            "content": "Wow, is this an involving story. It hooks you in fast and really grabs hold. It's very good in that aspect because it really makes you care about what happens. The story involves a parent's worst nightmare, so I would expect moms and dads to be particularly horrified. The movie manipulates, no doubt being overdone here and there, but it's generally effective.Angelina Jolie does a superb job of portraying a Los Angeles woman (\"Christine Collins\") in the late 1920s whose boy is kidnapped. Five months later, the \"proud\" police department brings her kid back, making it a good PR session. Unfortunately, it's not her kid and stupidly, although she's naturally upset about, she poses with the kid and takes him home. (Would that really happen?). Then she begins her quest of finding her real \"Walter.\" Further twists and turns make the story increasingly horrifying. In all, you won't be able to keep your eyes off the screen wondering if justice will ever prevail in the end and who exactly is involved in what. It's not particularly a fun ride - you'll have a frown on your face for quite some time - but it sure is interesting and an excellent two hour-plus of entertainment. By the end, you'll be emotionally exhausted.Kudos to all the actors in here for riveting performances and to the production and design team for a great period piece. Where else can you feel you're back 75-80 years in time with the boxy cars and flapper hats than in movies?",

            "review_title": "Eastwood and Angeline deliver a strong punch",
            "content": "There is nothing more reliable than Eastwood behind the camera, with his assured touch his films are never boring or deliberately confusing, hiding technical devices or special effects that detract from the most important part of movie making: a good screenplay, a good story, good acting. For the past 10 years, many films have been unduly praised because they have one or two great performances, unfairly leaving many good and deserving movies without the recognition they deserved. Eastwood has however, given us the whole package time after time, with movies as varied as \"Mystic River\", \"Letters\", \"Million Dollar Baby\" and now \"Changeling\". True, there is a link, they are all strong films, with themes that deal with pain and loss, but the stories are different, the settings require an amazing attention to detail, what they all share is a strong focus, and interestingly enough, superb performances.Eastwood has paved the way to acting honors for Penn, Freeman, Swank, Hackman, and others that were continuously ignored by the Academy. There is no denying the power of their performances in Eastwood's movies, and that leads to the center of this film: Jolie. I read recently that her performance has been attacked as being affected and the attempt of a star to look normal. Putting aside those silly and biased remarks, let's state something clearly, the lady has given us a fantastic tour de force, proving that she can be both a star when looking at the other cameras, but that when she is working for a director, she gives her best, regardless of what our perception of her private life might be. If you are a critic with a personal disapproval of that persona, keep it to yourself, concentrate on the film and the work of the performer.As the mother who desperately wants the truth about her child, Angelina is flawless. We can read the pain in her eyes, the determination and the disturbing reality that her obsession might be having unexpected results, but one thing is clear, there is a drive that won't quit, and it's admirable for those of us who want her to be reunited with her child, and it's quite inconvenient for the people who have other interests at hand.Her battle with the folks at LAPD is of epic proportions, and it is amazing that she held on to her goal of exposing the corruption that she encountered as she searched for her missing boy. There are some horrific moments in the film, as we relieve some of the injustices and Gothic horror of places like the hospital in this film. There are also some background scene that might or not reveal what really happen. There are moments when one is a bit exhausted from all the information the film delivers, but every moment is worth it. It is all framed with an expert hand, and it is anchored by the very powerful work by Jolie and the rest of an amazing cast that brings to life emotions such as madness, anger, pain, sorrow, and many times, disbelief that humans can be capable of such terrible actions.The film contains amazing production values, as we are taken back to an era that doesn't exist anymore. The recreation of the time Los Angeles was on its way to being a real city is incredible, as we see it before it fell apart and spread all over a gigantic geographical area, losing its identity. The musical score is a sweet melody that hints at the love and pain themes in the film, and there are some moments bound to become classic, as children tell the stories that adults might not want to face or believe.All in all, \"Changeling\" may be very difficult to sit through, but it is not less impressive, effective or good than any of the last five films Eastwood has made. As a matter of fact, it's just one masterpiece from the man who could teach Hollywood a few lessons.",

            "review_title": "An interesting story told well.",
            "content": "Christine Collins: \"The boy they brought back is not my son.\"ClintEastwood s knows a good story, and he knows how to tell it on film. Not everything he does is as powerful as his depiction of a dynamic female boxer in Million Dollar Baby, for which Hilary Swank won a best actress Oscar among four for the film. In Changeling he presents another strong woman, Christine Collins, played by the notable Angelina Jolie. Because she is directed to weep at almost every turn and regularly underplay her grit, Jolie won't win accolades, nor will Eastwood rack up the nominations as he frequently does in Oscar season. But his adaptation of the historic Wineville Chicken Murders chills with his perceptions about the capriciousness of crime and the determination of those who choose to fight it.In a Prohibition-era 1928, Collins gets word that the Los Angeles Police Department is returning her kidnapped eight-year old son. When she sees him at the station, a finely directed sequence showing the forces of motherhood and politics clash, she knows it is not her child. LAPD, needing the good publicity, forces her to take the boy overnight with the logic that she is merely in shock. The rest of this overly long thriller carefully traces the discoveries leading to resolutions and disappointments. Along the way, police corruption is exposed, mental institution incarceration of women is laid bare, and grisly serial murdering is slowly detailed.Yet in this discursive narrative, Eastwood indulges himself beyond Jolie's annoying crying by gratuitously laboring over the details of an execution. The stark San Quentin setting is ghastly and the villain worthy except for the film's obvious criticism of false mental institution lockup, ironic here because this murderer is clearly deranged enough to be determined unfit for trial.As in every Eastwood production, the values are first-rate, in this case period costuming and vehicles (those Model T's and trolley cars are beautiful). As in Mystic River, Eastwood knows how to splice family and community together in the struggle against organized crime, from street violence to public service malpractice. The activist preacher Reverend Briegleb (John Malkovich) helps bring the worlds together in his radio broadcasts, Malkovich for once playing good well. Eastwood continues to be the director of choice for depicting crimes and heartaches that strike the common citizen at will. We all should be as productive in our later years. May he extend well beyond his golf-playing days and into our future.",

            "review_title": "Interesting period piece",
            "content": "Watching this film is like taking a look back in time. Everything is picture perfect, the beautiful automobiles, the red electric street cars, the telephones, the switchboard station with roller-skating supervisors, the house appliances, and the outstanding clothing, from dresses to hats to police uniforms, everything is meticulously detailed. The story, which we are told is true, is complex and multifaceted. Angelina Jolie, who plays Christine Collins, gives an outstanding performance as a single mother who returns home from work to find that her son is missing. This puts into motion a series of events that exposes the reality of what Los Angeles society was really like in the late 1920's. Corrupt Police, uncaring and self absorbed mental health professionals and the basic premise that people left to their own ambitions will do anything to secure their own prosperity. Although this paints a bleak picture of the human condition, the film show that the actions of a few good men can make a world of difference, John Malkovich as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, is determined to expose the corrupt Police in his radio talk show, Michael Kelly as detective Lester Ybarra, although hampered by his superiors, uncovers what really happened to the boy and the unlikely hero, a powerful attorney who takes her case pro-bono comes to her rescue. If indeed this is a true story, then to see these people stand up to the powers that be is a ray of hope to all of us that there were people who were strong and principled. We can only hope that there are still people like that out there today.",

            "content": "Changeling is the new film from director Clint Eastwood. It is based on a true story that takes place in 1928 L.A.The story is about a woman who returns home one day to find her son missing. Then a few months later the police return a child to her, but it isn't her son. The woman keeps on telling everyone that this child isn't her son, but the police keep on claiming that it is her son and are calling the woman crazy.The film is a wonderful study about police corruption in L.A. in the late 1920s. The film is emotionally gripping, and at times disturbing.The film was superbly directed by Clint Eastwood, who was working from a terrific script by J. Michael Straczynski. Not only that, but Eastwood also wrote the film's score, which was very good as well. Of course the acting is what truly stole the show for me. Angelina Jolie delivers an Oscar worthy performance as the mother of the missing child, but what truly surprised me was how good these children in the cast were. All of the child actors were very well cast and all delivered amazing performances.As a whole Eastwood's Changeling is one of the best films of the year, and should be up for some big-time Oscars at year's end.A perfect 10 out of 10!",

            "review_title": "Grueling and scary search for truth.",
            "content": "Changeling - In 1928, Single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) returns home one day to discover her nine-year-old son, Walter, is missing. She calls the police and, after enduring a grueling 24 hours, they search for her son. But the boy they return to her is not her son. After confronting corrupt city authorities, Collins is vilified as an unfit mother and sent to an asylum.This is a grueling film to watch. I have not felt this hideous since North Country, a film which also dealt with misogyny within the power structure. Women are treated as fragile, emotional, and not believable. This film tackles corruption to boot, as the LAPD is accused of being a gang of thugs that answer to no one. Eastwood is old school with the violence, understanding that the mind can fill in the very brutal gaps.Angelina Jolie delivers another great performance. But unlike A Mighty Heart, this film actually deserves her presence. I don't think she really should have so much press coverage, but there is definitely reason for her acclaim as an actress. The situation her character goes through is so surreal and the film captures it perfectly. It gives you chills from the second Christine is given this pretender to raise and rarely lets up. And if for one moment you tell yourself \"It's just a movie\" as I tried to, this s*** actually happened. Characters were composited or changed, a disclaimer at the end states, but the events were the same.An odd praise goes out to Jason Butler Harner, who plays Gordon Northcott, a kidnapper and murderer of many children. He has played one of the monsters of everyone's nightmares to perfection. Also of note is Jeffrey Donovan for his portrayal of J. J. Jones, corruption personified. Jones is a man able to whisk people away to asylums with no need of warrants. Scary indeed.Changeling shares a theme with several of Clint Eastwood's other films. Unforgiven and Flags of Our Fathers come most readily to mind. His lesson concerns truth and lies, and exposing the hypocrisy of falsehoods for want of the truth. The truth is rarely pretty, but generally preferable to lies, and will often come to surface, if given enough time. I doubt I will watch this struggle for truth for a long time to come (it's not one for casual viewing), but it's a very good film.A-",

            "review_title": "A fine film, Clint Eastwood has done it again!",
            "content": "Clint Eastwood, the master of making depressing films now makes his trilogy: Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, and now Changeling. Based of the horrific chicken coop murders from the 1920's in California, we get a deeper insight into one of the mothers of the victims, Christine Collins who is portrayed by Angelina Jolie, queen of the never ending tears. I'm just playing, she does a terrific job and is just so heart breaking to watch her story on film, she gives Christine a lot of character and depth. The film is even made a certain way, a lot of dark colors, it seems as if it was made in old Hollywood, which was a very intelligent way of setting the mood and time of the film. We have some very fine performances pretty much from everyone in this movie. The one flaw I did feel is that the script does have some lines that are a little over done, a little too dramatic, but it really works for the film and story.Christine Collins is a single mother in the 1920's, she's a strong woman who is even ahead of some of the men in her line of work as an operator manager. But she's so busy with work that she tries to make time with her son, Walter. One day they are going to go to the movies, but Christine has to go to work, she says she'll meet Walter right back at home, she's late of course and when she gets home, Walter is missing. She calls the police, but they say she has to wait 24 hours. After a few months, the police tell her they've found her son, she couldn't be happier... that is until she sees a boy who is not her son. But the police will not fess up and admit they messed up, so instead of helping Christine, they treat her horribly and throw in her in an insane asylum and quite looking for her son, but the town's Rev. Gustav Briegleb will not give up and expose the police for the horrible people they are and will do anything to help Christine find her son.Changeling is a great film, one of the best of 2008, you know this is going to be a big contender for Oscar season. I really enjoyed this film, I have to admit it had me in tears, all that this poor woman went through to find her son, the pain and mental mind, well you know the f word, that the police put her through, I felt so horrible for her. Jeffrey Donovan just plays the ultimate jerk who just keeps playing gaslight on Christine Collins forcing a child who is not her son down her throat. Although I think this film could have been a good comedy if they gave her an Asian baby or something and try to convince her then that that's her son, lol, OK, that was so bad, sorry. But seriously, this is a great film, I do highly recommend that you take the chance to see it in the theater if you can.10/10",

            "content": "From Clint Eastwood comes a harrowing, poignant, gripping and somewhat beautiful and unforgettable film. At 140 minutes or so, the pace surprisingly doesn't lag so I didn't feel bored watching this. The true story about a mother whose son vanishes without a trace, and her quest for the truth is gripping and shown here in an intelligent and thought-provoking way. While some parts are poignant, there are also parts that are truly harrowing, like when Christine is sedated, the tense cortroom scenes, the strong violence shown in the film or the screams of the convicted man when he is approaching the hangman's noose.The direction from Eastwood is assured and attentive, the music is haunting and of true beauty in some spots and the script is nuanced and beautifully written. The period detail is indeed sumptuous, with scenery, costumes and settings making it look all authentic and beautiful, all captured perfectly by the brilliant cinematography. And the performances were nothing short of astonishing, with Angelina Jolie giving possibly her best performance in a mesmerising lead performance, and John Malkovich also very impressive. Overall, a beautiful and captivating film, much better than I thought it would be. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "My summary is NOT to discourage you from watching the film--just to encourage you to think before you watch it. If you are easily disturbed or a child--by all means DON'T watch this movie. It earned its R-rating because it is so incredibly disturbing--very disturbing!! I was very surprised to see that this film was based on a real case that I had never heard about and which was apparently pretty much forgotten until the brilliant writer, J. Michael Straczynski learned of the case. A mother (Angelina Jolie) is called away to work and leaves her young son home along back in 1928. When she returns, the child is gone--with absolutely no trace of him. Five months later, a child is located in Illinois and brought back to the mother--but the child is NOT hers!! It seems that the LA Police are so intent on closing the case that they push a child in her lap and demand she accept it--even though the boy is now 3 inches shorter and has been circumcise!!! Insane as it all is, when she complains, the police try to sweep it all under the rug by shoving her into a mental asylum--which is more like a chamber of horrors than anything else!. There is much more to the story than this--a much darker and more disturbing plot than just seeing the inside of the mental hospital. But, because I don't want to spoil the plot, I'll say no more about this.The film excels in almost every way. Aside from a bit of dialog that seemed anachronistic, the film gets very high marks for an excellent script, wonderful directions, a great performance by Miss Jolie and great music--written by the director, Clint Eastwood. One other thing I loved about the film was John Malovich's character. He played a radio preacher who was NOT some hypocritical, evil self-aggrandizer--as so many preachers are portrayed in films. Instead, he was a good man and important to the plot--thanks for a positive portrayal instead of a clich\u00e9d attack on ministers! See this film--just be prepared for some horrifying images and themes.",

            "review_title": "Not Eastwood's best, but better than most.",
            "content": "Clint Eastwood is one of the legends of the silver screen, from his humble beginnings as the Man With No Name in Sergio Leone westerns to Dirty Harry the kick-butt cop. As a director, he has given us some of the finest stories we could ever see, including the Oscar-winning Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, and the war epic twins Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. With his new film, he explores the dark side of the earlier part of the twentieth century in Tinseltown (Los Angeles). Taken from true events, the story unfolds that a single mother Christine Collins has lost her nine-year old son, Walter. She asks the LAPD to intervene, and about two months later, her son is returned. Then, she says it isn't her son. She never looks back.From the moment the young boy steps off the train, Christine insists to everyone that he is not her son. Unfortunately, the police say she is delusional and just upset. The films leads to the truth of the matter, which is that the corruption in the department has led to them being lackadaisical in their duties. The story moves along fluidly, yet we are never really told the reason that corruption resides.Nevertheless, the film is quite an experience. It looks terrific and really feels like the 1920s in Los Angeles. Angelina Jolie is solid as Christine, yet I felt she seemed more whiny at times than desperate. It just didn't move me as strongly as Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The supporting cast is good as well, especially John Malkovich as the pastor eager to help Christine in the fight against the LAPD. What I really wanted was that emotional pull that Eastwood's other films had. This one seemed a bit cold and ruthless, despite that being its subject material. So, I would say to go and see it; it is definitely worth the 140 minutes. As for Oscar time, I can't say for sure that it will wrap up the big ones such as Best Picture, Director or Actress. It wasn't the strongest campaign I've seen, but then again this has been a weaker year than 2007.",

            "content": "'Changeling' has a lot going for it in the eyes of the public just being directed by Clint and starring Angelina. Moreover the little-known but true LA story it tells is heartrending. A hard-working single mother in 1928, Christine Collins (Jolie) is forced to work on Saturday in her job as an assistant supervisor at Pacific Telephone and she leaves her young son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) at home. When she comes back he's gone. Five months later the police produce her son, found in another state--only she denies it's her son. The LAPD's reputation is on the line, and they force Christine to take the boy home. Then they try to discredit her as a lazy and unfit mother when she keeps insisting the kid isn't hers. Eventually she tangles more and more with the LAPD, who're going through an especially lawless period under a corrupt chief. They've shot down a lot of criminals in cold blood and swept away the bodies--just so the Force can control all the crooked dealings in town. Their arch-enemy and leader of the public outcry against cop corruption is crusading minister Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who seizes upon the Collins case when it becomes public, smelling a rat. After Collins has repeatedly opposed the cops and refused to accept the boy delivered to her--who's three inches too short and circumcised, has different dental work and is unrecognized by his schoolteacher--a willful Irish Captain assigned to this case (Jeffrey Donovan) orders her locked away in a psych ward. A lurid story of child abductions emerges.'Changeling,' in the screenplay written by J. Michael Straczynski, is based on contemporary press accounts of what are called the \"Wineville Chicken Murders.\" The mystery of Walter Collins' disappearance vies with the story of police corruption and the secret of the murders for attention, but Strazzynski wisely tells the tale from the viewpoint of Collins' mother, a kind of feminist heroine, since at a time when women tended to keep their mouths shut, she will not be silenced and never gives up. Some of the more gruesome details of the Wineville story are omitted, but sequences that go there still have a horror movie cast to them. The rest is a thriller-cum-police procedural with distinct period sociological elements. But there is skillful handling in the way a far-reaching story begins and ends with the intimate experience of a bereaved mother.Eastwood seems to have looked for a story on the order of Fincher's even lengthier 'Zodiac,' but the melodrama and focus on cop-crime in the material relate it to the James Ellroy-based films 'L.A. Confidential' and 'The Black Dahlia.' The psych-ward incarceration sequence takes you straight back to Samuel Fuller's 'Shock Corridor'--at which point things are beginning to seem pretty lurid, and the film almost as manipulative as Fuller's. Nonetheless the style has Eastwood's usual current elegance and clarity. Oxymoron it may seem, but this is lurid, yet (mostly) restrained. After all, this is a tale in which manipulation is being consciously looked at. In an interview at the NYFF, Eastwood pointed out that there was a link with movies like 'Gaslight' that deal with people trying to bend the minds of others: this is what the crooked cops try to force on Catherine, and they win to the extent that she takes the other boy home. And this is the most interesting and unusual aspect of the story.The acting is confident, if varied. There are a bunch of young boys who turn in strong, convincing performances, and as manipulative police captain and his chief, Jeffrey Donovan and Colm Feore are reasonable, and Michael Kelley appealing as the good cop who unearths the kidnappings. Newcomer Jason Butler Harner gives a distinctive performance as the wigged-out killer, Gordon Northcott. Amy Ryan is typically strong as another victim of the cops' psych ward incarceration scam. Less successful is John Malkovich in Marcelled wig as the crusading religionist Rev.Briegleb: he just seems too mannered and creepy. Jolie is good, though her appearance is a bit strange: that huge mouth goes oddly with 20's hair styles. At one moment after she was out of the psych ward, I thought she might be locked up a second time--for overacting. Harner gets his chance to chew up the rug himself in his final scene. A little holding back would not have hurt.The film is outstanding in its period look; and good, if not perfect, in its period feel. If nothing else you'll remember Catherine Collins quaintly gong back and forth along the lone line of phone operators she supervises--on roller skates. Whole neighborhoods were restored by the filmmakers and streets filled with Model T's and, best of all, old trolley cars. The attempt at period lingo might have been more consistent; but that's a goal rarely achieved. Since the time scheme runs from 1928 to 1935, more mention of the Great Depression surely would also have been in order. Since the screenplay sticks to known facts, there is nothing about Jolie's character before or after the events. This is a good and watchable film, but not up to Eastwood's terrific 2003, 2004 and 2006 efforts. Presented as the mid-point film of the New York Film Festival, already well-publicized at Cannes, 'Changeling' opens nationwide October 31st. Eastwood has already directed two more films, one of which, 'Gran Torino,' he stars in. Even at 78, the man still seems virtually unstoppable.",

            "content": "Films like this, especially when based upon a true story, always manage to infuriate me for the corruption and injustice that exists with entities absolutely resolved to maintain their personal power and control over others. In this case, it's the Los Angeles Police Department that attempts to convince a woman that a young boy that's returned to her after being lost and missing for a number of months is her own son, even when all evidence points to the contrary. How do people like Captain Jones (Jeffrey Donovan), Chief Davis (Colm Feore) and psychiatric doctor Earl Tarr (Peter Gerety) look themselves in the mirror and sleep at night? That they would put this woman Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) through a literal hell on Earth is beyond despicable, and yet they hold positions of authority that one would least likely question as regards an emotionally overwrought woman that these monsters are trying to scam.I've only seen Angelina Jolie in a couple of other films, but she really established herself in this picture in my view. Her performance was extraordinary, I can only imagine what the real life Mrs. Collins must have felt like during this ordeal. The thing I couldn't understand was why child murderer Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) got a two year prison sentence before being executed. Like all cowards, he went out a lot like Jimmy Cagney did in \"Angels With Dirty Faces\", but in Cagney's case, he was doing it for his buddy Pat O'Brien, so one doesn't have the same reservations about his getting the death penalty. Northcott's was more humane than he afforded the kids he victimized.So Clint Eastwood as director scores another stunning film to his repertoire, amid a string of winners that included \"Mystic River\", \"Million Dollar Baby\" and \"Gran Torino\". This one didn't receive the same level of recognition, but don't let that deter you from seeing the picture. It's a well told story that will make your blood boil, and though it doesn't have an entirely happy ending, it may help you see victims of the justice system in an entirely new light.",

            "content": "On 09 March 1928 in Los Angeles, Christine Collins (Angeline Jolie) lives with her beloved son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) in Lincoln Heights. When she is assigned to work in overtime on Saturday in The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph as supervisor, she promises Walter to return at 4:00 PM to watch the latest movie of Charles Chaplin on the movie theater with him. However, she arrives home late and does not find her son; after seeking the boy out in the neighborhood, she reports the missing child to the police, but the police officer tells that she should wait twenty-four hours to register the complain. Five months later, Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) communicates Mrs. Collins that her son had been found in DeKalb, Illinois, and is heading back home by train to reunite with her. In the train station, Christine does not recognize the boy as being Walter, but Captain advises her that his appearance has changed in five months. Sooner she confirms that the boy is not her son, but the corrupt LAPD does not accept her arguments. When Mrs. Collins is approached by the St. Paul Presbyterian Church Pastor Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovitch), who daily broadcasts protests exposing the corruption of the police force, she decides to disclose the evidence she has about the changeling to the press. However, the abusive Captain Jones sends Christine to an asylum to intimidate her. Meanwhile the efficient Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) is assigned to arrest and deport an illegal Canadian boy that is hidden in a ranch in Wineville. He captures the boy, who discloses hideous crimes committed by his compatriot Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner).\"Changeling\" is another powerful movie of Clint Eastwood based on a true story. This movie is almost perfect, with magnificent direction, excellent screenplay, top-notch performances, awesome cinematography, sets, costumes, edition and soundtrack. I am not fan of Angeline Jolie, but her outstanding performance in this movie is certainly the best role of her career and deserved the nomination to the Oscar; further she has proved to me that she is a great actress indeed. Mrs. Christine Collins was a great woman and her quest for her son is remarkable. In the end, she has walked the way she talked to her son \u2013 \"Never start a fighting, always finish it\". My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"A Troca\" (\"The Exchange\")",

            "content": "Typical Eastwood fare here - serious subject, recent history period drama, bleak outlook with a touch of redemption for the leads at the end, this was nevertheless a powerful, engrossing expose of what passed for good policing in late 20's America. Taking the film at face value, this was a convincing depiction of pre-Depression America, with some great details - the roller-skating supervising in the telephone company by Angeline Jolie's Caroline Collins character in particular was a neat period-defining touch, whilst good use is made of exterior locations, at psychopathic murderer Northcott's \"chicken-coop\" location, the train station where Jolie is \"reunited\" with her supposed son and the recreation of her suburban neighbourhood equally with the interiors at the grisly \"psychiatric hospital\" where Jolie is incarcerated, as well as the courtroom, police station and even the inside of Jolie's house. Atmosphere and realism are inset from the outset.The story, almost unbelievable in its premise, but bolstered by the \"based on a true story\" legend over the opening titles (I'll research its claim later!) makes for tense and at times unbearable viewing as Jolie's Kafka-type nightmare almost fully envelops her and only comes into the light with the aid of an anti-corruption radio evangelist preacher and a cop who finally does his job right and actually listens to the crucial witness testimony of Northcott's unwilling teenage accomplice.The film however suffers a bit from being overlong in places, symptomatic of Eastwood's typical slow-paced style and there appear to be three or four endings tagged on one after the other, each good enough in itself to close the film before the credits roll. I also didn't feel the dual-trial scenes worked together, Eastwood possibly posting the question about just who the bigger villains actually were here, the psychopathic killer who completely believes in Jolie or the back-covering inhumanity of the Chief of Police and his chief officer who think nothing of foisting an impostor on a traumatised mother and then unbelievably throw her into a ruthlessly run psychiatric hospital to hush her protests. The acting is of a high standard. Early on, I did find Jolie a bit showy in her performance but she learns the less is more maxim as the film progresses, particularly as she descends into the bedlam of her psychiatric treatment where she witnesses and suffers almost inhuman cruelty and deprivation, before her release which sees her thence-forward display a telling stoic dignity in her pursuit of the truth. It's very much her film, although the support is strong in almost every other part too.Eastwood is now very settled in his style and any viewer knows they're not going to be jolted out of their seat by anything put in their way. His skill is in story-telling and here again, with the aid of fine cinematography and an effective soundtrack of his own composition, he delivers a shocking story in a credible and persuasive way to keep you rooted, most of the time anyway, in your seat for its 160 minute duration.",

Then, Angelina Jolie, giving a mature and powerful performance as the victim of a disturbed mind and a corrupt police force. Then, the rest, doesn't seem well thought at all. Doesn't Angeline have a photograph of her son to show everybody that the child delivered by the police is not her son? The children, all of them, look and sound like performers of an elementary school theatrical production. Why I wonder? When the period details in the movie are so accurate, why the heaviest of details, the credibility of the supporting performances, are so weak. The writing doesn't help. The baddies are totally bad and the goodies are totally good. Jeffrey Donovan's corrupt cop is really unforgivable. So on the nose without nuances of any kind.

            "content": "I saw Clint Eastwood recently on the Daily Show, and Jon Stewart brought up a point I have not read in the handful of reviews I had read before going into his latest film, Changeling. Often one sees movies about civil rights, racial or ethnic, but rarely in a well-produced Hollywood picture will the topic of the history of \"hysterical\" women being \"dealt with\" come up, of the hardships of those who could be pushed around by the (given) crooked types at the LAPD. This isn't just what Changeling is all about, either, which makes it all the more impressive how much Eastwood, via a good writer, can accomplish.This is the kind of tremendous drama that could become daunting for any other director- any one little step one way and it could be straight-to-Lifetime glop- but the director at hand here is such a pro that he's able to put in incredible artistry at nearly every step, even when it looks as though it should be cut and dry film-making. And then there's also the cast. But first, the story, which incredibly is just \"a true story\" at the start, is about Christine Collins (Jolie) who is just a regular single working mother raising her boy in LA who one day comes home and finds her son is not around: missing. The cops barely do a thing until a few months later when another child who happens to be lost is picked up, instructed by the police to say that he's the Collins boy, and that this will all make sense as a happy-ending story.This is, except for Miss Collins, who keeps asking repeatedly a very simple but quickly angered question: where is my son? This leads into two tangents as a film: the roller-coaster tumble and rise and tumble of a mother fearing life and death for her son- sometimes in a mental hospital where she's been committed by police- and of a child killer who may or may not have killed Walter Collins, along with other missing/abducted children. Each of the tangents are interwoven with tense and particularly dark and harrowing detail, and once put together form an inexorable link that becomes all the more fascinating in the kind of way that most horror movies don't reach. Truth can be stranger than fiction, but in this case it's just uglier, and with only the faintest of hope.Which, in a sense, works to Eastwood's advantage. It'd be hard for me to imagine many other directors grappling with the facts in the case. How much Changeling sticks to the details of corruption and murder in the LAPD ranks back then (not surprising, of course, given the history of the force in reality and in cinema) or the Collins saga I can't say, but so much of the picture feels vital and without compromise to suggest that it is more than likely close to real, stark tragedy. Eastwood had that perfectly with Mystic River and somewhat in Million Dollar Baby. He gets it this time again, and applies a style that is one of his most ambitious (just on the technical side the way he and his DP desaturated the color of present-day 1928 era and of the flashbacks, which come out in some realm between color and b&w, not to mention the lighting, is completely extraordinary for a drama of this magnitude).And, once again, Eastwood shows his master's chops as an actor's director. Jolie, who is probably more well-renown as a star than as an actress at this point in her career, reminds the audience what she's got going for her, and in fact almost appears to underrated in any estimation (Oscar win notwithstanding). She's devastating at all the right moments, but tender and vulnerable and subtle without overdoing it, and at the same time conveying the star power that the role does need. It's a near triumph, and in a sense she does better on the Oscar-bait chart than her director might this time. Also noteworthy are Malkovich as the pastor (one of the few good-guys of the tale), and especially Jason Butler Harner in the crucial, role of Gordon Northcott who skims that line just slightly of hamming it up and turns in one of the creepiest killers in recent memory.It may be easy to label a Clint Eastwood picture, at least as of late, is a buzz word of masterpiece or great or classic or whatever. But with Changeling, he's made what is at once a crowd-pleasing tear-jerker and one of those stories of mothers and children and women and dirty cops that stick excellently both ways, and possibly earns rightfully a status like masterpiece because he doesn't ever go soft on the subject, never turning an eye to what lies behind certain conventions or pit-falls in a script of this sort, and will only allow the smallest, most ambiguous note of hope at the end. It's intelligent, brave work.",

            "content": "When my wife and I first heard that another Eastwood film was coming out, we planned to see it. Then we read unremitting negative comments by the critics, so we hesitated. We decided to see the film anyway because we have liked everything Eastwood has directed, and we knew that some of the cast were fine actors. Wow, are we glad we stuck with our first instinct. The film is excellent.The critics panned the script, by J. Michael Straczynski. One critic mentioned that Straz wrote Babylon 5 and suggested that was reason enough to expect this script to be bad. In fact, Babylon 5 was very good, and so is the script for this movie. Critics complained about Eastwood's directing, but the directing was fine. Some of the critics complained about the acting, but in fact the acting is flawless. My general impression of critics has been strongly reinforced: they typically are shallow and self-important windbags trying to show off how smart and sophisticated they are. They should be ignored.The story itself is sad, uplifting, disturbing, and bittersweet all at the same time. It is, sad to say, a true story.The characters come across as real people, as is typical for Eastwood's films. Every single actor delivers exactly the right performance for the role being played. Indeed, the acting is the best part of this movie, though I do not mean to diminish any other aspect of the film by saying that. There are several children in the film who have significant parts, often with lines that must convey genuine emotions of fear or remorse. Not easy stuff for a kid to get right, yet all of them do their jobs very well. That is partly a tribute to Eastwood's directing, showing his ability to elicit strong performances from his actors.There is no point listing every actor here and praising their performances one by one. They were all outstanding. I will single out Angelina Jolie for special mention, though. She is the main character, and her performance is simply superb. Her range of emotions is truly remarkable.

Five months later the LAPD return a kid to her but she claims it's not hers and must fight to try and figure out the mystery along with the help from a Reverend (John Malkovich) who wants to bring down the corrupt police force. Director Eastwood just keeps getting better and better with one great film after another and that trend continues with this haunting and downright dramatic film that has the man doing some of the best work of his career. Once again Eastwood takes his time in telling the story and he plays it out in a rather slow way. I'm not saying slow in a bad way but he does let the screenplay flourish by letting us get to know the central characters and go along with their painful ride. This is certainly true in the case of Jolie's character as we get to see many ups and downs and the actress nails all of them perfectly. Even though she's the biggest \"star\" in the world there's never a problem watching her as this character as this might be the best thing I've seen her do. She perfectly nails all the emotion scenes and you can constantly look at her eyes and see the sadness in them as she tries to find out what happened to her son. Malkovich is also very strong in the type of role that he does best. The supporting players include great work from Jeffrey Donovan, Michael Kelly and Jason Butler Harner. Eastwood's direction is what really keeps the thing moving because he doesn't take any safe ways out and for the most part he just punches the viewer in the stomach with a honest approach to the material. The subject matter of a kidnapped kid is very ugly as is the big twist that I won't reveal but not once does Eastwood shy away from the material. The ugliness of what happens to Jolie's character also isn't looked away from and this is why Eastwood remains one of the most interesting director's out there. His music score is also very good and adds a lot to the film. Another great thing. Another impressive thing is the film taking place in the late 20's and Eastwood perfectly recaptures this world. All the vintage stuff from the cars to the houses look incredibly well so getting into the atmosphere of the time isn't a problem at all. The film's one problem was the final fifteen-minutes when we get a couple spots, which are set up to be endings, which then turn into another ending. I think the screenplay has a little trouble wrapping everything up but outside of this the film is yet another brilliant and impressive work from its director.",

Changeling is a film about a single mother's (Christine) search for her son with a twist. Rather than the LAPD trying to help her they oppose her. As a result of receiving bad publicity for being unable to find her son Walter after five months, the police deliver Christine her \"son\". He is not really her son, he is a fraud. Christine immediately recognizes the boy isn't her son and quickly points this out to the police. She realizes she now has to fight the LAPD in order to find out the truth about her son. But with her attempt to fight back and embarrass the LAPD comes intense consequences. The acting was rather disappointing in some aspects. For example Jeffrey Donovan was a bit annoying in his role as Captain Jones. His role required him to have some sort of a powerful aura with an intimidation power. Yet to me he was average bringing nothing to the movie not properly portraying a selfish unjust policeman. The star of the movie, Angelina Jolie, was very solid but her performance was not a unique or impossible one to take on by any other actress. She did what she had to do to make the movie a success but she certainly did not take the movie to another level. The one actor that did impress me though was John Malkovich which probably shouldn't be a surprise who i felt should have received more screen time. Unlike Jolie he took the movie to another level. A more serious, suspenseful and intensified level that carried a heightened sense of depth which was was badly missing from a few performances such as Jeffrey Donovan throughout the film. Overall the performances throughout were inconsistent. The writing and director of the movie was done very well but it could've used a little more sharpness. At times the movie seemed to be all over place not quite having an identity. Sometimes it was a crime mystery, sometimes a drama, and sometimes it tried too hard to be both. Despite that Clint Eastwood some how keeps Changeling from dramatically falling apart. It almost seems as if Clint Eastwood couldn't make a bad movie even if he tried. At times it flourished and at other times it just didn't feel right. Christine Collins always told her son \"You never start a fight but you always finish it.\" Eastwoods job on this movies seemed quite the contrary, he never quite finished the movie off.

            "content": "Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) lives in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1928. Her husband took off long ago and left her the sole caretaker of her nine year old son, Walter. To make ends meet, Christine works long hours as a supervisor for a local telephone company, where she is respected as a very hard-working employee. One Saturday, as she was planning to take Walter to the motion picture theater, she is asked to fill in for an emergency situation at work. Making a promise to Walter that they will shift their plans to Sunday, Christine has no choice but to leave the young boy at home alone, although neighbors will check in on him every couple of hours. However, after work, Christine comes home to an empty house. Walter has vanished. When she contacts the police, they are singularly unhelpful and uncaring, surprisingly. But, after several months of searching, the police notify Christine that Walter has been found in Illinois and will be returning on the train. It is categorically untrue, as Christine sees immediately that the young boy stepping off the train is not her son. Yet, the police ask her to smile for the cameras and take this lad home and study him, for they tell her young children can change quite dramatically. Reluctantly, Christine does so. But, it soon becomes crystal clear that this boy is not hers, as he is three inches shorter, among other anatomical differences. Frustrated and upset, Christine continues to tell the police that a mistake has been made and she urges them to find her son and this new boy's relatives. Unbelievably, the police declare her to be \"crazy\" and they escort her to the local mental hospital for an indefinite stay. Only one person seems to be on her side, the local and powerful Presbyterian minister (John Malkovich) and he works tirelessly to help. Meanwhile, at a broken-down ranch near the city, police find a young boy from Canada who has enormous secrets to tell, all of them horrific. Can these secrets offer clues to Walter's whereabouts? This is a very powerful story of immense injustice, horror and sorrow. It clearly shows that evil walks among us, no matter what time period we find ourselves in. As the principal actor, Jolie is sensational, for she is heartbreakingly genuine as the mother who not only loses her son and her freedom but is a witness to unspeakable horror as well. Malkovich, too, is excellent as the combative and relentless man of the cloth. All of the other actors, although unknown, give extremely fine performances, too, especially the man who plays the police captain and the one who portrays the insane rancher-serial killer. As for the recreation of 1920's Los Angeles, through sets, costumes, script, and photography, is is very well done and Eastwood's direction is secure and forceful, despite the film's length of two and a half hours. Nevertheless, if you can not handle a story that will haunt you for days, due to its extremely horrific nature, don't see this one. Although it is a fine, fine piece of cinema, it is a most difficult watch indeed.",

            "content": "After overcoming my disappointment that this wasn't a sci-fi extravaganza, I quite happily toddled along to Changeling, having been initially intrigued by the trailers, and then by what I'd read in the press. This is a very good film, and packs an even bigger punch by virtue of the fact that it is essentially true.Produced and directed by Clint Eastwood (who also does the music), and written by J Michael Straczynski (a name probably best known to date for writing Spider-Man comics), the heart of the story may be well-known now to people reading about films - in 1928 Christine Collins' young son Walter disappears. Some 5 months later she is reunited by the Los Angeles police department with a boy they say is her son, but who is not. Her continued refusal to accept the son who has been thrust upon her is a major inconvenience to the LAPD who have her put in the psychopathic ward of a mental hospital. You can get this much from the trailers, but the film then goes on into other areas which I had not anticipated.I have heard as a criticism that the movie is slow. While I would agree that Eastwood never feels he has to hurry to tell the story, my attention was always held. The period detail always convinces, the music (by Eastwood) is attractive and serves the on-screen images nicely, and the script, while always gripping, never gives the impression that it is over-dramatising real events (although this may well be the case).But what of the performances? Angelina Jolie has already received much acclaim for her performance as Christine Collins and she is, indeed, very good, managing to convey the desperation any mother would feel in such a situation mixed with confusion at being somewhat out of her depth, and bewilderment at the perverse attitude she encounters at every level of the establishment. John Malkovich, as the anti-LAPD clergyman who supports Christine chews rather less scenery than one is accustomed to see him chewing of late.And this is where it becomes interesting. I've been watching films for nearly 60 years now and, apart from Jolie, Malkovich, and Colm Feore as the Chief of Police, I had never seen a single one of the cast on screen before, as far as I can recall. And they were, without exception, first rate, although I must single out Jeffrey Donovan as police Captain Jones, Michael Kelly (looking like a dark Steve Martin) as Detective Ybarra, Jason Butler Harner as Gordon Northcott, and young Eddie Alderson as Sanford Clark for special mention.This film was gripping and unusual, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

            "content": "Despite is age and his Hollywood status clearly emphasizing he has nothing left to proof, Clint Eastwood was one of the busiest directors of the first twenty years of the 21st Century. I nearly haven't seen all the films Eastwood directed, and I certainly didn't like every film he made during this period, but \"Changeling\" is a haunting and unforgettable masterwork.Initially, I didn't plan to write a user-comment for it, as I avoid commercial titles. But I feel it's a must. It's been almost a year since I watched \"Changeling\", but still distinctively remember every tiny detail of the plot and atmosphere, as well as the rollercoaster of diverse emotions it evoked in me. The plot and the historical accuracy are what's most impressive about, but also the authentic late 1920s recreation, the performances, and the direction are stupendous.Angelina Jolie isn't my favorite actress, but she's amazing as the hard-working single mother Christine Collins during the Depression era of 1928. When her son goes missing, and the police doesn't any leads or clues for several weeks, Christine receives the support of a fanatic pastor/activist who's been accusing the LAPD of sheer incompetence since many years already. In an attempt to boost up the public opinion, the police proudly announce they found Mrs. Collins' son and even arrange for a festive reunion at the train station, with many spectators and newspaper photographers. But the boy isn't Christine'son Walter, and when she tries to rectify this - after recovering from the initial shock and mental manipulations - it is Christine herself who gets accused of being a terrible mother and desperate attention seeker. She's even submitted to a psychiatric ward and, meanwhile, in a chicken farm outside of Los Angeles, the real and truly horrifying crimes are taking place.The true story of the frustrating and loathsome injustice that overcame Mrs. Collins is already marvelous drama/thriller material, and then I haven't mentioned yet the linkage to the horrific but factual Wineville Chicken Murders case. I read a lot of articles and books, and watch many documentaries and true-crime movies of authentic serial murderer cases, and but the story of child rapist and killer Gordon Stewart Northcott one is genuinely one of the darkest and most appalling tragedies ever; and all the procedural errors and blunders of the police/immigration service only made it worse. \"Changeling\" is a powerful and uncompromising film, paying a lot of respect to the real-life victims and the nightmarish ordeals they faced. Must-see film, for me on par with Clint's other greatest efforts like \"Mystic River\" and \"Unforgiven\".",

            "content": "One of the big movie events of the year, Clint Eastwood's \"Changeling\" has had a lot of buzz going about it up to its release, and I can tell you that all the chatter about this movie is well-deserved. Based on a true story, the movie focuses on single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a working-class woman living in 1928 Los Angeles with her son, Walter. After returning home one afternoon to find Walter has vanished, she seeks help in the Los Angeles Police Department to help find her son. Around five months later, a boy believed to be Walter is brought to L.A. from Illinois, and reunited with Christine - the only problem is, the child returned to her is not in fact Walter. What ensues is a bitter battle with the Los Angeles Police Department and the lead of the investigation, J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan). Aided by a reverend who knows of the LAPD's corrupt history (John Malkovich), Christine desperately searches for her son, but ends up disbelieved by those around her. Meanwhile, a deranged serial killer who may know something about Walter's disappearance is on the run...Plainly put, I simply loved every piece of this movie. Everything about it was stunning, from the music, to the acting, to the scenery - it was all so amazing. But besides the aesthetics of the film, what is the true point of interest here is the central mystery of the film - what happened to Walter Collins? We, the audience, are taken on an emotional, disturbing roller-coaster ride as Jolie does everything in her power to find her son, but is stomped on repeatedly by those around her (often males). There are layers and layers to the story here, but beneath the surface there is strong commentary on female submission during the era, the power of males in society, and the obvious corruption and greed that can be found within a system that is supposed to help the citizens. All of this comes across quite well, and the elements of the film coerce nicely.Angelina Jolie delivers an outstanding performance here, that I'm sure would make the real Christine Collins very happy. Her emotions, mannerisms, everything is so spot-on. She owns the role, and the audience can do nothing but sympathize with her character as the grieving, yet strong-willed mother. Supporting performances from academy award nominee John Malkovich and somewhat overlooked performer Jeffrey Donovan (who some horror fans might remember from the \"Blair Witch\" sequel) are all deserved of praise as well. Another thing I'd like to mention is the capturing of the time - this is a period piece all around, and a very refined one at that. Everything is precise, and the costumes, set-design, and styles of the 1920s are extremely strong, if not completely flawless.The resolution to the events of the movie still leave questions, but give enough information as to what happened to Walter. The unraveling of everything that takes place about three- fifths through the movie is rapid and intense, with the unveiling of a disturbed ranch- handler who was responsible for the savage murders of twenty kids at his desolate farm, one of them maybe or maybe not being Walter. Apart from the missing-child aspect of the film (which makes it disturbing to begin with), the introduction of the serial-killer aspect is even more horrifying, accompanied by some awfully disturbing flashback sequences depicting the crimes. All the more horrible is that everything in the film is in fact true, and did happen. But at the end of the day, the movie does leave its audience with a glimmer of hope, and concludes itself on a somber but satisfying note as justice is served and some small sense of peace is delivered to Ms. Collins.Overall, \"Changeling\" is an extraordinary movie-going experience. As far as period-pieces go, this is probably one of the very best I've ever seen, and the multi-layered plot never loses the viewer. I was completely engaged through all two and a half hours the film lasted, and was extremely happy with the movie when I left the theater. Beautiful cinematography and essentially flawless performances add to the positives here - I really can't complain about this movie at all. \"Changeling\" is a tragic and disturbing tale of murder, corruption, empowerment - and above all, justice - that will haunt the audience for days after viewing. Highly recommended to anyone who likes a seriously good movie. 10/10.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Changeling",
            "content": "J. Michael Straczynski of Babylon 5 fame wrote Changeling, which is based on the true story of one woman's fight against corruption, incompetence, accusations and intimidation, all the while in searching for the truth of what happened to her beloved 9 year old son, who vanished without a trace, only for the LAPD to try and convince her that the boy they found, was indeed her son. But that's just the gist of the first hour with plenty more in store, keeping you gripped to the screen as the story develops.I continue to admire the very human stories under the direction of Clint Eastwood. His films over the last few years have been nothing less than excellent, and Changeling adds to this stellar repertoire of his. There's a certain quiet confidence in the way his films get presented, like a veteran hand masterminding all elements to fall in place perfectly. What more, it's always a treat to have the film's score composed by Eastwood himself, and the main theme is already buzzing in my head already, way after the end credits have rolled.But of course the star of the show here is Angelina Jolie. While we had not the opportunity to watch her dramatic turn in A Mighty Heart on the big screen where she plays a woman searching for her husband and for the truth, we do get to see her here playing a mother searching for her child and for answers. I particularly liked the line where she said she's not here to pick fights, but she sure would finish one, and that practically sums her her fiercely combative character in a film where she doesn't get to literally kick arse.I guess local distributors prefer to play it safe and continue to feed us with the alpha-female roles that Jolie plays, from Lara Croft to Wanted, that it's a rare opportunity to see her in a dramatic role, reminding us that she has won awards before for such roles. This is certainly a chance not to miss, because there are numerous moments where she demonstrated her acting chops. I still cannot forget that one brilliant scene, which was almost the equivalent of Ralph Fiennes' in The Constant Gardener, where she didn't have to say her word, but just her expression alone had painted the phrase \"prepared for the worst, but hoping for the best\". That alone is worth the price of an admission ticket. I suppose being a real life mother, she would have no problems with translating what would possibly be any mother's fear of losing their child suddenly and without explanation.She provides a very solid performance that hinged on everyone in the audience being able to connect with her plight and exasperation, of sympathizing with her, and rooting for her as she faces obstacle after obstacle as she goes about doing sensible things that the authorities frown upon. You'll seethe with rage when others give that can't-be-bothered attitude to a helpless mom, and feel pity that while more could be done, no finger was lifted. You'll share that tinge of hope that things will turn out for the better, and feel sad at the disappointments faced along the way, each time hoping that the outcome would be better than the last.And here's where Straczynski's story excels. There are a number of threads running that converge nicely together, and while the movie clocks in over 140 minutes, you'll never feel time plod, as you get engaged into the story, feel for the characters, and at the same time, enjoy the excellent recreation of the 1920s. There's a little bit of everything that managed to cram itself here, from mystery to courtroom drama, showcasing a variety of story settings, dealing with themes such as justice and integrity.It also contains a very strong critique of authority which is given too much power without proper checks and balances, that such power could be corrupted and abused for personal gain, before it takes those who are resolute in doing the right thing, to push for change. John Malkovich has a supporting role here as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, who has a congregation behind him as he tells it as it is in his weekly radio shows, and provides much needed intervention to assist Jolie's Christine Collins along the way.Changeling becomes the first movie this new year that I would highly recommended without hesitation. Go watch it when it opens on the 15th!",

            "content": "\"Changeling\" is a well done drama that is styled perfect to form as an emotional mystery from legendary Clint Eastwood(who once again proves he's a fantastic director). Based on a real life case that actually happened Eastwood as a director captures the time period just perfect with the backgrounds of the 20's and his musical scores set up each scene just perfect, once again it's fabulous work from Mr. tough guy.Anyway it's 1928 in Los Angeles, California and Christine Collins(Angelina Jolie)who's a single mother who's making ends meet by working as a telephone telegraph line supervisor enjoys life. Her main love of life and reason to live for though is her precious son Walter(Gattlin Griffith). Then all of a sudden her world comes crashing down after she returns home form work one evening to find that Walter has suddenly vanished. This is only the start of a hellish nightmare for Christine, as this film takes on a new path of it's own as the main spotlight showcased is the incompetence and corruption of the L.A. police department. From the way the case is first handled only to really take a tailspin when they claim they have found the son of Ms. Collins only she clearly sees this is not her son.\"Changeling\" is also a good spotlight to show how authority does not like to meet questions and provide answers as this is the case when Christine is forced to take a boy who clearly isn't hers. It only worsens when she questions the manner and tries to stand up for answers as we the audience see the film take off on more of a cruel and emotional grind as Christine is subjected to punishment that she doesn't deserve by being institutionalized and at the same time being threatened with more and more intimidation. As you watch you really have to hand it to Jolie her performance is in top form and emotionally heartfelt maybe the best of her acting jobs.Good supporting work is found in local Rev. Briegleb(John Malkovich)who's one of the few to fight for Christine as he knows all about the history of the corruption of the L.A.PD as it's with his help that some justice in a moral sense is obtained. Only the film takes on more of a mystery direction in which we as the viewer see some justice has been served, yet we really don't feel any closure except the fact that corruption and abuse of power has finally been exposed and it showed the real L.A. police.Overall well done film by Clint the setting and mood is emotional and it searches for truth and justice, and Angelina's performance is probably the best work of her time she's really into her role both mentally and spiritually. Really it's how you as the viewer see it sure it provided some justice, yet the closure was somewhat of a letdown only as with the way it ended just as in life many times we just have to hope for hope. As long as we have some hope all good is possible just remember hope can be found in anything.",

            "content": "It's ironic that because of the 1950s TV drama \"Dragnet,\" Los Angeles got the reputation of being a city with a squeaky clean, incorruptible police department. It's ironic because nothing could be further from the truth for much of the city's history.The 1920s and most of the thirties were particularly lawless decades for LA cops. LA was overflowing with gambling houses and bordellos all operating virtually openly. Cops were involved in one scandal after another, including a police chief caught during Prohibition in the back seat of a police car with a bottle of booze and a half naked hooker; vice squad cops caught up in a badger game targeting a city councilman; and the commander of the police intelligence division convicted of attempted murder in the bombing of the car of a special investigator for the grand jury looking into police corruption.One of the hardest incidents to comprehend was the 1928 disappearance of 9-year-old Walter Collins, and his return five months later thanks to the \"detective work\" of the LAPD. That was a case that might have been completely forgotten by now but for one thing -- the boy's incredulous mother who took one look at the returning kid and said \"That's not my son!\" What could have prompted the LAPD to substitute another kid for the missing boy? Awash in a constant stream of bad publicity, targeted by reformers and plagued by the fact that it was a department of thieves, thugs, and incompetents, the 1928 department under Chief James \"Two Guns\" Davis was apparently desperate for any good publicity and returning a missing kid to his hard working, single mom seemed full proof. But for one thing: Mom was tougher than Davis and conducted a non stop crusade to uncover the truth and find her real son.Sadly, unfolding at the same time was the repugnant tale of a serial killer operating out of a chicken ranch in nearby Riverside county and how he was abducting and murdering young boys.All these elements --the Collins case, the police corruption story and the tale of the serial killer -- are expertly woven together by director Clint Eastwood into a movie that grows more interesting as it goes.Expertly cast and beautifully mounted (the art direction is a shoe in for an Oscar nomination)the film nonetheless lives or dies on the performance of Angelina Jolie, who plays the mom, Christine Collins. Many of Jolie's roles don't do much to test her acting chops, this one does and she more than meets the challenge, turning in a beautifully controlled performance that should get her another Oscar nod too.If I have a criticism, it is that the movie in the end gives the impression the corruption may have ended when Chief Davis was demoted following the Collins case. He was demoted, to head of the traffic division, but was made Chief again when Frank Shaw became mayor.Corruption at city hall and in the police department simply exploded and there were so many abuses by the central vice squad, the Intelligence Division and the \"Red Squad\" of strike breakers and gun thugs that they eventually led to the 1938 recall of Mayor Shaw and a general house cleaning of the police department, which forced out Davis and more than 40 other high ranking officers.But see the movie. This one is certainly worth seeing.",

            "content": "After a warm reception at Cannes, the US critics were not nearly as kind to Clint Eastwood's 2008 effort \"Changeling\". One of the most commonly used phrases in attacking the film was 'Oscar bait'. There have to be few dumber labels used by critics than that. I think it does apply to a few movies here and there, but it has become so commonly used for anything which might appeal to the Academy voters, and Eastwood's classicist tendencies happen to fall into that category. That plus the fact that the Academy seems to love Eastwood's recent output made \"Changeling\" the target of countless accusations of Oscar baiting. It's disappointing, and indicative of a genuine lack of quality in American film criticism.If you go into \"Changeling\" expecting a fairly long, nearly completely black-and-white dramatization of real events, I can't imagine why you would be very disappointed. The script by J. Michael Straczynski, the man behind the great \"Babylon 5\", displays his talent for writing great dialogue (albeit rarely very realistic dialogue) and his extraordinary storytelling ability. The film's first half hour is the least interesting, I thought, but almost everything after that was quite enthralling and entertaining, and really all you should know going in is that Christine Collins' (played by Jolie) child goes missing, then the LAPD returns another child to her which isn't her actual son. On the side of good we have the aforementioned Inspector Ybarra, Collins herself, a reverend devoted to fighting corruption (played by John Malkovich), and on the side of bad we have the police chief Davis and the main bad guy (for the majority of the film anyhow) Capt. Jones, played superbly by Jeffrey Donovan in one of his first major film roles.\"Changeling\" is very clearly a dramatization. There's plenty of melodrama and the script feels convoluted at times (although Straczynski's storytelling ability had me going along with everything, rarely giving me time to dwell on stuff which annoyed me. Much of the film takes on a feminist feel, something which I hadn't really expected. I really ended up liking this sprawling and admittedly flawed script quite a bit, especially when it focused on Inspector Ybarra and his findings (which I won't discuss in detail). Where I disagreed with many critics and audience members is Jolie's performance. It's occasionally just right, but a lot of the time ends up being hysterically over-emotive or, as I suspected, infected with the typical air of smugness Jolie exudes. If anything's Oscar bait here it's Jolie. Aside from the very good script and generally excellent performances, Tom Stern's photography and Eastwood's direction and music are absolutely superb, along with basically all other technical aspects, particularly the phenomenal design. The film is always great to look at, but there's one or two scenes where it's just beautiful. \"Changeling\" is the sort of good vs. bad story we don't get often, and when we do get one it's often poor and ridiculously contrived. There may be contrivances here, some of it might be over-written, and Jolie may have grated on me occasionally, but the film is ultimately worth seeing.",

Meanwhile the government wants the case to go away so they give her a child and claims it's her...but he isn't.

The horrors of a mother being forced to care for a kid that isn't hers. The terror of being a woman struggling for a voice within American society. The horrors of having your child taken from you and the mind of someone who would steal children.Everything about this movie is so well done. The acting is out of this world and Jolie delivers an Oscar worthy performance. The era is brilliantly depicted in every way - the attire, settings and cinematography were all perfect. The depiction of the US, which hasn't changed much, is also well done.

If it weren't for the writer, actors and directors would be standing about waiting for divine inspiration as to what to do. This movie was written by J. Michael Strazcynski, best known as the writer/producer of the Sci-Fi series Babylon 5. YOu can see a few echoes of dialog he used in B5, such as when Angelina's character announces \"Never start a fight, but always finish one.\" This is not easy material to watch. A child vanishes, and an inept LAPD returns the wrong child. Rather than just admit their mistake, they commit the mother to an insane asylum where she is tortured in an attempt to get her to recant her complaint. Sadly, this is a true story, and for those nostalgic about the \"good old days\", they weren't nearly as good as we like to think they were. even though she prevails in her quest to right the wrong the LAPD did, she still doesn't find her son. The film does a fine job of recreating 1928 Los Angeles, from the chaotic switchboard room to the streets to the skyline. JMS has always like writing strong female characters, and he doesn't disappoint here. Jolie's solid performance in this film erases the fluffy nonsense most of her career is comprised of. John Malkovich is strong in a role as a crusading clergyman. (A positive portrayal of the Clergy in Hollywood. Who would have thought so?)",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's \"Changeling' runs for almost two hours and half and yet there's no scene I would take out. In fact, the more I process the narrative, the more I find it perfect for a mini-series format. IMDb says that writer J. Michael Straczynski intended to make the film for TV, having cumulated a huge documentation on the \"Wineville Chicken Coop Murders\" and the disappearance of Walter Collins and it's true the film has such a dense a rich material that I could count almost five or six cliffhangers.It starts with Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) living alone with her boy Walter (Gattlin Griffith) in Wineville, near Los Angeles. The story is set in 1928 where single mothers were not only rare but rather ill-regarded by the good society. The husband left the house after Walter's birth, but like a modern mother even by our standards, Christine took good care of him, teaching him good manners and toughness and ensuring a comfortable living thanks to her salary; she's a competent manager in a telephone company. One day, the son disappears. First shock.Alerting the Police after a night of research in the neighborhood, she faces her first wall of uncooperativeness when she's requested to wait for 24 hours after the boy disappeared. Days go by, she goes the full support from local minister Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) who delivers a powerful \"J'Accuse\" speech against the Los Angeles Police Department and provides the viewer an interesting insight that will explain the Police's answer to Christine's despair. A boy is found and Police Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) happily announces the good news and invites the Press to cover the train station reunion. But Christine Collins is positive: that's not her boy.Marking the most pivotal point of the film, that \"he's not my boy\" statement will be all throughout the first act Christin's plea, repeated as insistently and desperately as Meryl Streep crying \"The Dingo took my baby\"... and like for Lindy Chamberlain, the more she'll cry, the more counter-productive it'll be for her and infuriating the experience for us. It's so obvious that a mother would know, let alone when the boy is circumsised and three inches shorter than her son but the patronizing Donovan refuses to believe her, or maybe he does and wouldn't allow that the one meager victory from the Police to be a flop.And so Jones deems her as hysterical and pulls a Code 12: which means pushing women in mental institutes when they became noisy disturbances. And so begins the journey in the 'hospital' where Christine will maintain that she was given the wrong boy, digging her deeper in the mud of insanity. Meanwhile, through a competent cop Ybarra (Michael Kelly), the plot takes us to the path of Gordon Northcuff the notorious serial killer who abducted and killed boys in the 20s. Northcuff (played by the excellent Jason Butler Harner) would have probably escaped the Law if it wasn't for his guilt-ridden nephew who denounced him and himself as the bait used to convince kids into getting into Gordon's car.Once the first bodies are unburied in the criminal's ranch, Christine is free and learns from the reverend the extent of police corruption. Not only cops were using hospital as dumping grounds for \"troublemakers\" but they also wiped out criminals because they were competitors to their own alcohol traffics (those were the Prohibition days). So many things happen in the film that it's a miracle Clint Eastwood could sustain it in a less than three-hour format, but that's due to his straight-to-the-point approach. He doesn't waste time building up characters: actions and reactions speak for them and while the events unfold, we realize the unspoken depths and darkest sides of each, including the kid who pretended to be Christine's son.As for Christine, she goes into every stage ; from trusting the police to pure bafflement and then revolt. In fact if you discount the procedurals part, there are two essential themes that Eastwood harbors in this film: corruption (moral and legal) and vulnerability (physical and legal) whether little boys at the mercy of sexual predators or women confronted to systemic misogyny. Eastwood declared that he came from a time where chivalry put women on a pedestal but indirectly ranked them as secondary citizens, members of the \"weaker sex\". And that's the most infuriating part: where Christine is slowly gaslighted and forced to think that she's troubled by her motherly instinct, or worse, that in the name of it, she would accept a kid who's not hers.There's a whole conspiracy against her that culminates in the hospital when she doesn't even know how to behave. It's a losing game where women are treated in the most condescending way, using the old excuse that they're incapable of rationality; victim of a system that would be labeled as 'toxic patriarchy' in the way it uses mothers and women as scapegoats. Such a shameful legacy that even the town changed its name. With the resonance of a pamphlet, Eastwood still avoids the trap of the political comment, he shows the corruption of the system through an example we can relate to and shows examples of true morality and bravura that allowed Christine to triumph in a never-ending quest for truth.\"Changeling\" is a solid film with a rather peaceful theme, it doesn't go for spectacularity because the sight of a distraught mother is spectacular enough and as Christine, Angelina Jolie delivers the kind of performance that would be perfect for an Oscar... if it wasn't a year for a sympathy one. Her emotionality is the key element of the film because it does two things at once: it builds our empathy but it works against her. Ironically, the man who commit these crimes went on sobbing, wheezing like a baby, indirectly proving that good people are indeed sensitive while monsters are simply wimps in disguise.",

            "content": "I confess that I was not expecting this film to be so interesting. It's truly awesome. Partly based on a true case that took place about a hundred years ago, the film is loaded with feelings that are difficult to digest and absorb. Skillfully directed by Clint Eastwood, who once again presents us with a piece of great technical quality and good dramatic sense, the film is absolutely memorable.The script is the main strength of the film, and it's really worth highlighting. I think it is really difficult to remain indifferent to a story so fraught with suffering and where the police are so deserving of censorship. The whole story revolves around the disappearance of a child and the incessant search for its mother, against all expectations and against the will of the authorities themselves, who presented a child to her as their child and never took it seriously when the mother said not to be the right child. It is a well-written and skillfully developed script.Another aspect that deserves positive mention is the colossal and talented work of Angelina Jolie in the main role. She has, on several occasions, already shown us her talent, this is nothing new, but it is always pleasant to see a great actress giving us another excellent performance. Here, the actress was perfectly able to clearly express that mother's mental anguish and psychological torture. In addition, the film also has an excellent contribution from John Malkovich, in the role of a religious pastor who is determined to help that mother by seeing her as a victim of arrogant and cruel police, and Colm Feore, in the role of the Police commander, ultimately responsible for their mistakes and negligence.Technically, it's a film that has excellent production values. The film is not long and the pace is excellent, allowing each point of the plot to get its best development. Being a period film, the sets and costumes take on greater relevance, and were excellent in the task of contextualizing the audience and the story in time and space. Finally, a word of appreciation for the great soundtrack.",

            "content": "This brooding film may not acquire as much credit as it should for the same reason that many films with flawlessly attractive stars do not. Angelina Jolie plays a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles who returns home from her job as a telephone operator one day to discover that her nine-year-old son Walter has disappeared. She has no idea why or how. All she knows is that the last thing she said to him was that she promised that tomorrow they will go to the movies. There is a powerful maternal instinct in Jolie which fuels her performance as a woman who goes through so much. She has a look that does not only evoke glamour and sexiness, but also a relative familiarity with the film's time period. Jolie puts on a powerful emotional display as a tenacious woman who gathers strength from the forces that oppose her. She reminds us that there is nothing so fierce as a mother protecting her cub. She inhabits this woman so deeply and persuasively that the camera is hardly conscious of Angelina Jolie, superstar and Goodwill Ambassador. But then again, there is no actor in this film that is anything but entirely convincing. And then, the camera has the same effect, and we are completely absorbed. And angry.Changeling opens as a typical story of a missing child, but it fundamentally stays outside the structure of a family drama to focus on a portrayal of a woman whose self-determination is seen as a menace to a male-dominated culture. The time and place are sketched as a city that acts towards women as if they are out of control, and defective when they have reservations about the reasoning of men. An assessment that the film has therefore been subject to sexist contempt derives contrast with that aimed at the women of this heavily engrossing drama's 1920s setting, suggesting maybe that attitudes towards independent, career-minded women have yet to entirely disappear in the prevailing years. Our protagonist challenges male-bred social beliefs and pays for it.Screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski carefully chooses not to crack down on the atrocious events involved in the story, favoring to tell it from Jolie's outlook. He sticks close to the facts of the case, something I wish more docudramas would do, because if the story is worth telling, it is bizarre enough that supplementing it with too many dramatized or fictitious aspects would call into doubt its reliability. There is just a handful of points at which, due to the lack of information, dramatization is necessary. But I am adamant that one does not read too much about this film before seeing it. Walk into the theater without any knowledge as to what happens. You know about Jolie's character and you know that her son goes missing. That is too much. Let the film take you on its journey in much the same way it takes her. The experience without preconception is that much more absorbing.Eastwood and Straszynski's seamless succession of one rivetingly acted, written, shot and edited scene after another puts on view that psychiatry became a device in the gender politics of the time, no more than a few years after women's suffrage was guaranteed. While women were no longer second class citizens, further upholding their individualism, mental institutions turned out to be major means utilized by the male establishment to lead to female disempowerment.As a director, Eastwood's continually been a classicist captivated by the decay beneath legends, and his films proliferate in a country's ethical drawbacks, in its outlook on a system's refusal to admit to its blunders, his latest film appears more densely linked to the War on Terror than his openly anti-war films. There is ample material for an analysis of maternal-spiritual displacement, though Jonathan Glazer's Birth never gave into elementary melodrama.Eastwood uses a subdued color palette to evoke feelings of security and contentment which incapacitated the movement toward equality throughout the former half of the 20th century. The closing shot in the film is a three-minute take in which Jolie walks off to ultimately grow to be lost in the crowded street. The camera pans upwards to show miles of city blocks, people walking the streets, cars passing and streetcars along tracks. The amount of visual effects, technical logistics and creative cinematography and production design all of this took must have been grueling, but to us, it is simply the atmosphere taken into the periphery of the experience.",

            "review_title": "Clint Eastwood's Passion Play",
            "content": "In the old days, Clint Eastwood was Dirty Harry, the vigilante maverick pitted against a world of bleeding heart liberals. Now times have changed and he's drifted more toward the left. In Million Dollar Baby, spokespersons for the Roman Catholic Church are the bad guys because they're against assisted suicide. In Letters from Iwo Jima, Eastwood attempts to soft pedal Japanese fanaticism by offering up the quid pro quo of a 'good' Japanese soldier to balance out a 'bad' one. And here in 'Changeling', it's the corrupt LAPD from the late 1920s which is the subject of another one of Eastwood's morality plays.In Eastwood's world view, it's simply a question of good vs. evil. That's why he's always drawn to melodrama which is the perfect type of drama for reminding us that he's always on the 'right' (and winning) side! Changeling's screenwriter, Michael Straczynski, researched this true crime story for a year and then changed the facts not only to improve the narrative but to also manipulate our emotions. Part of his quandary was that he needed to integrate two tangentially related aspects of the story, the kidnapping of the 10 year old boy, Walter Collins, and the mass murders of children on the Northcott Farm (Straczynski decided not to put the killer's mother into the script even though she actually confessed to the murder of the Collins boy and was sentenced to prison).Stracyznski is much more successful simply relating the details of the investigation into the child killings. Tension builds as one of the detectives uncovers the horror quite by chance after having to track down a juvenile runaway who needs to be deported to his native Canada. Before he's shipped back home, the juvenile reveals the sickening details of what happened and this in turn leads to a series of grim scenes including the digging up of evidence, the flight and apprehension of the accused in Vancouver, flashbacks of the actual crimes and the eventual trial and execution of the murderer. James Harner as Gordon Northcott, looks a lot like the actual killer (check the old photos!) and ably conveys his creepy manic and manipulative demeanor. When dealing with the historical facts of the crime itself, Eastwood is on solid ground. He falters however when he dwells too long on the sickening circumstances of the killer's execution. What exactly is the point in drawing out this scene? Again it's part and parcel of Eastwood's strategy to champion himself as the guardian of morality. The bad guys always must get their comeuppance whether it's pointing a gun at a miscreant and blurting out \"make my day\" or having a serial killer twist at the end of the hangman's rope a little longer than the viewer needs to see.Unfortunately Stracyznski appears to be at a complete loss as to what to do with the film's protagonist, Christine Collins. In real life, Collin's husband was locked up in San Quentin. Could it be that Collins wasn't the saint that Stracyznski makes her out to be? It certainly would have been more interesting to have Collins depicted as a complicated human being than the melodramatic victim depicted here. Collin's victimhood reaches its apotheosis when the police lock her up without a warrant at the Psychopathic Hospital. In a derivative scene right out of 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest', Collins is subjected to various degradations including a strip search, imprisonment on the mental ward, a coercive interview by the institution's vile psychiatrist and shock treatment given to a prostitute who comes to her aid (Stracyznski fails to do his research since shock treatment wasn't used in mental institutions until 1937!).Angelina Jolie is not an actor of great range to begin with but here she's saddled with a script that tells us virtually nothing about its main character. Jolie is good at histrionic expression but after awhile there are a few too many scenes where she pleads, \"I want my child back\". The film's ending loses dramatic tension since the protagonist becomes a passive participant. Collins not only sits through Northcottt's trial but she also is a spectator at the City inquiry into police misconduct in her case. In addition to Christine, the good Reverand Briegleb, played by John Malkovich, is another overly self-righteous character who remains underdeveloped (I also wondered if the police were so corrupt, why didn't they at least harass the Reverand at any point?) James Donovan's J.J. Jones was much more on the mark as Christine's tormentor (although the Irish accent probably would have been more applicable to New York than Los Angeles). Despite his liberal leanings these days, Clint Eastwood will never give up his original moniker as 'Dirty Harry'. He'll always be the man to protect us from the criminal element whether they be ordinary street thugs, corrupt police and government officials, serial killers or (as in his new film, Gran Torino) Asian street gangs! As long as Eastwood continues to see himself as an arbiter of morality, we will continue to endure more melodramatic tales of stereotyped self-righteous victims triumphing over cold-hearted villains.",

Christine Collins son (Walter) disappeared on March 10, 1928 and after five months, to avoid more negative press, the LA police brought home a boy of the same age, who claimed to be Walter.Christine played along for a short while, bullied by the police, but then - backed by Walter's dentist and teacher - stated publicly that the boy brought back by the LA police was not her son.The police had Christine committed to a mental institution, from which she was freed thanks to public support. In the meantime, a more sinister truth was discovered.Apparently Christine did not refuse to accept the fake Walter from the start because the LA police of the 20s was a misogynist bunch of violent, corrupted cops. Whatever it was and despite the meticulous reconstruction of LA in that period, the film collapses due to Jolie presence and performance.Eastwood is said to have chose Jolie because \"her face fit the period\" but if you check movies and fashion shots from the 20s, you will see women with pencil-thin eyebrows and thin lips, none with full brows or oversize, bee-stung lips. The colossal failure in the makeup department is coupled with Jolie's lack of subtlety and wooden presence. Certainly the real Christine looked nothing like her, but a more naturalistic approach would have lacked star power.Clearly the fans appreciate Jolie regardless of her skills but to me she just looked like \"Jolie-the movie star\" with a bad wig trying and failing to emote and convince you she was an anonymous, helpless, fragile mother.",

            "content": "When Changeling was screened in competition at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, a lot of people assumed it was a lock for the Palme d'Or, given none other than Sean Penn, whom Clint Eastwood had directed to an Oscar with Mystic River, was the President of the Jury. Instead, good old Clint had to settle for a Special Award for the whole of his career. While this might not qualify as a proper award (in fact, it was made up on the spot so that he and the female winner, Catherine Deneuve, didn't leave Cannes empty-handed), it's a fitting tribute to a great filmmaker who, at the age of 78, shows no signs of tiredness or mediocrity, as proved by Changeling, another sober yet merciless look at the underbelly of American society.The movie takes us back to that most cinematic of cities, Los Angeles, in the year 1928 (two years before Clint himself was born, by the way). The shockingly true story told here is that of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a single mother whose only concern is the happiness of her 9-year old son Walter. It's no surprise, then, that she almost loses her mind when he disappears without a trace. The real surprise, to the LAPD at least, is that she refuses to recognize the boy they bring back months later: he claims to be Walter Collins, and Captain Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) summons several experts to explain some of the visible changes (the kid is shorter, not to mention circumcised) in a logical way, but Christine refuses to believe those lies, and with the help of a priest (John Malkovich) who uses his radio program to publicly denounce the bad side of law enforcement she sets out to uncover the truth, no matter the cost.Like most masters of today, Eastwood uses the period piece gimmick to really tell a story that concerns our present situation: in this case, as has often been done previously (see L.A. Confidential), corruption within the police and its effect on the general public. Changeling is also a different take on a broader subject - the inefficiencies of the justice system - Clint has handled many times before, as both a star (the Dirty Harry cycle) and a director (True Crime, Blood Work, Mystic River). He takes advantage of the setting to tell the staggering tale, brought to the screen by sci-fi and comic-book writer J. Michael Straczynski (of Babylon 5 fame), and it does in fact look like it had really been made in the late '20s or early '30s: the cinematography, in particular, is reminiscent of what he did with his WWII double bill, especially Latters from Iwo Jima, which was almost black and white. It was made today, but could just as easily have been produced seventy years ago (with the swearing removed, of course), and like most well told period stories it holds up perfectly in our times as well.Then there's Jolie, who constitutes an entire chapter by herself: she was reportedly cast because she was the only actress who had that special something that defined movie stars during Hollywood's Golden Age (in fact, she was attached to the project before it even had a director), something which was visually enhanced with little but vital make-up. She returns the favor with a performance that exudes rare pain and power, a career-topping effort that is, for good reasons, earning her more Oscar buzz than any other actress this year. To say that this is her best work since Girl, Interrupted (for which she won an Academy Award) isn't enough: it is likely that with this and the equally difficult role she had in A Mighty Heart she may have reached the climax of her notable talent, which has been wasted in the past on crap like the Tomb Raider films. Needless to say, everyone else in the excellent cast pales next to her, which is probably why there's no other A-lister in the movie, minus Malkovich who turns out to be a very good choice thanks to his trademark old-fashioned, stage-like acting style.Most people mellow with age. Clint Eastwood doesn't: after the likes of Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby, he delivers another uncompromising, unmissable study of human behavior at its noblest (a mother's attempts to find her son) and at the same time most inhumane (the LAPD's reaction to Christine's \"crusade\")",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood's newest project, Changeling, is sort of awesome, sort of annoying. The true story of Christine Collins, a telephone operator and single mother in 1928 Los Angeles, has a promising script and cast, but fails to accomplish any major feats on screen. At times the dialog feels forced. For example, when Jolie adds an ambient \"Sport\" moniker or makes references to Cleopatra. It's as if Eastwood is saying to the audience \"Yes, this really is 1928, I promise.\" Historical accuracy is important in a film claiming truth, but Changeling is a bit like scaling a wall\u0097 there is not much to hold on to.But what little there is to hold on to is both enjoyable and sophisticated. Angelina Jolie, who plays Christine, gives a convincing portrayal of a mother who returns home from work to find that her son Walter is missing. In fact, Jolie might have scored a career best performance with Changeling, but it is hard to say whether or not this is enough to carry the film.Jolie holds her head high as a mother who loses her son and receives little help from the Los Angeles Police Department during the search. The 1920s were wrought with scandal for the L.A.P.D. and Christine Collins find herself in the midst of them. After months of search, the police return Walter to Christine only to find that she denies that he is her son. Despite the mounting evidence supporting her claim (her Walter is uncircumcised, the new Walter is not; the new Walter is 3 inches shorter, etc.), the police continually deny that there is anything wrong. Because of the recent scandals, the L.A.P.D does not want to admit any wrongdoing with the Collins case.The tone of this story seems to border between over-the-top melodrama and a dead-on homage to 1930s dramatic style. This is most notable in the scenes featuring Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) whose performance is cookie-cutter bad cop for the period. Eastwood navigates the \"bad cops\" with ease and never allows them to become satire, but it borders on the edge. Likewise with the necessary court scenes in the latter portion, Eastwood makes the material work, even if just barely. It is hard to diminish the negative affects of these melodramatic choices, but then again, it is a story about true events. Who am I to say whether or not the courtroom proceedings actually had that much fervor and zest? It is hard to find fault in conceivable truth.Another strong performance in the film comes from John Malkovich as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, a man determined to expose the misdeeds of the Los Angeles Police Department via his radio show. Briegleb vows to help Christine in her quest for her son as he believes that \"Walter\" is not the same boy. Malkovich gives a convincing role as a man of God, a man of principle, and a man of determination. He plays the hero, but never saddles up his white horse. His heroics come naturally as a man who wants the best for his city and the people within it\u0097 his mission is never glitzy, never self-indulgent.Malkovich and Jolie together save the one part of the film that could have poisoned the entire piece. When Miss Collins refuses to be quiet on the issue of her son and is convinced by Briegleb to go public with the misdoings of the police, she is whisked off to a mental ward. Until she admits that she is making the whole impostor-son bit up, she will remain in the ward. The mental ward scenes were in complete discord with the rest of the film. The inclusion of stereotypical elements like electro-shock therapy and evil nurses allowed these scenes to toe the line of ridiculousness. If it were not for a convincing and levelheaded performance from Jolie, nothing good would have come from these scenes. And when Malkovich's character swoops in to save her from the grips of the ward and the police, it never once feels trite. Eastwood should really thank these two and consider the possibility of never, ever filming any hospital-like scenes ever again.The unsaturated color choice for the film gives an immediate feeling of doom and sadness for the picture, but a more upbeat, stylized look might have complimented the film better. The cinematography attempted to mirror the motif of the film but ended up missing the mark and falling more into dark and muddled than stylistically relevant.With the film clocking in a 140 minutes, it is impressive that it never feels that long. Eastwood navigates through a significant chunk of time with little duress and manages to take on a troubling story without being all too troubling. Easily an audience favorite and definite Oscar-bait, as the United States release is set for November under the title \"The Exchange.\" This film is mass of \"in-betweens.\" It is neither complex nor simple; neither heartfelt nor underwhelming. I find it hard to love it, but I do not hate it either. That's the problem: nothing clicks. It is within this realm that I find this film, more than anything else, a tad bit frustrating. It is a virtuous attempt and no doubt going to do well both in box office numbers and with awards. But because of that, I wanted more punch. I wanted more zing, more attitude. The film melts quickly in my mind and becomes just another biopic that might soon be forgotten. A little originality is crucial, especially for a film being considered for the Cannes Film Festival's highest honor. This film leaves me generally satisfied all whist thinking, \"Come on, Clint. You could've done better.\"",

Changeling is beautiful, heartfelt, haunting and amazing brilliant film that captured my heart and made me feel so bad of what happened to Christina Collins. Not only the movie is so amazing, it sends a strong message about how brave single mothers are and would give their life away if their child was found missing or taken. Angelina Jolie did that without overacting, she did everything an actress could do to give the Oscars a hard time and give them some second thoughts of who they would choose.

            "content": "I liked this movie less and less the longer it went on. Eastwood is an interesting director but his biggest fault lies in his inability to see the woods for the trees. Like the latter-day Spielberg, he just can't bear to end the movie or at least cut out scenes which stretch the patience. There are long, tedious swathes of this movie (the hearings at the end, the trial of the killer) which could have been drastically edited or (in the case of the outcome of the hearings) cut completely and dealt with in text at the end of the movie or in a far more succinct denouement.Conversely, there are parts of the story dealt with so briefly that they are simply confusing. The reason why a small boy would pretend to be a missing child, how he got the idea and who encouraged him are inadequately provided, and the solitary scene of the boy being left as collateral in a diner is scant compensation.It's a testament to the slightly unfocused film that I felt it necessary to read more about the real case online when I got home, just to fill in the gaps. In my e-travels I found an interview with the screenwriter who says he didn't want to glorify the heinous crimes which formed part of the story, but wanted to focus on the personal tale of Christine Collins and her disappeared son. That's all very well, but it was only really in the scenes involving the crimes that the film really felt alive and driven, instead of melodramatic and pedantic. If I had to see Angelina Jolie slap her heart and shout 'I want MY son!' one more time, I'd had have wanted a refund. Or earplugs.Jolie has had loads of plaudits for her role and she was good - but I found her lips so distracting that I can hardly judge. Against a muted 'period' palette, her scarlet protuberances - often in the act of grief-induced quivering - intrude like two giant red jellies in a pot of porridge.This is not a bad film - parts of it are very good and some of it is shocking. But someone needs to let Clint Eastwood know the line between drama and melodrama, taking time and tedium, and attention to detail and pedantry.I would have given it a 6 but I'm giving it a 5 in an effort to drag the ridiculously high score down to a sensible level as quickly as possible.",

The story itself is strong, and it is brought into the screen in such a way that the audience really holds on to it. I expected a dull, sappy melodrama, but instead I found it to be very entertaining. I found all the turns that the film takes to suit it well, and instead of all the different challenges it had to overcome, it could have easily failed, but it succeeded brilliantly. The pacing is never slow, it is always on focus, and it does not linger so much as other mystery films. Since this film starts off as a mystery, then turns into sort of a crime and court film, it has a lot to offer in performances. Angelina Jolie is really an underrated actress. I think all her fame sometimes overshadow how good she is, and in this, she gives the best performance I have seen from her. Her pain, her unbearable suffering, her eagerness for the truth and justice, it is all played perfectly. Angelina Jolie deserves at the least an Oscar nomination. John Malkovich and the entire cast are great, even the kid actors. The film is also very beautiful to look at. The atmosphere of Los Angeles in the 1920's and 1930's is perfectly captured. The cinematography is beautiful, and I was also glad it was not too showy, it would not fit the tone too much. The costumes and set designs are also perfect. Expect a lot of technical Oscar nominations, as well as Original Score. It was so soothing and enhanced the story even more.Overall, amazing and brilliant film! It is not flawless, but it certainly is a great film, if not for the gripping story and writing, then for the performances. I really enjoyed it a lot more than the overrated Million Dollar Baby, and the dull letters from Iwa Jima. This is Eastwood's best film of the decade, and one of his best works",

            "content": "If \"Changeling\" didn't tell us right up front that it was based on a true story, one might be easily forgiven for dismissing it as nothing more than far-fetched and implausible melodrama. But since truth so often IS stranger than fiction, we can but sit back in openmouthed disbelief as this most bizarre of bizarre scenarios unfolds before us.Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins, a single mother living with her nine-year-old son, Walter, in 1928 Los Angeles. When Walter goes missing one day, the frantic mother pleads with the police to find him. After five long months of grueling suspense, Christine is finally reunited with her child. Or is she? For while the police, eager to close the case for publicity purposes, insist that the boy they've found is indeed her missing son, Christine knows otherwise and spends the next few months attempting to convince anyone who'll listen that her real son is still out there somewhere and that the boy living with her is an imposter. John Malkovich co-stars as a crusading radio preacher who takes up the cause of this understandably distraught mother against the increasingly disreputable and malicious LAPD.Written by J. Michael Straczynski and directed by Clint Eastwood (who also wrote the musical score), \"Changeling\" is a gripping human drama that keeps us on tenterhooks every step of its narrative-shifting way. Going well beyond the surface fascinations of the plot, the movie broadens out to become a compelling study of police corruption and of one woman's battle for justice against a totalitarian, bureaucratic system. Throughout, the audience is buffeted back and forth between utter frustration and heartwarming uplift and just about every other emotion in between. It's true that the movie does have a few too many false climaxes towards the end and there are individual moments when it veers dangerously close to exploitation, but, for the most part, this is a first-rate, riveting drama, solidly directed by Eastwood and beautifully acted by Jolie, Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffrey Donovan, Amy Ryan and many others.Director Eastwood triumphs again.",

I have a very mixed reaction to Clint Eastwood's work both as an actor and as a director - some I love, some is OK, some I really don't care for. There's no consistency. This film, though, is a definite winner, and he's clearly on a winning streak after his great work with \"Gran Torino.\" Set in 1920's Los Angeles and depicting real events, the movie begins a bit slowly, with a depiction of a series of domestic scenes to establish the relationship between single mother Christine Collins and her only son Walter, but once the element of mystery is introduced, Eastwood very skilfully builds the suspense through a series of mysteries. After leaving Walter alone at home when she's called into work, Christine returns home to an empty house, with no clue about what's happened to Walter. At first, the mystery appears to be simply \"what happened to Walter?\" But it keeps growing. Months later, the police \"reunite\" Christine with her son - except she's convinced that it isn't her son. Who is this boy? Then a story about police corruption becomes the focus, leading to the police illegally sending Christine off to a psychiatric hospital because she refuses to accept the boy as her son. Along the way, she connects with what you might call an \"avenging angel\" - a well-known Presbyterian minister with a popular radio ministry who's taken it as his mission to fight police corruption. Finally, the movie becomes extremely dark and disturbing, as it begins to look at a series of child abductions and murders, of which Walter may or may not be a victim.In the end, there's no resolution - there can't be, because in truth Walter's remains weren't identified, nor was he ever found. What happened to him remains a mystery to this day. Subsequent to watching this I was involved enough with the story to do some checking on the \"Wineville Chicken Coop Murders\" as they're known in history. The story is remarkably accurate. There are a few details about Christine's experiences which are altered for dramatic licence I suppose, but nothing really substantive, and some details about the killer Gordon Northcott are left out, but again they weren't important to this particular story, since it was about Christine and Walter and not the killer or the murders per se.Perhaps strangely for a movie that I considered to be a very good one, I can't say that the performances leaped out at me. They were fine; there was nothing wrong with them. It's just that the story itself was so compelling and so well told that the cast seemed secondary. I was actually surprised to check the cast list later and discover that Christine was played by Angelina Jolie. That's a compliment to Jolie, by the way, because she became so totally Christine that I didn't see her as anyone else. This is truly a movie that deserves to be seen. 9/10",

With 'Changeling' he takes the director's chair again and tells the harrowing story of a single mother desperately in search of her missing son followed by a wrongful accusation by a corrupt system and a lawsuit while her son still remains gone. The film is set in the 1920s-1930s. Eastwood's attention to detail of that time period is noticeable. The sets look real and the costumes are well designed. The makeup department does a good job too.I only thought the language slightly felt more of the current time than of then but otherwise the writing is fine. Given the different themes, 'Changeling' could have easily been a mess but the story unfolds smoothly and the issues are well tackled. I particularly liked the ending which avoids the usual clich\u00e9 but at the same time stays hopeful of the protagonist's future.Given his strong films, especially of the last 10 years, Eastwood has managed to extract some of the best performances of his actors. Now it's Angelina Jolie's turn and this woman is a knockout. Her acting could have easily ended up whiny and preachy but Jolie stays restrained as she wonderfully displays Christine's dignity, courage and determination and is only explosive in one scene that required it. It is only occasionally that we get to see her do something of note because her glamorous image seems to overshadow her acting abilities but it is good to see that she is becoming more picky (last year she did an equally convincing job in 'A Mighty Heart'). John Malkovich too stands in a supporting role as the supportive minister who helps Christine through her ordeal while the rest of the cast are competent.'Changeling' is an engaging story of a mother in search of justice and her lost son. Unlike most of Eastwood's other films, 'Changeling' is disturbing. There are some gory scenes of murder. Even though they are mostly suggestive, it leaves a chill down the spine. The movie also enlightens about the legal system and how easy it was for the authority to get away with injustice. This is a must see for Eastwood fans but also for those who are interested in 'a different kind' of period piece and a gripping story.",

When she gets a call to say he has been found safe and well, she is overjoyed...only to find the boy is not her son. When she brings this little matter up with the chief of police, she finds herself thrown into an insane asylum. The outraged Rev. Briegleb (John Malkovich) begins a campaign for her freedom, and when she is free, she continues her fight to find her son and expose the corruption and shame of the police force.Fact, as they say, is often stranger than fiction. If Clint Eastwood's true life justice drama were a work of fiction, there would be numerous plot holes that could be brought up, such as the mother not being able to prove the boy was not her son with a photo or other people not being able to verify her claims. But if the front cover says it's based on a true story, who am I to argue with it? A real 'you couldn't make it up' plot line, this story served as the wake up call that changed LA's mental health policy forever.Aside from being an unbelievable story, it's also an uneasy and disturbing one, and an air of disturbance and unease hangs over it through out. Long and drawn out, the smooth pace and expert story telling never make it feel a drag. Of all the stars, Eastwood gets his best work out of lead stars Jolie and Malkovich, who both deliver strong, powerful performances, but that's not to say the supporting cast aren't on fire either, including Colm Feore as a police captain and Devon Conti as the oddball accused of unspeakable crimes.It's a story that had to be made into a film and in the hands of a pro like Eastwood, it didn't go wrong. ****",

Several months later she is overjoyed to be told by the LAPD that Walter has been found alive and well. However, when she is reunited with the boy she categorically states that this boy is not her Walter. Persuaded to take the child home by pressure tactics and mind games by department Captain J. J. Jones , Christine becomes ever more clear that the boy is not her son. Refusing to accept what the authorities are telling her, she begins a public crusade to find the real Walter. This however opens up a can of worms that involves corruption and murder.Based on real life incidents that occurred in in Los Angeles and Riverside County, California, in 1928, Changeling sees Clint Eastwood direct after Ron Howard had to step aside and J. Michael Straczynski adapting the story for the screen. From his first directing assignment in 1971 with Play Misty For Me, Eastwood has grown into one of the finest and most respected directors around. His choice of topics may not be across the board appealing, but, certainly with his work from Unforgiven onwards, he has an easy on the eye style that belies some of the dark material he chooses to work from. Such is the case with Changeling, a magnificent film that asks you for your undivided attention so as to make you angry, upset and even repulsed in equal measure.Driven by a powerhouse performance from Jolie (is this really the Tomb Raider and Wanted girl?), the film niftily puts under the microscope a number of issues that existed around the time of this two handed story. There's the treatment of women, well, more society's attitude to women at this time, while the LAPD, already pinpointed as a discredited organisation in the 20s, firmly get the barrels aimed straight at them thru the station doors. There's also the ugly spectre of how mental health patients are dealt with, this point in the film signifying a change of mood, it no longer being a film about one mother's quest for the truth. There lies the trump card in the piece, after being fully engaged with Christine's black and blue world (the story is too strong to not be involved with it), it turns to black horror with the arrival of Sanford Clark, and more tellingly, his uncle, one Gordon Northcott (a fabulously twitchy Jason Butler Harner).The production is top dollar, from the costumes (those wonderful hats) to the rattling streetcars and jalopies, this is rich 20s period detail. While the rest of the cast turn out good work for their relaxed director. John Malkovich is perhaps a little under used considering he is the film's moral backbone, but in true Malkovich fashion he leaves a lasting impression and proves once again what a fine visual actor he is. Geoff Pierson pops in with a potent turn as lawyer S.S. Hahn, while Colm Feore, Jeffrey Donovan and Michael Kelly are the coppers of the piece and they round out what is a well casted motion picture. Nominated for three Academy Awards (winning none), the film made a Worldwide profit of nearly $58 million. That profit doesn't do justice to how good the film is. After enthusiastic reviews from Cannes the piece received mixed reviews on its general release. Some complaints lean towards the film apparently being over melodramatic at times. Not so! This is just real adult drama produced with like minded adult precision. There's a small gripe that it has one too many endings, thus stretching it to being over two hours long, but it's not enough to stop it from being the tight and emotionally involving picture that it is. Keep up the good work Clint, Hollywood needs you now more than ever. 9/10",

And of course having Jolie in it she didn't have to twist my arm to much. We had to go out of town to see it because our local theater wasn't showing it. The acting by Jolie was great. Eastwood's direction was great. And the 20's and 30's look to the movie was so realistic. I learned some things about this time frame by watching this movie. So not only did I enjoy the movie I learned a little bit along the way. This is a Rated R movie so I wouldn't take kids to it because there are a couple disturbing moments in the movie. If this movie doesn't get some Oscar nominations I will be very surprised. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!",

            "content": "I just got back from seeing this, and I am still overwhelmed. So, I'll begin by giving a definition of the title. A \"changeling,\" in medieval folklore, was a child of the magical fairy-folk left in place of an abducted mortal child. So, using that to describe what the LAPD of 1928 tried to do, with regard to Christine Collins, is all too-apt.As depicted by Angelina Jolie, in this film, Christine is a single mom whose husband abandoned her and their son almost ten years earlier. So, she has been trying to make ends meet by working at the L.A. branch of the Bell Telephone Company as a shift supervisor. A job so hectic, she has to wear roller skates!Getting home late, from an emergency fill-in, she calls her son Walter in for supper...and gets no response. After an increasingly frantic search around the neighborhood, she calls the local police station. And, I must admit to being shocked at hearing that the \"24-hour minimum rule\" was in effect even eighty years ago!!Cut to a downtown L.A. train station five months later. Enter the boy from Illinois who claims that he is Walter. Despite her claims to the contrary, she is pressured into giving him shelter overnight. After giving him a warm bath before bedtime, though, she finds...surgical proof that the kid is definitely an impostor.You will see for yourselves just what the LAPD subsequently puts her through, rather than admit they might have made a mistake. Because, mere words cannot do it justice. I've gone to a lot of graphically violent movies before. But, even I had to close my eyes during several of the mental hospital scenes, alone!Clint Eastwood has truly directed another gut-wrenching masterpiece. That and his musical score--which I predict will be just as bittersweetly haunting as \"Beyond Tomorrow,\" from the Al Pacino classic SERPICO--are bound to get Oscar nominations for those two categories. Likewise, the writing by J. Michael Straczynski (of BABYLON 5 fame) and the co-production of Ron Howard.Jeffrey Donovan, from TV's BURN NOTICE, does a pretty good job at making you hate Capt. J.J. Jones. Although, if he was trying to give his character a slight Irish brogue, I have to confess it sounded more like the Maine accent of that actor who used to appear in the Pepperidge Farm commercials!As for Jason Butler Harner? He reminded me of a young Dennis Hopper, with the suitably chilling way he played convicted child murderer Gordon Northcott.But, I think it's John Malkovich (as Rev. Briegleb), Gattlin Griffith (the real Walter), and Devon Corti (the fake Walter) who will probably all wind up being rivals for Best Supporting Actor. And, if none of my predictions come true? Then, shame on you, Motion Picture Academy! So, go see this movie, and bring plenty of tissue. Because, no one in their right mind will be able to keep a dry eye through this movie. And, I'm not ashamed to say that I certainly didn't.",

            "content": "19 February 2009. \"Changeling\" is easily the most ambitious and dramatic movie of the year (2008) in which the subject matter, the plot all conspire to make this movie almost unwatchable but captivating at the same time. Watching the movie is almost like having to sit through two solid hours of the emotionally intense but upsetting television action-thriller \"24.\" The frustration of the disbelief that \"bad\" guys get away with so much, that the primary female protagonist comes across, especially for the first two-thirds of the movie, a wimp, a weakling that the movie becomes almost unbearable to watch. \"Changeling\" raises a fascinating conundrum of whether the unsettling feelings about a movie, particularly this movie are because of its inferior weak qualities or whether it is in fact the fascination of the authenticity of the plot and characters. There are a few problems with the movie, the first having to do with the two week jump between Angelina Jolie's character's son's disappearance and the next scene that skips over the initial behavior and reactions of Jolie as a mother and the police department, supposedly crucial moments in any kidnapping incident. The second is after the movie is over, Angelina Jolie's character is strangely still underdeveloped in that the audience never really is provided much in the way of who this person is, no background, no backstory, no real understanding of who and why this person does specifically what she does. This absence serves to somehow distance the audience from the primary character of the movie. Finally, one of the musical selections that keeps getting played over and over towards the end of the movie just doesn't seem to fit in the the emotionality of the scenes, almost a happy, reminiscent tonal quality instead of the more melancholy melody. Nevertheless, this movie presents several major and fantastic plot sequences each and any of which could have easily been devoted to a single movie themselves. The kidnapping, the police cover-up, the mental health institution - with flashbacks to another movie Jolie starred in \"Girl, Interrupted\", 1999 where she won an Oscar for best supporting actress - the criminal search, the trial, the continued search. What was also amazing was Angelina Jolie's performance, that felt real (no superhero antics), the set design, and even several of the musical melodies were just set on period perfect. Clint Eastwood's moody direction was haunting, scary, thrilling in the right moments as well as uplifting (the last hour) without getting gaudy. Overall, this movie was an incredible, if not complicated experience - one of the most difficult emotionally and logically to judge as a movie because the line between the performances and story entered into one's own emotional beliefs and feelings and investiture.

            "content": "The dictionary defines \"changeling\" as a child surreptitiously or unintentionally substituted for another, a clever title for this drama film from BAFTA nominated director Clint Eastwood. Set in 1920's Los Angeles, this film Christine Collins (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Angelina Jolie), a telephone operator come home to find her son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) has disappeared, and it is only in the morning that the police come over for descriptions and stuff. Finally after weeks the police are convinced they have found the boy matching Christine's description, but she knows it is not her son, and she is definite when she sees he is not the right height, and has been circumcised. She also gets confirmation from two people who know him well, his dentist and school teacher, but Capt. J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) thinks Christine is going crazy with her accusations of the police being wrong, they go to extreme lengths to protect their reputation, they place her in a mental hospital under \"Code 12\" (attacking police reputation). Eventually she is released after a young boy hands himself into the police, and confesses to helping a man commit brutal murders of young boys, and one of the boys may be Walter! After released, Christine, with the help of local activist Rev. Gustav A. Briegleb (John Malkovich) is determined to punish those imprisoned her and others under Code 12, and also the man who murdered the young boys, Gordon Stewart Northcott (Jason Butler Harner), oh, and the fake \"Walter\" gets what he deserves to. In one of the last scenes, Christine sees one of the young boys who escaped Northcott with the police, and he knew Walter, as he was the one who helped him escape, but he never knew where he went, it says in the end text that Christine never stopped searching for Walter. Also starring Colm Feore as Chief James E. Davis, Amy Ryan as Carol Dexter, Michael Kelly as Detective Lester Ybarra, Devon Conti as Arthur Hutchins and Eddie Alderson as Sanford Clark. Jolie is magnificent as the suffering and sometimes hysterical but determined mother, and Malcovich has his moments as the publicist against the police, and of course Eastwood is the perfect director for this very compelling mystery thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography, it was nominated the BAFTAs Film Award Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Eastwood. Angelina Jolie was number 74, and John Malkovich number 59 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Malkovich was number 53, and Jolie number 1 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Outstanding!",

            "content": "Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a single mother, raising a young son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith), while working as a supervisor to a telephone operator agency. She leaves Walter at home when going to work one day, and find him to be lost upon her return. She calls the police, an investigation is launched, and she is reunited with her son months later. Only, she is convinced the child is an imposter, and is not her son.I wanted to really enjoy Changeling. I always give Clint Eastwood a chance with his frequently Oscar-nominated films (having thoroughly enjoyed his last offering, Letters from Iwo Jima), but I am finding that I may be a little too lenient. Yet again, Eastwood gives us a movie that proves he has talent, but lacks the right formula to be considered as anything extraordinary.While the basic story is there (a very interesting true one at that), it gets muddled into a deeper subplot of corruption, scandal and murder. It is not confusing in the least, but becomes frequently annoying. Once the film starts moving and Collins is reunited with her \"son\", it just loses its focus and starts swinging its hands into other things. Sure, they are integral to the film, but they feel so open-ended and thrown on that they look and sound superfluous when they first appear. A meeting between the integral characters Det. Ybarra (Michael Kelly) and Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) is set up as being merely scene filler, but only becomes important much later in the film. It is troublesome in every instance, and plagues the film from beginning to end.What does not help is the film's running time. Clocking in at 141 minutes, Changeling feels about 20-30 minutes longer than it needs to be. When Eastwood is not hammering us over the head with how distraught and confused Collins is, he is packing on the emphasis on the near-superfluous items that become important only as the film draws to a close (or on scenes that were clumsily added in for an effect lacking any subtly). It feels like writer J. Michael Stracynski knew he had found a great story to tell, but had a few too many problems adapting it to screen. Why else would we have a wonky timeline, repetitive sequences, and all-too predictable moments that are meant to shock, but instead induce the audience to rolling their eyes? This is not meant to be a life lesson-style story, but merely a recreation of history. Stracynski, in his attempt to stay true to the source material, cuts very little out of his storyline, and the film suffers under its own weight because of it. Where it needs to be fast-paced, it drags its heels. When it needs to slow down and dwell on something shocking, time just flies by. Is there any real need to not know which way you want to play the film? Jolie, as the main character, has seen better days and far superior performances. Yes, her exquisite acting chops are put to the test in some scenes, but a lot just require her to almost act beneath herself. We saw her as a struggling, very pregnant wife in A Mighty Heart, acting as journalist Mariane Pearl. While by no means a great movie, Heart gave a great means for Jolie to express herself in a depressingly serious role, allowing her to pull on heart strings and prove she is not just a one-trick pony turned paparazzi fodder. But here, where she plays a very similar role, she seems to be merely aping off her old performances. Shades of Pearl are obvious, and shades of her Oscar-winning turn in Girl, Interrupted are even more noticeable. She just seems incapable of giving any real means of attention to the part, and looks like she is merely going through the motions, just hoping for that next Oscar nom. A scene near the end of the film, where Collins acts totally and inexplicably out of character, only makes her role seem that more staged than it already was. Her character goes from somewhat believable to a total fantasy in less than three minutes; which is never a good sign for anyone.Jeffrey Donovan, playing Captain J.J. Jones makes for a great antagonist, but he is very underused. His accent may be a bit wavy, but he beams brightly when he shares the screen with Jolie. Much the same goes for John Malkovich, who plays a local radio-based Pastor who loves to enthrall his listeners with stories of corruption and evil within the LAPD. He too is shafted (much like in Burn After Reading), merely acting as an over-sized prop for Jolie as the film progresses. Both Kelly and Harner do great work for the small roles they are given, but as the films drags almost exclusively around the story behind these two characters. In a stronger film, both of these guys could have been stars.While the film suffers under the weight Eastwood and Stracynski are forcing upon it, it does manage to set the 1920s scenery up quite well. From the costumes to the cars to the sets to even the drab and dark weather, Changeling is a tour-de-force for its technical means. The artists who put together this maverick vision clearly have a grasp on the material, and have an even better idea on where it is headed from moment one. They put a lot of effort into these designs, and it shows in how realistic and authentic they look.Changeling is an interesting movie, but gets bogged down under too much being pumped into the story. It knows what it wants to be, but it makes itself out to be something totally different. Jolie is the star, but the supporting cast does a much better job holding it up than she does. Its watchable, but not more than once.6/10.",

            "content": "Abuse of power can be ugly and creates lots of havoc and hurt lots of people. But sometimes it also brings out the best in people as they marshal all their strength and determination to confront and combat the abuse. This movie is about one of those instances where one person, without influence, with few resources but with indomitable will, stands up to a corrupt system, draws a line, and makes her stand. In short, this movie is about heroism and redemption. Cruelty is always repugnant but perhaps never more so then when perpetrated by the very people who swear to protect and defend us. We as members of society invest them with a sacred trust which they in turn promise to honor. This movie is about one of those instances where that sacred trust is dashed to the ground and stomped into the dirt under the dubious pretension of enforcing the law and protecting the public. And what can be more dastardly than the victim being a young single mother? Who among us is more in need of protection and care than a young single mother? What kind of community would even think of wanting to crush a single mother whose only \"crime\" is that she wants to find her son? This movie poses these questions and does so with a quiet strength that is only equaled by the fundamental forthrightness of the story itself. This story is not a melodrama; there are no hysterics. Rather the story speaks for itself with an eloquence that is almost nonexistent in movies today. Angelina Jolie's performance is outstanding. She dominates this movie. She is the star and deservedly so.Yes, the movie is a little on the long side, at times seems to drag out, but so what? Here sensationalism takes a back seat to story telling. The supporting cast is excellent and there is a good mixture of pathos and indignation that contribute to keeping the story interesting. The \"bad guys\" are actually bad because they knew that what they were doing was wrong but did it anyway out of a crass desire to protect their reputations. How pathetic. This movie is about what happens when one person refuses to knuckle under and confronts the system with the only thing she has going for her, the truth. This theme alone makes the movie well worth watching.",

            "content": "Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood does not change much does he? He continues his non-changing hot streak of directing emotionally powerful films in his twilight time. His latest \"Changeling\" stars Angelina Jolie as Christine Collins, a single mom in 1920's Los Angeles whose son goes missing and then found by the L.A.P.D., but it turns out that the boy located is not her real son. The film is based on a true story, but I guess Clint did have to make a few changelings for dramatic enhancement touches. 'Changeling\" channels itself into such themes as: police corruption, despicable murders, and mental institutionalism. Jolie's performance should not be missing from the list of top female acting efforts of the year. It would be another case of corruption in L.A. if Jolie is not nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award. The supporting thespian performances of the film were the right ones found for Oscar consideration: Me gusta John Malkovich's work as Rev. Gustav Briegleb, an advocate on fighting police corruption; Jason Butler Harner was monstrously amazing as the loathsome Gordon Northcott; Amy Ryan is not yet \"gone baby gone\" from strong acting with her wicked performance as psych ward patient Carol Dexter; Jeffrey Donovan as \"bad cop\" Captain Corrupter J.J. Jones was commanding; and Michael Kelly was solid as \"good cop\" Detective Lester Ybarra. OK, I will stop playing \"good cop, bad cop\". Hey, but you know what \"Kids Are Good Actors Too\". The child actors in the film were phenomenal and should have plenty of \"changelings\" in their pockets and bling-bling on their necks & wrists for years to come! So acting kids' kudos goes out to: Gattlin Griffith as Walter Collins, Eddie Alderson as Sanford Clark, and the rest of their child thespian colleagues of \"Changeling\". Let's change the subject of \"Changeling\" and get technical! Because the cinematography, art direction, costumes, sound, sound editing, and score (by none other than Eastwood himself) of the film are all worthy to be found and not missing from the Academy Awards nomination list for their respected categories. Scriber J. Michael Straczynski effectively put the word out on \"Changeling\" with sturdy emotional pathos that will leave you uneasy but in tuned. Lastly, one cannot ignore that Hollywood God Eastwood was the proficient main orchestrator of \"Changeling\" and I think the Academy will \"make his day\" once again by nominating Clint for Best Director. So change your plans today and allocate some time to locate \"Changeling\" at your nearest theatre. ***** Excellent",

I think that even though it was indeed a very dark and bleak film, it wasn't one which outstayed it's welcome by becoming tediously gloomy, because, besides handling the subject matter in a fashion that didn't become completely suffocating, it also compensated the darkness with a grimly bittersweet conclusion and a somewhat hopeful outlook on humanity as not being 'all bad'. In other words, the film delves deeply into the very worst aspects of human action and feeling before eventually resolving to the better, more compassionate aspects to leave us with the view that while some people are terrible, there are good people and there is hope. As Jolie's character, Christine Collins puts it in the last minutes of the film.I felt that some of the aspects of this film were so horrific and graphic that they almost touched on Horror in a way. In that way, because some of the subject matter was so gruesome and confronting, it did make it almost unbelievable. After seeing an emotionally charged, dramatic, deeply intense movie like Revolutionary Road and then seeing Changeling, I found that while the subject matter in Changeling was somewhat more horrible, it didn't affect me so much or discomfort me as much. Mostly, I think, because the events were beyond what we expect to be confronted with in a civilised society: the murder of innocent children, a police force which condones violence and terror, the abuse of a mother at her most vulnerable are all things we find almost too horrific to believe and are ones we can't really relate to unless we've been in a similar circumstance, which I hope is not the case.In saying that, the emotion was very real. The tension and unease were beautifully used to keep the audience on tenterhooks throughout the movie, always hoping that just around the corner would be Walter Collins, because we follow Christine through so much pain, fear and anguish. Despite this film's subject matter, I did enjoy it and that's not something you can often say about a film containing these sorts of events. The ending message, while certainly not a Hollywood happy ending, was one which really finished off a brilliant movie on a bittersweet, hopeful tone, but one which does not attempt to undo the horrors which unfold in this very unique and enthralling film. Jolie, by the way, was brilliant and I certainly will be keeping an eye out for her in the future to see if she can perform this well again.",

            "content": "(Spoilers Ahead) Clint Eastwood's first of two films for 2008 is a large scale story of a woman looking for her son and what happens when she collides with the the people who are suppose to be keeping the peace and protecting the innocent.Based on what is known as the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders but with some changes to the events, the film is nominally the story of Christine Collins, a single mother who's son Walter goes missing. Collins played by Angelina Jolie does everything she can to draw attention to her plight in the hopes that someone will help her find her son. When a Boy across the country turns up saying he is her son she is at first thrilled, until the boy arrives on the train and she instantly realizes that the boy isn't her own. No one will listen to her except Rev. Gustav Briegleb, played by John Malkovich. Briegleb has it in for the police and their tactics and he uses his pulpit and his radio show to take them to task. However as time goes on Mrs Collins is seen as a problem and is promptly sent to a mental institution. From there the story spins out as it comes to light that the fate of Walter may not have not a pleasant one and the plight of Christine reverberates on a larger scale.Oddly promoted to focus on the Christine Collins story which is the line through the story on which everything hangs, this is actually a much larger story than is advertised. Most of the scenes that were used to promote the film come from the first hour, during which time the focus is squarely on Jolie. The second half of the film focus's on the discovery of the murders and how that coupled with the publicity about Christine shake Los Angeles and its police force.Angelina Jolie is good, but not great as Christine Collins. I do feel for her and her plight but there are times I found the performance, like some of the first hour, rather one note. I do think the problem is not so much with Jolie rather with director Eastwood (and writer J.Michael Straczynski) who is a much too lax in the telling of the early part of the story. I found that I could guess the shots he was going to use and I knew what we'd see, say a young boy running out side the trolley. He's using clich\u00e9s to set up a complex story and it hurts the film since there are times the film doesn't feel special. Unfortunately Jolie's performance never fully recovers and its only in the final passages of the film that I think she recovers her footing.About an hour in as the story begins to move away from the Jolie story and we begin to see how larger forces are at work. First there is a dangerous killer on the loose and secondly the police begin to have to backtrack and circle the wagons to protect themselves. Its here on the larger stage that the film begins to come to life. certainly the story of Christine and her search for Walter remains the primary focus, but the story takes on larger implications which make the film very much better.The film varies from the actual story in a couple of ways which I won't get into here since that would spoil things if you haven't seen the movie.To be honest I had a hard time getting through the first hour of this film. There were moments where I cared but for the most part I kind of felt I knew where it was going. I don't blame it on knowing the story, rather I think its because, as I said earlier, most of the promotional material, clips and stills and such, all come from the first hour. Its like watching a movie after the commercial gave everything away. However once the second hour rolls around and the story begins to move away from the scenes that I had seen a dozen times before the film picks up momentum and cruises along nicely to the end.This is a good film by Eastwood and worth seeing. I don't think its one of his best films, but then again it doesn't have to be.7 ish out of 10.",

            "content": "A little boy is taken from his home in 1928. His mom enlists the LAPD to find him, and five months later they come up with a lost child. The mother quickly grasps that the kid isn't her missing son, but the LAPD will have none of it. Outraged, Christine Collins takes on the entire police department in an effort to get them to look for her son, much to the detriment of her own welfare.Oh, the arrogant LAPD! They foist a boy, obviously the wrong child, on poor Mrs. Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) and practically force her to shower affection on the kid. Then they wash their hands of the matter, even when Collins protests that the kid's not hers. This attitude gets her thrown into a women's sanitarium, because you just didn't talk back to the LAPD in 1928, especially if you were a woman. Especially if you were a single woman who was pointing out a huge mistake on the part of the LAPD.Luckily, Christine has a powerful ally, the Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who broadcasts a weekly sermon excoriating the police for corruption and other misdeeds. Briegleb is instrumental in winning Christine's release, but the battle's only just begun: the cops are still crooked, and she is still without her son.Concurrent to Christine's problems, we also follow the story of the real kidnapper and of the upper management of the LAPD. What begins as a slight cover-up on the part of the all-powerful police in order to placate a testy public and press turns into a disaster, all because Christine Collins wouldn't give up.The movie is never lacking for emotional realism. First of all, you completely empathize with Christine Collins, a woman who refuses to be a victim. Her goal isn't to bring the police department down, and it's not even to exact some kind of vengeance (which might just be a way for her to get over her son's kidnapping). Her goal is simply to get her son back.Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins and is, in a word, outstanding, and she earned a Oscar nomination for this movie. Jolie's Collins is not homely - you can't completely lose that beauty, even if you're playing a somewhat dowdy 1920s mom - but her looks don't get her anywhere in this movie. To tell the truth, her looks are never even mentioned, not even in a snide comment by the cops (\"Just sit over here, cutie, while we men take care of things\"). When Collins comes home to find her son's gone, we feel the anguish she feels. It doesn't feel forced, and we don't feel manipulated, and that's at least because of Jolie herself.One odd little complaint, though - why is everything so dark? Was the sun dimmer in 1928? Even in broad daylight, everyone seems to be half in shadows, which made me squint most of the time, thus giving me a headache. Was director Clint Eastwood trying for some kind of period moodiness? It's not needed for most of the scenes, although the mental hospital should, by definition, be poorly lit.As Christine Collins tenaciously clings to the idea that her son may still be alive, the movie also grabs a hold of your heartstrings and never lets go. But neither does Eastwood try to manipulate us toward an inevitable conclusion; he doesn't pluck those heartstrings so much as gently caress them, ambiguously leading us in multiple directions. Collins' predicament feels terrifyingly real: the aching loss of her only child and her own violent incarceration in a sadistic \"hospital.\" Changeling is frightening not only because of the blistering account of evil cops and doctors but also, and most hauntingly, because of the horrible anguish and despair Collins feels as she fights the system while maintaining her resolute belief that her boy will be found.",

The cast is good, Angelina Jolie forgetting for a moment all her sexiness and performing as a desperate mother trying to find her son, she is really good in this role, you can really feel all her sorrow throughout the film and John Malkovich as reverend Gustav Briegleb is very convincing.

Jolie was miscast, but maybe they wanted to make an action flick when the project started, had her sign up, and by mistake started working of a script for a totally different movie. It might explain the title. Or what about the irritating self awareness of John Malkovich who'd you, at any point in the movie, expect to break the rule of the 'fourth wall', look smugly into a camera and tell the audience that he's really pleased with his performance so far.Story wise: horrible, unbelievable plot turns, starting right of the bat when a seemingly intelligent woman is given the wrong boy back, her supposed son, who disappeared a few months earlier. The boy is not her son, she takes him home anyway...\u00a4\u00a4 Really? \u00a4\u00a4The story continuous with Jolie trying to explain to the world that the boy is an impostor who doesn't even match her son's height to which a dentist and a school teacher are willing to testify. Why family members, neighbors, school chums, the family physician, the baby sitter and E.T. the Extraterrestrial weren't asked to help resolve the obvious misconception on the part of the police, was conveniently left out of the tale completely. No, in stead of taking the boy into custody and resuming the search for the real son, the police keep pushing her into believing it actually is her son after which the woman finds herself in a poorly copied tale by Kafka. From this point on the movie reveals itself for what it was intended to be. An endless string of manipulative scenes drenched in an Oscar vinaigrette in both the melodramatic writing and the obnoxiously polished cinematography with a fetish-like attention to props. Some movies get Oscar nods, but this one actually nods back.I can only imagine why the livestock would hail these kinds of movies by Eastwood (Milion dollar Baby, Gran Torino) in stead of taking a blazing torch out and scream for something more authentic or at least something less hideously contrived to grace the silver screen for a change. Not to mention featuring characters that are a little more complex than those used in a Donald Duck story.I mean, it 's not like you are going to complain to the manager at the McDonald's either that everything tastes the same, is soaked in grease and that a Euro 3.20 for a sliced and fried potato with vomit sauce is perhaps a little excessive.

At two and a half hours of mostly Angelina crying some maybe put off but I urge you not to be because if you do you will miss what is essentially a great movie. Filled with shades of The Green Mile, L.A. Confidential, There Will Be Blood and even earlier Jolie outing Girl Interrupted, Eastwood weaves the plot around the cast and the city of angels but it is Jolie's performance that is not only one of her best but quite rightly tipped for an Oscar. Yes at times she over emotes but she also shows us how good an actress she can be and at several times I had forgotten it was her I was watching. The script, apparently unchanged from its first draft, is strong and gives the actors and the director plenty to work with and again deals with empathy, wrath, injustice and revenge. But directing aside it is also the cinematography that excels creating the city streets and making them look so believable for the cast to work within add to that the film stock giving that bleached, washed out effect and the 1920's have never looked so real. It's as grey as the corrupt cop's suits, which is why even the slightest hint of colour like Jolie's red lipstick really stands out. All in all the film is almost perfect; there is a slight bit that is so cheesy you may physically wince but that is a minor quibble, the plot will keep you guessing and at the hands of a master like Eastwood there is never any drag as it reaches its conclusion. Another to add to his unstoppable career and a must see movie that will no doubt be heavily talked about come Oscar time.",

            "content": "Not a remake of the 1980 horror film of the same name, nor yet a filmed version of Middleton and Rowley's Elizabethan play, this \"Changeling\" is a harrowing tale about one woman's struggle against police corruption in 1920s Los Angeles. Her quest for the truth is made doubly difficult by the fact that her young son has gone missing, and the police investigating what has happened to him are not conducting the search properly. This is a film about sensitive issues, dealt with tastefully throughout particularly during some of the more harrowing moments (which could so easily have been sensationalised).Single mum Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) lives in the suburbs and works at a telephone exchange in the city. One day she has to work an extra shift and is obliged to leave her son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) at home. It is the last time she ever sees him. Upon returning, Walter has gone missing provoking Christine to turn to the police to find him and bring him home. Several months later, Christine is notified that a young boy matching Walter's description has been found. But when she is reunited with the boy she remains adamant that he is not her son. Already under intense criticism from the public, the police cannot afford another embarrassment, so they continually reject Christine's claims. In particular, Captain Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) takes great pains to convince her she is mistaken. When he cannot silence her, Jones has her shipped off to a cruel mental asylum where she can bother the police no longer. Then, out of the blue, honest policeman Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) discovers the remains of a bunch of murdered children, victims of a demented serial killer (James Butler Harner). The police learn that, through their own neglect, ineptitude and misconduct, they may have wasted precious time lying to Christine Collins while her son became the latest victim of this psychopathic madman\u0085..Jolie is outstanding in this film, playing down her sexy image to give a very moving and heartfelt performance that is a million miles from the Lara Croft persona. Indeed the whole cast are excellent in \"Changeling\", particularly Harner's creepy child murderer and Donovan as the dirty cop who wants to wash his hands of Christine's problems. The film is deliberately paced and builds to a powerful climax, in which emotions of despair are tinged with a grain of hope. Perhaps one could argue that the film has too many climaxes, for it takes several scenes spread over the best part of 25 minutes for all the loose ends to be tied up. However, one does come away from the film feeling that the subject matter has been treated with the thoroughness and sensitivity it deserves by director Eastwood and writer J. Michael Straczynski. \"Changeling\" is a disturbing, powerful and worthy piece of cinema.",

Also there was nothing demure about her trademark full lips painted red throughout the entire movie. Those lips would have been downright obscene in 1928. So Joliee spends the entire film mousing around trying to convince the police that the imposter boy was not her son. They tell her she's crazy and toss her in the loony bin. During this entire time Joilees character is acting like a damsel in distress. Then towards the end of the movie she visits the guy who is accused of killing her son, and commences to kicking his butt in prison like she is Evelyn Salt! Um I know Clint Eastwood is pushing 100 but did his Alzheimers kick in or something? Malkovich only knows one thing and that's how to play himself. One a director casts him they should know they will be getting a very one dimensional actor. Well can't really call it acting if you're playing yourself.

            "content": "CHANGELING\u0085 9.5/10 Almost a year after Clint Eastwood's Changeling premiered at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival I finally saw it and I saw it exactly on 11 March 2009, I saw it one day after another anniversary (the number 81) of the disappearing of Christine Collins' son Walter Collins, certainly it took place on 10 March 1928. As you know Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins (for me her very best performance so far) and the story begins on 9 March 1928, everything is normal, Christine and her young son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) are going to see a movie next day, maybe the new Charles Chaplin movie but for something the plan can't go on, Christine has go out and then happens, a tragedy and is just the beginning. There will be justice, hope but for once we have nothing but a damn perfect time for all of those corrupts. Let's see, woman's son disappears, some months after if you have the chance why not bring an abandoned child who says his name is Walter Collins and say that finally Christine will meet again with her son but how act when Christine will say that his son is still missing, well is kind of easy, say that after months a child certainly changes and stuff. So now this case is over, you must act like just the f****** bastard you are and every time Christine argues that the boy you brought is not Walter well just say to her stuff like \"so you were just fine alone, you liked it and now that your son is back you don't like it anymore, now you just don't want responsibilities\".So meanwhile people think that Christine is finally again with her son she will go with people that knew Walter, there's no doubt but certainly the kid that the police brought as Walter calls her mom, the corrupts thought that for Christine would be enough that any kid call her mother to forget about her son? Of course not but they certainly will have all under control so Christine can come and denounce that the police made a mistake and that they should be trying to find her son and stuff but the irresponsible mother will be her, the one who will go direct to the psychopathic ward. And inside the hospital we have a typical part, typical in the way that Christine must admit that she was wrong and that the boy the police brought is her son otherwise she will basically die there. And is all pretty well clear and all the women that are there because of a problem in which a police officer was the guilty know what will happen if they fight and of course Christine will fight. On the other hand there's this case that certainly has nothing related with the case of Christine's missing son, a simple case of a Canadian boy who has to be deported. So we meet another young boy of the four in the film and again when this Canadian boy talks he certainly don't know if what he is saying will be relevant in the case of Walter Collins however it will be and it will bring some justice, some satisfying moments. Certainly this film is a difficult one in the way that it begins and we have a missing child, certainly the pain of the mother only to meet those corrupts and to see how Christine's life is in danger. But certainly what the Canadian boy says is just as hopeless as horrible, as unbelievable as real. The film's last part is full of justice with answers yet for Christine is not time to stop thinking that his son is still alive somewhere, certainly for some moments we and the people near Christine, John Malkovich's character Rev. Gustav A. Briegleb, wish resignation. Certainly there are not enough proves to confirm that Walter Collins was one of the many children that were brutally murdered by Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) and his nephew Sanford Clark (Eddie Alderson), the Canadian boy, but is just very difficult to think that Walter was not one of those children. The killer Gordon Northcott says to Christine that he didn't murdered Walter and at one point near, the day in which Gordon will be hung from neck until dead, Gordon requests that Christine travels to see him since he will say the truth about what happened with Walter, certainly whatever is the confession of Gordon will bring some peace to Christine yet this won't happen until years after Gordon's execution when we meet the last of the four young boys in the film, there will be hope. A magnificent cast (not only Jolie but Malkovich, Jeffrey Donovan as one of the corrupt bastards, Harner and Michael Kelly, as a fine police detective, are simply fantastic), long but never boring or uninteresting, Changeling is a true piece of work and is together with Mystic River (first place) and Letters from Iwo Jima my favourite Clint Eastwood film from this decade yet I have still to see Flags of Our Fathers and Gran Torino (that will be released in my city on 27 March 2009).",

However the mother quickly realised the patchwork by the police and goes on a fervent hunt to find her son stopping at nothing until she gets answers. Along the way she is declared insane and put into a psychiatric ward; she meets a priest who helps her fight injustice and corruption by expressing his anger in a variety of ways, including through his own radio show. The plot is easy to follow, with great twists and turns by Eastwood along the way.Angelina Jolie provides a stern and powerful performance, guaranteed to lead the way in the Best Actress category at next year's Golden Globes and the coveted Academy Awards.

Sometimes I downright dislike them. This isn't one I disliked. I rather did like it. In fact, it's my favorite Eastwood-directed film since Mystic River. I think it's a lot less flawed than Million Dollar Baby, and a lot less lifeless than his two WWII films from a couple years back. Angelina Jolie plays a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles. One day, when she is forced to work overtime, her nine year old son disappears. After a five month investigation, the police find and return her son \u2013 only it's not her son. In fact, it's another boy who looks somewhat similar, but he's three inches shorter and circumcized. Most of the film follows Jolie's desperate and futile attempts to fight the police force, who refuse to accept her story. The film is based on a true story, one that dragged out for quite a while. I think a lot of critics felt that the film is poorly paced because of this, but I thought screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski did an admirable job of keeping it moving. Jolie is fantastic. I also very much liked Jeffrey Donovan as the corrupt police captain. On the other hand, I thought Jason Butler Harner overplayed his role.

Not because it shows a serial killer in his true flesh and in his death sentence, right to the last drop of his last moment. Not because it is using some extremely good actors. Not even because it shows a lost picture of Los Angeles, even if there are a few flaws in that vision. But definitely because Clint Eastwood is trying to tell us an allegory, a tale that is a metaphor reflection of the world at this very crucial moment we are living today in 2008. Then the film is so brutally true and cruelly prophetic that it becomes so bright and hot that we can only close our eyes and wonder if we are able to survive what is coming. When the world is nose-diving into depression, financial or other, due to the total selfish greed of a few and the absolute blindness of most, when the world is in the hands of people who think what they think, no matter what it is, is true and that all those who may even in shy words question their truth are mad and must be gotten away in some kind of camp beyond the protection of the law, when those who are self-righteously proclaiming their absolute truth and reason and logic and divine embodiment and inspiration, then there is no recourse at all, or that is not really an option because you have to survive first. And there Clint Eastwood rises over that chasm, that chaos produced and egotistically nourished and enjoyed by the powerful of this world, and he raises the question of how can we raise the alarm, how can we stop the paranoid schizophrenia of these megalomaniac tyrants, how can we get back on track. Where can we find the energy to start a new deal of the cards? How can we finish a struggle or a fight we did not even start and we have to finish it for sure. The n you have to go and watch the film and just see that Ms. Christine Collins concludes it with a fight to the finish, of yes she can, and her last word that sounds like a call to some badge of courage, that last word we have seen and heard so often lately, HOPE. Yes we can enjoy that HOPE even if we know it will not be satisfied, at least entirely. We can enjoy it because HOPE is in our hearts, is a feeling shared with millions, when it is shared with millions. It is amazing how Clint Eastwood has captured the atmosphere of this historical period so well.

One of the trademarks of Eastwood is the slow delivery, but this shouldn't be confused with a movie that is boring. The pace of the movie gives you time to empathise with the characters and consider the events that are unfolding.I don't know how well known this story is in America, but it isn't something I was familiar with. I'm not sure how much artistic license was taken, but it is based on the true story of a 1928 child abduction in LA. Angelina Jolie plays Christine Collins who is the unfortunate Mother. I watched the story unfold with amazement as the trials and tribulations of Christine are played out on the big screen. This is a fine performance by Jolie although I think it's also fair to say that this must have been a fairly prized role for actresses around the world. I for one certainly wouldn't be surprised if she nabs the Oscar for it.The film is quite a tough watch at times and there's very little feel good factor. Probably not for the adrenalin junkies or a first date, but a great film for those who love character based films or real life tales. Definitely one of the top movies of 2008.",

Angelina Jolie is good in the role of Christine Collins, even though I find it hard to look at her blown up lips. John Malkovic and Jeff Donovan (Officer Johnson) were also good, though I couldn't find Donovan's name in the IMDb character list.I was a little annoyed as the movie seemed to go on and on but then I understood why Clint Eastwood wanted to finish the story.

            "content": "When Christine Collins' (Jolie) son goes missing, she waits for months and when receiving a phone call her life is changed by a boy claiming to be her son.This is the reason Angelina Jolie is famous. Forget all the rubbish in OK magazine and remember her acting career. Oscar performance in Girl, Interrupted aside, this is a sublime piece of acting and her finest to date. Jolie makes her character passionate, determined and opinionated and one of the most memorable mothers of 2008. An Oscar should be on the cards. Her performance was so good she made my arm shiver in a roasting cinema. Not only is Collins a memorable protagonist, she is a beacon of hope, she never gives in and presents herself in the face of adversary. Outstanding.The supporting cast of Malkovich, Donovan, Griffith, Conti and a particular terrifying turn by Jason Butler Harner help make this a solid cast in a solid consistent drama.Based on a true story, Clint Eastwood brings the dramatic events of 1928 alive with a simple but highly effective use of direction. The high shots and slow moving sequences help cement the story to the gritty ground.This film isn't afraid to tell it like it is with a sharp depiction of mental hospitals, electric execution scenes and a shivering concept of murder.The costume design and settings help depict the time the narrative is based. Juxtaposed with the issue driven storyline and you are watching a sharp and dramatic period film that makes you feel as though you are right there in the heart of all the controversy.The issues regarding the representation of the police are unbelievably articulate. Not only does this film raise a valid point about how the force went about their business, it is written in such a way that is entertaining and exciting, and this is a period drama which turns into a gritty crime thriller come the end.Changeling is a fine representation of the late 1920s which is helped by a fine central performance, a realistic and dramatic narrative that makes you think about law and the way lives were lived 80 years ago, and a consistent sophisticated style of direction by Eastwood, who is becoming a legend behind the screen as well as in front. All praise Clint Eastwood.",

            "content": "\"Changeling\" is a story of a woman's search for her missing son and the outrageous treatment that she's subjected to by the deeply corrupt LAPD. The events depicted (which take place in late 1920s L.A.) are inherently shocking, touching and bizarre but also make a huge impact because this is a true story that illustrates how the actions of corrupt police officers, politicians and medical professionals can cause incredible suffering to an innocent victim of crime at a time when they're feeling at their most vulnerable. The scandalous nature of the story and its human dimension make it utterly compelling from start to finish but probably the movie's greatest achievement is the measured way in which the action's delivered and the fact that it avoids any tasteless sensationalism or unnecessary sentimentality.Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a working-class, single mother whose son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) goes missing one Saturday while she's at work. After searching her neighbourhood, she reports the disappearance to the LAPD whose unhelpful and insensitive response only adds to her distress. After five months have elapsed, she receives the good news that her son has been found in Illinois and a reunion is arranged at a nearby train station. Police Captain J. J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) invites a crowd of press reporters to witness the event so that he can gain some positive publicity to try to improve the LAPD's tarnished image but Christine's joy soon turns to disappointment when she sees that the boy at the station is not her son. She feels intimidated by the position she's been put in and so, reluctantly gives in when Captain Jones forcefully insists that she should look after the boy.At home, Christine soon recognises that the boy who's been put into her care is actually 3 inches shorter than Walter and (unlike her son) is circumcised, but a doctor appointed by Captain Jones assures her that there are sound reasons why these changes may have happened. More compelling evidence from Walter's dental records, his teacher and his classmates again reinforce the assertion that the boy found by the police is an impostor but when Christine confronts Captain Jones on the issue, he arranges for her to be placed in a mental institution where she's humiliated and medicated and told that she'll never be released until she agrees to sign a document to say that the boy in her care is Walter.Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) is sent to Wineville, Riverside County to apprehend a 15-year-old Canadian boy called Sandford Clark (Eddie Alderson) who's in the country illegally. When Clark tells the detective about his forced involvement in a series of killings involving 20 victims who were all young boys, it leads to the arrest of ranch owner Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) and the strong likelihood that Walter was one of the victims.The Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) is a local preacher who regularly uses the pulpit and his radio broadcasts to criticise the LAPD's conduct and since the time he'd first heard about Christine's plight had consistently supported her. When he discovers that she's being held in a mental institution, he quickly finds a way to secure her release. A city council hearing into Christine's case and the trial of Gordon Northcott are then held concurrently and produce some extremely important and far-reaching outcomes.Angelina Jolie portrays Christine's anguish, determination and growing strength very powerfully in a performance that's incredibly subtle and very affecting and although the quality of the acting is consistently good throughout this movie, the contributions of John Malkovich and Jeffrey Donovan really stand out.\"Changeling\" is a beautifully photographed movie and Clint Eastwood's straightforward style of direction adds great clarity to its rather involved story. An unsettling mood prevails throughout and is very effectively enhanced by the use of a haunting piano score, an interesting colour palette and the presence of numerous shadowy interiors. \"Changeling\" is unquestionably a work of great substance that's also very moving and totally unforgettable.",

            "content": "A \"changeling\" in European folklore is an elf or other enchanted entity that is secretly left in the stead of an abducted child. Director Clint Eastwood takes this legend and applies the name to the 1928 case of Los Angeles woman whose boy went missing one day and another boy was returned to her. Incredible as it may sound, this is supposed to be a true story.Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a single mom working as a supervisor in a telephone service. One day in March 1928 she came home from work to discover her son Walter missing. A few months later, the L.A. police return another boy to her who is clearly not her son. Despite her repeated protests (and I mean REPEATED), the police, specifically Capt. J.J. Jones (sinisterly played by Jeffrey Donovan) do not believe her and even put her in a mental institution! While this was going on, Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) stumbles upon a house where grisly murders of boys have been committed. This child murderer Gordon Northcutt (disturbingly played by Jason Butler Harner)would randomly pick up boys on the street, keep them in a chicken coop and mercilessly hacks them to death. An unwilling accomplice confessed to the crimes and identified Walter Collins as among the kids they had abducted.Now for me everything else after this point, I felt the movie lost its focus. Instead of ending it right there, it still went on to depict in detail the murderer's escape to Canada, his capture there, the extensive trials (two simultaneous cases vs. Northcutt, AND vs. the LAPD), his fruitless audience with Christine before his execution and his hanging (complete with his spooky singing of \"Silent Night\")! Not being satisfied with that, the movie even fast forwarded to five more years ahead, when a boy suddenly returned and revealed that he was among the kids abducted by Northcutt. He said that he remembered Walter, and that Walter was also able to escape. However, the movie ended with Christine still not being reunited with Walter at all.As a result, the movie really felt very long. There were so many scenes that felt repetitive and unnecessary in the telling of the story. And I have not even mentioned the part of John Malkovich! I felt that Eastwood tried to milk everything out of this story, much to the detriment of the story telling.Fortunately, the acting performance of star Angelina Jolie, upon whom the entire movie hinged, was sincere. She was very good in conveying subtleties of emotions required of her persecuted character. Her very heavy eye and lip make-up may be a bit too distracting at times to the drama, but otherwise, she was spot on. She deserves her Oscar nomination, along with the Academy citations for Art Direction and Cinematography that this film has earned.",

            "content": "Changeling\" is almost what the trailers reveal; a woman (Angelina Jolie) comes home one day from work and finds that her son is missing. Several months later, he is found by the LAPD, but the boy is not her kid. When she tells the police that the kid is not her son, they say she's crazy and then she is tossed into a mental institution. This though is only a thin slice of the cake. The film is a study of the 1920s on police corruption as well as ties in a disturbing true event that happened in California around this time period. Clint Eastwood captures this era wonderfully with the aid of authentic set designs and a muted color tone, (which reminds me much of Conrad L. Hall's cinematography for \"Road to Perdition\"), which also aids much depth to the look of the time period as well as the dark mood of the story.The performances give a certain illumination to the film, bringing it to life. Of all the movies I have seen, Angelina Jolie gives her best performance that is definitely not shy of an Oscar. She was very engaging and believable, enough for me to feel her character's anguish. John Malkovich also gives a noteworthy performance as the local activist Gustav Briegleb. More great additions come from the children actors. I always find most child actors to be either too rehearsed or just plain bad, but all of them in this movie were very moving and captivating in their roles.The other genius in this film is Clint's direction. I always found him a better director than actor, and he definitely proves that in this film, particularly when it comes to capturing emotion. I won't give away the ending, but I have to mention that one of the most brilliantly directed scenes in this movie is the execution scene. To make the tension believable, he uses a lot of POV shots on the man who is about to be hanged as well as with the victim's family members, which not only drags out the scene to build the suspense, but it also builds emotion. Even though the guy who is about to be hanged is evil, I still feel pity for him. Not many directors could do this, but Clint pulls it off magnificently. The only problem I had with this movie was the pace. The first hour and a half is pretty good, but the remaining forty-five minutes just seemed drawn out and lifeless. The conclusion is inevitable, but in my theater seat I felt it should just get there quicker. Overall, this masterwork by Clint Eastwood has potential for some Oscar recognition.",

Angelina Jolie does an excellent job as the mother of an abducted child, who goes through a gruelling effort to find out the truth as to what happened. In the attempt to get justice, she has to fight the City and the police force. The movie portrays the period with sets that give us a look at the times. We see the craftsman bungalows in her neighbourhood, the streetcars, the switchboard operators she supervises so the viewer gets a visual treat of the period as well as the story with its multi-layered plot. One can sense the frustration and heartbreak she encounters with the authorities as she tries to penetrate the corruption and cover-up from people protecting their own vice and evil-doing. The acting is good among a cross section of characters. The sets might be criticized for being too perfect and highly sanitized but this is a small complaint, given the positives of the movie. On another note, some of the cruelty in the film may not be to everyone's liking. It is certainly felt by the audience, although not altogether graphic.

            "content": "There's been a lot of talk about Clint Eastwood, from his early, iconic screen characters through his ups and downs and into his latter career, turning into one of America's best filmmakers. And for all the talk, he really lives up to it and delivers once again. Since 2003's 'Mystic River' the now 79-year old has been on a terrific winning streak, pulling out a double-wham in 2008 with the surprisingly multi-genre 'Changeling' and the harsh, gun-wielding but oh-so-soulful 'Gran Torino'. And for what I know he's shooting a new movie about Nelson Mandela, and let's hope he'll just go on and on, because right now he is making himself one of the most memorable film directors of all time.'Changeling' seemed at first simplistic, obviously mysterious and obviously draining with Angelina Jolie (as Christine Collins) crying her heart out over her disappeared son. But I soon learned that Eastwood and screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski had some unpredictable and hidden tricks up their sleeve. The emotional core (in which the theatrical trailer so boisterously showed) is draining and not shy of coming upfront, there's several page-turnings throughout that keeps Angie's performance natural and vivid. And although the heartfelt stories of both 'Mystic River' and 'Million Dollar Baby' had eyebrow-raising power in its tenderness of the main characters, 'Changeling' takes a different path. The movie quickly develops, not forgetting its spine, but painting roads that gave hints of noir, pure crime-thriller, melodrama (off course) and even horror. Jolie, at the center, gives a great performance loaded with a series of unfortunate events, whether at close-ups in heavy makeup and red-hot-lipstick or fading into the big portrait of City of Angels (fabulously shot by Tom Stern), she can hold this spectacle of corruption, lies, greed, hope & loss together with impressive strength.It's great casting (Jolie is daring and brings down the house, Malkovich feels odd but interesting as a priest-gone-crusader, and among others, Michael Kelly, Gattlin Griffith (as the gone baby gone Walter Collins), Colm Feore and Amy Ryan), the production and costume design brings further depths to characters and environments, and the music by Clint himself is classicism at times, but is full of life.Jolie/Christine going down an almost hopeless line gets needful help by Reveran Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) who preaches that it has become his mission in life to bring down the LAPD. Malkvovich becomes a fresh breath of air, he steps into this with a detective's attitude into slashing the corrupt police down, and becoming a helpful friend in Christine Collins' dog days. And with such a multi-layered film, there will off course pop up several, interesting characters that adds new sides of the story, as in any classic film-noir crime. But ops, be sure not to stamp it, the film's loose and so is Eastwood, never loosing momentum and always have a keen eye on holding the thrills tight, showing a new, but knowingly dark, side of himself, and doing it brilliantly.",

Screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski really stacks the deck against our heroine, with only a Presbyterian minister (and the audience) on her side. With so many villains (corrupt, uncaring, and unfeeling) peopling the cast, one is apt to feel as beaten down as Angelina Jolie's Christine Collins. Producer-director Clint Eastwood feels for her but spares us none of the horrors of her nightmare, which dragged on for years, culminating in two different legal trials (which appear to be happening at the same time). Jolie's acting is finely measured, well-considered, and emotionally felt, however the supporting performances are wildly uneven. From John Malkovich's super-superior Reverend Briegleb to Jeffrey Donovan's maddeningly condescending police chief, everyone seems to have stepped out of an old horror flick. Eastwood isn't subtle--nor does his final edit exhibit brevity--but he knows how to pack a punch when it's called for, and his film has many powerful moments. It certainly looks good, which helps compensate for the over-length, and it's satisfying to a certain degree...yet the picture isn't a rich, engrossing entertainment.

            "content": "As with many of Eastwood's other films, Changeling doesn't hold anything back, emotionally or thematically. Eastwood really bares his teeth here, and delivers as disturbing, frustrating, and aggravating a movie as any of his others. The story on display here, from an original screenplay by TV scribe J. Michael Straczynski, is shocking, infuriating and emotionally draining, and the fact that it's based on a true story lends it even more weight. As I mentioned already, Eastwood really doesn't hold anything back and the first half of the film, during which the protagonist undergoes a series of grueling, torturous events that she is powerless to fight against or to resist, including a stubborn and useless police force, lack of support from any authority figure (at least at first), and her eventual involuntary commitment into an insane asylum even though she is perfectly sane \u0096 and if anyone has read anything about insane asylums in the 1920's, they'll know that it wasn't a pretty sight.Uncharacteristically of Eastwood's films, which for the most part are inescapably bleak and offer no form of solace, with the second half of Changeling Eastwood offers us a beacon of hope that well-deserved justice has been served. I won't say that in the end the film is a \"feel-good\" movie, because everything leading up to its final act is, in accordance with Eastwood's previous body of work, inescapably bleak and depressing, but Eastwood does provide us with a form of dramatic closure that is rare in his recent body of work.Like all of Eastwood's films, in particular his recent ones, the film looks absolutely stunning; Eastwood shoots in the broad 2.35:1 aspect ratio, not often used in these dramas, and takes full advantage of the breadth it offers him. His cinematography is stark and striking, often utilizing one strong source of light and creating a very chiaroscuro, high-contrast look that really looks absolutely great. Production value is also top notch, and Eastwood captures every little detail of 1920's Los Angeles period with utmost care and attention. The film is also accompanied by a repetitive but very effective score by Eastwood himself that emphasizes the compliments the story and the drama with perfection.Unlike previous films like Unforgiven, Mystic River or Million Dollar Baby, Changeling's cast is for the most part composed of unknowns or character actors. Its only really has two big \"name\" actors, but both of them deliver such strong work that it really makes up for it. John Malkovich has a medium-sized supporting role and is as good as ever, perhaps angrier than usual but overall more strong work from the legend. But at the center of the film is the main performance: Angelina Jolie portrays the protagonist who is on screen throughout pretty much the entire movie, and delivers a performance so incredible, so powerful, so commanding and yet so subdued, so with such presence but also with such restraint and submission, that it really amazes me that there are still people out there that doubt her skills and abilities as an actress. Sure, she won the Oscar for her supporting role in Girl, Interrupted, but that was mostly for show; last year she delivered a far more accomplished and absolutely stunning performance in A Mighty Heart that was for the most part unjustly overlooked; hopefully she'll get her due this year for her amazing, incredible performance in Changeling. It's the best performance of her career, and one of the strongest leading female performances of the year.Overall, Changeling is an exquisitely accomplished drama: It tells a fascinating true story that is compelling to follow, and yet, Eastwood treats it far less like a mystery thriller as one would expect and far more as an in-depth character drama. Eastwood holds no emotion back and lets us feel a wide variety of emotions, from anger to frustration to hopelessness to sympathy, and Angelina Jolie, in the best show of her career, delivers a truly amazing, incredibly well-acted performance, playing her small character with such introverted restraint that it just emphasizes her presence in the film even more. I fail to understand how so many critics were emotionally detached from this film, as I felt it very hard to remain aloof in front of the film's deep emotions. Its mixed critical reaction renders it, in my opinion, as one of the more underrated movies of the year. In the end, Eastwood and co. deliver a fascinating, emotional melodrama while managing to skip over the melodrama and elevate the film to subtler, more naturalistic place.",

            "content": "Life can be an inspiration for fiction but the artist who uses it must adapt it to tell a story of importance. There must be a beginning, an end and there must be a reason to tell.In this, almost I would say worst movie ever, there is none. Yes, there is a beginning and an end, but they do not seem related and everything that happens in between happens for almost no reason at all. Just like in life, one could say, but that was clearly not the message of the makers.No, they had to tell about... a woman losing a child and getting another one back. OK, might be interesting. But not if the woman's only reaction is to scream: \"I want my son! This is not my son!\" (And that about twenty-four times.) Then it's improvisation by amateur theater players. Not if the bad men are just bad men, no dimension, no nuance, just cruel and evil.The script goes nowhere, does not know what to tell, and the heroine, the unbelievable bad acting Jolie, does not once take action. She is constantly invited by others to do anything.The change from a 'give me back my son'-theme to a 'evil guy abducts little boys and slaughters them for his pleasure'-theme is made with no preparation, and the themes have nothing to do with each other. So, at once there are two stories to tell. Follows the 'psychiatry in the 20's was a fraud'-theme, with bad bad doctor man and evil sister woman. And, oh yes, the good hooker for good measure.The last half hour adds nothing. Why do we get 10 minutes of hanging the crazy boy killer? The last scenes are good, but just because of the little boy and his mother, two sincerely played roles. The onlooking Jolie does what she does the whole film: get out the emotion and then repress it. A weak technique by a weak actress. (Oh, and of course, the hand to the mouth, another brilliant technique.) Malkovich is talking so unclear that you wonder if that was his revenge to be cast in this one penny melodrama.Accompanied by music seeming to be made for a burial services commercial, this is an example of how a true story is not a story. Not if you don't have any clue what to tell and just tell everything: and then you get, instead of a possible sandcastle, a pile of mud.",

            "content": "Christine Collins is called in to work on her day off. She leaves her son at home and promises to take him out tomorrow to make it up to him. When she returns, he is missing, nowhere to be found. 5 months later the LAPD claim to have found him, but when they present the boy to Christine, she refuses him, saying he is not her son. Instead of making the department look embarrassed and admit failure, they throw her in a mental institution.What makes Changeling even more depressing is that this is all based on true events.Eastwood has yet another winner under his belt with Changeling. Some might find it a hard film to enjoy, but I was engaged throughout, due to the performances, art direction, story and Eastwood's talented directing. It's Eastwood's eye to detail that brings this 1920's era to life. I was really impressed with the design of this film and it felt completely real to me. From the set design to the costume design. Normally you can see through the fabric and know that it was made for the film, but here it simply fits.A lot of the film rests on the shoulders of Angelina Jolie, as the mother of the lost child. I believed her in this role. Her eyes do most of the acting, subtle and honest. Yet at times her overbearing yelling distracts. At first it's believable, but near the end it seems more of the same and irritating at times. It's a strong enough performances to garner attention from Award ceremonies. On the supporting side is John Malkovich, who kicks all kinds of ass without doing much. His presence is enough to make you cheer. He is in command and you can tell by simply listening to his tone of voice. Colm Feore is someone you can count on to play any man with questionable morals. It's all in his face, perfectly cast here as the Chief of police. I have to say that a weak link in the acting is Jeffrey Donovan. I enjoyed him to a degree, but his voice/accent is just too annoying to get use to. I squirmed in my seat a couple of times, not from his characters actions, but from the accent.One person to watch for here is Jason Butler Harner, who plays a serial killer. He takes a slightly different approach to the subject matter. He isn't too crazy, he isn't too weird, he's a mix of both. But what makes it a more horrifying performance is that he is human. We are not seeing Hannibal Lector up on the screen, we are seeing a human being. I wouldn't be surprised if a Supporting Acting nod went in his direction. Also, Amy Ryan makes a small appearance, nothing too big, but her scenes are well enough to make a mention of.The story is strong, and it is strengthened by the fact that it is based on a true story. If it were fabricated, then the emotion might not have been there, at least not as much as what this film delivers. Jolie delivers a performance that is heart wrenching, at times, and it is heightened by that small little fact that someone in this world went through those emotions, those barriers and heartaches.Yes, this film is depressing. Eastwood knows it, and uses it to his advantage. Throughout the entire film I found myself just wanting to punch some people in the face, to yell at them and help Jolie in her cause to get her son back. Malkovich does this for the audience, which is why I think his character kicks ass. He does what we as the audience want to do. The tension in this film is high, not from thrills, but from the horrible things that these characters do to Jolie. She stands her ground, we cheer, and they throw more rocks at her, we tense up. Great flow for this film.Although, with all it's greatness, it does have a weakness. It's too freaking long. I thought the film was going to end, then it went on for another 20 minutes. I think with a bit more editing and tightening up, you can easily shave off those 20 minutes. Even though I was entertained and engaged in the last little bit of the film, mostly the trial and the bits in between the trial, I couldn't help but think that the film should wrap up soon. Real soon.Much like Eastwood's Oscar baby, Mystic River, Changeling deals with a missing child. Only this time it's the feminine aspect and the time period is drastically different. The film is strong enough to stand as one of his better works and if it were a bit tighter and shorter...I might have been able to call it a masterpiece.Too bad.",

            "content": "No need to recap the plot. The movie's a superbly woven screenplay that rivets interest for full two-hours plus. I've read accounts of Northcott's killings, which the screenplay follows factually, but in a very general sense. However, I wish I knew how many of the aspersions cast on the LAPD and city government are true. The script is pretty unsparing in it's portrayal of official misdeeds. So I'm really curious. Then there's that psychiatric hospital where if you're not unhinged going in you will be coming out. Apparently that's where the authorities sent people in need of help. Thus, thanks to officialdom, it seems Christine (Jolie) has no chance of either finding her boy or surviving the experience.As a result, what starts out as a missing boy mystery turns really into an expose of LA government and related institutions. That the two themes are interwoven so effectively is a real tribute to scenarist Straczynski.Also, it looks like producer Eastwood spared little expense recreating 20's fashions and street scenes. These help lend flavor to the proceedings. Then too, I really love the cloche hats the ladies wear. And check out all those black flivvers cruising around town. I guess only jokers went into the showroom asking for a black one. In terms of cast, wisely they are largely unknowns except for Jolie and Malkovich. As a result, we're not distracted by name players in supporting roles, which allows the storyline to remain uppermost. Also, actor Harner (Northcott) strongly resembles pictures I've seen of the real serial killer. Kudos to Jolie for a carefully calibrated turn without milking the part. Likely the temptation was there given the mother's emotional strain. And big time kudos to Eastwood for assembling a crew that turns difficult material into a compelling gem.",

            "review_title": "A powerful, harrowing true story which makes your blood boil",
            "content": "Having overcome my reluctance to watch this movie (as I thought it would be profoundly depressing), I must say how rewarding and informative it was. Based on a true story of a mum (Christine Collins, played by Angelina Jolie) who is convinced to work on her day off, leaving her young son (Walter Collins, played by Gattlin Griffith) at home, alone, only to return later that night to find him missing. The rest of the story is an absolute nightmare. Christine must deal with a corrupt police force which is more interested in good press than good outcomes for victims of crime.Set in 1920's Los Angeles, attention to period detail is excellent, it seems to me. One of the ways that this movie is informative is in how it shows Los Angeles to be a spitting image of those present day, corrupt South American cities where the only thing worse than gang violence is...police violence. The revelations about police conduct in this era is jaw-dropping. Other revelations about civil institutions are also frightening.The cast in this movie is uniformly strong and effective. One of my reasons for being reluctant to see this movie was seeing excerpts on movie review shows on TV where John Malkovich's character, Rev. Gustav A. Briegleb was shown. He seemed really weird in excerpts, but watching the movie, he comes across a lot better, being a staunch ally of Christine in her dealings with the L.A.P.D.In the header, I mentioned that this is a movie which makes your blood boil. The main reason for that is just glimpsing how the city's powerful and elites function. Of course, your blood can boil so much that you don't give credit to the actors who push all your buttons and make you fume with outrage. Actors like Jeffrey Donovan, who plays Capt. J.J. Jones, and Colm Feore, who plays Chief James E. Davis. Other sundry characters who Christine encounters are similarly infuriating. As someone who lives in somewhat more enlightened times than Christine did, it's shocking to see how her case was handled, back in the day.Captain J.Jones is perhaps the most ghastly specimen of humanity in the movie. He is so narcissistic and selfish that his own incompetence (at best) does not register with him. It's doubtful I've ever seen a character who is more of a man-child than him.My blood hasn't boiled this much since I saw \"Capturing the Friedmans\", a docu which also deals in crime and justice. The subject of that docu is morally ambivalent in a way in which Christine Collins isn't, but the conduct of the police against him is just as troublesome. There is also a brilliant Australian mini-series with similar themes of crime and justice in \"Through my eyes\", which was also based on a true story.No doubt the facts of the story have been embellished and even fabricated no doubt, to increase the drama, but I have no doubt that the real facts of the case are sufficient for a powerful movie. It would be a pity if some fabrications have been made in order to make the Collins' family seem more heroic than they actually were-I do not think that they would be lesser subjects for a movie if they hadn't done half of what they are depicted of doing in this movie.Director Clint Eastwood has another movie out around the same time as this one, \"Gran Torino\". \"Changeling\" is the superior movie in my view...\"Gran Torino\" is just average. Am not sure if \"Changeling\" was up for Academy Awards in 2008-if it was released in time for that year's awards, I feel that it was definitely a contender for \"Best Picture\" amongst other awards. If it was released after the cut-off date for that year's awards, then I feel that it must be a contender for \"Best Picture\" in 2009, along with \"Watchmen\".Although the movie does not go into the ultimate fate of the 'changeling' of the title, the last we see of him just increases the number of unanswered questions the movie raises. A post-script to this aspect of the movie would have been appreciated. A meeting between Christine and a man with knowledge of her son's fate also seemed a proper subject for a footnote...I mean, I'm not sure that this meeting really took place, so this man's story could have been dealt with by a post-script to the story.A great movie.",

When an LAPD captain, Captain J. J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan), presented a similar looking boy to Christine claiming that the LAPD found her son, she was more than a little disappointed. The boy they'd found was not her son, but to save face they forced the boy upon her and told her she was mistaken. She would continue to fight the LAPD even though the odds were stacked heavily against her.\"Changeling\" is one of those movies that wants to make you angry and succeeds, unlike many movies that make you angry for all the wrong reasons. You want to scream, shout, and fight for Christine Collins, particularly because her character is so mild mannered. She was a mild-mannered single woman opposing the force of the entire LAPD which was allowed to act with impunity, what chance did she really have? \"Changeling\" showed what chances she had and just what the LAPD would do to keep a squeaky wheel quiet.",

            "content": "Chageling is a wonderful film; a harrowing scenario stretched agonisingly out to two and a bit hours without a moment that is ever really without either fear, hope, pain or anything particularly uninteresting. It's a tale of dedication; of facing one's fear and truly persisting in what you know is just, even if everyone else seems to think otherwise. And boy, do a lot of supporting characters think otherwise; continuously trying to beat the lead back down, a pounding into submission; an assault on the emotions; a dangling of the proverbial carrot in front of them with the promise of their old life back, plus one thing that wasn't there before filling in for something that now isn't. Freedom and 'normality' is so close, yet justice and the righteous scenario is so far away.The film is effortless; effortless in its progression from an everyday mother and son; to a disappearance; to a re-appearance; to a might-be study of madness; to the dedication of a detective and then onto the harrowing conclusion. You'll get angry; you'll feel sad; you'll feel frustrated, only not at the film itself, before settling with an emotion that is somewhere in between everything: a sort of acceptance. The lead is Christine Collins (Jolie), a supervisor at a local branch of a national telephone company whom lives alone with her son Michael in a small house in Los Angels, circa the 1920s. As a lead, we're led to believe she embodies a number of characteristics: individualism, professionalism, but most importantly, dedication. Very early on, a senior individual at the telephone company Christine works at commends her for the level of her recent work, and it is briefly established how well she's done in defying her, what we assume to be, ego driven male doubters whom work in the nether regions of the company.Within the narrow corridors and wired-up rooms of her workspace, Collins bosses her female workmates and dominates what is hard, fast paced work that needs a lot of dedication, love and attention to get the verbal results she is given early on. What follows, rather interestingly, is a taking out of this supposed groove on Christine's behalf when the male led LAPD just about manages to sign her life away and put her on misery row. What was an office-set life of dedication against what might be perceived as male oppressors in a feminist-less set world is escalated into the rest of the world as the actual police department of the city of Los Angels, and then the government itself, is taken on by this one woman and her dedicated hunt for the mere truth.Director Eastwood treats the supposed repression of a strong, truthful female voice in exceptional taste. He tells a plight, a journey through the grinder that sees police station interrogation rooms; asylum cells and prison execution chambers the locales for the ever searching reality of the situation. The film will mostly, for its first third at least, consist of men at the supposed peak of their respective careers telling the female lead just how wrong she is; how deluded she is and how correct they are. But she doesn't buckle; she knows what's what and she knows more than they do \u2013 she should, since she's smart, independent and she's the mother.Changeling only gives us a brief glimpse of peace, tranquillity and normality very early on. The very little exposure the film gives us of Michael works in the film's favour, since there isn't really enough of a stone-wall chance to map onto exactly what this child looks like, including any distinguishable features. From here, the film rather cannily relies on the supposed bringing back of a boy, of some description, which Christine is told is her son, to act as the overall initial incident. If the boy is indeed her son, the film is a study of madness; if he is the incorrect boy, then we observe the film has a licence to go down a different path, that of a detective story so that the truth can be searched out. What actually transpires is that Eastwood takes us down both routes anyway. We go off on one for the scenes in which Christine is supposedly crazy while the film unfolds a would-be hard-boiled; whisky downing; bribe-rejecting; noir-infused detective on the other \u2013 one that looks as if he's waltzed straight out of another film and into this one.As a physical representation of justice, this detective named Lester Ybarra (Kelly) is Eastwood's way of reminding us that not all men enjoy pushing women that have garnered praise and attention for defying what's expected of them back down into the doldrums. In regards to Christine's supposed madness, Eastwood shoots the scenes of her commitment in a particularly harrowing fashion. Additionally, Detective Ybarra's investigations lead him to an isolated shack int he middle of rural nowhere and the first things he notices upon entering the property are a cleaver and a knife on a table. Eastwood changes tact here, shooting the film like a horror piece. The slow burning sensation that turns the idea of loosing a son, and getting the wrong one in return, is developed from a misunderstanding that just needs to be sorted out to a real-time nightmare which suddenly comes complete with isolated shacks housing knifes and so forth.Changeling is a scary film. Its premise to do with missing children and the 'replacements' that are incorrect is harrowing. But the film's inclusion of a certain male hatred of certain strong willed women that comes complete with a specific space in which those are rounded up and placed within is equally as frightening, only on an entirely different level. Eastwood directs this visually impressive period piece brilliantly, with a real taste and acknowledgement towards his subject matter; while Angelina Jolie shines through in what might be her best film to date. Changeling is most certainly worth the time.",

I'll be honest with you, my wife bought this movie on DVD and I didn't think I'd like it; the plot didn't interest me and neither did Angelina (she's fine, but I can take her or leave her). However, within 25 minutes I was absorbed into the story and captivated until the end. After it was over I researched the true story of the \"Wineville Chicken Coop\" kidnapping and murder case. The case was so repugnant the town changed its name to Mira Loma in 1930.It's not necessary to say anything more.

When he comes up missing after an unplanned workday--a Saturday,as it was--Christine does what any distressed mother does,she goes through the proper channels to find him. What happens to her ensuing is something that shouldn't happen to anyone.Clint EAstwood's latest directorial effort is both something very familiar to his work(think UNforgiven,maybe Bridges of Madison County,Million Dollar Baby)and yet something that is wholly unique. To call this a kidnapping story,a story about police corruption,a women's plight movie,a crime mystery or a meditation on loss would miss the mark,because in truth this movie is really a big stew of ALL of those concepts. Adapted off a book by J.Michael Stracynzski(spelling?),Eastwood's simple filming is able to capture reactions and emotions as cleanly as possible. Jolie is mesmerizing as the mother,and even though I realize she seems to be happier playing \"kick-butt\" type roles,her ability to play vulnerability(she cries about as good as any A-list actress out there today!)is priceless. While I'm not sure I would've placed slow-burning actor John Malkovich as the muck-racking aggravating Presbyterian minister,he carries out this role with convincing,empathetic and intelligent controlled rage. Much of the cast is not what you'd probably call main-line or even vaguely recognizable talent,but that's maybe the great beauty of the film:character actors who don't distract from their characters. Some notable veterans who come to mind in this film(to me anyway)are \"Burn Notice\"'s Jeffrey Donovan(as the conscience-free Police Captain who seems more interested in putting off people like Christine Collins and keeping his unit un-burdened), Amy Ryan(normally lovely and well-scrubbed,as a hardened,roughed-up prostitute that's been \"dealt-with\" by the LAPD),Colm Feore(as the politically aware,corruption oblivious--willfully so--Police chief),Peter Gerety(As the quack doctor,hired to basically put official wraps on loose-ends for the Force)and Michael Kelly(As the one detective in the Force who actually seems more interested in investigating a case than covering his behind). A great attention to time period(late 1920s and early-to-mid-1930s Calfornia,mostly)and EAstwood's spare usage of music(mostly instrumental horn JAzz,BTW)fills this out beautifully.Some tie-ups with the plot and a little predictability in the dialog makes this JUST shy of perfection,but still the fantastic filming,which enhances the storytelling technique,is what makes this very special. While I'm not one to usually make declarations of a film's worthiness of the Oscar or any other award out there,if one wanted to offer this up as \"Best Picture\" of the year,I certainly wouldn't object.

            "content": "During John Malkovich's first speech as Reverend Gustav Briegleb near the beginning of Changeling, his vicious indictment of the Los Angeles Police Department in front of his church congregation made me feel that the movie was going to be something of a scathing criticism of the LAPD, which is not exactly what I expected. I like to go into Clint Eastwood films knowing as little as possible about them, because the element of surprise has added a great deal to my experience of brilliant films like Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, and True Crime, to which Changeling bears undeniable resemblance. Angelina Jolie stars in the true story about Christine Collins, whose 9-year-old son went mysteriously missing without the slightest trace in March 1928. Five months later, she received a visit from a police investigator giving her the news that she had been praying for all this time, her son was alive and well and on his way back to her.Upon being reunited, however, she insists immediately that the boy they bring is not hers, even though he bears close resemblance to her son and, most importantly, he says his name is Walter Collins and yes, she is his mother. He runs into her arms in front of the newspaper photographers' cameras, and her life takes a bizarre and frightening turn. What follows is a brilliantly paced battle between Christine, who insists the boy is not hers, the LAPD, who have maneuvered the case as an example of their good work amidst public accusations of corruption and violence, and the Reverend Briegleb, a Presbyterian pastor determined to use his radio broadcasts to reveal the extensive criminal underworld operating within the LAPD. The movie tells the story not only of a time when violence and corruption flowed unchecked within a major metropolitan police force, but also of a time when women enjoyed a level in society distantly below the early 21st century. You know, I live in China and the Chinese like to cover up embarrassing moments in their history (it's illegal to print or buy books detailing the events of the Tiananmen Square Massacre anywhere in mainland China, as one tiny example), thinking that those moments make the government look bad. They have convinced the people that they \"don't need to know what happened,\" in order to maintain public approval of the government's workings. But when I hear stories like the one told in Changeling, or when I see films or read books or learn about the history of slavery of the violence that was inflicted upon the Native Americans when the first Americans arrived from Europe, it makes me so proud that America was so brutal and so dangerous and so barbaric because I look around me now and see how far we've come. In 1928, it was possible for the Los Angeles Police to tell a woman to her face, and all over the newspapers, that she couldn't even recognize her own son. People believed the police instead of a mother, which is an astonishing example of how different American society was.Initially, the deepest part of the mystery is where this new boy came from. He is given darkly mysterious origins. We see a scene where a boy and a sweaty farmer are eating lunch in a dingy country caf\u00e9. The farmer says he's forgotten his wallet and will return home to get it, and the man working in the caf\u00e9 threatens to call the police if he's not back within ten minutes. The farmer leaves his son as collateral, and the man waits nearly an hour before giving in and finally calling the police. Soon, the boy is given to Christine Collins as her son. The answer to this mystery is, however, one of the film's few weak spots.Events spiral out of control with the LAPD gradually pulling out all the stops in ending Christine's protests until she is briskly locked away in a mental institution, where she discovers that the place is populated with other women who somehow publicly annoyed the police. The movie has no mercy on the embarrassing past of the LAPD. As Christine languishes amidst the screams and forced medication in the mental hospital, a determined detective, LAPD detective, by disobeying orders, discovers the horrific series of murders of young boys at a chicken ranch outside Winesville, California.Changeling is based on a true story, although the story of the murders committed by Gordon Northcott definitely seem to awful to be true, especially given the involvement of another young boy, who helped him attract and then imprison and even kill kids his own age so that he could stay in America. Is Canada really that bad? In the story of Northcott's pursuit and ultimate fate, it's impossible not to remember Eastwood's stunning crime drama True Crime, which also dealt with themes of police fallibility and the power of one man's determination. Jason Butler Harner's performance as Northcott is the most powerful and important performance in the story. If he had gotten one tic, one single detail not perfectly right, the whole character would have fallen apart into a cartoonish caricature of your standard serial killer. But he's real and he gets under your skin. We never learn much about his childhood or what made him what he is, but it's good that we don't because Eastwood understands that that would have been a waste of screen time. The story is, after all, not about him.The movie spectacularly re-creates late 1920s Los Angeles, and never for one second loses its authentic feel and sense of character and style. The Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography Oscar nominations are richly deserved. 2008 has been a year of profoundly important and well-made docudramas and crime thrillers about American politics and history, and Changeling ranks up there just below Frost/Nixon and Milk.",

            "content": "Can Clint Eastwood ever make a bad film? Contrary to the innumerable lemmings gushing over his Hollywood recognition and reputation, the answer is \"yes.\" This film had the production quality, sophistication, and entertainment value of a tedious made-for-TV flick trying desperately to be taken seriously. It didn't help that none of the characters were well conceived by the script (which is strange, considering this film was inspired by a \"real\" event and \"real\" people), and the actors were clearly bored with their roles.Angelina Jolie could not help but be 'emotionally distraught' in every scene, not only because it was called for by the script and the film, but because she seemed genuinely distraught that more discriminating viewers might not embrace this film on Eastwood's reputation alone. Malkovich doesn't even look like he's awake in most of his scenes, and Feore plays the same bureaucrat bit-role he's played in countless major Hollywood productions that continue to gloss over him. The only component worth mentioning is the score, which Eastwood purportedly composed himself. I guess that's something....",

            "content": "One of Clint's more challenging films. Angelina Jolie's young son disappears and the corrupt LAPD, prodded into a search, try to foist off a different kid on her. She denies it is her son. The police want the case wrapped up and Jolie's public complaints are becoming a nuisance so they have her committed to a psychiatric hospital where she undergoes various horrifying experiences.Then a boy shows up in police custody, an illegal Canadian immigrant, who begins to tell a blood-curdling tale of being held with other boys on a ranch near Riverside. The rancher, a fruitcake named Northcott, was in the habit of kidnapping young boys wholesale and slaughtering them at his pleasure with an ax. The ex-Canadian identifies Jolie's son as one of the twenty or so victims. Northcott is captured in Vancouver, convicted in Los Angeles, and hanged in San Quentin.Years later, still another kid shows up and reveals that, in fact, he and Jolie's son managed a joint escape. The other boy may still be out there somewhere, alive, afraid to return home. The last shot is of Jolie walking with a smile down the street. \"It's given me something I didn't have before.\" A detective who has backed her in the case says, \"Huh? What's that?\" \"Hope,\" says Jolie sweetly.That final exchange gave me a shudder because just for a moment a flashbulb exploded in my admittedly unusual brain and I was suddenly watching an old episode of \"Dragnet.\" In fact, the first half hour or more focuses on Angelina Jolie, earth mother. If the end sounded like \"Dragnet,\" the whole beginning of the story looked and sounded like a movie on LMN, the kind with titles like \"Please Don't Take My Baby!\" and \"Why Are You Doing This To Me?\" Jolie handles the role of the despairing but ever hopeful mother with seasoned skill but it's a stereotype nevertheless. She's loving, plucky, and defiant in the face of patronizing cops or brutal hospital staff. She gets to weep a lot. My heart was sinking along with hers, as I was pinning down the difference between Eastwood's ambitious story and a typical LMN offering -- higher production values and more expensive actors in the former.Happily the narrative takes a turn for the better when it shifts from Jolie's clich\u00e9d tribulations to the new investigation by the police, led sub rosa by a sympathetic but thoroughly UN-stereotyped tough cop, played by Michael Kelly. His is one of three outstanding performances in the film, the others' being that of the mass murderer Northcott, played by Jason Butler Harner, and the final escaped child to turn up in custody and tell the tale, Asher Axe. Harner's role is a difficult one. He must shift his demeanor, his motives, his whole persona, in different directions at different time, a Proteus of a character. The part isn't that well written and it takes skill to pull it off.In fact, the movie itself doesn't follow the usual narrative template. That's not bad in itself. If the story is based on real events, it can only be twisted so far. But this plot is wrought by the writer, J. Michael Straczynski, in a way that seems to me to hold the audience in something like contempt. Anti-climax follows anti-climax with the strictness of a religious ritual. And we don't really get a single solid scene with Northcott the monster until his execution when, yet again, we get to go through the process -- the shivering convict, the solemn reverend, the thirteen steps, the grim witnesses, the black hood, the adjusting of the hairy noose, the checking of the watch to make sure there are no last-minute reprieves, the nod of the warden to the executioner, the flapping of the trap door, the plunging of the shackled body, and this time Clint lingers on the victim's final spasms a long time -- too long. I'm frankly getting tired of these execution scenes. We've seen dozens of them lately. They're getting more and more explicit. Is there some hidden appeal in a realistic scene of a man being deliberately murdered? If so, it's under my head. They're starting to look like slasher movies for adults.It's one of Clint's more arty movies but not, in my opinion, one of his best. The period detail is exquisite. Love those antique cars! But the photography is darker than it needs to be. Even the scene in the desert, with dead bodies being unearthed, is shot late in the afternoon so that the sun is low, the shadows long, and the atmosphere mephitic. There are a few other jarring instants. Jolie would have referred to an \"ice box\" rather than a \"fridge\" in 1928. And she would not have said, \"F--- you, and the horse you rode in on.\" These are lapses in judgment not so much because they're anachronistic but because Clint, as the director, either didn't realize that they were, or, worse, didn't think anyone would notice them. There are other scenes that are eminently predictable -- the hellish psychopathic ward, the pinched-face nurses fire hosing the patient, the screaming fruitcake in the next bunk. With its several flaws, though, the movie is still worth watching. I'd never heard of the case before yet, according to what we see on the screen, it had a great deal of impact on California law.",

            "review_title": "Well done period piece of police corruption in the 1920's",
            "content": "Last night, October 29, 2008, I was one of the lucky ones who got in to see this movie that quickly followed with a q and a with Scott Foundas with the director/producer/composer Clint Eastwood, who gave quite an astute answers and even joked with the audience before making his undisturbed exit.The movie itself plays with colors that has been seen before in Eastwood's pictures. The names of the crew are quite familiar to those who've seen other Eastwood' movies. The first shot is actually in black and white and very much in the period in terms of building and cars when the first caption reads out: 1928.Slowly but surely, from an aerial shot to ground level, the black and white changes into color. We are introduced to Christine Collins who brilliantly played by Angelina Jolie. Collins is a single mom who's also a telephone operator supervisor required to use roller skates to fix little emergencies and handle supplies. Her first scene firmly establishes her as a loving mother.After returning from work to take her son to the latest Chaplin movie, she finds her son is nowhere to be found. Captain J. J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) reassures her that the LAPD will find her son. A child is brought forth from Illinois and the press are present to record the mother child reunion. However, the first words out of Collin's mouth is \"He is not my son.\" Pictures are taken anyway.Later, she comes back to complain to Jones that the child is not hers, he actually gets angry as far that he's concerned, the LAPD did its job. Just prior to this, she meets with Rev. Gustave Brieleb, (John Malkovich) who has his own radio broadcast program denouncing the very corrupt LAPD, whose tie-ins with organized crime he knows about.Jones actually has her committed. She's listed as a Code 12, one who has had trouble with the police and where electric shock therapy is used. Meanwhile, Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) follows a tip and captures an illegal alien from Canada. This boy tells a shocking story of boys being hacked up to bits that he was forced to help and among the boy s identified is Michael Collins as among the dead.Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Hamer) gets thrown in jail for committing those hideous acts. In one powerful screen, he calls Christine to give her closure which he never does. There's cross cutting between the police cover-up trail and Northcott's trial and both get the right verdicts with thunderous applause, one dramatic taken out of Capra, who has been criticized for same and the movie ends with Collins winning a bet that \"It Happened One Night\" would win at the Academy Awards.When Eastwood came out, he was chewing on some popcorn. This took place two years before he was born. He recalled his years growing up in the Pacific Palisades and remembers the Red Car, electric rail trolleys that were replaced by diesel buses, not so bright idea in retrospect.The script by J. Michael Straczynski was presented to him by Paul Glazer's company and he liked it very much. He offered the lead role to Jolie as both have expressed interest in working together. Clippings of transcripts were taped on the other side of the script pages really sold him.He praised Anthony Mann, Howard Hawks and John Ford when pressed what was his favorite Western. He rarely uses playback because those old pros didn't and even gave a passable impersonation of John Wayne while acknowledging other great actors who played cowboy parts.He even talked about making the Piano Blues doc for Scorsese when prompted. All in all, he was quite respectful in his responses to his audience who accorded him the respect when he left. A true living legend.",

            "content": "In 1928, in Riverside county, California, a cold, dispassionate, demented and brutally insane serial killer named Gordon Northcott (Jason Buttler Harner) amasses a string of some twenty kidnappings, molestations and murders of young boys. His eventual arrest, capture and trial became National news, leading to his conviction. This extraordinary film is called \" Changeling \" and is based in part on the true events of the time, including the abduction of Walter Collins (Gattlin Griffith). The crime also lead to a direct investigation of the Los Angeles Police Department. Their ambivalent attitudes and corruption charges would eventually lead to the dismissal of Police Chief James Davis (Colm Feore), Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) and several other police Officers. The movie's heroes include Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), Dectective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) and Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). Together they expose the single minded effort of the police to convince Mrs. Collins that her kidnapped son was found and returned to her. However, the police are mistaken when they believe the case has been solved, as Mrs. Collins is not convinced the boy is her son. Waging a non-stop war with the police, the medical doctors and their cronies, she becomes a force to be reckoned with, despite being ignored, arrested, jailed and confined to a mental Instituation. The movie and all it's tragedy is perhaps a great tribute to Clint Eastwood (Director) in filming what for many is an incredible and unbelievable story of horror and disbelief. Yet when one sees the final product, there is little doubt, Eastwood and his cast has created a Classic. Touching and dramatically sensational, this movie is recommended to any seeking the great effort it takes to fight City Hall. ****",

That little truth stretches a long way, however, and the story finds relevancy even today. It points out the simple truth, that if you are criminal it's much easier to be that if, at the same time, you are the police. In fact, it is such a nice set up, that all of us should always be on the lookout for it, regardless of which country we live in or, expressed somewhat differently, we ought to suspect foul play if the police is never accused, because that means that the crooks have expanded their realm and have the media in their pockets as well. Not so in this picture. There is a reverend here that has broad access to the media, seemingly even better access than the police. That's always a good thing. In a country in which the police is often accused in the media and occasionally brought down, there is always hope for at least some justice. You see, this is what this good film makes me think of. We may look at this film and say \"yes, these were the dark ages\" (the story takes place in the twenties and thirties) but we might just as well say \"yes, these were the days of justice, when the police could be convicted\".

Going to the police to file a missing persons report Christine runs into the first of many horrors she suffers throughout the film in the police's indifference to finding her son Walter. It's when the police finally locate Walter some five months later in a diner at far off DeKalb Illinois that Christine's problems, instead of ending, star to intensify. The boy isn't her missing son Walter and what's more the L.A police-who took the credit in locating and returning \"Walter\" to her-in wanting to finally close the case insist that he is! So much so that they have Christine committed to an insane asylum when she refuses to go along with them!True story about the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders committed by the deranged Gordon Northcott, Jason Butler Hanner,back in 1928 that stunned the entire nation. The person who unknowingly uncovered these ghastly ax murders-Christine Collins-almost ended up being committed for life in an insane asylum by the very police who's job it was to solve them. It was when L.A Det. Lester Ybarra, Michael Kelly, interviewed this 15 year-old Canadian runaway Sandford Clark, Eddie Anderson, that the truth-about the ax murders- finally saw he light of day. It was Sandford who identified a photo of Walter Collins as one of his crazed Uncle Gordon's victims that cracked the case wide open. Uncovering the victims, as many as 20, at the Northcott Ranch not only leads to the arrest of Gordon Northcott but the indictment of the L.A police in their total incompetence in not chasing down the clues,in the case of the missing Walter Collins, that may have prevent any more murders from happening.****SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT DOWN**** Besides the tragic story about the missing Walter Collins-who in fact was never found dead or alive- and what his mother Christine went through to find him the \"Changeling\" also shows the amount of corruption that existed in the LAPD back then and how it allowed, with the police participating in it, crime to get out of hand in the \"City of Angels\". Gordon Northcott who was sentenced to be executed at San Quentin Prison was still up to his old tricks when he, from his cell in solitary confinement, sent Christine a telegram expressing remorse for his crimes and willing to tell her if her son Walter was in fact one of his victims. This lead to one of the most explosive scenes in the entire movie with Christine, while visiting him in a holding cell with a prison guard present, smacked Northcott silly when she realized that he was, by pulling her leg in what he knew about Walter, just extending her suffering for his own sick and perverted pleasure! As for Northcott he was to meet his maker the very next morning, on the San Quentin gallows, and that, unlike his sickening game of cat and mouse he played with Christine the previous day, was nothing for him to laugh about!",

It ultimately does have a happy ending (sort of) but the middle section is pretty strong stuff. Collins is institutionalized and her treatment there is beyond belief. Also murder and child abuse come up later on. Trust me--this film is VERY R rated. The 1920s are captured perfectly on film in all terms. Also the acting is just great across the board. However Jolie (in an Oscar nominated performance) is just incredible. She keeps most of her reactions and emotions bottled up but you can see the fear and anger in her face. When she finally explodes near the end it REALLY hits! There are also standout performances by Eddie Alderson (as Sanford Clark), Amy Ryan (as Carol Dexter) and Jeffrey Donovan (as J.J. Jones). It is too long and rather slow but a story like this can't be told quickly. It gives you time to understand the characters and situations. Dark but powerful. An 8.",

            "content": "Among the most popular types of shows on television are shows about forensic criminology. CSI and all its fictional brethren get the ratings, but for me, the cream of the crop is Forensic Files on the former CourtTV. Since they're relegated to the world of the real, outlandish stories are usually few and far between, and they aren't particularly adept at misdirection (the first person accused is almost never vindicated), and yet, I prefer it over similar shows thanks to excellent pace, presentation and personality, namely the startling delivery of narrator Peter Thomas, a man with a voice that could make children playing hopscotch terrifying. This show continually came to mind throughout the extensive length of Clint Eastwood's Changeling, a film that disappointingly lacks both ghostly red balls and Odo and the Founders.The film deals with a telephone operator in 1927 whose son goes missing, and is the victim of a police cover-up when they return a boy that isn't her own, and attempt to discredit her as crazy. When creating a film based upon a true story, you always run the risk that the story will be overly familiar to some audience members (I made it a point to avoid any and all details so as not to spoil it for myself), so, as stated, it comes down to pace, presentation and personality, and the film only partly succeeds. The opening jaunt through town in 1927 was wonderful in its feelings of the ordinary, the mundane; it's just life, and it was lovingly created. But this feeling quickly wore off, and the film soon became ordinary itself, the visuals becoming a drab non-issue. As for the other two P's, the film failed on all counts. Angelina Jolie turned on the wailing histrionics almost immediately, and her delivery and emotion ran false throughout (also, I was never, ever able to see the character, all I saw was Angelina). John Malkovich sleepwalked through his sparse character, with Jeffrey Donovan bringing up the abominable rear (the Lucky Charms leprechaun is a most believable Irish man).Pertaining to pace, one look at the film's length should tell you all you need to know. Eastwood gives it a sort of three-act structure, none of which ring anything but contrived. In the first, Jolie screams MY SON MY SON MY SON and all the one-dimensional villains scream YOU'RE CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY, in the second, it's the same story, except she's in a mental hospital. The third becomes a sort of double court drama, and features not only its one moment of intrigue, but exacerbates exactly why this film doesn't work as a whole. Eastwood's cowboy origins show through in the characterization, as not a single character in the entire film is given an even two-dimensional shade. Jolie is so idealized I'm surprised her character wasn't sacrificed so she could float to heaven. In her presence, every other character becomes undershown. Malkovich is but a plot machination to spring her from the pen, and S.S. Hahn breezes in, has a righteous, and did I mention pro bono shoutdown. On the flipside, Chief Davis and J.J. Jones are so single-mindedly ignorant that Bud White would have whipped their asses on the spot, and Gordon Northcott is so preposterously, snivelingly evil that I'm amazed they allowed him to avoid a lengthy mustache for him to twirl.Northcott's eventual denouement is all the more frustrating considering the film's one fleeting moment of worthwhile commentary: the convicted murderer's speech about how he had been railroaded, and never given a chance by a single person in the courtroom save for Jolie, who had never badmouthed him to the press, and never made any sort of announcement of judgment towards him. This comment made me confront my own feelings, as I too had convicted this man right off the bat, ignoring his every plea, rationalizing every claim he made as a falsehood, after having spent an entire film with a woman who was the victim of the exact same treatment. Unfortunately, this was but fleeting as the very next segment turns him into a blithely uncooperative kvetch, subsequently confirming his guilt in a scene so plainly obvious that it's not even treated as a surprise.Changeling seems to have inclinations to not only win a lot of Oscars (and don't think I didn't make a joke during the film's credits about how we should have gone to see It Happened One Night at the Royal instead), but to be mentioned in the same breath as other legendary neo-noirish looks at the seedy side of old Los Angeles like Chinatown and L.A. Confidential, but those films were brilliantly scripted, breathlessly paced, and had characters that, if perhaps leaning one way or another, were all real people with real feelings and real motivations, and despite the fact that Changeling is based on a true story, none of the characters ever rang true for more than a moment, and I was a step ahead at every opportunity. I can tear up at the drop of the hat, a sucker especially for court dramatics, but even Matthew Harrison Brady was a man first, and \"she wasn't thrown in, she was escorted\"? Not even E.K. Hornbeck could be that heartless.{Grade: 5/10 (C) / #51 (of 80) of 2008}",

            "content": "Whether there will be a better picture released in these last few weeks of 2008 remains to be seen, but this is the first truly excellent big budget film I have seen so far. After making fun westerns which became cultural icons, Clint Eastwood turned to various action films including San Francisco Inspector Callahan who uttered memorable lines like: \"Go ahead, Punk. Make my day.\" His films garnered good box office but not critical acclaim. Beginning with \"Unforgiven,\" Eastwood's name became synonymous with excellence in film making.Anyone asked to be in one of his projects would be a fool to turn it down, because it virtually assures Oscar consideration. No director in this decade has had more actors nominated by the Academy. No director has scored more wins for cast and crew in recent years. This string of wins will continue with this film. Angelina Jolie has made a lot of money at the box office since her Oscar win in 2000 with \"Girl Interrupted.\" Since then, Ms. Jolie has become a female version of James Bond in action films like \"Laura Croft\" or \"Gone in 60 Seconds,\" where she is a tough, sexy chick who can drive fast, shoot straight, kick ass, and rumble with the bad guys. She fits the fantasy in these films, but it strains credulity to believe she can always defy physics, gravity and reality to perform these super heroic deeds. She has played some serious roles involving some unfortunate accents which are hard to pin down geographically including \"Alexander\" where she played a Persian with some kind of Slavic thing happening. As the wife of Daniel Pearl last year, she attempted a French accent with some success.In this film, she gets an opportunity to portray a mom who is looking for her lost son. Under Eastwood's direction, she becomes the actress she was born to be.The film takes place in L.A. in the 1920s and early 1930s, a small town with trolley cars, modest homes, and T Model cars. The film is like a time machine recreating the past in great detail. With gorgeous cinematography, a tight script, excellent acting and excellent art direction, this film would be the first contender for multi-category wins at the Oscars.There is one more Eastwood touch to this film which deserves mention. Eastwood is a musician. {If you get the chance, watch his installment of the Scorcese history of the blues where Eastwood sits with Ray Charles and chats with him about music and musicians. I could have watched those two old guys for hours, but the segment runs only a few minutes. Charles died a few months after he appeared in the film.) Film scores are background music often unnoticed. The subtle connection between sound and emotion operates at the edge of the sub-conscious. The wonderful score by Eastwood could be one of the finest scores you were never supposed to hear. Moving jazz undertones with an elegant saxophone rising to the surface on occasion strikes the perfect emotional connection between sound and light.In a business that caters to the young, half a century of experience stands out. Mr. Eastwood knows what he is doing.",

According FBI agent Ted L. Gunderson, an adult survivor of satanist pedophilia in the Franklin Cover-up case named Paul Bonacci relayed to him that using a child to lure other children near playgrounds and other public areas to a kidnapper's car was one way his captors acquired children for abuse,torture, and murder. See Gunderson's YouTube video \"Throw them in Jail for Life: Franklin Cover Up (1 of 3)\", time index 1:54Also, Northcott's tactic of enlisting this same boy to help him kill, mutilate and dispose of the bodies of his victims is similar to Paul Bonacci's story as relayed in chapter 10 of his defense attorney John DeCamp's book, \"The Franklin Cover-up\":(The following is a graphic excerpt of survivor Paul Bonacci's account and is disturbing but nevertheless needs to be told as some of the perpetrators are still at large and this pedophile network is still active and includes dirty judges, adoption agency officials, and prominent government and business leaders, and law enforcement. This took place in an \"area with big trees\" about an hour's drive from Sacramento, California, in January of 1984. Again, be forewarned; you can't unread this teenage boy's account of abuse he gave to his lawyer but every parent needs to know about this:)\"There was a cage with a boy in it who was not wearing anything. Nicholas and I were given these tarzan things to put around us and stuff. They told me to f--- the boy and stuff. At first I said no and they held a gun to my (genitals) and said do it or else lose them or something like that...We were told to f--- him and stuff and beat on him. I didn't try to hurt him. We were told to put our d---s in his mouth and stuff and sit on the boys p---- and stuff and they filmed it. We did this stuff to the boy for about 30 minutes or an hour when a man came in and kicked us...He grabbed the boy and started f---ing him and stuff...The boy was bleeding from his rectum and the men tossed him and me and stuff and put the boy right next to me and grabbed a gun and blew the boys head off.\"The boys blood was all over me and I started yelling and crying. The men grabbed Nicholas and I and forced us to lie down. They put the boy on top of Nicholas who was crying and they were putting Nicholas hands on the boys *ss. They put the boy on top of me and did the same thing. They then forced me to f--- the dead boy..they put a gun to our heads to make us do it. His blood was all over us. They made us kiss the boys lips and to eat him out. Then they made me do something I don't want to even write so I won't.\"After that the men grabbed Nicholas and drug him off screaming they put me up against a tree and put a gun to my head but fired into the air. I heard another shot from somewhere. I then saw the man who killed the boy drag him like a toy. Everything including when the men put the boy in a trunk was filmed. They took me with them and we went up in a plane. I saw the bag the boy was in. We went over a very thick brush area with a clearing in it. Over the clearing they dropped the boy. One said the men with the hoods would take care of the body for them.Ted Gunderson notes that Paul Bonacci saw some of the children in this pedophile ring auctioned off and shipped to D.C., New York and Paris for sex parties.

            "content": "Changeling- ***1/2 out of **** By Kevin Muller With all the press lately about Angelina Jolie being \"Uncool\" people may have forgotten she is a movie star with a new movie out. With this film, Jolie reminds us why she is one of Hollywood's greatest talents. Seriously, if Jolie isn't nominated for an Oscar come February, it is a crime. In \"Changeling\" she dives so far into her character and displays every emotion with such ease that it will make you glad you spent money on a ticket to this fantastic film.Clint Eastwood, who directed this picture, really explores the dark side of human emotions in this picture. Anyone who has seem \"Mystic River\", \"Million Dollar Baby\" or \"Unforgiven\" knows that Mr. Eastwood can easily tell a story about the ugliness of human nature. With \"Changeling\", he goes a step further and really makes us feel uncomfortable because this time the victims aren't a bunch of cowboys, a teen girl or a adult female boxer, but little children.For those of you who don't know, the movie is inspired by true events that took place in 1930's Los Angles, when the cops ran things their way with no questions. Jolie plays Christine Collins, a mild mannered telephone operator, who is raising her son Walter. One day she she arrives home to find her son missing. Like any other mother, she starts to search for her son with the help of the police. Three months later, the police say they have found her son and hand over a boy who doesn't resemble her son at all. Christine keep insisting that the boy isn't her son, but the police keep making up excuses to cover their own tracks; even going so far as saying that the obvious case of her son's shrinking height is due to some connection to distress that he probably went through while captured. I won't give away any more of the plot, but things do get ugly and the only one on Christine's side is a local preacher Gustav Briegleb (John Malcovich) who has a extremem distaste for the LAPD.The movie is quite long, running almost two and half hours, but it is worth it because Eastwood is a master story teller, who doesn't let everything unravel all at once. The time period is perfectly mimicked as are the costumes. What Eastwood and screen writer J . Michael Straczynski accomplish is making a picture that is both filled with both hope and hopelessness. You feel Christine's highs and lows because the movie takes its time connecting you to her. There is a scene where Jolie comes face to face with the suspected killer, pleading him to tell the where abouts of the son, which is so powerful that you just are taken a back how amazing Jolie is in this scene. She throws him around like a doll, slaps him, bullies him and you feel every emotion she is throwing at this man.\"Changeling\" is definitely an adult picture, with moments being almost as dark as 1995's \"Se7en.\" Most of all, and I can't stress this enough, it is a emotions picture about the undying love and drive of a woman who has lost her son, acted out beautifully by a beautiful and talented actress.",

Clint is a genius, one of my favourite directors. he puts the exact pace in a film, the exact musical score, the right actors..... everything.i think this got nominated for three Oscars, i cant believe it didn't win any. i'm appalled by that. this film is absolutely amazing and there will never be a film like it again.......

It is a fascinating, exciting and frustrating journey that takes twists and turns. Last and certainly not least is the star, Angelina Jolie who leads us on this journey. If there was any doubt that she is a great actress, this film will verify that as fact.

Part of the lyrics say, \"If you never know the darker side, you'll never see the light --- of your soul.\" This past week I have seen the dark and the light. The movie \"Australia\" was a clunker. It reminded me of the cloyingly morose songs sung by Celine Dion, who suffocates every line with sobbing, carefully-crafted sincerity. \"Australia\" should have been a magnificent movie, but it lacks any warmth; instead it relies on the kind of plastic, manufactured sincerity that we saw in other clunkers like \"Pearl Harbor\".\"Changeling\" is the complete opposite. I was transfixed. What was happening on the screen commanded my total attention. Mrs. Collins' anguish became my own. I wanted her to find her son every bit as much as she did.\"Changeling\" is based on a true story about Christine Collins, a California woman whose son was abducted in 1928. Right from the start, you feel her anguish, and the frustration of not knowing where her son is, nor whether he is alive or dead.One of the elements of brilliance in this movie is how plausible everything is. Mrs. Collins is not just fighting the agony of losing her son, but also battling against the incredibly corrupt L.A.P.D. who see her as an embarrassment to the police force. When the public attention becomes too great a liability for the L.A.P.D. they have her sent to a psychiatric ward. This part was absolutely chilling, because it showed how completely helpless she was when everyone is part of the conspiracy of silence. No matter what she does, she cannot prevail.Angelina Jolie has to walk a tightrope of sorts in this movie. She is strong-willed, but she is not some ultimately invincible, puffed up superwoman that can single-handedly take on the whole world, and especially not this world, which is rife with corruption.At the end of \"Changeling\" you learn if there was a happy reuniting of mother and son. Since I have chosen not to write any \"spoilers\", you'll have to see the movie for yourself to know the answer. And that will be time very well spent because this movie truly is like the golden age of film making.**Addition added January 16, 2009** I first started writing these reviews in 2005.

Seeking escape or inspiration, we turn to movies.Changeling, the account of a mother searching for her missing nine year old son, presents a paradox. Based upon true events, its outcome is predetermined. So on one hand, unlike an artificial happy ending of a work of fiction, we could be offered an authentic portrayal of hope validated upon reuniting with her boy. On the other hand, we might be faced with the mother finding him dead, or not even knowing his fate. How can she rationally cope? The challenge for the director lies in staging this drama.Overall, the acting is fine, the cinematography excellent. Notwithstanding the R rating, horrid images are depicted with minimal visual gore which in your mind's eye actually exacerbates the horror. The corrupt cops and the monstrous psych ward staff are overtly hostile to the mother. The pastor initially appears supportive when she aids his political cause against the establishment. But after her service, he tells her it is time to abandon hope for her child. Nevertheless, she valiantly clings on, as do we in empathy.Tragically, the director, seeming to underscore the pastor, himself forsakes the mother. This otherwise powerful movie is emasculated by its finale. Changeling merely delivers its denouement with a text overlay explaining what happened. Reread that sentence. Let it sink in, and you'll share the emotional vacuum thrust upon the viewer. Whatever escape or inspiration one sought instantly crashes.I later learned that historical records reveal little about the woman and her son after the calamity. But this is no excuse for leaving us empty. In the film Hollywoodland, despite sketchy facts, the death of George Reeves (the 1950's TV Superman) was rigorously interpreted and portrayed three alternative ways. Because the narrative begins in 1928, the mother is presumably now deceased. Thoughts and feelings she took to her grave remain undramatized. Hope springs eternal only in theology: in the world of Changeling, hope dies a lonely death.",

The story itself is very powerful and the delivery is a constant assault to the viewer's emotions where the plot though it evolves constantly, does so in a pace that whilst you are kept engaged it does not give too much out too soon.Furthermore another reason I believe this film stands out is the fact that despite being a drama there is a beacon of hope that always shines.A movie with distinction, class and quality.

I am sure directing wanted to detail the tragedy and the corruptions of the LAPD, in which was a little too similar in taste like the other LAPD scandals in Black Dahlia, and LA Confidential. In a movie drawn out for a little over 2 hours, I was expecting a little more closure than the ending I saw in this film. I don't think I can sit through this movie and re-watch this drama over again. I'd rather watch a movie not as good as this one before I go back.

            "review_title": "Another Masterpiece from Eastwood",
            "content": "Clint Eastwood has established himself as master of modern cinema. His films are always interesting and effective and have the benefit of his years of experience, including his work with some of the world's finest directors. Eastwood rarely falls into the bombast. He is a master of control and can do emotionally heavy stories without resorting to worthy sentiment.His masterpiece, \"Million Dollar Baby\", showed all of Eastwood's subtle expertise and quiet brilliance. It set the bar high for his next films, and \"Flags of our Fathers\" and \"Letters From Iwo Jima\" understandably struggled to live up to expectations. With \"Changeling\" Eastwood moves away from the more epic scope of the Iwo Jima films and returns to the arena of the person in crisis. It is the astonishing true story of Christine Collins, whose son was kidnapped in 1928. The subsequent investigation, carried out by an LAPD desperate for results and good news, returned a boy who was not her child, and her protests led to her incarceration in a mental asylum before she was eventually, and tragically, proved to be right.Eastwood gambles somewhat in his central casting choice. Angelina Jolie is a superb actress, but her problem is that she is Angelina Jolie. Her fame can prove to be a barrier to her performances. In other words, it's really hard to forget that it's Angelina Jolie and believe in the character. Here however, she triumphs. It is a magnificent performance and the driving force behind the film. Not only do you believe in Christine Collins but you utterly empathise with her. Jolie deserves an awful lot of recognition for this piece of work.Jolie's tour-de-force is excellently supported by the rest of the cast. John Malkovich deals with a part which is actually fairly under-developed well and manages to make him an effective character. Jeffrey Donovan is excellent as the corrupt policeman, Captain Jones. However, the second-half of the film moves away from Collins a little and considers the horrendous crime which is associated with her case. At the heart of this are three terrific performances. Michael Kelly is splendid as the film's only good cop, Detective Ybarra (and even he has his dark side). Eddie Alderson is excellent in a brief but impressive appearance as Sanford Clark, a crucial character in the tale. However, one of the most memorable and haunting performances comes from Jason Butler Harner, who brings a chilling depth to Gordon Northcott.That second-half of the film contains some of the film's real strong points. There is a staggering scene between Alderson and Kelly where the former's Sanford Clark tells the latter's detective about the horrible crimes he has witnessed and been coerced into. During this highly effective scene, Eastwood cuts from horrendous flashbacks to a simple shot of the detective's cigarillo, still in his hand, now more ash than tobacco. It is a brief example of Eastwood's subtle brilliance as a director.The film, although it is lengthy, is never dull and merits every scene. Having said this, Eastwood missteps slightly toward the end when there is a scene in a prison where the determined but quiet Collins suddenly becomes uncharacteristically violent. This scene is immediately followed by a hanging scene which shows a bit too much of the event and could be called gratuitous. The slice of closure which is achieved in that scene is necessary; the manner in which the scene is carried out is not.However, this is a small complaint in light of the rest of the film. The delicate score (composed by that man Eastwood again) and the subtle photography in themselves make up for those small errors. Added to that, Eastwood has crafted a superb drama which tells a gripping and shocking story well, and has a lot to say about the state, ordinary people and freedom. But at the core, this film is a heartbreaking and moving tale about a mother separated from her son and the selfish and horrible forces which acted against her and those good men and women who fought with her. It's a triumph for Jolie and another masterpiece from Eastwood.5 Stars out of 5",

The main problem is that the story concentrates on other events, highlighting them so much that the actual plot gets vanished. I'll note down everything about the film below.Performances:1) Angelina Jolie: She has done a commendable job. She showed her vulnerability and succeeded in her performance. Even then, I was not sucked into her role. Her character was dull and boring. Her constant cries of \"Where is my son?\" became annoying. 2) Jeffrey Donovan: He showed his evil side and succeeded too. But he does fall flat towards the end in the courtroom. When he had so much gut in the beginning, he should not have been shown so quiet towards the climax.3) The young boy confessing the crime to the police: He too showed that he had acting skills but the whole situation wasn't so believable.4) The killer: Okay. I did not understand his character. The major flaw with the movie is that almost everyone is shown corrupt. Corrupt police, corrupt nurses, corrupt doctors-all kept getting on my nerves. Such corruption is not even seen in India! The corrupt thing got on my nerves mainly because it felt too far-fetched. Also I do not think that Angie's character was treated like that in the hospital. Basically, the whole hospital thing was rubbish and a waste of time. The story prolonged for two hours and twenty minutes but it felt like a 4 hour movie. I would give a 4 for this movie mainly because I liked the end in which \"hope\" was still shown.",

            "review_title": "Harrowing, moving and beautifully filmed - Eastwood delivers the goods yet again",
            "content": "Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a single mother living in 1920's LA. She is scheduled to go to the cinema with her young son to see the latest Charlie Chaplin film. However, she has to cancel her plans with her son when she's required to go to work on her day off due to a shortage of personnel. She leaves her son behind informing him that the neighbours will pop round occasionally to check on the house. When she returns, she discovers that her son is missing. A few months pass by when the LAPD claim that they've found Christine's son in Illinois, but when Christine informs the LAPD that the boy they have found is not her son the LAPD assure her that it is and close the case. However, Christine knows that this boy is not her son and does everything in her power to find her son whilst she takes on the LAPD at the same time.Based on a true story, Changeling is harrowing, moving and incredibly well acted. Angelina Jolie put in a very strong performance and also managed to be very convincing as the grief stricken woman who is pushed to the limit due to the awful way that she is treated by the LAPD. I knew from the premise that it would take a strong female lead to pull off this type of acting role and I honestly didn't think Jolie would be up to the job, but she not only delivered the goods, but she excelled proving that she's more than just a pretty face.The fact that this is based on a true story makes this all the more frightening when you think of the way that women in particular were treated by the LAPD in the late 1920's. Anyone who came close to exposing corruption or mistakes within the LAPD were automatically deemed to be 'insane' and sent for psychiatric observation. The LAPD's corrupt influence even extends beyond their own department - when Collins is incarcerated the head doctor tries to get her to sign a disclaimer accepting that the LAPD are not to blame for the mistake involving her child in exchange for her freedom. It must have been utterly terrifying for Collins and all the other women involved knowing that they are innocent but feeling totally powerless and unable to do anything about it. I'll admit there were times when I found this hard to watch, but I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen as I was so engrossed in the story and the characters.Jolie gets support from a largely excellent cast. When watching this, it really felt like everyone's heart was firmly in this and I can't think of anyone that gave a weak performance. Particular praise should be given to Malkovich in his role as church Pasteur/radio DJ Gustav Briegleb who helps Christine Collins in bringing down the LAPD. Jeffrey Donovan was also excellent as the evil Captain J.J Jones - he was despicable and succeeded in making me hate him which is a testament to both writer and actor. Jason Butler Harner was also good in his respective role of child killer Gordon Northcott.Changeling is an incredibly moving and harrowing film, but it manages to produce the goods with very little sentimentality. Eastwood and Straczynski focus on Collins taking on the LAPD and also focuses on the dreadful treatment that she receives at their hands. It's an emotionally draining journey, but it's a worthwhile one. I loved it!!!",

            "review_title": "A corrupt system",
            "content": "A period piece about a single mother looking for her lost son? This couldn't possibly be a Clint Eastwood film, could it? Well, if you've been paying close attention to what Eastwood's been trying to say over the previous several decades, it'd be easy to see that Changeling actually fits really well into his body of work. He is essentially a studio director in the modern era, after the fall of the studio system, so, similar to a filmmaker like Fritz Lang, you can't pinpoint the same kind of thematic obsessions at the same ubiquity as someone like Martin Scorsese. However, the tales of individuals being left behind or actively destroyed by corrupt systems simply keeps resurfacing again and again, and this tale falls right into place.Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a single mother in late 1920s Los Angeles with a son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith). One Saturday, she's called into her place of work, the Los Angeles telephone switchboard where she was a manager, and has to leave Walter alone at home for the day, returning late to find Walter gone. She reports Walter's disappearance to the corrupt LA police, but months go by without any word. Desperate for any kind of positive press, the police led by Chief Davis (Colm Feore) arrange for a boy found in Iowa (Devon Conti) to take the place of Christine's son. It's obvious that this is not Walter, but the police keep insisting that the awful events of the previous few months were enough to shrink him by four inches. Her plight hits the radio waves in particular because of the Revered Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) who is on a mission to expose the corruption of the police force, and the police captain in charge of the case, J. J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) decides to forcibly put Christine in a mental institution where the head doctor, Jonathan Steele (Denis O'Hare) puts Christine through the wringer, trying to force her to sign a confession that the boy is hers.Based very closely on a host of primary documents from the era, the script by J. Michael Straczynski takes its first half to really establish character and the overall sense of corruption as told through this limited tale. There is some talk of the gun squads of the era run by the police department, but ultimately its about how they treat Christine, and they treat Christine with disdain, condescension, and dismissiveness, peaking with violence to keep her quiet. It's all well-handled, anchored by a very strong performance from Jolie who is at the center of most of the film, but it's when the secondary investigation begins that the film really gains the kind of character that elevates it.Detective Ybarra (Michael Kelly) takes a random immigration assignment to head out to a ranch in Wineville, California to find and help deport 15-year-old Sanford Clark (Eddie Alderson) back to Canada. Clark's uncle, Gordon Stewart Northcott (James Butler Harner), runs at the sight of the police, and a basic interview with Clark begins to uncover the terrible truth that Northcott had been bringing boys around Walter Collins' age to the range and murdering them. Clark even positively identifies Walter as one of the boys. This sets up an interesting contrast of the evil corruption of the LA police with the good, solid work that they tended to do under the radar. Ybarra is a good guy in this whole thing, and the press doesn't care because he's a low-level cog in a deeply corrupt machine that's willing and able to throw a woman into a mental institution because she's become a headache.It's Christine's release where the film becomes more than just a tale of a woman who lost her son and went up against City Hall. It reaches the heights of a complex tragedy as Northcutt gets captured and tried. The contrast becomes almost explicit as Eastwood cuts between the trial of Northcutt and the public depositions of police officials led by the big-time attorney Sammy Hahn (Geoff Pierson) hired pro-bono by Briegleb. It's a strong sequence with some very wonderful and small moments from Jolie that feels like the ending to a lesser film, but it keeps going so we can watch Northcutt's execution and the further slivers of hope Christine receives in the ensuing years.This is one of those scripts that perfectly matches Eastwood's thematic concerns as well as his directing style. It's a film that, if you were to bring it back into Academy ratio and use black and white film stock, you wouldn't have to change much else to make it look and feel like it belonged in the 30s or 40s, something that Otto Preminger or Fritz Lang might have made. It takes its time with a very strong focus on character to help create the emotional reality of the piece, the strong first half that spends so much time on Christine and her plight building up to the second half that has a more subtle emotional appeal as Jolie very rarely loses her composure, sometimes no more than a quiver of a lip. It's not the kind of acting showcase that gains lots of attention, but it's the kind of acting that I find to be some of the most affecting. The script is a great foundation. Eastwood handles the production with extraordinary skill. However, it's Jolie who really give the film its final push, making Changeling one of my favorite Eastwood films. Amidst the very capable and professional cast, I want to point out Herner as Northcott who plays the part like Peter Lorre might have, creating a creepy, deranged, and almost sympathetic character.This period of Eastwood's career feels very similar to Scorsese's later period with movies like Shutter Island and The Aviator, period pieces with a lot of money behind them and an obvious effort by studios to marry the more traditional elements of the studio system with auteur directors they could trust to not explode budgets or make complete messes. And, much like Scorsese, this kind of money was where Eastwood ended up making some of his best work.",

You have the legendary, chilling account of the \"chicken coup murders\" which would make a great film on it's own, but takes more of a backseat to the virtually unknown story of the Christine Collins case. Screenwriter Straczynski literally unearthed the details of her ordeal from the LAPD archives right before they were about to burn everything. He spent years doing extensive research on the case so he could be sure it would be a 'true story' and not just 'based on a true story.' It paid off. The true story is far better, and crazier, than any fictionalization would have been. I'm not a big Eastwood fan, but I love what he did with this film. In my opinion, this is an outright horror movie. I'm sure it's a lot scarier than the Friday the 13th remake. I also really liked the way he handled the period aspects. He made 1920s and 30s Los Angeles into a vivid world all its own. I loved how new characters keep popping up as the movie goes along, and each one of them is performed brilliantly. What begins as a simple little story goes far and wide with several stops at very unexpected places along the way.",

Working together for the first time here, Jolie and Eastwood have created an outstanding work that sears into the soul.'Changeling' is not a word I've come across before this movie, but its definition - a child exchanged for another - tells you all to need to know before seeing the film. It is based on a true story: the disappearance in 1928 of nine-year old Walter Collins in a Los Angeles badly served by a deeply incompetent and corrupt police force.This abduction became one part of the wider case of the infamous Wineville Chicken Coop Murders and, if the details of the case depicted so graphically in the film were not a matter of public record, one would never believe them.

Be afraid of going to hell! Be afraid of sitting in front of 132 minutes of a sermonizing movie about good and evil. Add to this: clich\u00e9s galore, a slow pace (you can go out and buy a drink, being comfortable you are not missing anything), plain camera work and picture compositions, and a very unconvincing performance from A. Jolie. Everything she does is unbelievable. When she takes her child in her arms it looks fake. Her feelings which may be genuine just don't come through. To her credit she has nothing to play: the character is the embodiment of virtue. She's good, good, good, so good, so dull, she should have asked for a rewrite. Only upside to her character: she works on roller skates for a telephone company, which may have sound cool on paper and is simply odd in the movie. Quite unlike her, a series of evil freaks badly try to harm the Virgin Mary who's lost her child. The corrupt cop, excellent performance by Jeffrey Donovan, a baddie who should get more parts, the corrupt and pervert psychiatrist (what else), and of course the formulaic serial killer who just walked out of an episode of CSI, except this time, the TV series plot is served with a sermon, as he finds true redemption owing to a last minute confession to a priest. The content of the confession most certainly holds the secret to the whole plot but nor us nor Mrs Jolie get to know it. The good mother is helped by another good character in her fight against the three baddies and guess what's his job: he's a reverend. Malkovitch looks so evil naturally that he manages to create an interesting character out of another dull part of the screenplay. He's a genius actor this man, Hollywood tends to forget his huge talent too much too fast. You end up wishing the film was about the reverend rather than his simpering prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Most of the time the plot is grossly unbelievable. The mother is manipulated by the press to accept a child which is clearly not hers; What made the real mother do it in the real life, who knows; but the film fails to properly account for this keystone to the story. The good reverend walks in the hospital with a warrant to save the good mother from the evil psychiatrist just as she is about to receive electric shocks, just like in a pulp B movie, except this one thinks very highly of itself. I mean come on, this can't be serious, what were they thinking? 2 out of 10 for the recreation of the 1930s LA costumes, props and visual effects.",

Those films were more original and I think Unforgiven was his best, but in terms of film-making, not originality, Changeling is better. Great period-piece without CGI or other modern technologies require meticulous attention to details on sets and style of the period. This film succeeds in re-creating the 1920s (even if some details are not quite accurate) with terrific sets and cinematography. The script was excellent and acting was very good. Angelina isn't a great actress but she pulls off convincing scenes such as when she shows her discomfort, confusion and despair when she is alone with the boy Arthur or facing the corrupt psychiatrist. John Malkovich often seems forced and superficial in his acting, but here he plays a convincing role as a driven anti-corruption clergyman. There are plenty of films with missing children, murders, and abused women, but this film climbs a notch above an ice floe of penguins: films that are alike. The film strength is really drawn from its sense of hope. It gives and it takes like an action film with plenty of twists. You draw hope with the child off the train and then feel let down. You draw hope when Christine Collins (Angelina's character) gets a phone call from a friend and again, you feel her disappointment. Even though it is easy to know how a Hollywood-style melodramatic thriller ends, this film scores big with the idea of a mother's hope.",

            "content": "Angelina Jolie is Christine Collins, single mom who was a lead operator at the phone company, back when a bunch of ladies put calls through at a switchboard. She is so competent that her boss says she will be considered for a supervisory job, even though it was still thought back in the 1920s that most women couldn't handle such a job. But one evening when she had plans to go to a movie with her son, 9, she was called in to work. She told her son not to leave the house.Gattlin Griffith is her son Walter Collins. When mom came home Walter was not to be found in the house, nor the neighborhood, and no one had seen him. She did the only thing she knew, called the police and reported her son missing. They investigated for months without turning up anything, until one day Christine gets a call that they had found her son ... in Illinois.Her elation turned sour when she met the boy at the train station, he was not her son. Even though the police told her kids can change in 5 months, this one was 3 inches shorter and was circumcised. Later both her son's teacher and her son's dentist verified that the boy could not be Walter.But the Los Angeles police, known for corruption, were attempting to cover their incompetence by finding a son for Christine and closing the case.Another key character is John Malkovich as Rev. Gustav A. Briegleb who made it his mission in life to work to expose the corruption in the police department. He took an active part in Christine's fight and through his efforts, including his radio broadcasts, enlisted the public to help fight the cause.The whole story is historically accurate, and Angelina Jolie is superb as Christine. The movie is really her story more than anything else.SPOILERS: Even though most already know the details, Walter was one of perhaps 20 boys that were stolen off the streets of Los Angeles and taken to a ranch to be molested and killed. Although they never verified Walter's death, he was never found either. His mother never gave up hope of seeing him again. The impersonator had used Walter's name to get to Hollywood to meet Tom Mix. The case was brought against the chief and certain other members of the police department and led to positive reforms.",

The film explores child endangerment, female disempowerment, political corruption, mistreatment of mental health patients and the repercussions of violence. That's a lot of topics that needs to be talked about, and Clint Eastwood does a phenomenal job at it. I also have to praise the writer, J. Michael Straczynski for his incredible screenplay. The visual storytelling is superior and matches the writing perfectly. Fantastic cinematography and art design, Changeling is a beautiful looking film.Angelina Jolie plays the leading role brilliantly, portraying Christine Collins realistically and with so much heart. She gave one of the performances of her career, if not her best. The film also stars Jeffrey Donovan, Jason Butler Harner, John Malkovich, Michael Kelly, and Amy Ryan. Some are even based on real people, the events are also inspired by true events.I'm glad I went in blind in not knowing the story of this film, it was an amazing experience that was filled with emotional moments and some very dark ones.

The chief component that makes this drama so painful, disturbing and solid would certainly be the emotions presented by Angelina Jolie, alongside Jason Butler Harner and Eddie Alderson.You'll easily feel pure infuriation whilst you observe the treatment of the film's powerful leads, but it's a very engaging and gripping mystery that's way too disturbing and excruciating for kids to even courageous adults. Apart from the feelings portrayed by the powerful acting, this dark, historical jewel is superbly entertaining. It will never bore or disappoint true-mystery viewers.It's hard to understand how some of the critics didn't enjoy this masterpiece. Angelina Jolie's incredible performance and the fascinating true story make Changeling a completely memorable depiction of a wounding history.The film steals every parents worst nightmare and perfectly processes into a fearfully long movie. It's a must-watch for all adults, still a powerful tale for teens, but not a mystery meant for children. However, every single individual will surely stay attached to this affecting crime-drama. It's also a film that definitely takes its time to conclude, but is all an entertaining experience.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

In my opinion, there weren't any standout performances except for ANGELINA JOLIE. She made sure that she was the standout and that she is a force to be reckoned with. One could feel her pain and anguish as she goes through the trials of looking for her son. She totally captured the role and trust me it deserves an Oscar nomination. I don't know if she will get the win, but she definitely deserves the nomination. Her compassion and pain can be felt by the viewer and if you can't feel it while watching this movie, then you have no feelings. The movie did get off to a slow start, but once it picks up, it continues to bring on the excitement. Some scenes were hard to watch, but Clint's excellent direction keeps the viewer engaged and one can't help but go through the emotions. Overall, a good film, but there were a few glitches that could have made this movie \"excellently superb.\" I recommend seeing this movie.",

            "content": "It's a story about a woman who loses her son to a kidnapping and probably (because that part is left out) child molesting murderer.In the process we learn that the police is very corrupt and they even lock her up in an asylum when she refuses to accept a boy as her son, which the police provide in an attempt to make the press believe that the case is solved.But one of them, the one good cop, gets a clue which leads him directly to the mass grave of twenty murdered boys and eventually to the killer. More or less at that pace.The corrupt are punished all the way up to the mayor, procedures for committing women to insane asylums are ordered to be tightened (but were they?) and the murderer is hanged with a cowardly yelp when the trap door opens beneath him. But not even a dribble of reality escapes from his pants, over his shoes and onto the floor.And this detail encapsulates the style and mood of the entire movie. It pretends to be factual while lacking all detail. Not one character develops, even though the story spans several years. There is not one real action, or gesture that even hints at any kind of a human relationship between any of the characters. Not even between mother and son. Any sympathy between characters is suggested by the mere fact that they communicate. Nothing more.In other words: it is as flat as a pancake on which Dirty Harry himself danced a jig or two.Right at the end we are told that her son heroically helped another victim escape and may even have escaped himself. The mother replies that this means there is still hope her son is alive.Then follow the titles in which we learn that she never gave up the search, the guilty were punished and that part of LA got a new name, as if that were significant to anything else but local folklore.In short: the script presumably reads like a local history article in a high school newspaper and the acting is two dimensional. It's as if a local kid tells a story he heard some months ago but forgot all the relevant details. But he remembers it happened 'right here'.It leaves me with the feeling that so much more of a story could have been told if someone just had done their homework. And at the same time I was grateful that someone hadn't.",

            "review_title": "Clint Eastwood's overlong historical drama is dark, depressing, but deeply gripping in its roots",
            "content": "This historical drama conducted by the force of Hollywood mogul Clint Eastwood is definitely not a pleasant experience. It is dark, emotionally taxing mystery that centers on the disappearance of a woman's son, every parent's worst nightmare. With a gripping execution and powerfully rooted storytelling, Eastwood pulls almost no punches when spearing the audience with a flooring emotional atmosphere. But above the bleak subject matter is a film that shines bright light of both the directing chops of Eastwood and the acting muscles of Angelina Jolie. While the film never ventures outside of any conventions of its genre or familiar subject material, it shows that Eastwood clearly knows how to handle a compelling story without slipping into the cracks of sentimental contrivances or flimsiness. Inspired by true events, this film is set in 1928 Los Angeles where switchboard operator Christine Collins (played by Angelina Jolie) resides as a single mother of a nine-year old boy named Walter (played by Gattlin Griffith). After a day of work, Christine comes home to find Walter nowhere to be found and reaches out to the LAPD on an investigation. After months of search, LAPD successful finds the child alive and well, and when starts off as cheery mother-son reunion quickly turns dour when the child does not appear to be hers. After adamant claims against the LAPD, particularly Reverend Gustac Briegleb (played by John Malkovich), that they found the wrong child, Christine is declared mentally delusional and is admitted into a mental facility, while Detective Lester Ybarra (played by Michael Kelly) sets out on an investigation that may lead whether Christine is telling the truth or not. Clint Eastwood proves to have the muscle to take on complex stories like these, and this true-story-based drama does a magnificent job at showing it. Eastwood brings a hefty hand at bringing this mystery story in life in ways that leave viewers guessing at nearly every turn. Is Christine Collins right about the child being not hers, or is she a woman overwhelmed with emotional trauma that not realizing she lost is right there in front of here? Only the few who are familiar with the story will know the outcome, but that is not to say that Eastwood fails to keep the events within the complex trajectory unpredictable. Eastwood takes on a daunting task of not only transitioning from the lead character's part of the story (including her time in the mental asylum), to the legal trajectory of the investigation that ensues from her uncertainty, but also balancing the film's two major subplots in an even fashion. One of which centers on Christine's battle of grief with the loss of her son, and her struggle against the law enforcement who refuse to buy into her mysterious claims. The other follows Michael Kelly's investigation on a child who seems to have an odd connection with Christine's son. This all comes down to a series of shocking twists and turns that not only contribute to the grim atmosphere, but sheds light on the ethical corruption of the law enforcement. There is no doubt that Eastwood does stumble on keeping things moving at very few spots, but it boasts a strong hand at balancing these stories with solid precision. The story is gripping, and occasionally holds no bars at tugging at the heart strings.Angelina Jolie has mostly made a name for herself in taking on action roles such as 'Wanted' and the 'Tomb Raider' series. This film however, allows her to exercise a dramatic heft that defies against expectations she is brought in previous roles. Jolie shows out with an uncompromising performance that sees the actress shining with humanity and gripping acting chops. Every she is on screen, it is hard not feel the emotional devastation she leaves swarming in the air. John Malkovich leaves a strong impression in the role of Gustav Briegleb, an LAPD officer who becomes the lead character's sidekick in the second half in the heat of the battle against the law enforcement. Gattlin Griffith, a young actor in his single digits, gives a pleasant performance for his young, nothing to the ordinary to speak of. Michael Kelly boasts a fair amount of grit and integrity of his role as Detective Lester Ybarra who goes on a grueling investigation that leads to results he may forget. The rest of cast whom are all suited in small supporting roles are credible as well. Pointing out an actor that stands out among the rest would be rather difficult task, even with Angelina Jolie in the roster. Changeling is a powerful historical drama that paints a strong picture of Clint Eastwood's directorial talent and storytelling skills, and the absorbing talent of Angelina Jolie. It is a gripping experience that grabs and rarely lets go. If there is anything that chews at the film's compelling narrative, it may the overlong 141- minute runtime which seems to drag on from time to time, and of course, the grimness of the atmosphere. Above all, there is plenty of talent to be admired in this picture.",

            "content": "Here is a story which would be impossible to believe if it weren't actually true. In Los Angeles in 1928 a nine-year-old boy, Walter Collins, goes missing. Months later he is found and the LAPD sets up a triumphant, highly publicized, reunion between Walter and his mother Christine. There's a problem. Immediately upon seeing the boy Christine knows that this is not her son. Desperate for good press the LAPD is quick to hush Christine up and prods her to take the boy home on a trial basis. Seriously, that's what they said. Take him home, try him out, maybe you'll like him. Christine has little patience for this charade. She continues to insistently state the obvious. This boy is not her son. She wants answers. What she gets is a one-way ticket to the psychopathic ward.On the surface the movie appears to be about one woman's fight for the truth, her fight for her son. It's also about the incompetence and corruption of the LAPD and director Clint Eastwood unfortunately hammers that angle to death. The LAPD of this time was full of bad, vile characters. We get it. As the clich\u00e9 of the big, bad police department gets beaten into the ground there has to be the other corresponding movie clich\u00e9. That would be the one good, honest cop who wants to get to the bottom of things. And in this case getting to the bottom of things takes the movie to some very dark and horrifying places.The story of the missing Walter Collins ties into a bigger picture storyline. That bigger picture is too awful to even want to contemplate. Here give Eastwood some credit. He didn't exploit the horror. He chose to stick closely to the story of Christine Collins, her quest to find her son and her battles with the LAPD. Eastwood gives us enough information to realize the awful nature of what has been done and to understand the sick, twisted evil of the villain who is introduced into the film. But at its heart the movie is always about Christine Collins. This was a brave woman who, faced with so many obstacles, never wavered in her quest for the truth and never lost hope of being reunited with her Walter. That makes for a great story but there are too many nagging issues here to make this a truly great movie.Angelina Jolie gives a highly-charged performance in the role of Christine. But there are times she goes a little too far. Obviously there are tremendous emotional highs and lows in Christine's story but when Jolie lays it on a bit thick the effect is jarring. One scene near the end is most notable, Jolie hamming it up to such an extent it takes you out of the movie entirely. All you're thinking is \"Angie dear, come back to us.\" Many of the supporting characters fall flat, most notably Christine's main LAPD adversary, Captain Jones. He's a bland, boring, rather ineffectual foil for Christine. John Malkovich, playing well against type as a radio preacher, and Jason Butler Harner as the exceedingly eccentric villain have their moments. But other than that it's Jolie's show all the way. And her performance doesn't quite sustain the movie over a rather excessive 140 minute running time. Eastwood's relentless hammering of the LAPD wears thin rather quickly. Yes, the police in this true-life story were corrupt and incompetent and pretty much completely awful. But Eastwood belabors the point to at times tedious effect. All in all, for as fascinating a story as there is to work with, there is the sense the movie never fully ignites. It simmers but never boils.

            "content": "Where should I start? Mostly, I complain about the set designs and the atmosphere of the movies which tell stories that take place in old periods, because mostly it looks superficial, the (advanced) technical equipment of 2000s clashes with the set designs of 1930s, 1940s etc. Changeling was the first movie that I felt like it really takes place in those years (by the way, The Public Enemies was the most successful one in the sense of set design) However, the primary thing that makes Changeling a masterpiece is the script. It was perfectly written. This bloodcurdling true story wouldn't have been told better, it is a very bold movie including Clint Eastwood's direction. I believe that there are a few people who can dare to show some horrible details. Additionally, the story editing is perfect and there are many twists in the movie and it makes you flabbergasted. This is not a simply clich\u00e9 a mother's son disappears and she is involved in a thriller and tries to find her son movie. And if it is, the best one so far. The true story is very original (because it is a true story?), just listening this story makes the movie worthy! and the script writer adapts it perfectly, so makes the movie original. The first half is very mysterious, but the second half, the movie becomes mysterious again and there are some sub stories, and each one is unbelievable, horrible and Eastwood shows things blatantly obvious. Direction has no flaw at all, if it had had, the movie might have missed the opportunity of being perfect. Therefore, Changeling is another example of Eastwood's perfect direction like Million Dollar Baby or The Mystic River. I liked Angelina Jolie more by this movie and liked her character a lot too. As for Angelina Jolie's acting, she was just persuasive (may be because I kept my expectations too high) In this movie, she is so beautiful too, but her beauty, her attraction is not in the foreground at all, this may sound clich\u00e9, but it was just an information, not as a positive or negative thing. As I learned, Changeling was criticized like Eastwood was not objective on some issues such as the faith of a character that I can't tell you know because of spoiler. I don't know whether Eastwood changed some details or not, but if this is a true story, probably he did not, but it was irritating and ridiculous that the movie got criticisms like this. Changeling is in IMDb Top 250, but it is still pretty underrated and the most important, it really deserves to be there, not like some other recent movies that have entered the list because of popularity. The ending of the movie is one of the most astonishing, original and thoughtful endings I have ever seen with a simple, but thoughtful last one-liner. It left me with complex feelings, happiness, sadness and impressiveness.",

Jolie's character is incredible, not to mention that there was a Christine Collins that draws you into her Trauma's and experiences that she goes through and who stops at nothing to find out where her son has gone when he was reported missing in 1928.But the great Clint Eastwood (who I've been a huge fan ever since his westerns in front and behind the camera) gives us an insight into the corrupt L.A.P.D. during the time when they didn't care and stopped at nothing to hide the Police's force embarrassing state that they were in.Whats starts off as an emotional thriller soon turns into a bloody horror when a Gordon Northcott is introduced into the film, and the shocking truth is barley understandable, and since this is a true story is very shocking. But Jolie isn't the only one who gives out a brilliant acting performance, as does John Malkovich (who else?!) who plays Reverend Gustav Briegleb help Christine Collins uncover the truth and stop at nothing in order for the corrupt L.A.P.D. to be seen as who they are really were during the 1920's, with the odd exception to only one good cop named Detective Lester Ybarra, played well by Michael Kelly.Therefore the conclusion is ended in a very tense courtroom battle. But the term 'hope' is not just for Jolie's character, but for everyone who lived during that time where there was so much horror and depressing times that there was a time to stop and change matters thanks for a Mrs Christine Collins who says during one brilliant sequence, \"finishing the fight.\"Once again Mr Clint Eastwood is still directing his finest films still, from Unforgiven (still my favourite!) to Million Dollar Baby, and bringing out memorable acting performances, e.g. Sean Penn, Hillary Swank, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman.Now Hollywood can agree that they have one of the finest actor's/Director's of all time, and has produced yet another Masterpiece.Bring On Gran Torino!",

Changeling is another type of horror film. As a parent of two young boys This movie hit me deeply where I lived. The Story is a matter of fact In Los Angles March of 1928 christine Collins a phone operater supervisor came home after working a Overtime shift to find her son Walter Collins age nine missing. She phones the police only to find a police department that not only doesn't care but is useless. The Cops come out only after she pleads with them they inform her 24 hours must pass before Walter can be considered missing.when the cops come out they find Nothing. the trail is Stone cold. Christine Collins is understandably angry and scared while the police seem to not be able to do anything nor do they even seem to care if she finds her son. during this time she finds at first a strange ally in rev.Gustav Briegleb Wonderfully played by John Malkovich He actually is one of the film's Biggest saving graces. Briegleb is the Reverand of a church but while he serves the community he makes it clear his mission is to bring down the Corrupt LAPD his church prays for Christine Collins to find her son. A Tale Briegleb uses on his nightly Radio broadcasts. Then Five months later a boy calling himself Walter Collins is found and brought home. One Problem the boy is not her son and the LAPD begins to browbeat her into accepting the boy as hers. Christine Collins and Briegleb soon create a problem for the LAPD the police force is full of arm breakers and gunmen with no real detectives on the force they see no end to the problem except one admit her to a insane asylum before she goes nation wide and becomes more of a problem and a liability for the LAPD. She has Embarrassed them plenty and that they will not take lightly. Meanwhile a LAPD Detective on a routine case finds out about a murder spree of Young Boys committed by Gordon Northcott and his Young Nephew one of the victims may be Walter Collins the horror of this case causes him to buck the system and to try and bring Northcott to justice, Eastwood directs with a strong firm hand and Angela Jolie does a outstanding job in what may very well be the best performance of her career. The movie is filled with suspense Horror anger and love and it ends on a note of Hope. This as I told my wife may very well be one of the best movies I have ever seen.

That said most of the sequences, though being a bit too much melodramatic, are powerful and the legal/courtroom ending is also effective. Eastwood has here evoked also a typical Hollywood style, in the sense that all the events don't show up in a rush, allowing the story to develop at a pace that could be defined natural. Angelina Jolie is truly impressive and really fits her role, never lacking credibility or pathos (absolutely necessary for the part she played).",

Angelina Jolie shines in her Oscar-nominate role a a single-mother whose son goes missing in 1928 Los Angeles. Meanwhile, the LAPD is under public scrutiny at the time and very eager to solve the missing boy case as soon as possible. This film is very engaging, always interesting, and very well acted. I was very impressed with the way it was shot, the set decorations as well as Eastwood's entire approach to the project. It was stylistically different than Mystic River or Million Dollar Baby, an on the same level of those films (much better than Million Dollar Baby which i consider a great film but not flawless). The supporting cast was perfect as well as Malkovich, Donovan and Amy Ryan all gave refreshing performance. There are some amazing scenes between Malkovich and Donovan, Malkovich and Jolie and Jolie and Donovan. Despite this film being a tear-jerker, a bit frustrating to watch early on, it definitely pays off, and is a big achievement for Eastwood. I enjoyed every bit of it, and highly recommend it to any fan of good Drama films. 10/10 #35 on my list of all time favorite films.",

I was very curious about CHANGELING because I like the Work of Clint Eastwood he did as Director. The Story is about a Mother who lost her son. Something like that must be terrible for a mother. The Mother never stopped to looking for her kid and I thought the same would have done my Mother too. I lost my mother some years ago and this movie reminded me a lot of her and touched me. Angelina Jolie is wonderful as Mother and she was perfect as young self confident woman around 1928. Her acting surprised me; she was totally believable and moving in her role. Maybe one of the best acting in her career.The second thing I admired was the scenery and the photography of CHANGELING. I really thought that it was like a Window to another Time long ago. The supporting cast around the all time great John Malkovich was also very convincing in their roles. I enjoyed CHANGELING for me it's a movie with Grit and strong performances. The slow music which sounds sad but also hope was a good choice. It might have a slow start but soon I was in the powerful story and not a single moment bored or annoyed. I couldn't take my eyes of this carefully photographed Movie.Thank You Mr. Eastwood; thank You Ms. Jolie for these wonderful and suspenseful two hours.

The story of the child going missing and a different boy being presented to the mother by LAPD seems made for a movie, even without the even more horrific subplot of what actually happened to the boy.Jolie is good as the mother but,not her fault I know, you never forget who she is, with those amazing eyes and lips in nearly every scene. At times, especially given the main theme and some very disturbing scenes, the film strays uncomfortably into sentimentality.

            "content": "So you're Clint Eastwood, everybody knows you're a patriot, a conclusion gleaned from the fact that the man just shot two WWII movies back to back. So what does a Sarah Palin supporter do for an encore? You pull the rug out from under everybody's feet, that's what. \"The Changeling\" is a melodrama like how \"Unforgiven\" was a western. There's a prism, shot, of course, with the luxury of hindsight that underlines the dated sensibilities of the original incarnation. In the 1992 Academy Award-winning picture, the filmmaker demythologized the genre by examining the morality of violence through the eyes of an aging gunslinger. This time, the emotional violence inherent in melodrama, or what was considered as women's pictures, is foregrounded by our awareness that Lars Von Trier's \"Dancer in the Dark\"(itself a product of \"weepies\" such as King Vidor's \"Stella Dallas\") informs this period-piece melodrama. Von Trier, well-known to the international film community as being vehemently anti-American, would seem like an unlikely inspirational for this card-carrying Republican, who proves to be a true maverick by answering \"Flags of our Fathers\" and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" with a film that stealthily attacks the ideology of our country.\"The Changeling\" takes place in the dark ages, the late-twenties, an era where women were expected to be homemakers, not breadwinners, and above all else, to be subservient towards men. As Spencer Tracy put it to Katherine Hepburn in George Cukor's \"Adam's Rib\", \"I want a wife, not a competitor!\" And mind you, this was 1949. If a woman tried to get ahead, like Stella Dallas(Barbara Stanwyck) does in the 1937 remake that bears her namesake, the woman was usually punished for having desires that existed outside the sanctity of the prescribed domains mapped out for her kind. In \"The Changeling\", Christine Collins(Angelina Jolie) is a supervisor at a telephone company. While the row of women are seated at their switchboards, Christine glides on by them; her feet enabled by rollerskates, her position of authority enabled by a man. The scene where her boss promises Christine a managerial job is two-fold for its dual existence in time. At the outset of the opening credits, the filmmaker employs the original Universal insignia, which has the effect of orientating the audience to purview \"The Changeling\" as a contemporary film of its time: the late-twenties. Christine's boss seemingly pats himself on the back while he offers his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 his kudos, and while it may play like condescension to our modern sensibilities, our postulated late-twenties selves are asked to find his behavior normal, as we consider the context of her promotion, an era when women bosses were more than likely, in short supply. In keeping with the genre requirements of melodrama, Christine is punished for being something other than a mother or a wife. On her day off, on a day when Christine promised her son Walter(Gattlin Griffith) a day at the movies, the mother is asked to sub for a sick supervisor. When we next see her at work, the skates are off; Christine's nonchalance conveyed by her gliding is replaced by the more humble act of walking. In her office, on the phone in tears, she's just like all the women, in a seated position, as her amorous boss walks past the doorway. The red on her lips has been superseded by the red in her bloodshot eyes. Christine gets her just desserts for being a siren to her boss. Late in \"The Changeling\", Christine is punished again, in a scene that evokes \"Stella Dallas\", the bereft woman is forced to look at somebody else's happiness, through a window(just like Stella, who watches her daughter get married), as a woman and child are reunited after a long spell, in which all of the missing children were presumed dead. The preceding scene is especially cruel because the caller should have been more specific, more sensitive, when referring to the found child. Christine's expectations, not to mention, the audience's expectations are raised, as the caller relays to our heroine that \"a child has been found.\" Christine must think she means her Walter. It's a shrewd bit of audience manipulation when we learn, along with Christine, at the police station, that it's not her child who has been recovered. \"The Changeling\" most resembles \"Dancer in the Dark\" at the hanging. As the killer stands on the platform, he half-sings \"thirteen steps\", a reference to Bjork's \"107 Steps\"; also, he warbles \"Silent Night\" under a black hood. In the Von Trier film, the Icelandic pop princess sings \"The Next-to-Last Song\" in the same a capella style. Earlier, the killer buys a bus ticket to Seattle(the setting for Selma's cross-bearing, and Walter, in what was to be his last words, tells Christine that he's \"not afraid of the dark...not afraid of anything.\" In referencing \"Dancer in the Dark\", Christine's happiness about finally having \"hope\", concerning her missing child, makes such faith in Walter's aliveness seem like the ultimate torture, the ultimate expression of melodrama's dark side. To be loyal to a dead child takes precedence over her professional accomplishments, and only then, by keeping the mother in limbo, in perpetuity, can Christine be considered a good woman.",

It's going to be upsetting, it's going to be authentic and its going to be a beautiful movie, these no doubting that. At this point though, it all seems like Oscar Bait, abit like The English Patient. Where Changeling differs is the films ability to tell a intriguing story without seeming pretentious. Its handle with graft and care if not a whole load of originality.What will attract moist to the movie is Angelina Jolie's performance, almost unrecognizable as a struggling mother; it's hard to comprehend the fact that this was the same woman who only a few months ago played a tomboyish assassin in \"Wanted\". This movie is crafted so well, every character in this movie done with the utmost attention from the writers and while most might complaining about the excessive running length, for me this film needed to be that long. It's that complex and there are that many story arcs that it's a necessary formula.Inspired by actual events that occurred in 1920s-era Los Angeles, Clint Eastwood's The Changeling tells the story of a woman driven to confront a corrupted LAPD after her abducted son is retrieved and she begins to suspect that the boy returned to her is not the same boy she gave birth to.The year was 1928, and the setting a working-class suburb of Los Angeles. As Christine (Angelina Jolie) said goodbye to her son, Walter, and departed for work, she never anticipated that this was the day her life would be forever changed. Upon returning home, Christine was distressed to discover that Walter was nowhere to be found.Over the course of the following months, the desperate mother would launch a search that would ultimately prove fruitless. Yet just when it seemed that all hope was lost, a nine-year-old boy claiming to be Christine's son seemed to appear out of thin air. Overcome with emotions and uncertain how to face the authorities or the press, Christine invites the child to stay in her home despite knowing without a doubt that he is not her son. This story's resolution, while decent felt a little disjointed to me. While it would have done fine ending at one key moment, Eastwood Carries the film along for too long making it feel as if it has as many endings as Return of the King. This is not a best director picture film for me. I love what Eastwood does but its all very familiar grounds, its the other elements, the superb acting, the astounding source material, the well scripted story and the orchestral score. These elects fit together so seamlessly that it would almost be a tragedy if this want in the running for best picture. While with Angelina Jolie, I think its a sure-fire answer over what's she's taking home come award season.Verdict: A competent, cleverly crafted period piece that combines all of its elements so seamlessly it dabbles on perfection. The lack of flair and originality shown by Eastwood is a bit of a letdown but Changeling rivals his best movies.",

            "content": "Once again, Clint Eastwood gives us a thought provoking and deeply emotional film. The Changeling. It was much better than I expected. A true story of an LA woman in the late 1920's, who's son is kidnapped and the LAPD decides to substitute another child and demonstrably makes the woman believe it is her son, despite her protestations. Angelina Jolie does a great job as the mother, Christine Collins in an emotionally gut wrenching role. I loved how she was living out her imaginary circumstances. Powerful stuff. John Malkovich portrays the Rev. Gustav Briegleb, who is on a crusade to bring the LAPD's corruption and wrong doings to light. I heard many reviews citing that character is being manipulative and using Christine Collins for his own gain. Not sure of the actual story, but in the film, I disagree with that assessment, I think the Reverend was portrayed as a hero and the lone voice in the wilderness that would listen to Christine Collins and do what he could to help. Malkovich is as fine as ever.As for the LAPD, excellent performance by Jeffrey Donovan as the cold and heartless Captain Jones, who torments Christine Collins. Primarily a television actor, Donovan was very good as a man you love to hate. Colm Feore, portrays Police Chief Davis in a somewhat lesser role but did a decent job as well.The sub plot to Changeling is equally riveting. A kidnapped Canadian boy forced to helping a serial killer slay children and somehow this all gets enmeshed in the Christine Collins story. I was impressed by Jason Butler Harner as Gordon Northcott. I have never seen him before. Another predominant television actor, but he has good chops and I enjoyed his performance.And of course the film would be nowhere without the talents of Clint Eastwood. Time and again, he keeps showing us what a remarkable film maker he truly is. As an actor's director, I would love to work with him some day, if I am fortunate enough. Changeling is hard to imagine being a true story, considering all that goes on in the film. I am surprised it has gotten little Oscar recognition, especially Angelina has been practically written off in pre Oscar balloting. But, she excellent and a lot better than Kate Winslet in The Reader. I give Changeling 4 Stars. Check it out.",

Police officers are oh-so-bad; the vile kidnapper is a hammy caricature. And the extended sequences that portray the fate of not just one, but a group of abducted children are horrible. Given he covered similar terrain in Mystic River (another film wildly overrated), can Mr Eastwood please move on from his obsession with murdered children. Get back to exploring the ethology of the Wild West, Clint - your two best films as a director are Unforgiven and Pale Rider.Expect recognition come awards time for Jolie, but the film fails to engage its audience and will not be remembered as one of Clint Eastwoods finer moments.",

Angelina Jolie delivers a refreshing performance which proves she does not need action or glamour to carry a starring role. It would be very easy for any woman playing such an emotional part to slip into hysterical over-acting but instead she delivers a beautifully understated study of a mother living through the worst nightmare any parent can imagine. Add a supporting cast of top-shelf talent, and a good period atmosphere, to what is an incredible true story and we get a must-see movie.",

And it's an amazing true story that doesn't need any unnecessary effects added to it. Through cinematography and direction, the sense of menace and evil are very effectively put across, not just concerning the pedophile who calmly abducts and kills children, but from a corrupt police department that is more concerned about looking good and scoring political points than about the truth. John Malkovich is magnificent as the pastor who befriends the mother of the missing boy, played by Angelina Jolie. His character may be one of those media savvy, loud and crusading religious leaders, but you get a sense his heart is in the right place, and his speaking out, in this case, is effective in pointing out moral wrongs. Jolie is a little too glamorous to play the part of the grieving mother, I feel, but she does bring a certain quiet sorrow and empathy to the role. She is serious and committed to the character.",

            "content": "Wineville Chicken Coop Murders From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaGordon NorthcottThe Wineville Chicken Coop Murders[1] (also known as the Wineville Chicken Murders[2]) were a series of kidnapping and murders, occurring in Los Angeles and Riverside County, California from 1928 through 1930. The case received nationwide attention, and events related to it exposed corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department.[2] The 2008 film Changeling is based upon events related to this case.The murders In September 1928, the Los Angeles Police Department visited the Northcott Ranch in Wineville, Riverside County.[5] In 1926, Sanford Clark, the then-14-year-old nephew of ranch owner Gordon Stewart Northcott, had been taken by Northcott from his home in Saskatchewan, Canada. Clark was beaten and sexually abused by Northcott, before a family member informed police of the situation.[6] Police found Clark at the ranch and took him into custody. Clark claimed that Northcott had kidnapped, molested and killed several young boys with the help of Northcott's apparent mother\u0097Sarah Louise Northcott\u0097and the forced participation of Clark himself.[5] The police found no complete bodies at the site, but discovered body parts, the personal effects of missing children, and blood-stained axes. Clark said quicklime was used to dispose of the remains and the bones had been dumped in the desert.[6] The Northcotts had fled to Canada, but they were arrested near Vernon, British Columbia.[2][6] Case and trial Sarah Louise Northcott initially confessed to the murders,[6] including that of 9-year-old Walter Collins. She later retracted her statement, as did Gordon Northcott, who had confessed to killing five boys.[5] On February 8, 1929, after a 27-day trial in Riverside County, California before Judge George R. Freeman, Gordon Northcott was convicted of the murders of Lewis and Nelson Winslow (12 and 10 respectively),[7] who went missing from Pomona on May 16, 1928,[8] and an unidentified Mexican boy,[6] though it was believed the killings could have numbered as many as 20.[9] The jury heard that he kidnapped, molested, tortured, killed, and dismembered these and other boys throughout 1928. On February 13, 1929, Judge Freeman sentenced Northcott to be hanged.[10] The sentence was carried out on October 2, 1930.[2][11] Sarah Louise Northcott was convicted of Walter Collins' murder. She was sentenced to life and served her sentence at Tehachapi State Prison.[12] She was paroled after serving less than 12 years of her sentence.[13][14][14] During the trial Gordon Northcott learned that Sarah Louise, who he had thought was his mother, was actually his grandmother.[15] Sarah Louise stated that Gordon was the result of incest that her husband, Cyruss George Northcott, committed against their daughter Winifred.[16]Walter Collins (9) went missing from Los Angeles on March 10, 1928,[17] after having been given money by his mother to go to the cinema. His disappearance received nationwide attention, and the Los Angeles Police Department followed up on hundreds of leads without success.[5] The police faced negative publicity and increasing public pressure to solve the case,[18] until five months after Walter's disappearance,[5] when a boy claiming to be Walter was found in DeKalb, Illinois. Letters and photographs were exchanged, before Collins paid for the boy to be brought to Los Angeles. A public reunion was organized by police, who hoped the successful resolution would counteract the negative publicity they had received for their inability to solve this case and others. They also hoped the uplifting human interest story would deflect attention from a series of corruption scandals that had hit the department. At the reunion, Collins claimed that the boy was not Walter. She was told by the officer in charge of the case, police Captain J.J Jones, to take the boy home to \"try him out for a couple of weeks\". Collins agreed.[18]Three weeks later, Collins returned to see Captain Jones and persisted in her claim that the boy was not Walter. Even though she was armed with dental records proving her case, Jones had Collins committed to the psychopathic ward at Los Angeles County Hospital under a \"Code 12\" internment\u0097a term used to jail or commit someone who was deemed difficult or an inconvenience. During Collins' incarceration, Jones questioned the boy,[5] who admitted to being 12-year-old Arthur Hutchins Jr., a runaway from Illinois but who was originally from Iowa.[19][20] A diner at a roadside caf\u00e9 in Illinois had told Hutchins of his resemblance to the missing Walter, so Hutchins came up with the plan to impersonate him. His motive was to get to Hollywood so he could meet his favorite actor, Tom Mix.[18] Collins was released ten days after Hutchins admitted that he was not her son,[21] and filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department.[5] This aspect of the case is depicted in the 2008 film Changeling.[6]Collins went on to win her lawsuit and was awarded $10,800, which Jones never paid.[5] Five years after Northcott's execution, one of the boys that Northcott allegedly killed was found alive and well. As Walter Collins' body had not been found, Christine Collins still hoped that Walter had survived. She continued to search for him all her life unsuccessfully, until she faded into obscurity without ever knowing her son's fate.[22] The last public record of Christine Collins is from 1941, when she attempted to collect a $15,562 judgment against Capt. J.J. Jones, retired police officer, in Superior Court.[23] Arthur J. Hutchins, Jr. later wrote in 1933 how and why he fooled the police, the real missing Walter's closest friends, and even Walter's dog and cat in 1928. Hutchins biological mother died when he was 9. He pretended to be Walter Collins to get as far away as possible from his stepmother.",

            "content": "\"Changeling\" begins with the old-fashioned Universal Pictures logo and it really sets up what's to come. If this story were set today, a DNA test could have ended this movie in 5 minutes but it's set during the late 1920's, which makes it a complicated mess worthy of being unraveled by a big Hollywood movie. The film is based, unbelievably, on a true story about a Los Angeles woman who loses her son. The LAPD finds who they believe to be him, but its not him. It's a strange story and in less competent hands it could have gone way off track but Clint Eastwood is at the helm and a fantastic cast including Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich are out right in front. \"Changeling\" is dense and twisty but it remains interesting nonetheless.Jolie plays Christine Collins, a switchboard supervisor who comes home one day to find that her 9-year old son Walter is missing. It's during this time that the LAPD is already under constant scrutiny for its corruption and incompetence, even being the focus of sermons given by Pastor and radio evangelist Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). Christine is about to get a good look at how they do business when she gets a call that her son has been found. Only when arriving at a train station to see him, she knows immediately that the boy is an imposter. This leads to many verbal sparring matches between her and Capt. J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) and to police reports in the newspaper that Christine is neurotic and an unfit mother. Jones even goes so far as to throw her in a mental institution, where more police corruption is revealed to her by an inmate (Amy Ryan). Her only support comes from the pastor and from one good cop investigating murders committed by a serial killer (Jason Butler Harner) at a ranch.The movie is more of a chronicle than an emotional journey. It takes us down one path only to yank us down another one later on, going from the sad loss of a son, to a ludicrously shocking display of how the police use their power, to the grisly and disturbing murders committed at the ranch, and finally to the inevitable trials and calls for justice. This movie has a lot to cover and really doesn't spend much time trying to pull at the heartstrings in between. The timeline of events is shocking, ugly and is pretty much guaranteed to leave you fascinated and disturbed just I wish the story stopped every once in a while to dive into character psyches. But regardless, I liked the sort-of chess match being played between Collins and the police, her move being the constant evidence against this boy being her son and theirs being the laughably awful explanations to the contrary, my favorite being that shock can lead to \"spine shrinkage.\" And again this is an uncomfortable yet probing film from Eastwood about the evil that men can do and if you can handle it there is a lot worth watching here.Eastwood's film is also very authentic. The cars, big red trains and drab looking costumes all look very 1920's. And amid all this background and design is Angelina Jolie, one of those old-fashioned Ava Gardner-type beauties who seems to fit into everything like a glove. There hasn't been a lot of talk concerning the Best Actress race this year but that should change with Jolie, who fills the character with fight, determination, and a strong sense of hope. Her best quality though is that she brings a restrained dignity to the role, never falling into a melodramatic trap once. Malkovich is phenomenal, providing us with a character whose rock-solid both in his intelligence and in his resolve. And the villains also shine, Jeffrey Donovan giving a slick and slimy performance while Jason Butler Harner makes for a disgustingly pathetic and sick human being.\"Changeling\" works as a report. It's more of a this happened, this happened, then this happened type of movie, with the characters going through motions. But that's really the only thing that keeps the movie from being really exceptional. The cast does fine work and fills the emotional holes the best they can and Eastwood again makes a compelling movie about the evil in the hearts of men. \"Changeling\" could have been better but it's good nonetheless.",

            "content": "The truth is a tricky construct. Words are uttered and, depending on who says them, they are afforded a certain level of belief. Sometimes the truth is so entirely outlandish that believing it is a struggle. And sometimes that struggle is worth it because the truth has the potential to enlighten and call for change. The truth in a movie is almost inherently a falsehood. The intention of telling the truth may be genuine but film requires reconstruction and subjectivity in order for its message to be told. So when Clint Eastwood's latest directorial effort, CHANGELING, announces at its very start that what we are about to bear witness to is a true story, a certain weight is lent while a certain caution is exercised. The truth here is that a boy by the name of Walter Collins was abducted in 1928 and the boy that was returned to his mother, Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), five months later was not her son, but rather a boy claiming to be her son. The thought that no one believed her truthful claims is a wide stretch to begin with and Eastwood, despite setting a complete scene, did not ultimately convince me that any of this actually happened.Of course, to some extent, much of the story did happen. In the late 1920's and early 1930's, Los Angeles played home to an atrocious set of serial murders known then as the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Walter Collins was said to be a victim of these horrible crimes, in which a man by the name of Gordon Northcott (played in the film by Jason Butler Harner), would lure young boys back to his run down ranch, lock them up in chicken coops and torture them before ultimately killing them like helpless animals and burying their bodies in his backyard. At the same time, a boy by the name of Arthur Hutchens Jr. claimed to be the missing Collins boy in order to get a free ride from Iowa to California. When Christine Collins told the police that this was not her son \u0096 something Jolie says repeatedly in the film like a beautiful but busted record \u0096 they tried to convince her that she was mistaken and confused. She pushed and was eventually incarcerated in the psychiatric ward of the L.A. county hospital for her supposed delusions. She was released ten days later when Hutchens finally admitted he was not Walter Collins.The facts are what they are but yet somehow, when Eastwood tells the story, it seems ridiculous and CHANGELING becomes a disappointing experience because you want for it to be better than it is. Cinematographer, Tom Stern, shoots Patrick M. Sullivan Jr.'s delicate and detailed art direction with a soft sensitivity that births an encompassing sense of nostalgia for a time I never knew. And it always surprises me just how breathtaking Jolie is. As the single mother at the center of this controversy, she is composed and determined one moment and fragile and frightened the next. Sometimes, she is all of these things and more at the same time. Unfortunately for Jolie, she seems to keep picking prestige projects where she outshines the material itself. J. Michael Straczynski's script is overly facile as it chalks up all of Collins' difficulties to her being a woman, that ever-emotional creature that cannot possibly function with reason. And Eastwood has all of her male aggressors adopt that same mentality. So when a doctor tells Christine Collins that of course it is possible that her boy shrunk three inches after this ordeal and that she cannot see this because she is a woman and has no objectivity, we chuckle at how ludicrous this is instead of recoil at the horror.Throughout CHANGELING, you can feel Eastwood's sense of accomplishment. There he is behind the lens, standing up straight and proud. He is the champion of women's rights, exposing injustices and not afraid be the man that does so. What he doesn't see on the other side of his smug sense of accomplishment is that he is actually detracting from Christine Collins' plight by oversimplifying the whole affair. The specific details can never truly be exposed but this truly happened and by trying to tell his limited take on the truth, Eastwood has turned the truth into a bad joke.",

This movie features a brilliant performance of many of the actors involved, John Malkovich acts with excellence and transmits a lot of concern in every time he appears on the film, but that's not a surprise as he's one of the greatest actors we can enjoy, besides this performance, Jolie in amazing, and she shows herself as a really concerned and suffering mother, desperately looking for answers regarding what she loves the most, she doesn't overact at all, one thing to point out is that she usually performs a non sensitive sexy man eater, but in this film, from beginning to end, you can feel that she's a really sensitive painful mother. There's lots of great acting in the movie, Jeffrey Donovan does a great job as well as Jason Butler Harner, they definitely got into they're characters with passion . I just can say that this kind of movies are the ones that are worth watching, it's completely beautiful, to your eyes to your ears (wonderful music) and the most important of all. It's a deeply intense experience that will surely touch your heart.Just one more thing to say, and that's all, Thank you very much for your work Mr. Eastwood, I hope that your work inspire young directors and actors, by now you're for me one of the best drama directors of all times.",

            "review_title": "Very odd and not in a good way!",
            "content": "Having heard good things about this film and read much about the background to the case I watched 'Changeling' with high hopes. The film opened well, wonderful attention to detail and an unearthly quality which I felt added tension and unease to the film. In fact, unease was my overall reaction to this film. This unease might have been positive, in that it was engendered by the unpleasant deaths of the children or the suffering of Walter's mother or that of the 'patients' at the institution. However the unease was I think caused by the oddly detached performance of Jolie and the clinical nature of the CGI and sets. Everything appeared as though shot through a thick slice of glass. The main, very obvious fault with this film is one neither cast nor director could hope to fully overcome. That is it's breadth. It attempts to cover aspects of the abduction and murder of children by a serial killer and his trial and execution. The systematic mistreatment of patients in an institution. The (undisclosed) relationship between a radio preacher and whistle-blower and the mother of the abducted child. The corruption endemic in the LAPD during the period and it's treatment by the press and eventual prosecution. Unfortunately the film doesn't venture in any depth into any of the above themes, it merely scratches their surface. Without doubt, I would have liked the film to concentrate near exclusively on Collins and the pastor and the ambiguous nature of her search and their relationship. Two further things omitted from the film were Collins culpability, having left the child unattended and secondly the glaring absence of any father or extended family. Perhaps if Eastwood had narrowed the films scope, combining that with the ambiguities inherent in the story and the claustrophobic camera work a more satisfying product may have emerged. Despite it's many faults this films' oddity, if anything serves as a mild recommendation, even if the complex story behind it proves more interesting.",

            "content": "As a cinema addict I just wish some directors were granted immortality as an accolade for their genius gifts to the world. In the same way I'm mad at Kurt Kobain, Ernest Hemingway and Edgar Allen Poe for instigating their own premature deaths, I'm mad at The Almighty himself for allowing the greats to perish. The Hollywood old timers strike me as only refining and honing their skills as the hourglass empties. Lumet's aptitude, at age 84, showed again in the uncompromising masterpiece 'Before The Devil Knows You're Dead' and here Clint Eastwood proves he's still sharp as a tack at age 78. Eastwood, not in the least as a result of his role in the 'Dirty Harry' series assumed to be extremely conservative, surprised friend and foe in 2004 with the truly remarkable euthanasia drama 'Million Dollar Baby'. Here the symbol of cool and machismo parents a feminist movie. 'Changeling' lends itself excellently for analysis as it's a movie with many faces. First it's a character drama, second it's a political thriller laying bare some sensitive veins of the LA police department, third it's a courtroom drama and fourth, some scenes remind us strongly of 'Mystic River', it's a crime thriller centering around the notorious Wineville chicken murderers. Luckily for us, Clint uses almost 2.5 hours of celluloid to tell the complicated story so every arch gets the attention it merits. I'm positive Eastwood had the studio breathing down his neck during post-production, any film over 2hours runtime is by definition less suitable for promotion, luckily for true and patient movie fans like us here on IMDb Clint Easwood has the courage of his convictions. The movie opens with a short tracking shot sketching a '20s middle class neighborhood, accompanied by a delicate, elegant tune, composed by Clint Eastwood himself. He earlier brought forth a remarkable, moving score for 'Grace is Gone' last year. First the picture's completely b&w and then the colors slowly drip in, still leaving a pretty bleak color look at the end of the opening credits. Christine Collins (portrayed by Angelina Jolie) and her son wake up and start their run-in-the-mill Saturday. However, an emergency causes her to have to rush back to work for a short while; meanwhile her young son gets left home alone. Her work ends late and when she returns home she finds he's nowhere to be found. In a state of panic, she calls the police and to her astonishment they don't take her cry for help seriously at all. Months go by until finally the notoriously corrupt and unscrupulous L.A.P.D claim to have found the boy. When she reunites with him at the train station, another unwelcome surprise awaits namely the boy is not her son. Hungry for positive press coverage, they manipulate Christine's mother instinct ('the boy has nowhere else to go') into taking the boy 'home'. Several inches shorter and circumcised, the kid is obviously not hers but the stubborn LAPD possesses immense powers (they're judge, jury and executioner) and when Christine insists on renewing the search for her son, they bend the rules to declare her insane. I have not scratched the surface of the compelling true story here but my space is limited. Needless to say, the story's unlike anything you've ever seen - I can't recall a movie dealing intensely with police corruption since L.A. Confidential - and the cast's performances do justice to it. Jolie's Christine Collins is complex - the actress is not afraid to throw her whole acting weight into the heavy scenes but understates the rest of the time(surely by Eastwood's advice)- a good-natured woman with no ulterior motives, no message to spread or agenda to push, as she states multiple times: 'She just wants her son back'. Jason Butler Harner, introduced late, steals the film as the disturbing, hell-fearing child killer, the rest of the cast also hand in great work (even though Jeffrey Donovan's Irish accent fails hilariously).'Changeling' makes for another excellent addition to Clint Eastwood's oeuvre, whose multiple faces will make it pleasing for many demographics, a sure-fire new classic. It establishes Eastwood and Jolie once again in their status as two the most redoubtable in the business.",

            "content": "Changeling has Clint Eastwood donning the director's hat and Angelina Jolie in the lead role. The movie is set in the year 1928 and is based on a true story. Being a Clint Eastwood fan, it is with great expectations that I went and saw this movie. A couple of hours later, the movie ended and there were a plethora of emotions inside of me. Yet another film by Clint Eastwood had had a deep impact on me! The struggle of a woman to find her lost son is a long grueling search that turns into a fight against a corrupt police force and an immoral establishment of the city of Los Angeles in the year of 1928. The film highlights the grave injustice the ordinary citizens had to face during that time by the very establishment that was meant to serve and protect them.If you thought that L.A Confidential showed the dark side of the Los Angeles Police Department then Changeling shows it as a living hell where the words - justice and morals didn't exist in the dictionary. That such travesties happened in the most powerful democracy in the world is both shocking and shameful.Changeling is as engaging a drama as it can get! An interesting story is brilliantly executed. The effort put in by the screenplay writer is clearly evident when during the run time of 139 minutes, not once do you feel that the plot is dragging and saying anything too much or too less. Clint Eastwood's school of cinema is often conventional and focuses on the story. Changeling too is a story well told. On one hand Clint shows the shallowness of a corrupt system and on the other hand he shows the strength and perseverance of a mother which serve as a wakeup call to set things right in the system.It is the toughest challenge to base a movie in the 1920s and make it seem real and the last time it was done well was in the 2001 Tom Hanks starer 'Road to Perdition'. It is the brilliant cinematography in Changeling that gives the film that highly authentic feel in which you are submerged and lost in those 2 hours, witnessing first hand, the mystery unfolding. The backdrop of the city of Los Angeles is after Angelina Jolie, the most important character in the movie. Changeling is high on production values! The film is A + on production values be it the artwork, the cinematography or the costumes and makeup of the characters. It says a lot when you drape the sexiest woman in the world with loose fitted garments and make it seem real! And let's talk about Angelina Jolie. I, for long have maintained that she due to her sexy body and those luscious lips she has got more than her due and is overrated as an actress. But now, after having watched this movie, I eat my words! From frame to frame Angelina dominates with her intensity and her subtlety. One feels the excruciating pain and desperation of her character. Like in that horror of a scene when you jump out of your seat crying for help when she is about to get the electrical shock at the asylum or in that scene where she screams and asks the convict whether he indeed killed her son or not! Her performance is highly deserving of an Oscar.The supporting characters of the comforting Reverand, the menace that is Captain Jones, the heinous killer - Northcott, and the morally upright Detective Ybaraa are played well by the different actors and deserve a high amount of praise.\"Changeling\" is a rather depressing movie but it inspires tremendous courage in you. Courage to stand up the next time you face injustice!",

Starring the inimitable and devastatingly gorgeous Angelina Jolie as Mrs. Christine Collins.The story tracks the disappearance of young Walther Collins and the subsequent calamity caused by the LAPD during the period in question. When the little boy goes missing and is apparently recovered 5 months later, Mrs. Collins vehemently protests that it was indeed not her son who was returned to her.In a cloak and dagger world of crooked cops Changeling goes to great pains to portray the angst and determination of a mother longing for her son's return.Jolie's performance is adequate but certainly not Oscar worthy. Clint Eastwood has delivered another fine production.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood has established himself as one of not just one of America's greatest actors and directors, but his influence and inspiration to many in the film industry and die-hard Clint fans alike.Some of his best films noticeably The Dirty Harry movies being one of the most famous. I could rhapsodise about countless others, but then I would be veering off with what the review should be about, which is this film Changeling.Sufficed to say Eastwood promises so much and once again delivers. This true fact story is basically about a single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) in 1920s Los Angeles whose son Walter goes missing when she comes home from work.Five months later the LAPD call with the news that her son has been found. Captain J.J Jones (Jefferey Donovan) escorts her to the train station. But it turns she's not his son and despite all evidence to the contrary the LAPD dismiss her claims.The more she tries to insist the boy they have bought back is not her son the more mentally unhinged she seems and eventually Captain Jones declares her unfit mother who has gone insane and throws her into a Pcychiatric institution.I could go on but sufficed to say she fight back and campaign's to expose the police corruption and help find what happened to her son with the help of Reverend Gustav Brieglib (John Malkovich) and pro bono lawyer S.S Hahn (Geoff Pierson) Eventually a man named Gordon Northcott is apprehended for the crime (Jason Butler Harner) and the whole case changes LA forever.This film is 141 minutes long. You might think quite a stretch but the story is so interesting and gripping. The time will fly by. Credit has to go Eastwood first of all. His direction is flawless. He has an attitude where he actually wants to tell a story not merely turn a profit.The design of 1920s Los Angeles is marvellous to visual at. The tone and the essence of the period is captured beautifully with the vehicles of the time to the costumes worn of the period.Eastwood knows precisely what camera angles to use from when Jolie is anguished at her son going missing, but he never overdoes it. He gives the actors there chance to breathe and reveal there characters in real depth and understanding and allows them to explore there own abilities.What also helps is the immaculate performances given off. There isn't a weak one anywhere. To say the acting is excellent is an understatement. There is Oscar winning stuff here. Jolie for example gives the performance of her life. She plays Christine so convincingly, the audience (I certainly did) feel the pain and suffering of every scene. This movie has done Jolie wonders. In other films like Tombraider or Mr. and Mrs Smith she has come off a good actress but her image has always been thrust into the limelight. Not in Changeling, her acting is raw and real.It's not just Jolie that is terrific here but Jason Butler is memorably creepy as Northcott, Jefferey Donovan as Jones dominates his scenes with a malevolent energy that radiated to the audience. Great support comes from Malkovich who is back on top form from the dismal Burn After Reading and Geoff Pierson is on strong form as Christines lawyer Another excellent performance comes from Micheal Kelly as detective Lester Ybarra whose investigation blew the Collins case wide open.Screenwriter J. Micheal Straczynski has to be mentioned. He actually researched the story and it was ninety five percent accurate which is an incredible accomplishment.The themes explored of justice, police corruption and male dominance over women are explored in great depth through the characters performances and are terrifically relevant to today. Changeling will have you moved (as it is disturbing) and inspired to the last scene and Eastwood has one again conclusively delivered another masterpiece. This film was surely go down not just one of his greatest movies and not just of this year but of all time.I implore you to see this film. It is storytelling in the making and I could not criticise any of it. This was flawless.",

            "content": "I liked it slightly less on this rewatch. Not because it's long or because there's too much/not much going on. It's because there are certain moments where the film is catering to the audience, making the viewers feel outraged when the main character is wronged or content when something goes the way it should. Not that it's a big issue but this subjective approach becomes a little too intruding at times. Maybe the script is too self-indulgent or maybe that's just Eastwood being Eastwood and over-directing. Talking about Eastwood being Eastwood, his score for this movie is quite galling, that same piano piece playing throughout the movie to the point of suffocation.Nevertheless, Changeling is a magnificently crafted film, with pristine cinematography and marvelous production design, giving palpable life to a world set in Los Angeles in the first half of the twentieth century. The acting is good across the board, with stand outs Angelina Jolie as a mother fighting to find her missing child and Michael Kelly as a detective who works on the case. Based on true events, the story is interesting and intense, touching on many aspects of the life back in the day in LA, like gender inequality, political abuse and police corruption.

This is the movie in which we can cherish Angelina Jolie in the most accomplished role of her career & I'll be surprised if I won't see her name in Academy nominations for the Best Actress category for this year. # 2- The movie was directed by none other than forever cowboy Clint Eastwood and this is again Oscar worthy film of the year in direction. Again a superbly crafted period thrilling drama from this genius actor turned director. The movie is based on true incident occurred in 1928 Los Angeles. A single living mother's son disappeared. She lodged a police complain & they returned her boy after few months. But he's not his child. The child was just fabricated face of corrupt LAPD & now the mother is threat. Next police declared her as insane & delusional & sent her to mental asylum. What happened to boy & the mother in this case??? Better you watch this slowly gripping drama of the year. Perfect sets & production of 1930's L.A. & soothing camera work by Eastwood's stalwart camera man Tom Stern made the film more intense & original with minimalist touch of Eastwood film. Jolie's period look & convincing mature acting simply gain the empathy of the audience. All the supporting actors have done realistic act including small but significant role of John Malkowich. It's period film belong to the time of 1928 when women in US were not entitled to vote & they were treated as third class citizens & women liberalization & rights were far on horizon. It's also the time of corrupt police & politics in US. So the film is a true case document of how a desperate mother struggled hard & turned the tables of corrupt LAPD & get the fair justice not only for her nut for whole society. Kudos to Eastwood for his brilliant theme & direction. Must Watch of the year. (This film will sweep the Oscars next year in many categories.)Ratings-9/10",

This is one of the few films to come out in the last decade or so that I think deserves at least minor classic status. Fine acting (especially by Jolie but by everyone else as well), a riveting yet well-paced and intelligent storyline. . . just a very fine film in every aspect.CHANGELING is frightening, provocative, and heartwarming all at once. One of the many things this story shows us is how a governmental/police bureaucracy can make the most innocent people seem guilty and the most sane people appear nuts. CHANGELING also provides a clear, immediate portrayal of the late 1920s/early 1930s, revealing how, though very different insofar as technology and styles are concerned, this period was much the same as our contemporary age.",

The movie is based on true events that took place in 1928. The movie is about is about a boy Walter Collins who goes missing on March 10, 1928 and Christine Collins who is trying to find her son. When the La Police Department tells her that they have found her son only to get there and find out that the boy they found is not her son and the police department trying to convince her that the boy they found is indeed her son. The movie deals with the corruption that was going with the police department at the time. This is a movie that you will be talking about soon after the credits roll. Both Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich really shine in this movie. They both should get Oscars for their performance in the movie.",

The police are less interested in finding the child than in maintaining a facade of crime-fighting, and meanwhile they force the mother to believe that the wrong child is her son. As the clergyman puts it, the police aren't about wiping out crime; they're about wiping out the competition. No surprise that they put the mom in a mental institution to make her look like the wrongdoer.I had never known the story of Christine Collins before watching this movie. It's a harrowing one.

Even today, the human mind is still susceptible to both manipulation and fear, it's just that the attack and approach has matured with time.Yes, the neighbors and teachers and family could've come forward to corroborate Christine's claims, however, is it really a far stretch to believe that in that time, the world, countries, cities, towns and more specifically, neighborhoods, were filled with people who's mentality would be to \"stay out of matters that don't affect them, unless it's to judge and condemn\", especially given how that was a period, where people would believe anything, no matter how apparently absurd?However, though I would love to give Changeling an 8 out of 10, it wasn't quite. Angelina was superb, Eastwood displayed some great work both behind the camera and with the composition, while Malkovich was also satisfactory, but sometimes the film felt a bit emotionally exhausting, and its resolutions weren't as satisfying as one would prefer. Also, the child actors could've been better, while the depiction of how the ranch story broke felt, slightly incomprehensible.I mean, the picture of the guy that was acting as if he didn't know where the ranch was, was on the wall in the house, and the detective looked right at it, and didn't bat an eyelid or find it strange? Instead, it was up to the boys' conscience to break the case, a case who's writing was on the wall. 7/10.",

Christen works as the supervisor of a large group of telephone operators while Walter attends school. One Saturday, when she had promised to take Walter to see a Charlie Chaplin movie, she is called into work to fill in for another sick employee. When she returns from work, Walter is no where to be found. She immediately calls the police, knowing that Walter is reliable and would call her if he had a reason not to be home. The police take her call but reject doing anything immediately: Walter had not been missing for more than 24 hours. After her request is made official, days (then weeks) go by as Walter remains missing.The media is informed and Christine's search for Walter becomes a famous case as newspapers and radio reporters won't let up on the police department's failure to find Walter. A local minister, Rev Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who broadcasts on the radio and has some public clout, seems to be particularly interested in the 'widespread corruption of the LAPD.' He uses their lack of action in this case to further attack the LAPD. Weeks after Walter's disappearance, Christine receives news from the LAPD that Walter had been found with a drifter in Illinois and that he would be returning home safe and sound. When Christine goes to meet him at the train station, the boy who meets her is not Walter (even though he claims to be). After police Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) has the newspaper take a picture of Christine and her \"son,\" he insists that she take him home in spite of her certainty that he is NOT Walter. Jones suggests that Walter's appearance may have changed and that Christine might be in a state of shock. When she continues to insist that the strange boy in her house is not Walter Dr. Earl W. Tarr (Peter Gerety), who regularly works with the police, tries to convince her that the new boy's shorter height and the fact that he is circumcised (Walter wasn't) all could be explained logically. As she continues to speak out, the police have her committed to an asylum.She is released when a young illegal immigrant, 14-year-old Sanford Clark (Eddie Alderson) is discovered at a nearby ranch. He is arrested for deportation back to Canada. But before deportation, Clark reveals that he was involved in a bizarre series murders (about twenty other boys). The alleged murderer is Clark's uncle, Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Hamer). (For more about the actual events, see 'Wineville Chicken Coop Murders' on Wikipeia.) Could Walter have been one of those murdered..or was he one of the two that got away..or was he still missing in another location?

That by itself made the film worth it. As well as watching the Dr getting punched. Okay so I am a feminist who felt a huge rush of emotion watching women fight for the right to be recognised as intelligent human.I admit that as the man was taken to be hung I thought good! Then as I watched the scene I was cursing JMS as the horrid, grim, inhuman nature of a hanging was shown and you are left to rethink your beliefs.

His sympathy for the boy who had killed or help to kill so many touched me. This was a child he could of hated and punished who no one had any reason to like and feel sympathy for, a child who had been so traumatised he would probably never get over it. What are we like today with children who kill? Do we shown them any sympathy or compassion. He treated this boy with respect. If the scenes are from transcripts of the interview. Did Walter Collins escape? The big question and one to which we will never get an answer as even if he did escape the chances of him still being alive (at about 92) are slim. He obviously had courage and a will to survive. I believe if he did escape he would of tried to get back to his mother. So sadly I believe he did not make it out of the farm. Or did not survive after the escape.I have no knowledge of the actual events and have not looked for them as I wanted to see the film by itself. Don't go if you just want a thriller or who done it.

In his practiced and revised methods, love of cinema and wisdom of audience satisfaction that it's no surprise that 3 of his films in the last 5 years have had Best Picture nominations, with all of them only subtly being Oscar bait. Changeling is right at this standard and possibly his finest film since Unforgiven. Through the use of weaving different tones and genres, he's developed a imposing achievement not just for himself but for mainstream cinema as a whole. It takes a lot of its influence from classic film, only in style and not in content, of which the true story is handled with care and taken to cinematic levels \u2013 though the influence is presented as homages. I'm completely bewildered as to why this is no longer popularly considered in this years Oscar race as it suits their patterns and has classic, iconic material.Through precise pacing, it remains compelling throughout all the acts, that once a subplot is nearing the end it starts another so the film doesn't drag. It's a film that has completely grasped its scale so it's constantly and consistently intimate and involving whenever a new feature is added. The most fascinating detail I found in the presentation is how the characters are always most conscious of the public's reactions, so much so that they motivate their own actions. However the public are rarely viewed \u2013 except during protests, when none of them are given the individual or unbiased opinion. This allows Eastwood the opportunity to use the film's audience as this public, with his knowledge of convention in who they would support within the film; with Jolie subtly viewed as a heroin (despite none of her actions, besides her strength, are specifically 'heroic') and the police viewed as villainous \u2013 which is what Jolie's character discovers. With these perspectives not shoved down the audience's throat, it adds to the involvement and overall enjoyment without any use of manipulation. The pivotal theme is definitely mixing morality with justice, which leaves us as an audience to judge the rational actions towards this.Now, of course, the absolute focus and anticipation for the film was Angelina Jolie's performance. She did not disappoint. She amazed. It was a passionate performance in which she completely disappeared into. I could feel her completion during her routine in the first 10 minutes of introduction with her child. I could feel her emptiness during the desperate struggle for mentality during the time without her son. I could feel her relief in the brief time she thought are son had been brought back. I could feel the doubt and denial in her mind when she knew it wasn't her son. I could feel the desperation and frustration during her fight with the police. And I could feel her pain when she was losing. This amount of suffering did not feel overwhelming enough to be ridiculous. She does not glamorise the role nor begs for recognition and praise in her intense portrayal, which she has obviously used the thought of her own children to bring it to heart and make every scene with her in poignant. One of the most pleasant surprises of the film was Jason Butler Harner's edgy performance of the deranged murderer, who's edgy performance challenged Jolie despite his limited screen time. John Malkovich was natural in his role though didn't feel that significant. I respect that it's really only Malkovich and Jolie who are Hollywood actors and Eastwood's only device of gathering an audience. This film does not flash stars.The technical aspects also stand out, creating a pleasant ambiance for the film to settle in. With images blending into each other pleasantly, without the contrast of modern day technology. With this delicacy in the detail it adds the effect of the era and makes it utterly cinematic. The score fits in nicely with a tone that suits the drama of the events. However my main problems with the film as a whole is that it is often too melodramatic (the last line being \"I now have something I never had before last night... hope\"). Also the themes are elaborated too much, leaving limited interpretation that anyone could inform to someone else. Despite these, they don't affect my enjoyment and I'd happily label this film as outstanding.8/10",

            "content": "Three times Oscar nominee in 2009, the film \"Substitution\" surprised me with the choice for the main role of Angelina Jolie. Somehow it so happened that the actress was clearly associated with the heroines from the adventures. Her excellent work in the Lara Croft dilogy impressed, and her appearance in \"Hijack in 60 seconds\" and \"Especially Dangerous\" fixed the girl in my memory as an actress of an entertaining popcorn movie. Later I discovered Jolie as an iconic dramatic actress thanks to her work in the films \"Gia\", \"Interrupted Life\" and \"The Power of Fear\". But the film \"Substitution\" is truly impressive and the image of the unrepentant mother Christine Collins, who is looking for her son.The picture sends back a century, where a young woman alone brings up a child, works hard and tries to give her child everything she can. A difficult time, a difficult situation for a woman. The unexpected loss of his son makes him watch with interest what is happening on the screen. How will the heroine Jolie behave, what will follow her attempts to find a child. The work of the actress is remembered, Angelina completely dissolves inside this character. There is no trace of the usual beauty with long legs and pistols in her hands from the adaptation of a computer game. Here Jolie gives out a surprisingly memorable and settling somewhere in the subcortex image of a slouching woman, on whose shoulders the burden of endless searches for a child has fallen, a collision with constant injustice, corruption and the absolute indifference of the surrounding world to her problem.An important moment is the meeting of Collins with her son. It seems that everything ends quickly and even somehow easily, but then these piercing eyes, full of pain and distrust of all living things around the heroine Jolie. Her words, growing into a demand that her son be returned to her, and not that unfamiliar boy that she sees in front of her. It is incredibly interesting to observe a seemingly absurd situation. Well, how is it possible, how is it permissible for a mother to return a child, but not her child, but a stranger? But as the viewer sees, all this is quite real. And then Collins begins his struggle to achieve justice.Jolie is good in this project, this is completely her role, she gave herself to her, imbued with a real character, which she realized on the screen and was rightly awarded an Oscar nomination for best Actress. The victory, however, was celebrated by Kate Winslet for playing in the movie \"The Reader\". And it's hard to say whether Jolie was more worthy of the statuette that year. But one thing cannot be taken away - the role of Christine Collins is one of the most iconic in the career of an actress. Something that allowed her to open up even more as an actress.The picture was directed by Clint Eastwood. Serious high-quality projects often come \"from the pen\" of one of the most famous actors and directors in Hollywood. The man really succeeded in working on this project. He created that unique atmosphere of the distant years that preceded the Great Depression, these colors, these human relationships, this frequent helplessness. It was a difficult time for everyone, and the loss of her son for the main character and the corruption-soaked part of society turned out to be overwhelming and oppressive for the director at all. Even when you are just a spectator of this film, and not a participant in those terrible events.The picture is excellent. This movie is one of those that I really want to recommend for viewing. Strong drama, excellent acting, heavy nerve - all this can be seen in the movie \"Substitution\".10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Changeling is a new film apparently based on a true story that took place in the late 1920's. The story focuses on single mother Christine Collins who lives with her nine year old son Walter. One day after returning from work, Christine can not find Walter anywhere and so she enlists the help of the police department, but the events that follow were to forever go down in history and show the corruption of the police department at that time, or at least in that city. Changeling is technically well made with great attention to detail trying to make everything look and feel like the 1920's, and I think they do a great job with costumes, sets and music, but other than for some technical achievements, I feel that there is little else to recommend with this film. First of all, I know that this film was based on a true story, but the events that take place in the film are so far fetched and unusual that while you are watching it, it feels more unpleasant than compelling. I also found a lot of problems with the script such as the many added subplots in the film that I personally did not think needed to be added. I also do not think the characters were as developed as much as they should have been and I don't think we as the viewer are given a chance to emphasize with the Christine character like we should be able to. Part of this problem comes from the many additional subplots I mentioned that take away from the real story, or at least what is supposed to be the main story that the film focuses on. I also found the acting in the film to be too overly melodramatic and over the top at times, so often it did feel quite unbelievable and forced which a true story film should never do. I also found the last half of the film exposing the corrupt police department went on way too long and the film started to hammer out a message that became repetitive and preachy and it was more tiresome than inspirational. The film could have lost at least 20 to 30 minutes of scenes that didn't particularly fit in the movie, or added much to it. The last half did drag very often and several times I felt like checking my watch to see what time it was and when this film would be over because it's one longer film where you can really feel it's length. I also thought the film gave too many instances of false hope to the Christine character and there was one too many scenes of her on the phone talking to the missing person's department and such that also could have been cut because it gives us the viewer false hope for the character and it just further made the film longer than it should have been. I think the main problem with this film is the script and had it been reworked over a little bit it could have been a very good film, but as it currently stands I can not personally recommend it.",

I think it gets such high rates because it exalts the USA's justice system and the kind of values that americans look up to. Again, what really minds me about the movie is that it feels like it could have been great, as the story is actually good, but it fails to deliver a deeper exploration on the topics it's involved in (like justice).

John Malkovich is, well, John Malkovich and his very name is synonymous with the definition of perfection. Jeffrey Donovan is a new comer who has his own TV show, Burn Notice, and did an excellent job. He sometimes let a little Scottish accent creep into his dialogue, and I liked that. In the story Christine plays a telephone operator supervisor and that was the first time I ever saw or even heard of those supervisors using roller skates to roll up and down the long line of the regular telephone operators.

They casting was also excellent, every character was multi-dimensional and served their own purpose.However, what really made this film truly special was Angelina Jolie's phenomenal performance as Christine Collins. I have never seen such amazing acting on screen. Her portrayal was more than heart-wrenching, and some of the scenes really gave me chills. Her commitment t the role really showed, and you could tell his was a part she was passionate about. I really is an Oscar worthy performance and if she doesn't win this year, i'll eat my hat! The directing was also incredible, the way Eastwood managed to build the tension and create a hugely \"on-edge\" atmosphere was genius, the hanging scene is the perfect example of this, as is the scene when Christine Collins visits her son's \"killer\". Also the story was extremely true to the actual events, they even dressed her the same as is seen in an old photo of Miss Collins. it is detail and care like this which makes it one of the most fascinating and tragic films of the year.Finally i cannot overstress Angelina's awesome performance.

It seemed the audiences tend to skip it due to the heavy tone and the heavy-handed \"true story\". However, it really deserved more than one viewing. The good: 1, Angelina Jolie. I can only say: she's totally true in every scene. Losing tens of pounds, she gave herself a nervous/desperate appearance right after the movie begins. It's not like she acted everyone off the screen, on the contrast, she's always weak, fearful and is everything a single mother would be. I like this character because she's an example of strength rising from love and hope, rather than hatred and anger. If you have stomach problem, I strongly suggest you take some anti-acid before viewing this, since Jolie's put in many tortures, mentally and physically. Anyway, I learned how strong a person can be in his/her mind.2, The story. It's not like Thelma and Louise, which preached feminism to an extreme. It's the journal of heartbroken person, a legend about enduring life's darkest periods. Such dark periods, regardless of the magnitude, can happen to anyone. In the movie, different types of crimes and misdeeds were exposed and explored, again gripping your stomach and challenging your heart. The mother, being weak and helpless, wanted to kept a good relation with the police/public/media, therefore reluctantly posed for a title photo which later turned out to be a nightmare. I mean, such kind of crap can happen everyday to any of us. Near the end, when the other captured boy was finally found after 6 years, he was questioned as why he didn't return and report the psychopath killer. His answer was also very shocking, stating that he was afraid that the public would blame his escape and cowardice. Such are victims. It's so realistic and mind-provoking that we're living in a miserable society, where a lot of things are waiting to be set straight.The bad: 1, It doesn't end a typical happy ending. 2, LAPD may still find this story horrifying and humiliating. 3, today we have a lot more social problems than 1928......I mean, the movie leaved me too many things to think about.

I have rarely seen a movie so perfectly cast. Angelina Jolie understands this character and matches that character's emotions at every point. I think the casting of John Malkovich as an anti-authoritarian radio preacher is inspired. We are used to seeing him play arrogant intellectuals, and usually we side with the characters he's playing, despite their arrogance. In this he plays somebody we hope is going to be a man of justice. Very subtly, we are kept wondering if he simply wants fame, if he's manipulating people for his own grandeur, or, more to the point, whether he will stick by Jolie once he's scored his political points. The role is well-written, but, in the hands of another actor plausibility would have been difficult. Malkovich's character is at once worldly, holy and, at some level, sly. Beyond the great casting (and let me say that every main player in this movie is played with forceful realism) the best thing about THE CHANGELING is that Eastwood never trumpets the ambiguities. He accepts and expects the viewer to accept, that characters' motives may be multi-faceted. This acceptance of complexity makes the exposure of villainy all the more powerful. There is something of M in this movie. A character beyond redemption seems, at times, to see right and wrong more clearly than the more casually corrupt. But where M plays like a sort of Marxist civics lesson, THE CHANGELING is, actually, about what Emily Dickinson called the thing with feathers. That's something which goes beyond man-made constructs.",

            "content": "CHANGELING is based on a true story, but I think it's fiction. I mean, come on - Angelina Jolie with only ONE child? Clint Eastwood directs Jolie as Christine Collins, a working, single mother in 1928 Los Angeles, who comes home one day to find her son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith) missing.As unbelievable as it sounds, the police (headed by Jeffrey Donovan and Colm Feore) deliver an impostor child to Christine six months later in a public political display, insisting it is Walter - against all the protests of Christine. They tell her that because she is the missing child's mother, she is therefore \"in no position to be objective\"! Christine takes this lying down. Now we're getting closer to Angelina...The police department, reeling under accusations of corruption and incompetence - from activist, Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) - prove the accusations correct, by desperately shoving Christine's case down the public's throat as a feather in their cap. They even send Christine a Consultant for Juvenile Services to spin their lie right in her face like a cheapshot Republican. The consultant says he will \"put it all to rights,\" yet as soon as he looks at the boy, \"He's got your eyes... and a little of your nose as well.\" To refute Christine's claims that the impostor is circumcised and Walter was not, \"he must have been traumatized and submerged the memory of the circumcision\"; as to why the impostor is three inches shorter than Walter, \"his spine shrunk during his trauma...\" It's a little hard to accept that even the 10-year-old impostor (Devon Conti) could be in on the conspiracy. When this mother is pouring her heart out to him, beseeching him for the truth, how is he so well-versed in the Clint Eastwood Method of saying nothing? At such a young age, is he already indoctrinated with the spirit of the times that would regard women as inferior enough not to answer her? He also seems to take a leery pleasure in seeing Christine squirm. And how does he fool Walter's friends, their neighbors, the school teachers? These questions are touched on minimally, but ultimately cannot be explained by the movie format, so leave us unbalanced - in this age of ultra-media that could disprove lies instantaneously.Screenplayed by J. Michael Straczynski, CHANGELING is a strange blend of flopsy first act and then terrifying second act, involving a child-killer. About the time the police department are wrongfully dragging Christine into a mental institution for insisting the impostor is not her child, Detective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) is stumbling on a ranch in the Los Angeles desert, where he arrests a stray boy (Eddie Alderson) who tells him a bizarre tale...Two stories run congruently as Christine is traumatized and mistreated in the sanitarium, while Ybarra hears the stray boy's testimony to being an accomplice to kidnapping and murdering numerous young boys with his uncle, a man named Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner, who looks like a skinny Hugh Jackman).The two stories intersect when Walter Collins's name comes up in the boy's story. We never discover whether Walter was one of the murdered boys or one of a few who managed to escape.Writer Straczynski was inspired (is that the right word?) by the True Crime events of the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Yet there was another True Crime enacted in this case - that of the police department.If we find it hard to believe how a whole department can lie so brazenly, we only have to look to modern politicians - Hillary claiming she \"landed under fire\" in Bosnia, McCain claiming \"the race is tied with Obama\" - the only reason those 1920's liars got away with their outlandish mendacity was that there was no DNA testing, no domestic photography... and no YouTube.Once again, Eastwood's film making is impeccable. We never question we are in 1928, with the surroundings, social mores and misogyny of the time; when women were treated like lower-class citizens, or at least like the hysterical, emotionally-unbalanced gender that Freud and others postulated they were.Women were so subjugated and downtrodden that when Christine tearfully demands that the police captain keep looking for her son after she is given the impostor, she then apologizes to him for doing so. He maintains coolly, \"Why should we keep looking for someone we've already found?\" Christine once told Water, \"Never start a fight. Always finish it.\" Of course, that credo is the body and soul of Clint Eastwood. He said it flat out in WHITE HUNTER, BLACK HEART and each of his Avengers lives it to the bone. Christine (with help from her ally, Reverend Briegleb) would devote her life to exposing the police who handed her a changeling, finishing a fight they should never have started.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",

            "content": "Awards season carries with it a raft of films that are \"Oscar-worthy\" and all tend to be released in the UK during January and February. I understand the reasons for doing this but sadly it is not for the sake of the viewer because most cinema goers do not want a glut of films in one month and then nothing till the summer time but then I suppose awards = money and this is what the studios want. Changeling came out in the UK at the fore of this season (in November/December I think) so I managed to catch it then and did so with Oscar hype and awards chatter in my ears. I managed to block out a lot of this though as I have been burnt before and I came to the film with little knowledge of the plot and not quite sure what to expect from it.Perhaps this helped me because I do seem to have enjoyed the film more than some other viewers here. What I found was a quite engaging drama that is helped by its \"true story\" tag but is solid enough to stand up on its own regardless. The whole narrative is charged with injustices and emotion and it is hard not to care as events unfold \u0096 I was quite held by it and I can't see the view of those that say it was dull. The downside of the film is that, while the events grip, the emotional heart of the film is surprisingly cold, with the viewer putting in most of their feelings and the film coasting on this. By nature of the story the viewer will bring a lot to the table and I did feel that the film coasted on this to a certain degree. This does hurt it because the lack of that on the screen does perhaps contribute to some viewers not being drawn in by it.Eastwood's direction is part of it as it is a bit too clinical \u0096 it makes it feel of the period perhaps but the cold edge is the con to that pro. Likewise the casting of Jolie. I agree with Eastwood's comment that her \"look\" fits the period, because her face certainly does, however this is not enough and I found her performance to be a bit lacking \u0096 not bad but just \"ok\" with \"give me an award\" moments in there as well. One can easily imagine what a better and more able actress could have done with the material. The rest of the cast are solidly good in the same way \u0096 with nobody really setting the world on fire but yet plenty of recognisable faces and names doing good work in smaller roles. The film belongs to Jolie though and, on the basis of that ownership one can understand why she was nominated for her Oscar while, at the same time, seeing why she didn't actually deserve to win it either.The liberties with factual detail did not bother me at the time of viewing (as I didn't know the story at all) and didn't after I read up about them (I try to see \"true\" films as an entry level summary rather than fact) and generally I did find the film to be engaging and professionally made across the board (acting, sets, direction). The problem with it is that it is quite cold and it doesn't produce people so much as it does events. These events are sufficient to make for a good film but the lack of more prevents it being more than this.",

            "content": "Changeling story has been described as being so extraordinary that it's impossible to make up. Changeling is a powerful film, which has multiple stories for audiences to sink their teeth into: a family tragedy, police corruption, a story about a serial killer, a political campaign and a trial movie just to name a few. It is a film that was overlooked by the Oscars, like The Dark Knight was in 2008.In 1928 Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a loving single mother to 9-year-old Walter (Gattlin Griffith). When she is called into work as cover Walter disappears, with Christine missing him for five months. When the LAPD say they found Walter, giving the media a great story. There is a catch: the boy was not really Walter and Christine starts to campaign against the police who claims she is insane, an unfit mother, etc\u0085. With the aid of veteran campaigner Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), Christine proves that the police knowingly gave her the wrong boy and bring down a corrupt police force and mayor. Add this done with backdrop of the investigation of the Wineville Chicken Coop murders.Changeling had everything you would except from a award contending film: great actor, writing and direction. It had a number of themes and ideas that would show that it is a real film of merit. Some ideas of the film are similar to L.A. Confidential, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Girl, Interrupted, many good serial killer films and the electro-shock treatment scene reminding me of Requiem for a Dream. Under the skillful director of Clint Eastwood he captures the periods with all set designs and costumes, whilst using more modern film techniques, like steady-cam and CGI: it was a little like David Fincher's Zodiac. After some slow moments in the beginning Eastwood is able to pick up the pace and he is able mix all the story elements together like it was effortless. He is able to film some really dark scenes, particular the way the scenes in the chicken coop were effectively creepy and scary, particularly how he used silhouettes; but so too were the scenes in the psychopathic ward. Eastwood shows how a political campaign functions on the ground and how the police would go about discrediting someone, using their own doctors and pretty much lock them up without any due process. Eastwood knows how to make a film and Changeling is one of Eastwood's best films as a director.Though Eastwood is a very talented director, he had a great script by J. Michael Straczynski, who is best known as a sci-fi writer, writing Babylon 5 and comic books, particularly Spider-man and Thor. For Changeling its report that he up 6000 historical documents and legal transcripts, with 95% of the script based on it. He writes a brilliant screenplay filled with character and ideas. As well as exploring the idea that the LAPD was corrupt (which still seems to be an issue e.g. the Rodney King beating), the police doing everything to discredit any critics, particularly women, and look for quick results and not willing to admit when they made a mistake (which is still true today). There are other ideas, such as the sociological idea that insanity is a social construct, that when someone is marked insane all their behaviour is seen through that lens. There are ideas of using the pulpit as a political platform, which of course men like Martin Luther King, Desmond Tutu and Pope John Paul II used. We get to see the make-up of a serial killer, someone who is creepy and insane, but also very cold and cunning, carefully planning his crimes. The idea of a serial killer is also nothing new, they have always been around in some form. Even the title Changeling has meaning because it in fairy tales a changeling was a soulless or empty child. The other meaning is a mystrical creature like a troll or an elf steal a human child and replace it with one of their own, thereby it ends up being raised by humans. Hopefully Straczynski can write more films like this and get to fit more ideas in his sci-fi work.There is a great cast in the film. Jodie in my opinion is a terrific actress and I prefer to see her in more roles like this, compared to action roles like Salt and the Tomb Raider series. There is a little bit of shouting which is expected from a Oscar nominated performance she was still very convincing and powerful as a mother fighting a powerful enemy and determined to find her son. Her performance felt natural, a woman who was intelligent, committed and wrong. Malkovich's performance was a lot more understated then his performance (usually psychopaths) and because of it I think its his best. He too plays his role with real conviction, a dedicated campaigner who wants to support Christine but also has his own agenda. He should have had more award nominations for this role. Jason Butler Harner was effectively creepy and insane as a serial killer who does not care about what he did and Jeffrey Donovan was charismatic and oozed hatred as the police Captain who plays one of the main antagonists of the film. The child actors were also very good in the film, particularly Eddie Alderson as a very scared and emotionally damaged young teenager suffering emends guilt.Overall 2008 was a great year for films and Changeling can easily join the ranks of films like The Dark Knight, Wall-E and The Boy in Striped Pyjamas as the high points.",

'Changeling' is must watch for each & every human being alive! 'Changeling' is not only about a mother & her lost child, but also focuses on the shitty & corrupt side of the LAPD & on the infamous \"Wineville Chicken Coop\" case. This is real stuff, this happened way back in the late 1920's. Honestly, 'Changeling' is such a real & moving experience, that you really forget that you're watching a film made by Cinematic Legends.Written Brilliantly by J. Michael Straczynski & amazingly executed by the Greatest Film-Personality, Sir.Eastwood, comes a film that we'll remember for a really, long, long time for sure.In the acting department, Angelina Jolie delivers an astounding performance as Christine Collins. She plays the helpless mother with rare ease & understanding. John Malkovich is first-rate in a dynamic role. Jeffrey Donovan is perfect. Jason Butler Harner & Colm Feore are good. Amy Ryan, Michael Kelly & among others are satisfactory.'Changeling' is a true story, told in the most beautiful & truthful way. Two Big Thumbs Up!",

            "review_title": "A heart wrenching emotional roller coaster",
            "content": "Clint Eastwood is easily one of the most remarkable and prolific figures in film history, and age has never slowed him down. It's incredible that a man of his age continues to churn out an average of one film per year, in addition to directing everything he's been in since \"In The Line Of Fire\". Eastwood's dedication to creating an atmosphere of escapism and a compelling story packed with great acting is something to marvel at. His latest effort, \"Changeling\", is an emotional roller coaster of a film that hits in more places than it misses, and features some truly dynamite acting.A mark of a great film is its ability or inability to expand as a story. When a film stays on a formulaic road during the entire runtime, despite how good of an experience it can be, I find that it's often forgettable rather than memorable. With Changeling, I found that Eastwood's ability to transform the film through the performances into more than just a 'mother searches for son' storyline, though most of this credit should go to J. Michael Straczynski, the screenwriter. It's like a flower that opens up gradually over the course of a runtime.Despite having the headlining A-lister in Angelina Jolie, she's not the best performer in the film in this writer's opinion, despite giving a tremendous performance. Her work is obviously the emotional center of the movie, as the film's emotion rises and falls with her character's feelings. She does the most with what she can, and may get that Oscar nomination that many scenes see her begging for, but I feel like I've seen better performances this year (especially in the emotionally distraught strong woman character department).The film is held up by some great supporting players, one of whom in particular gives a true powerhouse performance. Jason Butler Harner, the unknown actor in said powerhouse performance, is so effectively creepy and disturbing to the point that you'll have your jaw on the ground. Due to being a virtual unknown, he may not get the commercial recognition that he deserves, but this movie will be his audition tape for years to come for his incredible portrayal of the psychotic and unstable parts of the human mind. John Malkovich's portrayal of an authoritative and controversial reverend is spot on, as he nails the intensity of the character as well as the subdued aspects of him, especially in the end. Then there's the almost out of place Jeffrey Donovan, who is surprisingly stellar in his role as the vile corrupt police captain at the epicenter of the happenings of the third act of the film. Amy Ryan's brief turn is also worth noting. Just like in last year's \"Gone Baby Gone\", Ryan manages to pack a world of emotion into so little screen time.I especially liked how the film firmly established itself as a period piece in the 1920's and 1930's. The costuming and makeup are all top notch. Eastwood's film is beautifully shot, and it had me hooked from the first shot of the movie. The sets, right down to the streets of Los Angeles, are all exactly as I would imagine them being in the time period. It was a gutsy move on Eastwood's part to film so many transition scenes outside in the streets, and it really helps the film.If I had anything bad to say about Changeling, it would be that there are several hammy and \"Oscar begging\" moments that kind of got on my nerves, especially Jolie's parody inducing \"I WANT MY SON BACK\" speech, which kind of got worse for me when I saw who she was shouting at (I thought it was Jeffrey Donovan's character, and it totally wasn't). I also thought more could've been done in terms of developing the supporting players, but at that point I'd be splitting hairs.Though Eastwood's latest picture is quite an achievement, I don't see it collecting all the accolades it was rumored for earlier in the year. It's a strong ride on the emotional roller-coaster of cinema, but falls short in terms of being that one 'monumental' picture of the year.",

My heart goes out to anyone who has lost a child in similar circumstances to that of Christine Collins.I was very impressed with the film's cinematography which made me delve in the late 1920's era. Also with Jolie's performance as been very alive on screen as the victimized mother of the missing child. You feel for her after all all she wanted was her son returned. Not a big story that would be made into a picture more than half a century later so people can see it nominated for an academy award. However, your alter-ego prefers the movie not to end with a safe story. I mean I really loved the fact that Eastwood made the choice to make it an open ending.

Boy, was I wrong.The film's story is its strongest point. It is based on a true story (always a plus for the makers and the audience) and never do we forget that through the movie- there aren't any cheap Hollywood aspects that would make The Changeling unrealistic. I felt that the direction did somewhat lack creativity (i.e. I expected a bit better from Eastwood) and the storytelling did consist of pretty ordinary and unremarkable flashbacks. Overall, however, it is very enjoyable to watch and the story-telling is very coherent.The acting was another pleasant surprise. It was hard for me to imagine Angelina Jolie as a grief-stricken mother in the 1920s, but she nailed the role and proved her worth as one of the best actresses around today. And there are not many big stars who can play a character so far from their Hollywood image. The rest of the cast was very good as well- particularly John Malkovich and Michelle Gunn. The characters were deep and never boring.One complaint I have is the depiction of the time period it was set in- some of the dialogue just took me out of the '20s/'30s and I never really felt like the movie took place in that decade.However, any complaints I have are minor compared to how well-acted and written it is. I recommend this film to any film-lover (and anybody who thinks Jolie is not a talented actress). Consider my score an 8.5/10",

I like how the film references the 1935 Oscars ceremony to explain a future plot point--anyone with a reasonable knowledge of film history would know that Collins (at least in the film, that is) does accept the date!

But for being a classic , it is far more behind such thing . way to go to reach the mountain top of classics . the idea of exchanging the identity of children and a single mothers's seeking for her lost boy,is performed well. but you know what?,i don't really like Angie's hairstyle & performance . seems little fake for me when she shows her wrath to wrong kid . it's like she's Lara Croft . but the woman does the role better than her previous roles and hell let's say,she has good improvement on her acting career after she is working with high working directors .she is really good.she plays a single mother who has been deceived after his lost son is found and a mistaken idea story is behind all . and she resists to believe that his son is returned by the police.this whole looks like a frame and Christine Collins(Angelina Jolie)is going to prove that.even though she is accused for being a psycho and is sent to a mental hospital.But she still have hopes to find her son. she has help to gain the aim and thats Rev. Gustav Briegleb(John Malkovich)...Angelina struggles damn hard and she is doing a hard job after fake pictures like Beowulf & A Mighty Heart. and she gains better conclusion of being an actress.hope her way is found soon or before retirement.her husky voices annoys me while yelling.but i just bare it for she is doing a good performance.i think she should give up smoking for it is bad for her children and my ear. great movie . 8 from 10.",

It just tells a story of a desperate mother trying to find her mysteriously disappeared son.

Watching a lone mother struggle in historically accurate 1920s L.A. makes your heart want to give in from the amount of sympathy.I can stress the performance of Angelina Jolie hard enough. From the moments of blind rage to the lonesome disbelief she does a marvelous job. There are no weak actors.

It's doubtful the LAPD had time to read Shakespeare circa 1928 because they were too busy with corruption, incompetence and framing anyone who dared to question their integrity. This could so easily be portraying Tony Blair's and now Gordon Brown's government exactly 90 years later. As Frank Sinatra's character in Suddenly put it, nothing changes. With a flashy role it's probably true to say that Angelina Jolie is courting the Oscar but it's too glib a charge to level - as it has been - at the film as a whole. Clint Eastwood is as fine a filmmaker as any working in Hollywood and seldom disappoints behind the camera. If this were fiction he would surely not have dared portray a State Asylum in which the chief psychiatrist was in the hip pocket of the LAPD and virtually every nurse was a certified sadist but it is, we are assured, a true story. Apart from Jolie and a strangely subdued John Malkovitch the only halfway decent character is the Steve Martin lookalike who inadvertently solves the mystery of Jolie's missing son.

Until I did some research on the actual case, I didn't realize the changes, and when I did know, it didn't seem particularly detrimental to the overall story.However, there were a lot of little nagging errors in perspective, time-line, etc. that I found annoying. Of course, my wife just rolls her eyes and tells me I'm WAY too critical in that perspective. Without trying to spoil it too bad, some of my nits were: At the beginning of the film, Christine & Walter are discussing what happened to his father, something that only the real kid could know. Never heard about it again.When she left for work the day he was kidnapped, she mentions that the neighbor would be checking in on him to make sure he was fine. Yet when she found him missing when returning home, the neighbor is never mentioned. I don't know about others, but the FIRST place I would go in that situation would be to that person to find out when (or if) she last saw the child.At the end, when the boy who escaped returns home in 1935, he looks no more than 14 or 15. HOWEVER, in the flashback to 1928 during the kidnapping, the boy looks about 10 or 11, clearly one of the older boys (who were shown as being 9 or 10). Unless he was extraordinarily big for his age at 10 and didn't continue to grow, he looked all wrong.There were the usual goofs (Angelina Jolie sitting on one side of the street car then the next scene showing her face against the window on the OTHER side of the street car), but I found the unused clues to be sloppy film making.",

            "content": "For the past 5-10 years, I have enjoyed watching the supreme acting talents of Clint Eastwood in films such as Bloodwork, Million Dollar Baby, and (most recently) Gran Torino. This film, however, also cements Eastwood as not only a top actor, but also a spectacular director.The plot of the film centers on the story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), who after having her son Walter go missing for a few months is reunited...with the wrong boy. However, in order to save themselves some bad publicity, the Los Angeles Police Department insists that the boy IS indeed her son and, once drawn into the lie, will do whatever it takes (including institutionalizing Collins) to make sure that the truth about her case is never known. At the same time as Collins' story is playing out, the real abductor of her son, Gordon Northcott, is being investigated for the brutal murder of perhaps as many as 20 young boys, of which Walter may or may not be one of.Like most of Eastwood's more recent films, this movie resonates with the audience in multiple ways. While watching, you will sympathize with Christine Collins over the screw-job she is getting from the LAPD, while also be horrified at the Northcott case not only because of what he did, but because he was allowed to keep doing so while the LAPD were trying to save face. Of course, you never know how much \"creative license\" (think Denzel Washington's portrayal of Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter as a complete innocent) a director takes within a film, but in this case I trust the judgment of Eastwood. Plus, even if the LAPD were only half as bad as portrayed by Eastwood, they would still be responsible for the despicable acts brought down upon Christine Collins.Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the film, though, is the performance by Angelina Jolie as Collins. While better know for her blatantly sexual roles in such films as \"Tomb Raider\", \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\", and \"Wanted\", Eastwood is able to do a complete makeover on Jolie, turning her into a character that we can all root for, and not just for her body. I gained a lot of respect for Jolie's acting talents by watching this film.In a final touch, Eastwood also infuses his own simple brand of music into the film. Whereas in \"Million Dollar Baby\" it was the simple plinking of piano keys, in \"Changeling\" it is the simplistic strumming of a guitar that provides what little dramatic backdrop is needed to the storytelling. Eastwood knows that the story alone is compelling enough, so instead of opting for a dramatic score he just keeps it simple, which was the correct choice.Thus, I recommend this film to anyone who just wants to watch a really interesting, true dramatic story. Though some of the subject matter may be a bit intense for the faint of heart, it needs to be that way in order to convey the horrific events surrounding the case of Christine Collins and her son Walter. Like nearly every Clint Eastwood project, whether acting, directing, or producing, this one will have you thinking about its events long after viewing.",

There are very few film that can make me cry and this is one of them, but also strangely this actually is one of my favorite films from Clint Eastwood.Not a whole lot I can really say, I like the production value capturing 1920's America a decade long gone. From the wardrobe, cars, customs, everything. I really like the music score which has a somber and almost haunting tune to it. The writing is great the fact that it's by my favorite comic book/script write J. Michael Straczyski whom is known for the \"Superman: Year One\" graphic comic series is fantastic, it would be cool if he did scripts for movies a bit more often.Supporting character Rev. Gustav played well by John Malkovich (TV's \"Crossbones\") its to me is one of his better roles. He's pretty much a radical/activist that is helping out Christine in finding her son by rooting out the corruption going on in the LAPD. He's also kinda funny he has some charisma in some scenes.Howvever to me it's Angelina Jolie (Malificant) whom is one of my favorite actresses that really carries the movie, this to me is one of my favorite roles from her. She does a great job at portraying Christine Collins whom is simply an ordinary working class woman from a period long gone. Her character you just feel deep pathos for as she is constantly and desperately trying to seek help in finding her lost son.You really can feel her pain from what's in her eyes and all the crap she is just going though, let alone getting crap canned from the precent she asked for help from. You really feel angry at the pricent which isn't doing there job and seem to be more busy at trying to keep their hands clean, but their hands to me look plenty dirty to me; and for the record I fraking hate crooked cops.The scene when Christine says \"I want my son back.\" that always breaks my heart a bit whenever I heard that. But one scene that really broke my heart was when Christine was passing by the school again after the crap she went through in the psych ward she was illegally sent to. Just the look on her face and seeing the school it just put tears in my eyes and made me cry, knowing that her son use to go to that school and the fact she passing by it shows how far and lost her son may'be.Police must always protect and serve the law and people, but must never abuse the power behind their badge to their own uses. What that precent did to Christine wasn't right, and your glad near the end that their finally paying the price. However the real heart breaker is the last facts of the case in the end, which put tears in my eyes.We'll never forget about her son and the many other children out there still missing.Rating: 4 stars",

Angelina Jolie is normally hard to watch for any extended period of time (and here you have to watch her for 2.5 hours); there's a way in which she can never seem to wipe a certain smirk or sneer or leer out of her facial expression, which renders her acting always slightly false. Meanwhile, her decidedly 21st-century botoxed lips don't help much with her depiction of a woman in the 1930s. Jeffrey Donavan, in fact is about the only one who looks like he belongs there; most of the rest, including John Malkovich, seem slightly embarrassed by their clothes and their hairdos. In general, the film is marred by a lot of hammy overacting (the children overall but especially Jason Butler Harner, who becomes nearly unwatchable). Indeed, Eastwood seems to lose control of his actors or, alternatively, to be letting them flounder around without a rope -- but Michael Kelly is memorable in a fairly small role.",

            "content": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are perfectly matched, as both boast beautiful faces and a painful lack of serious acting ability.However, in an acting face off, I'd put my money on Jolie. She did much better with her 2008 Oscar-bait outing, \"Changeling,\" than Pitt did with his, \"The Curiously Boring and Pointless Case of the Blank-Faced Benjamin Button.\" Jolie plays Christine Collins, a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles whose son goes missing. When the corrupt police department return the wrong boy to her and she tries to raise a stink about it, they have her committed to a mental institution rather than admit their embarrassing mistake. But eventually, a grisly discovery becomes too large a story to ignore, and the LAPD is brought to task for its dirty dealings.\"Changeling\" is a solid accomplishment from director Clint Eastwood. It's not anywhere nearly as good as his other 2008 film, \"Gran Torino,\" but it's not nearly as bad as its critical reception had led me to expect. But the film succeeds largely in spite of Jolie's performance rather than because of it. Jolie is simply not able to make sense of this character. Maybe the fault is with the casting in the first place. We have to believe that Christine Collins is timid and mousy enough to allow herself, even for a moment, to believe that the boy returned to her is in fact her son, even though she's convinced he's not. But there's not a timid bone in Jolie's body, and that part of the film never makes an ounce of sense. The Christine Collins we see humbly bowing to the whims of the police doesn't match up with the Christine Collins we see in the workplace, barking orders in her role as a manager, or the flirty, glamour puss Collins that emerges toward the film's end. Pick a character, any character.There are some quite disturbing scenes involving violence toward children (violence seems almost too mild a term for what's actually done to them), scenes that are only slightly less disturbing than the ones in which John Malkovich appears, playing a pastor who aids Collins in her fight against corruption. Malkovich, by simply appearing in a film, brings it a healthy dose of \"ick\" factor, but I liked him here probably more than I ever have, just because he's one of the only characters in the movie who's not a slimeball. Jeffrey Donovan, of \"Burn Notice\" fame, plays the chief of police and decides for some reason to use an Irish accent that never quite materializes completely. Amy Ryan also appears as a fellow inmate in the institution, and looks and sounds like she should be starring in a women's prison film set in 1987.However, the film itself looks good, and though it meanders a bit, it's always engaging. Because Eastwood chooses to give it an old-time Hollywood movie feeling, some of the more histrionic and heavy-handed elements go down smoother than they might otherwise. Let's face it, the man knows his way around a movie set, and he's probably incapable of making an outright bad movie. But next time, I might suggest that he check to see if Julianne Moore is available.Grade: B+",

            "content": "Eastwood's libertarian leanings coupled with the underlying story's feminist perspective render a film that managers to make a lot of cogent points without being preachy. Collins absolutely was taken less seriously and treated worse because of being a single mother, or to use the parlance of the time an independent woman. In a different director's hands this point would have been in bold yet Eastwood renders it in graceful italics. The film's script does not fixate on the abuse of state power but Eastwood really gets that point across directorial. Instead of the two political sensibilities clashing they end up melding into a easy, restrained naturalism that utterly fits the narrative. Certain scenes are disturbing in the way they should be. There is little justice in this story and Eastwood does not flinch from all the ugly aspects of the story.Much of the film is restrained, Jolie, to her credit, is not. She gives a bold performance that renders Collins with the appropriate forceful personality. She is motherly, strong and elegant. This is truly her film from beginning to end.But I would be rueful if I didn't mention that Harner (Northcott) gives a memorizing performance. His character is human without being sympathetic. The final scene between him and Jolie is the film that has stayed with me all these years.The film has very nice cinematography. It isn't overly stylized but Eastwood and his cinematography do enough to have echos of noir present. The film has the same natural lighting style as LA Confidential. It is very visually pleasing to look at on top of the film leaning into its melodramatic aspects.This is late period Eastwood at his most interesting.",

            "content": "One thing I like about films directed by Clint Eastwood is their consistent attempt to depict the shattered American Dream. In this case, the shattered dream is that of justice in the LA of the late 20s and early 30s. Clearly, the dream has suffered at the hands of an LAPD and a judicial system that fall far short of normal requirements, even for that time. Eastwood tells the story well but it is difficult to swallow the fact that the changeling had a mother of his own and yet he was willing to impersonate young Walter and so pass off as Christine Collins' son. I thought at first that it might be because he had run away from harm but, alas, that was not the case. Sadly, that apparently minor detail opens a massive credibility gap in the film's narrative. That aside, praise must go to the effective direction, the generally sound acting, above all to the scrupulous attention to period detail, and the awesome photography. In terms of acting, the duplicitous nature of the murderer is superbly conveyed by Jason Harner but there is one serious minus: Angelina is too \"jolie\" and too stereotyped, a typical beauty down to her hat and clothing with the photography clearly emphasizing that beauty in its time capsule.As the movie progressed I found it hard to detect any real emotion in Jolie. Perhaps Estwood wanted to extract a restrained approach from her but I just do not think it works. As I see it, that is a central weakness in the film but when all is said and done, and in spite of those drawbacks, Changeling is a film well worth seeing especially because Eastwood refuses to provide an easy remedy to a very difficult situation and ultimately to paper over yet another crack in the American dream. Eastwood's honesty I value most of all: He does not shirk the usefulness of the death penalty to rid society of elements clearly unfit to live in it and, most importantly, unable to admit their evil deeds.",

            "content": "Looking past the lush setting of 1928 Los Angeles, which involves various startling trompe l'oeuil effects that must be state-of-the-art but don't help a weak plot, what is Changeling about? It frankly admits that the heroine, Christine Collins, an ambitious single mother played by screen goddess Angelina Jolie, left her nine-year-old child at home all day while she served an extra shift at the telephone company in the hope of a promotion.On this day, she failed to put her son before her work, although she had promised to take him to the movies. Furthermore, there was nobody else to step forward and take her place while she went to the office, because evidently our heroine 1.) did not have any friends 2.) did not have any relatives 3.) did not have any neighbours who could have taken care of the unfortunate boy and thereby prevented him being abducted and killed, and nor did her son have any friends whose parents might have stood in for a few hours and spared him a terrifying day abandoned in his home. So, is Changeling about a lonely, socially incompetent and neglectful mother who indirectly caused her son to be murdered by abandoning him in an empty house? No, obtusely the film is about the persecution of Mrs Collins, who complains when the LAPD fobs her off with a substitute son instead of arresting her for child abuse.Of course, the film takes pains to establish Mrs Collins as a devoted and deeply caring mother who every day accompanies her boy to a massive, impersonal educational institution by public transport, and who cuddles him lots and gives him a proper breakfast and not a packet of junk-food slung after him on the way out the door. Although she apparently has no friends, neighbours or relatives, she is one of the tiny minority who had a telephone at home in 1928, but somehow she fails to use it to check on her beloved son while she is away from him, even though she is a communications professional. Nor has she taught her son to use the instrument from which she makes her living to call her at work and enjoy a few words of reassurance during her eight-hour absence. So it's a bewildering shock to her when she waltzes home after a long day at the office and finds her totally isolated and ignored child missing. Director Clint Eastwood apparently found none of this basic premise for his movie at all ambiguous. For him, Mrs Collins was a model mother and an icon of virtue in a sea of corrupt manhood.If such directorial perversity is not enough to put you off watching this picture, then be warned about the leading lady, Ms. Jolie, whose acting abilities, already limited, are paralysed by the impossible task of portraying a villain as a heroine, and a strong-willed woman as a hapless victim. The result, inevitably, is horribly unconvincing.",

It was very intriguing and went places I was totally not expecting it to go, and I do think it will be remembered around Oscar time.Despite its obvious flaws, the drama is potent, Clint Eastwood's directing is just awesome (I think it's even better than Million Dollar Baby), and Angelina Jolie delivers an excellent performance as a determined mother. Even while others around her attempt to distort her perceptions of reality, she does not give in, ever. A brilliant performance. The setting of 1920's Los Angeles is incredible and realistic, and the fact that it's a true story blows me away; I can't believe I haven't heard this story.It's an important film to watch, and I do get that feeling it's an Oscar-caliber film.8/10",

            "content": "I hesitated quite a bit before deciding to dedicate 2 hours and 20 minutes of my time to watching Clint Eastwood's 2008 movie 'Changeling'. One of the reasons is Clint himself, I'm not one of his enthusiastic fans, and every time I face a film of his, the result is that I appreciate the film, including his talent and professionalism as a director, but I can't say I like it. There is something in his subjects and in the rigidity of his approach that keeps me at a distance. In addition, this film strongly desires to warn the audiences starting from the poster and from the introducing titles that it is based upon a 'true story'. Paradoxically, this kind of aggressive marketing makes me pay close attention to the artistic authenticity of the film, which depends on many other factors that have nothing to do with the anecdotal detail that what we see on screen is faithful or very faithful to events that happened in reality. Some of my fears were confirmed by watching 'Changeling', but fortunately there are many other reasons why at the end of watching the viewers have a chance to be satisfied even if they are not among Clint's fans.Most of the story takes place in Los Angeles in 1928, with an ending that lasts until 1935. That was the year before the Great Depression and the end of a period of expansion in California. Angelina Jolie (Angelina Jolie) is what today we call a 'single mother'. Her husband left her on the birthday of their son, Walter, and she works hard at the telephone company to ensure a decent living. One day, on a Saturday when she was called to work, 9-year-old Walter disappears. Kidnapped? Murdered? Strange events took place in California at that time, including the disappearance of children. After a few months, the police announce that Walter has been found on the other side of America, but when he appears, Christine is convinced that the boy police brought to her is not her son. From here the action branches into two parallel threads. One is a social drama about the single woman facing a corrupt system that refuses to admit mistakes and goes so far as to lock her up in a psychiatric institution to make her accept the official version. The other is a police investigation into the abduction of children, possibly related to the boy's disappearance. Spectators will judge the extent to which the two threads of the story merge and clarify each other.Clint Eastwood seems to love so much the cinema of the 60s and 70s, the timewhen he was at the peak of his acting career, that even now, when he is a well-known director, some the films he directs have a flavour that belongs to that era. The 2008 'Changeling' is a film about the late '20s that seems to have been made in the' 70s. The screenplay written by J. Michael Straczynski has an interesting idea, switching over two cinematic stereotypes. Unlike a few other Hollywood movies that retrospectively forgive the LAPD and its officers of any guilt in connection with the violent methods used to fight organised crime, in 'Changeling' the police plays the role of the 'bad guys', while to the help of the single woman fighting the system comes as the 'good guy' a preacher with a radio audience, the kind of those who would gain a much worse reputation, at least in movies. John Malkovich seems a bit over-cast in the role of Pastor Gustav Briegleb. I greatly appreciated the acting performance of an actor I didn't know, Jason Butler Harner in the role of a criminal the kind that Peter Lorre was undertaking in the 1930s in the films of Fritz Lang and Alfred Hitchcock. Angelina Jolie didn't convince me here either that she deserves her acting fame. Tom Stern's cinematography, on the other hand, is remarkable, with scenes filmed on location appropriately enhanced by computers to reconstruct the topography of the period, plus an impressive parade of cars of the time. I also liked the music, chosen and composed by Eastwood himself - discreet enough not to bother and expressive enough to emphasize the mood, with a main theme that deserves to be added to the playlist of famous musical themes. For me, 'Changeling' - like other Eastwood-directed films - failed to engage me emotionally, but many of its artistic qualities are to be appreciated and make the film worth watching.",

This isn't the very peak of his abilities, but as for movies of this type, it's nearly without equal. It is a truly inspiring piece on standing your ground, and fighting on when the system refuses to help you. This is a tremendously strong woman, and often not just \"for the time\"(and yet it does not feel anachronistic; add to that the marvelously achieved look, with amazing sets and costumes). The mother-son relationship is gripping, without crossing into obsession(I'm looking at you, The Forgotten). This is an emotional roller-coaster that very nearly moved me to tears(and that doesn't happen frequently), and it is absolutely devastating, unpleasant and terrifying. It is not a coincidence that this opens with \"this is a true story\", instead of saying \"based on\". While I do not know how close to the actual events it is, it certainly feels authentic. This builds up suspense and tension well when it goes for them, though note that neither are the focus here. The dialog is good and well-delivered. Jolie gives a stunning performance(Clint has been quoted as remarking that few would notice, since she is so attractive), and with only one or two exceptions(I maintain that the titular person was wooden, and no, not only when he was supposed to be \"rehearsed\"), the kids are amazing actors, as well, especially the one seen the most(there will be no spoilers in this review). The characterizations are well-done, if you could argue that it is a bit black and white. Humor isn't bad, or overly frequent. There is a lot of disturbing content, occasional bloody and brutal(if not all graphic) violence, a little swearing(all used for and with effect, not remotely gratuitous) and brief nudity(not sexual) in this. The DVD comes with two featurettes, both of them up here on the site, so I will be writing about them on their individual pages. I recommend this to any fan of the film-makers.

Much like \"Bordertown\", it's an example of justice pursuance.Being a woman in a period that women have no rights must had been terrifying for Mrs. Collins. It is interesting to see that even though the society was very macho, women fought for their rights and some men supported them. It was also interesting to notice that the only way of reading about the city problems were through the newspaper, which nowadays we know how tendentious it can be.Angelina Jolie acting was good, although her character wasn't that hard to play.About the death penalty: I don't think it should be used anywhere in this world. Leave the condemned stuck in jail for the rest of his life, but don't kill him... the man in this movie was a serial killer, a coward, but after all he's an human who will suffer before dying like he did in the movie.

Beautifully filmed and acted, Changeling is a delight for moviegoers and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or mystery.

            "content": "No one involved in this project has anything to prove. The assembling of such talent pretty much assures a positive outcome, yet, there's something missing here, and what's missing is crucial. The director focuses on the surfaces of this story and everything seems glazed and frozen. Particularly, Ms. Jolie who brought such passion to \"A Mighty Heart\"; she never convinced me of the desperation a mother must have felt in this situation.But the real fault is in the screenplay by J. Michael Straczynski which has to incorporate some pretty sensational material that the viewer constantly wants to reject. At least 40 minutes of the entire running time of this film incorporates a second story that is absent in the previews. That story belongs in a genre of films like \"Se7en\" or \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\" While I'm a big fan of horror films, I was unprepared for where this story went. All the facts here are documented by court and police records, yet as presented it's too fantastical to believe. And given the care of the elements in art direction, it's easy for the viewer to remain focused, say, on how carefully Ms. Jolie's elaborate make-up is applied.Eastwood is capable of masterpieces. \"Million Dollar Baby\" is a film that any director would have been proud to have his name on. Throughout his career he's been surrounded by the perverse and the extreme, and \"Changeling\" seems only an excuse to wallow in the perverse and the extreme.It's too bad, because the material, in the right hands, would have been electrifying. This, however, is only tedious with a few sequences that show promise, then we get the death thoes of someone shoved in our face while Ms. Jolie stands and looks beautiful; and, we wonder what on earth the character must be thinking (and where on earth is the director besides fussing with some period detail).",

But she really proved herself as an actress in Changeling and this is another triumph for the great Clint Eastwood even though some parts of the movie are not accurate but other than that, it's one of the best movies of 2008.I'm amazed that I had never heard about the true story about Christine Collins and the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Like we start with a single mother living in Los Angelos who's son goes missing. But after a while, the police find a boy but he's not her son. But the police insist Christine by taking the boy home and try him out even though she keeps telling the police he's not her son. She finds evidence proving that the boy isn't her son and begs the police to reopen her son's case. But as a result, the police become outraged and put her in a psychiatric ward. Then later the police arrest a teenager who confesses that he and his psychotic cousin (or uncle) Gordan Northcott kidnapped and murdered a bunch of kids. He identifies one of the boys as Walter Collins. But it's nice to see that a film as dark and tragic as this one had a happy ending when the police find a boy, who was presumed killed at the ranch where the group of boys were murder, escaped the ranch along with Walter Collins and another boy. And in the end, this gave Christine Collins hope. In conclusion, if you're a Clint Eastwood fan and/or an Angelina Jolie fan, I'd recommend that you see this movie because I'd say you'd love it!",

            "review_title": "Changeling undoubtedly goes to waste, no matter how powerful it may be.",
            "content": "They say that timing is everything, and while it is certainly a hard thing to imagine many audiences in our current social climate wanting to go see a film as downright dark and confrontational as Changeling, the quality of the feature as a whole remains a statement as to why you might want to give it a try. There's no doubt about it however, Eastwood here delivers a thoughtful and extremely emotive tale that very rarely caters to anyone's desires for uplifting holiday entertainment, and as such, things can get a little overbearing. Nevertheless, despite a severe miscalculation in terms of release, there's still plenty to take away from the experience, even if it does ask that you leave all expectations of personal enjoyment in the lobby; from the top class ensemble of performers to the stark detail present in Straczynski's script, Changeling is a gruelling and oft emotionally demanding tale that bestows a feeling of fulfilment and depth in place of entertainment. For that purpose I can only advise this to the select few willing to subject themselves to a story even more depressing than the world we live in today; and in that regard Changeling undoubtedly goes to waste, no matter how powerful it may be.Telling the true story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) and her battle with the LAPD after her son goes missing and is replaced by a fraudulent impostor, Straczynski here delves into territory that he is all too familiar with. This experience in dealing with conspiracy, corruption, politics and personal grievance gives the writer a firm hold on both his characters and plot, all of which are notably out of balance and overly contorted in the film's earlier stages, but come together neatly enough in the end. To his greatest credit however, Straczynski always keep the focus on his characters rather than his overriding themes; Changeling is a story of human perseverance for the cause of justice in a world where the word itself reeks of absurdity. It's a story that continually challenges the viewer and reveals layer after layer of development in both character and plot to the point where all such misgivings regarding the movie's dark nature are soon dispelled. Christine Colins' story certainly isn't one to be taken lightly by any means, but there remains light within the screenplay that glints at some form of hope, even if it does take the form of a shoestring. This acute balance of desperation and the harsh, bitter reality of Colins' predisposition isn't perfect \u0096more tears are shed in this movie than the average weepy- but nevertheless fulfils its purpose adequately enough in detailing a powerful struggle with corruption and personal loss.When it comes to the movie's biggest selling point, that is, the performers and the cowboy directing them however, I am of conflicting thoughts; on the one hand the movie for the most part remains coherent and rigorously compelling beginning to end, with little to no missteps from most involved. On the other hand I couldn't help but notice that leading star Angelina Jolie here, although giving a by-the-book Oscar-nod performance, too often reeks of trying too hard. She and director Clint Eastwood shoot Collins as an extremely withered, frail and timid creature prone to weeping at any given chance; sure, there are plenty of moments when this is poignant and warranted to her character, but an abundance of these scenes such as is present here, cheapens her to someone that doesn't feel as human as she ought to be. What's most striking is that given her position, she too often sinks into the background when brought in amongst her co-stars; yes, her character isn't the most photogenic for the big screen, but with so much focus on so little development on the main character herself, the result is more blunt than to the point. With much more convincing and striking performances from the maniacal, slimy Jason Harner and the ever compelling John Malkovich however, Changeling more often than not hits the nail on the head in the performance department. Placed within the terrific production values of the movie which transport you back into 1920's America with absolute ease that never draws attention to itself, Eastwood does fantastically well with the remainder of Straczynski's multi-layered and dynamic script. Yet constantly burdened with a limp sense of focus and direction coupled with an overbearing sense of tragedy that too often milks the audience for all the tears its worth, Changeling is in no way perfect, no matter how convincing its appearance might otherwise have you believe. For all it's worth though, the movie remains as a remarkably solid and well told historically based drama that more often than not gets the job done in conveying the contrast between the light and dark sides of human desire, ambition and power.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",

Stellar acting on the part of everyone--and their are a number of characters--really bring this film home.This is the single best film I've seen in years.

The isolation of her character was intense and very well drawn but the constant close attention to her face just moved attention away from other characters (who were hugely reduced) and from the story. Sadly when they did appear they were not wholly appealing. The police were one dimensional characters of stock \"we've been caught with our provincial pants down\" plot lines and the \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" scenes in the psychiatric ward were less harrowing and more hackneyed. The best scenes were from the mother of the returning child, who escaped from the serial killer and the trial and enquiry running together. However, if I had been the Changeling, I would have stayed at home rather than live with those lips. Sorry Clint.",

            "review_title": "Best Clint Eastwood film to date",
            "content": "\"Changeling\" is a film encompassing multiple plot elements: L.A. police corruption during the '20s, gender politics of the '20s, and power-hungry public figures. However all of these elements branch from the spine of this plot in which a single mother, (Christine Collins played by Angelina Jolie) comes home one day to find that her young son Walter, has disappeared. After some investigation the police return a young boy to her custody whom they claim to be her son. Collins however, believes this boy to be an impostor, and on her search to find the son she feels she's lost, she finds herself up against a web of corruption, and the gauntlet of a very public crusade against it.The plot devices of the injustices of police corruption, and a society that believes women to be fragile of body, mind and character; are compelling and empowering to say the least. The bleakness of Eastwood's tone (the cooler color schemes, the sparse soundtrack, and the seemingly endless roster of selfishly driven archetypical characters) make Christine's struggle appear to be an impossible one. However if you are a parent or have parental instincts you feel emotionally obligated to go on this journey with her.The characters are interestingly portrayed. The bad guys are REALLY bad, and the sympathetic characters are all afflicted in some way; Hardly the hopeful message this film drives towards. The film continues to get even more morbid than expected when it delves into a sensitive subject that has been navigated by Eastwood with both tact, and brutal honesty; and that subject is that of child predators. Much of the violence against children is psychological as opposed to graphic, but it is disturbing to sit through nonetheless. However this plot element is so effective due to brilliant casting. Jason Butler Harner, who plays Gordon Northcott (a child killer who might've killed Collins' son) was particularly good in his role; not just for his portrayal of Northcott's tortured motivations, but for his cowardice, (because let's face it; the only killers capable of preying on the most innocent and defenseless members of society are cowards.) Also quite notable was the child actor Eddie Alderson as Sanford Clark: Northcott's young accomplice.And yet as you continue on this dark, disturbing journey with Christine Collins, although the triumphs are few and far between, you understand her unwavering vigilance. You come to understand that although she may never find her son, the small victories she did accomplish wouldn't have happened without her undying sense of hope in the face of despair. I recommend seeing \"Changeling\" for the dramatic portrayal of a true story of hope. However, be prepared to have your heart broken a few times along the way.",

Mr. Clint Eastwood's directing is, as always, superb - his deft austerity of style finely balanced with the patience to capture the emotional depth and integrity of the performances. He clearly understands the needs of actors and also knows how to remain creatively open to capture the brilliant moments as they happen.Ms. Angelina Jolie is impeccable and truthful as Christine Collins. Her performance is visceral in emotion yet subtle. It is wonderful to see her become the character to the point where we forget we are watching Angelina Jolie but instead are captivated by her character. That is the mark of being more than a star, but being a true actor.Mr. John Malkovich also achieves this, never wavering from the truth of the scene. His performance in this film is heartfelt and real, his acting without pretense. Pure, focused, and most importantly, authentic. It is a refreshing reminder of why he is so revered.The other actors in this film stepped up to the plate and gave commendable performances. Colm Feore is, as always, engaging in his charm (practiced without seeming so), Jason Butler Harner natural and upsetting (as the character should be), Jeffrey Donovan riveting and precise (like a finely tuned instrument) Michael Kelly edgy and honest (an honest cop without ever being clich\u00e9) Amy Ryan exciting and unwavering (always real in each moment). The list goes on.Critics often criticize rather than critique. I am not a critic. I am a filmmaker, thus it is rare that a film will engage me to the point where I am no longer dissecting it as I am watching. This one did, so I felt compelled to write something. For what it is worth, Bravo to everyone involved, to the Writer for bringing this story to light and to the Producers who believed enough make it happen and to the Cast and Crew for what is clearly a successful collaboration.

It's a mesmerizing human drama that pulls us in, to the haunting strains of Eastwood's resonant score.9 year old Walter Collins disappears from their suburban home while Christine is out working at a telephone company. The LAPD does a rather sloppy job with the investigation. Five months later, when the trail has gone cold, Christine finally gets word that Walter has been found. In a taut scene later, LAPD stages a massive press conference in order to generate good press for the embattled police department, which has fought allegations of corruption and brutality.but Christine threatens to rain on their parade when she points out that the boy (Devon Conti) is not her son. With that revelation, the film veers into spooky, almost surreal territory. As Changeling gathers momentum and shifts tone, it retains a unifying quality, a bleak and melancholy air that sustains it through its transformations. Clint Eastwood, at the peak of his artful powers, adds to his already impressive body of directorial accomplishments with Changeling - a sordid tale of the abuses of power, a gripping mystery and a shrewd historical period piece which documents several concurring events which changed the landscape of Prohibition era Los Angeles. He tightens the screws of suspense without ever forgetting where the heart of his film lies. Lesser hands might let the story sink into teary sentiment.Yet the real draw here is Angelina Jolie. Not only does she dazzle visually with her unique features heightened with pale complexion and red lipstick, but Jolie provides an emotionally breathtaking performance. She plays Christine Collins like a gathering storm, moving from terror to a fierce resolve. The trauma she suffers is almost tangible as it pours off the screen. View the scene where she confronts the impostor posing as her son; tremble at her throaty scream; feel the pain and anguish. She evokes every parent's worst nightmare, and provides a career defining performance while doing so. All in all, it is a devastatingly poignant story, beautifully told by a filmmaker right at the top of his game. A failure that's more involving than most successes!",

Angelina Jolie does a nice job playing against stereotype, and Eastwood's direction is as confident and assured as we've all grown to expect, the production values are top of the line, longtime Eastwood conspirator/DP Tom \"Blood Work\" Stern's camera-work is beautiful and mostly understated, letting Eastwood tell the tale without undue showiness, and the ensemble work of Jolie, etal. is of a piece, even the kids. J. Michael \"Babylon 5\" Straczynski's screenplay is reasonably taut given the necessary attention to a lot of detail to make sense of the case (and let Jolie complete her character arc), but could have been tightened further. The brilliant John Malkovich is mostly wasted in a role that could almost have been written out, but I suppose a paycheck is a paycheck. I'm bemused by the heavily international weight of the current IMDb voting bloc for \"Changeling,\" but as it penetrates home video, I imagine that will change.I'd have liked to have seen a stronger thematic attention to the parallels between the institutional abuse suffered by Mrs. Collins and the equally tragic abuse suffered by her son and the other children. Strange, isn't it, that we attribute distinctive personal failure to the latter, but tend to lose our focus on individual responsibility when it comes to systemic failures? I'll definitely be looking forward to seeing what Mr. Straczynski does with \"World War Z,\" a zombie apocalypse novel I enjoyed a great deal.",

Most of this was discovered when a Canadian child illegally in the U.S. spills the goods to a semi-decent cop, Detective Ybarra (Michael Kelly, DAWN OF THE DEAD) who tries to bring this to the attention of his superiors only to be rebuffed because \"it doesn't look good for the department.\" On Ms. Collins' side (even while she's in the loony bin) is Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich, BURN AFTER READING) who learns of Christine's problems with the LAPD and already has a running battle going on with them over their autocratic style. His assistance is invaluable in aiding in Christine's release from the mental institution ...as well as releasing the other women who were wrongfully imprisoned on behalf of the LAPD.History tells us that Mr. Northcott gets what's coming to him. He's a slightly pitiable and disgusting fellow who was probably completely insane. Actor Jason Harner played him exceptionally well; a creepy and frightening premonition from the past. We also learn that several LAPD higher-ups get canned in the wake of the breaking news about the despicable things the authorities have done.Most of the praise obviously goes to Angeline Jolie for her excellent portrayal of Christine Collins. You can feel the rising tension as she battles to find her son and butts up against the walls of \"justice.\" Frustration is palpable. And you hope beyond hope that little Walter survived his ordeal. But did he? History tells us he probably didn't. But who knows. He could be a changeling, wandering out there, lost amidst the masses. We hope...(Final note: Clint Eastwood needs to stay behind the camera from now on. He's got what it takes to remain a powerful director. Please!)",

            "content": "'Changeling' is based on a true story. It's a harrowing account of a mother whose son disappears for 5 months but is subsequently returned to her, or is he? Angelina Jolie delivers one of her best performances, with shades of her Oscar-winning 'Girl, Interrupted' performance. In fact, her performance is probably even better in this film. However, although the film is promising at first, it devolves into a diluted hodgepodge of mystery/thriller, conventional courtroom drama, and social commentary on police corruption, civil commitment, and capital punishment. Nevertheless, Clint Eastwood knows how to spin a yarn and paces the film just right to draw you in (except the end, which is a bit overlong).",

Until the violence enters into your life. You can't imagine the unspeakable pain that is ripped from you when the truth comes to the surface.Angeline Jolie is fantastic in this film. Best I've ever seen. She morphs into the role without her glamour, seamlessly. You can feel the frustration in her eyes. The pain she suffers is within her hunched over body language. She's a distraught mom and plays it perfectly. I think Malkovich was completely underrated in this flick. He plays a pastor who is clearly fed up with police corruption. You don't know what they've done to him in the past, but you feel he's on a crusade.You feel that his lost cut deep in the past. And he seemed to relish in being a blustery fire-n-brimstone defender of justice.Eastwood's direction, as usual, is very low-key. He gives you the era without making it flashy. I LOVED the production design on this movie. Every corner made you feel like your were enveloped by this world. An amazing feat when you consider how much was done in-camera.

I'm so annoyed by this, that I am inspired to write my first ever review.The only reason I didn't give it a 1 out of 10 is that the old cars were sweet.Above all the other pathetic elements of this movie was Angelina's blatant overacting. She was screechy, veiny, fakely teary, and loud. I guess the paltry dialogue isn't strictly her fault, but if I had to hear her bleat the words \"MY SON\" one more time, my eardrums would hopefully have imploded. Couldn't Clint have switched it up with the kid's name, or \"MY KID,\" or \"MY CHILD?\" Just to keep things fresh, you know? The plot- Law and Order: 1920's. That simple. Psycho kills kids. Cops evilly bungle around (except for one heroic one, who eventually solves the case). One kid (coincidentally Jolie's SON, HER SON!!!) acts heroically, because he's just that cool. Seriously, just watch Law and Order- better plot, none of the MY SON, MY SON.One last thing- are we really to believe that Angelina is so whimperingly timid and passive at the beginning of the movie that she can't say \"uh, this ain't my kid\" when presented by the wrong twerp, but by the end she's a female gladiator/crusader for justice? Gimme a break.I hope she never found the stupid kid. No sympathy for the woman, more like hatred.",

Straczynski's script is well poised, with clarity and well defined differences in character. The narrative drive is balanced and always engaging. Indeed it may be a school for scriptwriters like Towne's Chinatown continues to be.And then there's Eastwood's direction, precise, integral to the story and timed so well that like all of his later films it has a distinctive sense of time. Just count the beats, it is unlike any other director. It makes the reaction shots work, it gives space to the pauses, and because the actors are thinking under the direction, these are not dead spare, unnecessary moments. It is distinctively American in tone and phrasing.If there is one small snipe it's Eastwood's musical score: they are sounding too similar with their limpid, even folksy simple, melodies; and while they work in parts, they are not the strongest artistic element.And central to the project is the story which is one of the best and saddest and proves why strong stories still make engaging movies.",

            "content": "There's no more gripping mystery than a missing child case. Just take a look at the tabloids, who reported the disappearance of little Caylee Anthony for months. If it is a gripping drama for outside viewers, imagine what it must be like for the parents of a missing child. That's what Clint Eastwood's harrowing film, \"Changeling,\" gives us. This is an unforgettable film.Los Angeles, 1928. Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) leaves for work. When she gets home, her son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) isn't there. She calls the police, but to no avail. But after months of searching, her son is found. However, the boy returned is not Walter. The police don't believe her, and do everything to make her go away. Help arrives with the Reverend Gustav A. Briegleb (John Malkovich), who has long been denouncing the corruption in the LAPD.\"Changeling\" has a brilliant story, and director Clint Eastwood wisely focuses on that. Therefore, I find it rather odd that Angelina Jolie walked off with an Oscar nod for her performance. Don't get me wrong, Jolie's performance is amazing, but I think her Oscar recognition was more due to the fact that it would have gotten a lot more viewers if Hollywood's Most Beautiful Couple (Jolie and Brad Pitt) were nominated in the same year. Then again, I guess some recognition has to go to Jolie for being able to pull off a meek disposition in front of the cameras.Jolie is helped by a number of solid supporting performances. John Malkovich is surprisingly good, playing against type as Briegleb. If someone were to tell me about the character, Malkovich, having made a career out of playing creeps and psychos, is the last person I would have picked. But Malkovich holds his own. Jeffrey Donovan is PERFECTLY cast as the corrupt police officer, Captain J. J. Jones. If there's anyone who can put on an instantaneous fake smile, it's Donovan. That, and he is so good at being so thoroughly unlikable. Jason Butler Harner is chilling as Gordon Stewart Northcutt, bearing a very strong similarity (in both his looks and his performance) to Cillian Murphy. Michael Kelly is warmly low-key as Detective Lester Ybarra, the first cop who is willing to publicly believe Christine. Colm Feore, looking more gaunt than ever, is also effective as the corrupt Chief of Police.Special mention has to go to the cinematography and the costume design. The color is desaturated, but in an artful kind of way. It looks like a magazine ad, and the effect is amazing. The costume design is spot-on. Everyone looks just like they did in the 20's. If the story weren't so engaging (which it is), \"Changeling\" would be watchable just because of how it looks.I've lost confidence in Clint Eastwood's direction after the vastly over-rated \"Million Dollar Baby.\" But with \"Changeling,\" Eastwood proves that he's not afraid to take a chance with his films. And he has the skills to pull it off.Rent \"Changeling.\" It's better than most of the so-called mysteries out there. It's tremendously involving, and unlike most \"thrillers,\" it's never predictable. That's more than can be said for many films.",

            "review_title": "Interesting, if not a simple, example of a mother's desperation...",
            "content": "In 1928, Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a single parent and working class woman in Los Angeles, leaves her son, Walter (Gattlin Grifith), at home to attend a last-minute work schedule. By the time she returns she discovers that Walter is missing and files a missing child's report. Over the next few months Christine attempts to search for her son by any means possible, yet the LAPD discover a stranded boy who they believe to be Walter. Upon being reunited with her son, Christine's joy turns to dismay as she discovers that the boy is not her son, even though he claims to be.Based upon true events the film automatically gains a shocking realism in conjunction to it's subject matter, which develops into a frightening case as the film progresses. What starts off as a simple case of a child going missing, turns into a complex matter of police incompetence and the desperate struggle of a mother. But this is not to say that the film flows from point to point without any hitches. While the first three quarters are intriguing to watch, especially with the addition of a hint of horror elements adding spice to the drama, the first half the film's final quarter drags the film to a standstill. The main reason for this is that by the time the last quarter starts, you'll already know how the film is going to end, even if you have no idea about the events on which the film is based. It's predictable what will happen to Walter, what becomes of Christine, and what becomes of the LAPD, but the film attempts to drag its run time by making these issues seem suspenseful. This falls directly within the film's major problem, the lack of ambiguity. From the very outset we know what Walter looks like ,and the boy claiming to be him later in the story only partially resembles him. Clint Eastwood never allows for the audience to question the integrity of Christine, such as many people at the time would have most likely done as well. The very chance to make the film more believable is never played upon.But beyond that there is very little to criticize the film except for the fact that Christine never really places any blame on herself for leaving her child alone in the house at a time when many children were going missing. It's a small thing, and her self-blame could be read into her actions, but it appears that she is too willing to blame outside factors and never really accept that she should have done more then just have the neighbours go over to check on Walter, which itself is never played upon because it is never stated whether the neighbours did or did not.Nevertheless, the acting which is top notch. Every major character does a great job of showcasing their respective character with realism. Angelina Jolie steals the show: her bodily expressions in conjunction with the pure veracity of her emotions and speech is breathtaking. When she is happy, Jolie has a glow to her; when she is desperate and angered at the loss of her child, Jolie is every inch the mother you would expect her to be. Jeffrey Donovan, as Captain Jones, is smug as he should be and annoyed at the constant plea from Christine. Michale Kelly comes across as interested and sympathetic as his character, Detective Ybarra, should have been when investigating the cases of missing children. If there is a little disappointment it would be John Malcovich as Reverend Briegleb, but not because he underachieves but because there is not enough screen time to allow Malcovich to really play with the role. He comes across as a little stifled, but this doesn't stop some good acting on his part.There is no sex, nudity and minimum language. Violence is kept for the latter half of the film but is performed in flashbacks, occur very quickly and the victim is off-screen, though that doesn't stop them being quite haunting.The Changeling is a good film, though not quite one of Eastwood's best. Yes the acting ensemble is really good, especially from Jolie, and there is an interesting plot. However this does not stop the film being predictable and not as suspenseful as it ought to be, and the main case of this is the lack of ambiguity. Everything in the Changeling is far too stated which, for the real life events themselves, was not the case.",

            "content": "Changeling is a reasonably well written and well made movie, but personally I don't think it's one of Angelina Jolie's best performances and I'm not certain she was truly Oscar-nomination worthy for this. (She didn't win.) Normally I'm an Angelina fan, but I couldn't warm to her in Changeling at all. The cast includes John Malkovich, Michael Kelly and Colm Feore, all of whom are good within the limits of fairly one dimensional characters, but there was something about Jolie's persona in this movie that I just didn't find believable.Perhaps she has reached that unfortunate stage where she is just such a big deal in the media, so often plastered all over the internet and the gossip magazine covers, that it's hard to suspend belief and allow her to sink into a character. In the morning, while standing in line at the grocery store, you idly read about her marriage to Brad, in the evening you try to believe in her as a devastated 1920s mother. Tom Cruise has reached a similar stage for me; I just look at him and think \"Oh yeah, that's Tom Cruise in a costume\u0085\" Which is a pity because he's not a bad actor either.I've loved Jolie in many other movies, I thought her performance in A Might Heart for instance, far superior to this. I also liked her in that popcorn flick Wanted, because in a film of that nature, it doesn't matter that she's a media babe. But for me this movie was all about Angelina Jolie in a costume, not about Christine Collins, the character she was trying to portray on screen.Ms Jolie looked stick thin even by her usually skinny standards, almost to the point of emaciation, with huge rouged lips which dominated the screen in every shot she was in, emphasized by her skeletal appearance. I just couldn't take my eyes off her mouth, which may well have been the director's intention but it ruined the movie for me. Angelina has two gestures in this film; eyes brimming with tears or her hand attempting to cover her mouth. I found the gestures over used, and no substitute of good acting. Sorry if this sounds harsh, but I've seen her give much better performances and I think she was miscast.Directed by Clint Eastwood, the script is based on reality and deals with both the disappearance of a child in 1920s Los Angeles, and the corruption of the city's police force at that time. It's certainly an interesting story and well worthy of telling. When her son Walter goes missing, single parent Collins (Jolie) is understandably frantic with worry. Days, then weeks and finally months go by with no word, then finally a child of the right age turns up in Illinois and the police bring him home. The LAPD arrange a big photo op at the train station, to help their flagging public image, damaged by accusations of corruption at the highest levels. But the child isn't Walter, and Collins says so, vociferously.The police will not admit they have made a mistake and try to convince Mrs Collins that Walter has simply changed because of his long absence. How, she wonders, can he have shrunk three inches? How come now he is circumsized? But the police employ a psychiatrist to refute Mrs Collins assertion that the child is not Walter, shifting the blame onto her (thin) shoulders and trying to label her reaction 'feminine hysteria'. Hysterical women were a popular theme back then, with us girlies labeled as too unstable and hormonal to hold down serious jobs. Women had, after all, only just gotten the vote. It was the word of an emotional mother against the might of the LAPD, and the latter won. Collins was shunted off to a psychiatric hospital for a strip search and examination and held against her will for some time, alongside some genuinely disturbed people and many rather clich\u00e9d stereotypes, such as the Tart with a Heart. We also see the Unfeeling Brutalized Ugly Nurse and the Macho Doctor Who Can Never Be Wrong.Eventually, aided by Malkovich's crusading Pastor Briegleb, Collins is released. The truth comes out about the 'son's' identity when the bodies of many small boys are revealed at a desolate country farm after a police investigation into an illegal immigrant. Arthur, the substitute son admits he just wanted to get to LA to meet cowboy Tom Mix. But Walter is still missing, presumed dead.Vindicated, but still dedicated to finding her lost child, Collins takes part in the subsequent trial of the killer and the clean-up of the corrupt police force, but never really achieves resolution about Walter's fate. To her death, she still hopes he is alive. It's a tragic and poignant story, yet at no time did I ever truly believe in it. All I ever really saw was Angelina and that mouth. Sorry, not a winner for me. You can do better Angelina. You can do MUCH better Clint.",

She recognised Angelina as well as others such as Brad Pitt and Matt Damon and knew immediately that they were bonafide legit.

It flowed with good energy and kept a nice pace that made the story dramatic and suspenseful.A woman's child goes missing and when the LAPD finds him it turns out to be the wrong child, which leads to an even greater downfall for the woman as the LAPD attempts to cover up their mistakes.Set in the late 1920s the movie speaks about police corruption on all levels and the politics that come along with it as well as the feeble metal Health program at the time.I love the art direction and costume design that takes us to that time period.Jolie's performance was very focus. The combination of Eastwood's kinetic storytelling gave it the feel of an action movie without being one. Jolie was intense as a woman whose dedication to finding her son was very black and white, similar to Eastwood's Dirty Harry character.The Movie seems very truthful to what the world was like back than. It looks good thanks to the art direction, but it's not pretty.Overall, entertaining",

I'm not an Angelina Jolie fan at all but the acting in this film is excellent. Great cast and well directed.The plot is very disturbing and i would have killed almost every cops in this story except one. You may want to watch it with a punching bag or a stress ball. A whole lot of cold hearted characters you will love to hate in this film.The police trying to convince a mother that a lying boy is in \"fact\" her kidnapped child, how crazy is that?!! Where is Dirty Harry when we need him?!I'm not a horror movie fan like \"Saw\" or \"Chainsaw Massacre\" or anything like that; THIS is a horror movie, emotionally speaking. The score composed by Eastwood is sober and effective without taking all the place. It's not the kind of movie i will watch twice though because i found it emotionally exhausting due to an high level of drama and realism. Knowing that is a \"true story\" makes it even more shocking. Good until the last drop.Thank you M. Eastwood for another brilliant piece of art!!",

            "content": "Changeling stars perhaps the most talked about person in Hollywood. Why do I even mention that? Well, I think it has an impact on the marketing for the film. Anything with Angelia Jolie is going to get attention whether it is deserving or not. I think this movie is worth talking about but I'm not so sure that Jolie's performance in the film is one of the best of the year as her Oscar nomination would tend to disagree with me.This is a factual story of a mother, Christine Collins, and her 9 year old little boy that disappeared. The Los Angeles Police Department is running wild with corruption in 1928, when the boy went missing. A few months after the disappearance, her son, Walter, was found alive in Illinois. There was a big problem. Collins said the boy was not hers. The police naturally tried to hold this case up as an example of their good police work. Collins protested and the police were determined to silence her. It was proved that the returned boy was three inches shorter than Walter, he was not recognized by school and classmates, not even the dental records matched. Still Collins was informed that she was crazy and the police had her locked up in a psychiatric ward.This film is directed by legendary Clint Eastwood. He chooses not to structure the film in a thriller type of format and does not keep his audience in the dark but rather tries to educate the audience and engage them. The story is more of a commentary and forthright storytelling in an artfully edited way. Eastwood does some amazing work here. He does it with just the right actress in Angelina Jolie. She is wonderful to watch in this totally believable and just portrayal of Christine Collins.Equally delightful in the film id John Malkovich as Reverand Gustav Briegleb. The Reverand was a radio preacher and used his show to bring attention to the rampant police corruption of the time. The LAPD works to hide their bad reputation. Collins is treated as mentally ill, which is virtually looked at as a crime in 1938 and handled with drugs, shock treatment and restraint. The story is told by the filmmakers, just told as it happened. The story is neatly condensed.Changeling is a good film and Eastwood delivers with a great cast. It is also a story worthy of being told as most stories of this caliber are. This is meat and potatoes story telling and few chances are being taken and while there is certainly commentary in the manner of the film-making and choices made by the actors there just isn't much thinking outside the box and that is what makes the film more ordinary than extra.",

Its like snapping a perfectly romantic & emotional scene with a fart. I felt sad because this movie could have been so much great; its an unbelievable story of courage , love & compassion . But the artificial attempts to \"de-melodramatise\" had an adverse impact of missing continuity and broken bonding with the characters of the movie.I think someone like Steven Spielberg could have done more justice to this story ; as in parts it reminded me that this could have been like his \"Schiendler List\" .",

Previously her parts have been dominated, and no doubt won, by her beauty. Here Eastwood ekes out a career defining acting performance in which her looks are conspicuously dressed and toned down, resulting in the unleashing of a very fine acting performance.But hers is not the only stellar performance.Jeffrey Donovan is unremittingly sly and evil as corrupt Captain Jones. Michael Kelly is superb as Detective Ybarra who stumbles across the gruesome activities at a remote farmhouse, a beacon of decency in a generally dark story.As a Director, Eastwood could not be further removed from his taciturn, largely one-dimensional but well crafted acting roles and image .His eye for 1920's detail in Los Angeles is both acute,and sumptuous.But it is his grasp of character and story which set him apart. Every part is believable and this enables him to win over the viewer to the story intellectually, and emotionally.Sub-plots of Police corruption, the role of women in 1920's American Society and contemporary Mental Health Care are starkly, awkwardly, observed, but not overplayed. The content, and intensity of performance makes this sometimes uncomfortable to watch, but what unfolds is never less than compelling.A modern classic, where story, dialogue, performance and setting combine to produce cinematic magic.",

Though this movie is a little too long, it is still great. I don't know if it's as good as Eastwood's Mystic river or Gran Torino, but it is a fantastic film anyways. Changeling is the true story of a woman named Christine Collins(played greatly by Angelina Jolie in her Oscar nominated performance). Her life falls apart when she goes to work one day and when she returns she finds out that her son is gone. When she goes to the police, they ignore her. But after six months, they say that they have found him. So when she goes to see her son, she realizes that it's not him. And when she tells that to the main detective shown(played by Jeffery Donovan), he doubts it the whole time. When she takes him home, she finds out that it is not her for sure. Eventually for Christine's doubts, they lock her up in a mental hospital. You do find out what happened to her son. But I don't want to go into that because it is kind of creepy. As is the movie at times. Even when I was younger, I have always hated cops. After seeing a film like Changeling, I hate them even more. The whole movie they are trying to make themselves look good. But they're not. They are all A-holes. Jolie does very well as Christine Collins. John Malkovich does particularly get too much to do as a priest or whatever who believes in Christine. So, maybe this isn't Clint Eastwood's best film. But I was engaged by every minute of this movie. Big thumbs up.",

            "review_title": "Forces Viewers to Confront a Truth",
            "content": "Clint Eastwood's new film, Changeling, forces viewers to confront a truth they would normally want to avoid -- the nature of the human animal. Eastwood, himself, has said lately that it is almost unbelievable how cruel people can be.The movie tells the story of Christine Collins, a California woman whose son was abducted in March of 1928. Ms. Collins ended up having to face not only the agony of losing her child, but the corruption of public officials, who decided they had to squelch her when she refused to say that a boy they claimed to have rescued was actually her son. She was seized by the police and thrown into a psychiatric ward, where she was mistreated and pressured to sign a statement acknowledging that the boy was her own.There is no telling what might have happened to her, had it not been discovered about the same time that a psychopath had murdered a number of boys at his farm on the outskirts of Los Angeles, and that there was evidence pointing to one of the kidnapped boys as Christine Collins's son.Those are the bare facts of the case, which critics say the movie depicted accurately. One might argue, based just on what happened, that the film is, at least partially, an upbeat tale, since the fraud was made public. It does, after all, show that many people were both kind and brave in their support of Christine Collins. Mercy and courage, however, are not what remain in one's mind after he has digested this film. It is not intended to make us feel good about ourselves.Despite the sensational events Eastwood had at his disposal, he chose not to descend to melodrama. It's a stark movie, not only in its visual effects but also in the tone it imparts. We are left feeling that this is what happens when humans are involved, and that it will keep on happening forever. People have, at best, only a slight power to mitigate it.What is it that causes people to chop little boys up with axes? What is it that leads public officials to exploit such events to advance their own positions? What is it that induces experts willfully to propagate lies because it's to their monetary advantage? Eastwood doesn't offer us fancy explanations. Changeling says, merely: because that's what people are. Plain and simple.That being what people are, what are we to do about it? There's slight answer in the film to that question. Yes, people can struggle against falsehood and viciousness. And they can win small skirmishes. But Eastwood doesn't tell us that's victory, because it's not.If you want to find something positive in Changeling, here it is, in its bleakness. Humans have to change, and not just moderately, if life is not to be perpetually punctuated by horror and pathetic misery. They can't keep on being the same sort of creatures they have been.Is it possible for humans to change? We don't know. Our inability to have confidence in human change is, perhaps, the largest impediment to making the effort. It's far easier to be conservative, to believe in unwavering human nature, to pull on the mantle of wisdom by acknowledging the conditions we have known as just the way things are. We can, of course, tell ourselves that hideous injustices will be repaired in a future life, as one of the characters in the film proclaims.You can tell yourself that. But I don't think that's what the film is advising us to do. Rather it is saying: get to the bottom. When you get there, you can't be sure you will ever get out. But, unless you get there, it is a certainty that you will never get out.A message of that sort doesn't make for Hollywood popularity. Changeling will probably not be a big moneymaker. All the same, I'm glad Eastwood chose to bring it to us.",

            "content": "How did someone who started out making spaghetti westerns get so self-important and full of himself as Clint Eastwood? I haven't seen the entire movie, beginning to end, just sections of it on TV and I just can't force myself to go all the way with it. It had the 'one eye on the Oscars' syndrome feel to it.I think Eastwood has seen too many Spielberg movies and went for the expensive production values rather than memorable characters. Both are experts at creating 2 dimensional characters that I couldn't care less about.First. I love Angelina Jolie but in this dreck, I cringed every time she was on the screen. I didn't empathize with her character's situation at all, which is pretty hard for a movie to fail at so totally given the naturally compelling 'situation'.Second. The story seemed so hopelessly depressing that I couldn't bring myself to care one way or another about her, the kid, the Depression or whatever.Third and most obvious was Eastwood's deliberate and overdone attempt to authentically recreate the era with clothes, cars, streetcars, and all kinds of stuff that seemed to take center stage over anything else. Surprisingly, there were still a lot of anachronisms with things in the movie that weren't created or used till years later. Fail.Sometimes, it's better for a director to create the illusion of an era in the imagination of the audience rather than excruciating close up shots of details to 'force' the notion. Heck, Michael Keaton's spoof, Johnny Dangerously, recreated the era better even while taking great artistic liberties. I'm reminded of how audiences who saw Gone With The Wind thought they saw great Civil War battle scenes in the movie when there wasn't one single shot of that kind. That's great movie making, not simply spending lots of money finding old cars and other objects from that time and putting them in your face on the screen.It's always amazing how some low-budget movies without big stars can do a much better job of storytelling, character development and overall entertainment than the big shots with money to burn.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood doesn't do happy endings. For the last half-hour of the movie or so, he strung my emotions out hoping against hope that he would go against tradition but no. Gah. And yet, like his best works of late, Changeling is an amazing watch.Set in the 1920's, a single mother loses her son only to find herself saddled with a boy the police claim - no, insist - is her son. When she actually stands up to them, they denounce her and eventually lock her up in a mental asylum.I think the 20's must be a time alien to most viewers nowadays. I was quite annoyed with many of the movie theater's audience giggling at inappropriate moments. In this day and age, it must be hard to imagine how the police can be so overtly corrupt, and how women were supposed to know their place and remain meek and subdued. Admittedly, even I thought some of the events that took place bordered on the ridiculous.What makes this movie not quite at the level of Eastwood's Mystic River or Million Dollar Baby for me are a few minor quibbles. The pacing seemed somewhat off for me: the initial focus of the movie was on how the mother and her missing child, but then it switched over to spotlight the kidnapper and his abettor, as well as their dastardly deeds, and then over to the corruption of the police and their subsequent exposure, all for a bit too long before returning to mom and her child. And while the last-hour of the movie was effective in that it was emotionally draining, it did get a bit trying how Eastwood would tease over and over as to whether he would reveal the child's fate or not.The child actors could've been better. For the most part, I couldn't see their emotions on their faces, and everything they said seemed overly rehearsed.And there's the refrain. Eastwood's scores for his movies usually sit fine with me, but here, whenever the music comes back in, it's always the same refrain, so much so that I had it stuck in my head even after the movie. A movie's score is supposed to be complementary, not annoying or distracting. But like I said, these are all minor quibbles that don't really affect how powerful the movie is.With all the constant hullabaloo about Angelina Jolie and what she's up to, it's easy to forget that she really is a great actress, and this movie is immeasurably elevated by her talent. Right from the start, Jolie exuded maternal instinct - perhaps the most important quality for this movie - and convinced me of her dedication towards her child. In the next 2+ hours, Jolie's character would suffer torment after torment and yet she never fell into the traps of over-acting or melodrama. Not to mention she emoted everything as a 1920's woman.I have to say that Clint Eastwood is my favorite still-living director today, even if all his movies are as depressing as heck. Here's hoping he stays around to make many more.",

Apart from some resemblance in the plot (in both movies a boy disappears), what is in common is the lucid denunciation of a perverted, wicked institutional power, tyrannizing the common people to the point that not only does not the police help the helpless, but moves against them and against verity. It's probably my total aversion to power abuse, and arrogance in any field of life, that made me appreciate both movies so much, also because the style is always so calibrated, balanced, sane. Certainly, there are strong scenes (for example in the mental hospital) but simply because necessary to the depiction of a whole system where violence and abuse dominated. However, never is a single moment of insane taste for cruelty or violence for its own sake or for sensationalism to be perceived. It's a movie full of controlled pathos, with very intense moments, and featuring great acting (the only disturbing thing, Angelina Jolie's over-glossed lips, truly out of tune, in some cases). Once again, Clint never disappoints, on the contrary proves to a great director, combining a deep personal humanity, with a strong consciousness of the means he has in his hands, and being able to use it intensely and wisely.",

The story is based on the barely told behind the scenes drama of the notorious real-life Chicken Coop Murders, and despite liberties and facts left out, it stays so shocking that it is hard to believe it was true. The story is that Gordon Northcott was a serial murderer and pedophile sheltered by his parents and allowed to slaughter several abducted boys, but the real-life story of Christine Collins connected to the case would not be told if her court records were not spared from destruction. To me, period pieces make the best stories, and in this one, one the crooked police make a mistake in covering up a murder investigation of Christine's son, it's a doozy. It has a cast of two big stars and several unrecognizables - although the Chief of Police looks like Michael Gross or Dan Castellaneta. The plot and script are excellent; my favorite scenes are when the dentist and teacher bust the holes in the police fraud. I mean, if the corrupt cops had just played up Walter's death, they would not have screwed themselves over to be busted down the line. The most powerful point of the story is the ending and where the players and locations are today. While this story (unlike the true story) ends with the suggestion that Walter could have lived, it remains uncertain. If this story had broke in the Fifties or Sixties, he would have been found, but now, there's probably someone out there who could be his son or daughter and not be aware of it. If anything, the case needs a modern-day forensics follow-up at the modern Northcott Ranch, wherever that is.",

The whole movie keeps you guessing and waiting for the mother to find her child. When she finally gets her boy back and finds out it's not her child she begins to wonder what happened to her child. The movie was riveting and suspenseful. It was extremely slow moving and didn't pick up at any point in the movie. The scenes you thought it would pick up at it slowed back down. It was sad and a very inspiring and emotional movie. It wasn't that hard to follow just pay attention and you will understand everything that happens. The acting was brilliant and had many Oscar worthy performances. Especially Angelina Jolie who turned in a perfect performance. The story was brilliant and loved how it was based on a true story. Overall the movie does lack speed but is a good movie to go see for a rainy night.",

            "content": "this is a great movie. it has the zest of a 80's film. It has a lot of psychological appeal but most teenagers will not appreciate the directing and planning that goes into a film like this- (They'll be thinking OH HOW LONG IS THIS MOVIE, WHERE's THE ACTION etc). Of course, assuming they sneak in somehow (it's rated R for disturbing language and some horrific scenes, no sexuality involved)The first part of the movie is dull, prosaic and monotonous, it takes about 45 minutes to get into the CORE of the movie's substructure. This substructure plot is made up of 2 coinciding events: one is that the LAPD attempts to avoid embaressment by the media, and the other is a serial killer (in the Wineville murders). These two stories interplay into the life of Miss Collins, whose emotional burden is unparalleled. The LAPD pretty much screws her over, and that's the point of the movie. It's main focus is on the actions of the LAPD at the time and to narrate the life of Northcott , the serial killer.If you like psychological/mature adult drama, you will appreciate Eastwood's directing. He is a true genius of the camera and this film represents that (but it is Oscar bait: at 2 hours , it seems eastwood was doing this for an award). The trials at the end elicit sympathy and sentiment for the characters involved, and the viewer leaves with a sense of justice and hope. I have never seen a movie like this. It is long, it is great, and it exposes and inspires. the directors should not have rated R but due to a certain scene at the end, it had to be. great actors. bad thing is it is so hard looking at Miss Collin's face because her countenance is a cadaverous ghastly white, which is in opposite contrast to her lips, which are bright red. She looks so sick that she's hard to look at anymore.",

            "content": "I thought this movie would be more of a thriller about a woman trying to find her missing child after claiming the child found by the police wasn't her son. But, actually this movie is more about the LAPD police corruption. LAPD tries to hide any mistakes made by them. If someone says they are wrong, they have a habit of having them incarcerated in a mental ward. That is what happens to Chirstine Collins after she claims the child returned to her is not her son. She has all this proof her son's dentist to teacher to the fact he is 3 inches shorter than her son. Yet the police won't admit that the boy is not her son, instead they say she is confused and crazy.Chirstine finally has some info about her son when a boy admits that a man and him were involved in the kidnapping and killing of young boys. He points out a picture of Christine's son. The guy is finally found and the last part shows Christine going to two trials: one of the LAPD and the other of a child killer.The acting was pretty good in this. However, the movie could have been shorter. Because it was so long, it seemed to be void of a lot of action.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but too long. It wasn't really a mystery more about corruption. I don't think it was good enough to recommend.",

From that moment onwards, I was glued to my seat. A fantastic performance given by Angelina Jolie, and a storyline that any writer would have difficulty to come up with, it's so unbelievable, so chilling, so outrageous.

After watching this masterpiece, I was left speechless although there were a million thoughts and feelings in me about the movie.I personally think that it's either Angelina won a 2nd Oscar for her role in this movie or her only Oscar is for this role. Despite her age, she played a single-mother: Christine Collins, so well that I would spend $663942719372489 to fly to US and give her an Oscar straight away.As usual, Clint have us another masterpiece of his. Only this time round, more influential, to me at least. Why? Because it's based on true events of 1920s' L.A. \"Chsngeling\" was a true story filled with immorality, cruelty, vengeance, corruption, tragedy, tears, blood, justice and finally, the great love of any family on Earth.Although I feel that there are many parts of this movie that are way too cruel, or rather difficult to watch, I was satisfied with how the writer ended the movie. Yes, we didn't know whether Christine and Walter reunite, but the ending gave us something: hope.If \"Slumdog Millionaire\" and \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" weren't released in 2008, I truly think that this would've won Best Picture, at least get nominated and Clint Eastwood might also have at least been nominated for Best Director.In conclusion, if you're a person who can stand tragic dramas and if you're a righteous person, you would love this movie. Go watch, it's worth it and you won't regret! Just bare the length of this movie in mind.",

Direct in it's approach and simple in structure like all Eastwood Movies the movie is beautifully made. It scores very high in subject matter treatment . Full of Eastwood's archetypal conceptions on Morality, Good , evil the movie forces one to cry for the saint as well the sinner. Hope and Hopelessness are just two sides of the same coin.

            "content": "Seventy years ago, Christine Collins, the mother of a missing boy, Walter Collins, tried to convince the LAPD that they had found the wrong child. She insisted they needed to continue their investigation. Except in this case, the LAPD decided she was a trouble-maker and put her into an insane asylum to shut her up. What was the use of a woman going around bad-mouthing the LAPD about a case that had been solved? The main point: don't mess with the LAPD. Strangely, how little things have changed? The story, for those who don't know it, uncovers one of most heinous crimes against children in the 20th century, the so-called Wineville Chickencoup Murders.The LAPD comes off somewhat similarly to the recent problems with the SEC in that instead of investigating what they should have been investigating, they spend their time playing damage-control. They were hoping that putting Collins in an institution would help prevent them from being on the receiving end of fear and loathing from the public, via the press. But they put the wrong person in there. At first the story centers around Collins, her missing child, and the corruption of the LAPD. Gradually, another story emerges, the serial killing of small boys by a child molester, Gordon Northcott. Northcott makes the likes of Hannibal Lector seem somewhat tame. The exposure of this case on film is one of the most disturbing cinematic episodes I have ever viewed, right up there with scenes from Apocalypse Now! and Zodiac.The center of the film is Christine Collins, played brilliantly by Angelina Jolie in maybe the role of her career, as the wronged mother of a missing boy. Her story propelled by Jolie is quite compelling despite some of the awful circumstances that come her way, particularly her incarceration into an institution. According to the film, many women, some of them prostitutes, were unjustly incarcerated when they refused to play along with the corruption of the LAPD. This story rings strangely familiar...Again high marks go to Clint Eastwood for directing and producing what may be the most horrific film with which he has ever been involved. Northcott, the real life child murderer, is as heinous as the fictional character Scorpio from the first \"Dirty Harry\" movie. But in the case of \"Changeling\", instead of going outside the law in the name of justice, the LAPD seems to be aiding and abetting crime.After having read about the case, both of Collins and the Wineville murders, the filmmakers did a tremendous job in maintaining much historical accuracy. Which may also keep some viewers away. This is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen, and is definitely not for the feint of heart. Or those with emotional instability. The entire story draws the viewer in like a reluctant witness to the injustices of the LAPD and the horrific activities that took place at a chicken ranch on the outskirts of Riverside County. If anybody in the LAPD and Wineville besides the victims were trying to come out looking positive, they failed miserably. Christine Collins received a new voice to tell her story.",

In this movie, we see a transition from a drama, to a mystery, to a thriller, to a crime, to a courtroom drama, to a history. The story is so brilliant and so brilliantly told. How this movie did not receive a Best Picture or even a Best Screenplay nomination shocks me. Not only well written, but the movie is so passionately directed and acted. You can feel and see the passion in Angelina Jolie's character Christine Collins. In fact, all of the cast, from John Malkovich as the determined preacher, to Jason Butler Harner as the disturbed child murderer, to Devon Conti as the faux son. The determination and dedication by the cast to their respective characters gives serious contributions to the movie.

            "content": "\"Changeling\" didn't blow me away like it promised to, instead it gave me an above-satisfactory true life drama which delivered some pleasant cinematography, capable directing and so-so writing.Why was the writing so-so? Well, I honestly believe that \"Changeling\" focused too much on giving the audience an historical account rather than an emotional one. We were given a depiction of a woman's life, loves son, loses son, gets a son that isn't hers, protests about it, goes in mental hospital, goes out. With a sub serial killer story that was an added bonus. Instead I think that \"Changeling\" would've benefited from focusing on the relationship with her son which we didn't get that much of. It's very early on in the film where her son disappears so we don't get that emotional characterisation between Jolie and her son which would've added much more emotion to the story.Also, their should've been longer of Angelina coping with her loss so that the audience could feel a little more excited when the police assure that they've found her son. Added to this the screenplay would've been stronger if we could see this rock relationship between Angelina and her fake son instead of giving us some historical factual account. Sure you can have her life in the mental hospital and the killer sub-plot but these shouldn't take over the main theme of the film which is love, loss and corruption.However, what the film did do well was to give some gripping emotional-driven scenes. \"Changeling\" was engaging but far from perfection. Agelina Jolie's performance was extremely over-rated, I couldn't take her seriously with her massive trout-like lips she must've used at least two lip sticks for one lip! Either that or she used one the size of a barrel. Her silly pudding hat was annoying as well, but as for her performance it was hammy. I lost count the amount of times she said \"my son\" (which is why I've used that line many times in this review ;).In the end \"Changeling\" isn't a bad film, in fact it's a very good film but it could've been improved upon, say if Lars Von Trier directed and Helena Bonham Carter replaced Angelina Jolie and Darren Aronofsky wrote it but hey. You can't have everything.",

One Saturday morning Christine says goodbye to her son and leaves for work. When she returns hours later she finds no sign of her son and the food she left for him remains untouched. She calls the police who inform her that she must wait 24 hours before filing a missing child report. A day later she does so but over the next few months despite her search she receives no new on her son. Then out of the blue a boy comes forward claiming to be her son. The police reunite them but she is devastated when she's sees the boy and realizes it isn't her son. She keeps telling the corrupt policemen that it isn't her son but they just keep trying to convince her it is Walter. When she finally goes to the press to tell her story the police have her placed in a psychiatric home, claiming that her unwillingness to accept this new child as her son means she is paranoid. Fortunately a local reverend continues working outside to have her freed. Then when a young boy comes forward admitting that he and his cousin killed about 20 young boys, including Walter Christine is released but since the remains couldn't be identified she continues the search for her son, who is being presumed dead by police. She also balances two court cases. One is the case against the man charged with killing the group of boys and the other is the case investigated how Christine was treated by the police while searching for Walter. After the cases she seems to have moved on from this part of her life but it becomes clear that she will never stop the search for her son, despite all the evidence to suggest that he is already dead. This is a stunning and unmissable film following one of the most interesting true stories I have ever heard. Possibly one of the best films of the year. Clint Eastwood continues to show he is just as good behind the camera as he is in front of it. He has been behind some amazing films in the past few years including Mystic River, Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby but this film will probably be the one which people will watch to remember how brilliant his directorial career was. He perfectly captures 1920's America and every change and emotion that the character experiences. He captured Christine Collins' change from loving and devoted to desperate, determined and defiant and it really is a beautifully directed film. Angelina Jolie gives one of her careers best performances and I would be very surprised if she doesn't win an Oscar for her display here as it is one of the best I have seen this year. She gives a truly phenomenal performance as Christine Collins and it is her best performance since Girl, Interrupted. She stole the show completely and few of the supporting cast managed to make an impact whilst sharing screen time with her. John Malcovich has never been my favorite actor but I thought he was fantastic in this. I have never actually seen him give a performance I liked until Burn After Reading so I guess in the past few months he has been better, in my opinion at least. I also liked Michael Kelly in this film. He wasn't exactly amazing but I really liked his character and I thought he showed a lot more emotion and determination than the rest of the police force. That was kind of the point but I liked him more for it. Jason Butler Harner was the last cast member who I liked. He gave an outstanding performance as murderous psychopath Gordon Northcott. It's never easy to play the bad guy, especially this kind. His character has to be chillingly terrifying and hated but at the same time must have a sense of innocence must gain the sympathy of the audience. This is a very tough thing to accomplish but he pulled it off brilliantly and It think his performance is unfairly overshadowed by Jolie's. So all in all this is a very impressive film. Is one of my favorite films of the year. It can drag out a little bit at times but it makes up for it when it gets moving again. It is a dark, tragic, haunting and gripping story which has been brilliantly adapted by Clint Eastwood, who has manged to make it just like the story (dark, tragic etc.). The director and the display of the whole cast make this one of the most powerful and moving films of the year and an absolute must-see.",

            "content": "Well Clint Eastwood has certainly created a masterpiece this time.I'll mention straightaway that it's not particularly my genre, being more of a Drama movie, so I'll be reviewing more indifferently here. Nevertheless, this movie turns out as a pure classic, to be remembered for years to come! **Synopsis** Inspired by actual events that occurred in 1920s-era Los Angeles, Clint Eastwood's \"Changeling\" tells the story of a woman driven to confront a corrupted LAPD after her abducted son is retrieved and she begins to suspect that the boy returned to her is not the same boy she gave birth to. The year was 1928, and the setting a working-class suburb of Los Angeles. As Christine (Angelina Jolie) said goodbye to her son, Walter, and departed for work, she never anticipated that this was the day her life would be forever changed.Upon returning home, Christine was distressed to discover that Walter was nowhere to be found. Over the course of the following months, the desperate mother would launch a search that would ultimately prove fruitless. Yet just when it seemed that all hope was lost, a nine-year-old boy claiming to be Christine's son seemed to appear out of thin air. Overcome with emotions and uncertain how to face the authorities or the press, Christine invites the child to stay in her home despite knowing without a doubt that he is not her son. As much as Christine would like to accept the fact that her son has been returned to her, she cannot accept the injustice being pushed upon her and continues to challenge the Prohibition-era Los Angeles police force at every turn. As a result, Christine is slandered by the powers that be, and painted as an unfit mother. In this town, a woman who challenges the system is putting her life on the line, and as the situation grows desperate, the only person willing to aid her in her search is benevolent local activist Reverend Briegleb (John Malkovich).Source: IMDb Starring Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich, and Gattlin Griffith. Directed by Clint Eastwood.**Storyline: 4 Stars** The story of the movie is both intense and gripping... the movie was 2.5 hours long, it never got tedious, in fact I didn't feel like it had taken more than about 2 hours... and, unlike The Dark Knight, this movie felt like it had a nice rounded ending... Quite satisfying through and through! **Music: 5 Stars** In my opinion, this music score is the only worthy contender with Danny Elfman's Hellboy 2 score for the upcoming Oscars. A wonderful score, not overly done, carrying the tone of the movie beautifully! Now that I look at it, I find that on the IMDb page that the music composer is actually Clint Eastwood himself... Never knew a director could make such great music! **Acting: 3 Stars** Angelina Jolie makes a wonderful performance in the leading role in this movie, and really connects with her character! The other members of the cast aren't excellent, but don't let the side down on no account...**Conclusion** I suppose you already know what I'm about to say... It's an excellent movie! Watch it!",

            "review_title": "No masterpiece, but good enough",
            "content": "Changeling is Clint Eastwood's 31st film, one of five he has released in the last four years. Although with Gran Torino the now-elderly star has announced his probable retirement from acting, in other ways he shows little other sign of slowing down, being now in the middle of 'The Human Factor', due out next year. At the tail end of an illustrious career, Eastwood's stock as a director has remained high throughout, his concerns consistent. He learnt his trade at the side of such American professionals as Don Siegel but arguably has superseded his mentor, and others, as the years have passed.Based on true events, Changeling continues the feminist strand in some of Eastwood's work, where the casual, callous treatment of women, taken either as the main or side event, forms part of the narrative. The film is sturdy, reliable, involving and includes an outstanding performance by Angelina Jolie as the mother who won't give up. If there's an unspoken 'but' in that last sentence, ironically it's because the film is so thoroughly excellent all round, but no more. The art department is painstaking in its recreation of period detail, the narrative deft in projecting its chief protagonist through various trials and tribulations (including traumatic incarceration in a mental ward for her obstinacy); John Malkovich plays well as the crusading Reverend Briegleb, who takes Collins' cause to the wider public, and so on. Even the film's less satisfactory elements, being those for the most part surrounding Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) the child abductor - whose representation as an unbalanced individual is a little too exaggerated, and the associated gallows scene has been questioned by some critics - do not really detract from the overall achievement. But a thoroughly good, decent movie is not necessarily a great one, and ultimately it lacks an edge at its centre.Changeling locates the dark heart of its city in the corrupt administration of justice, doled out by well-played cops and officials who might, never the less, have strolled in from any other good movie. The immorality reaches out of city hall to pervade and ruin the lives of those who cross it. Polanski's Chinatown dealt with corruption, albeit at a slightly later date, festering at the heart of personal and civic society, also in historic L.A. But there the malign influence spread outwards from the individual and family towards the environment. It's a reverse process which started that masterpiece off with a cynical, dark heart denied to the less scabrous family drama sitting at the core of Changeling: that of Collins' separation and continual love for her missing son.Christine Collins seeks justice. The sort of justice that will do is never in doubt, right down the verdict of the final trial, scripted with the help of existing records. To take one more observation from the earlier film, in Chinatown the justice required is often fateful and unclear, making the reaching for it seem far more dangerous and, perhaps, more memorable. Missing persons, unsolved mysteries and corrupt officials are usually the province of the private investigator. Christine Collins' reluctant assumption of the role of heroine, aided by her reverend friend and supporter, is something the story made essential - even if a story played out through the persona of a distraught mother could easily become melodrama.It's to Eastwood's credit that it does not. Despite Collins' lurid treatment in the mental home, electric shock treatment and all, the director's restrained treatment of the subject matter, as well as the inherent dignity of Jolie's character, all buoy the film up, whilst Malkovich's dignified contribution to proceedings adds a further touch of class. Eastwood's empathy with actors is such that Jolie, in the DVD interview accompanying the movie, claims at one point that she only wants to work with Eastwood from now on - a flattering exaggeration, but doubtless reflecting the high regard he gets from colleagues. The director's calm, proficient touch is everywhere until, it must be said, even the matter of serial child torture seems de-sensationalised, the unpalatable made practically palatable. Perhaps this is one reason why the execution scene and asylum shock therapy is emphasised as it is, in order to restore something of the necessary horror and revulsion back to the narrative.Critical niggling aside, none of this is to say that Changeling isn't a success on its own terms, deserving of high marks. Excellence brings it own rewards; here's a movie which never drags, provides consistent, entertaining drama showing old-style film making at its best.",

WHAT is with that long drawn out execution scene? My friend and I had to keep our hands over our eyes for about 10 minutes. But this movie loves violence. Note the fact that it is shown how the killer kept and killed the little boys but completely left out the real-life molestation of them. I mean, that would make the story (and it was) even MORE unpleasant but it's weird how the filmmakers decided to eliminate the \"sex\" (such as it was) but leave in the horrid, horrid violence.

            "review_title": "An emotional and unsettling picture of the American justice system in the '20s",
            "content": "\"Changeling\" reminds me a lot of 1997 thriller \"L.A Confidential\" in that it deals with police corruption and P.Ds' frightening level of power. The problem with that is \"Changeling\" takes place about 25 years earlier -- same police department, same problems, different era. It's unfortunate how incompetent our criminal justice system was and in many ways still is and that's what makes \"Changeling\" such a difficult film to stomach. It invokes rage, sadness, disgust and sympathy -- and when you've had enough it keeps going. But it's a beautifully realized period piece and a quality film from all aspects.Although \"Changeling\" earned Oscar nominations in deserved categories such as cinematography and art direction, it's hard to understand why there wasn't any love for J. Michael Straczynski's thoroughly reported original screenplay. This is one of those stories that's so unbelievable and so unsettling that you can't make it up and despite its length, Straczynski tells it in a compelling and emotional way.\"Changeling\" is about Christine Collins (Jolie), an L.A. single mother whose son Walter disappears for several months. When the police find him, she insists right away that he's not her son and the police department insists that she's wrong. When the case builds in publicity, she's shipped off to a psychiatric hospital, but a politically passionate reverend (John Malkovich) as well as a young boy's story might uncover the truth.There are so many painful and uncomfortable elements to this story that you wish it weren't true. You almost want to be spared the emotional agony of all the lying, corruption, torture and death. It's by no means a horror movie, of course, but each subject matter is heavy. Part of the film, for example, deals with the case of a serial murderer who has killed children. That's weighty stuff, and while it stirs up our emotions and makes the film more powerful, it doesn't change that it's tough to bear.Director Clint Eastwood and star Angelina Jolie are an excellent match in this film. They try and plant us deep down within Christine Collins without overplaying the clich\u00e9s of a woman who cries wolf but the powers that be declare her insane. Knowing Collins is a self- sustaining single mother, Jolie plays her with much more inner resilience. Eastwood includes her face at nearly every juncture of the main story's aftermath and you get the perfect sense of how she's feeling. That's critical because despite all the corruption and intrigue of the story, this is still her life and livelihood here. No one has more at stake than she does.This troubling true story is top-notch film-making, an exquisite stone lost beneath a pile of rare and more exotic cinematic gems that comprised the great year for film that was 2008. The costumes and period detail is vivid and Eastwood's cinematographer Tom Stern does some of his finest work wrapping characters in the shadows of this harrowing film.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com",

Publicly proclaiming the child not to be hers, she gets caught up in an intense melee with the less than ideal police who are willing to go to extreme measures to silence her. A riveting real-life story that encompasses corruption, abuse of power, mental coercion, criminal culpability, but most of all hope. A rare instance where one almost yearns for a conventional finale, however the biographical source material leaves a few of the subplots open-ended, and although some obvious anachronisms are thrown in for enjoyment of the viewer, it's still a praiseworthy showing--directed, produced, and scored by Clint Eastwood. ***",

The sets were almost laughable, as apparently everyone in 1928 drove perfectly immaculate, polished cars that look like they were driven directly to the set from a 2008 antique auto show. The clothing and interiors were the same - perfect, clean, polished, immaculate. Better throw in surreal and fake.

The thing is, the police department is corrupt and needs a story to cover their deficiencies. If it would turn out that the boy isn't Christine's son, it would be very embarrassing. Christine continues to fight the police to continue their search, and the police throws her in a psychiatric ward to protect themselves. Fortunately Christine has allies, a reverend that has criticized the police, and rescues her. And eventually the police get a lead that may give them the truth.Comments: Based on a real story, it is hard to imagine how it would be to really experience a nightmare like that. As a movie it is interesting and quite suspenseful, especially if you don't know the real case by heart. It is well acted and directed, with a cast spearheaded by Angelina Jolie, a role she was nominated for an Oscar for. It is a little typical role, in a typical movie that plays well at the Oscars, but her performance is very good. She also got a good support from mostly Jeffrey Donovan as her characters opponent.It is rather slow in its pace, and seems to be pretty true to actual events, anyway it is very plausible. But it keeps an edge throughout the movie that keeps interest, it is hard to look away from. There is always something small, but maybe important, happening. And it is a very captivating story.Credit is due to Straczynski, the writer who has turned this real story to a good movie, supposedly from actual records from police and trial. Credit is also due to Clint Eastwood whom with his directing has converted the screenplay into a very good movie.But to be a top movie for me, it is in the wrong genre. It is not lacking much as a drama, but as a superior movie I need elements from other genres as well.7/10",

            "content": "The first thing to mention here about this movie is that it is a true story. If it wasn't - you'd find it very hard to swallow. First things first - the title? Changeling? I must confess I had never heard that word before and did not know what it meant. I looked it up and found this \"(in folklore) an ugly, stupid, or strange child left by fairies in place of a pretty, charming child.\" Good description. A single mother - Jolie - goes to work leaving her 9 year old son at home alone. She returns to an empty house. A few months later the police tell her that they have found her son - but when she sees this \"found\" boy - it is not her kid. The cops however coerce her to \"try out the boy for a few weeks\". She does so but Jolie's character maintains her stance and continues to rail against the LAPD protesting that her boy is still out there somewhere.It is set in the 1920's and 30's America where Jolie has a telephone exchange job and lives quite well in a nice house, nice neighbourhood alone with only her son as company. The sets are great, the attention to detail spot on - nothing to complain about here. The acting too is impressive. Do I like Jolie? Not really....I cannot see what the fuss is about her on the looks front (she doesn't do it for me I'm afraid) and some of her films leave a little to be desired also. But I won't knock her for this performance - she was solid and played her character well - as a decent human being but also a strong representation of a single woman in an age where equality had not yet surfaced. Her whole celebrity persona turns me off her a little (well a lot actually) but I tried to put that to one side when watching this movie and give her a fair shot at impressing me. She did. They are the good things about the movie....are there any bad things? Of course....Eastwood directed it so there is going to be a couple of glaringly obvious things in there somewhere. The first - and most obvious - comes when Jolie arrives home to find her son gone. Before leaving to do some unscheduled work at the office, Jolie tells her boy that she will be back at 4PM and that a neighbour and her daughter will come over to spend a couple hours with him. But when she gets back home, the kid is gone, and she first looks through the house, then asks some kids on the street if they've seen him, and finally phones the police. They ask her when he disappeared, and she replies \"I don't know. It could have been this morning, or only an hour ago\". Why did she not get in touch with the woman who was supposed to come over for a couple of hours? Shouldn't that have been the FIRST person she would have contacted? The woman could have given her (and the police) an idea of WHEN the kid disappeared. She should also have contacted the woman to see if maybe he was at her house. Unfortunately, the woman seems to have just been entirely forgotten by the script... This is a glaring and sloppy error in the film's logic. How could they let that slip by? A simple scene showing her talking to this woman would suffice - or a scene to inform the audience that no such woman existed - maybe she just told her boy this story to get him to remain indoors and give him a sense of security. One or the other should have happened - but none did.Another biggie for me was the motivation behind the \"impostor\" boy. The reason why a small boy would pretend to be a missing child (to move to LA to meet a Hollywood actor) is preposterous and dealt with so matter-of-factly - it was disgraceful. How he got the idea and who encouraged him are inadequately provided. Also, how a 9 year old kid could fool the entire LAPD, doctors, medical people etc. into being someone he is not - is amazingly portrayed. We get some back story implying the LAPD are a corrupt lot with a platoon of gun-toting death squads killing off any competition on the streets to their ill-gotten schemes. But yet these hardened guys could not break a 9 year old boy into telling the truth? Unbelievable. Not only that but the Juvenile police officer had a PHOTOGRAPH of the missing boy - that clearly does not look REMOTELY like this impostor - but yet they never mentioned that in the story. Further on in the movie - a 15 year kid implicated in the disappearance and murder of the boy recognizes the missing kid from the photo straight off - without hesitation, even though he was in a distressed state. I suppose because this is a true story - a lot of these issues are brushed aside - but for me the film did not try to even explain the basic problems here. The whole premise of the story hinges on the boy's disappearance and the subsequent \"finding\" - but both of these events are littered with problems. If your basic core of the movie is in trouble - no amount of good acting, fancy sets etc. around the edges will save it.This is not a bad film - far from it - but it is not the classic people whittle on about either. For me it was a little slow too and coming in at a bum numbing 140 minutes doesn't help its case one iota. Eastwood is a good lad, a solid lad - but needs to speed things up a little at times - and a lot at other times.6/10.",

The guy new his parents were killed by local police, he tried to get to them with help of federal security service (former name K G B). He thought they can be trusted, but they threw him to the Psychiatric clinic... But unlike this story he never came back from there.Besides that, in USSR in the times of Andropov's ruling, they have built such clinics all over the country. So called medical stars have invented the 'Slowflowing schizophrenia'. And used that term in order to close up those who weren't needed to them. It was easier than putting them to prison, because for incarceration you still need a fact of crime. For detention and maintenance in a psychiatric clinic, you just needed a verdict of doctor.",

Even the repeating of the same lament doesn't detract, because after all, what mother would NOT become a broken record about her missing child, even if the powers that be were not treating her like she and her lost child were unimportant. This is based on a horrendous true story about the vile transplanted Canadian serial killer, Gordon Stewart Northcott, who moved to LA and environs and used the farm his mother bought him to carry out his atrocities in secrecy, jailing his victims in the chick coop. When our heroine mom gets word that the police have found her son she is overjoyed. That is until she greets her returning boy only to find that he isn't even her son.

            "content": "Let's see if I got this down correctly, it's Los Angeles in 1928, a young boy raised in a single working mother household disappears while he's left at home unattended. Months later, the police desperate to keep their decaying reputation intact because their so corrupt, lazily claims that they found her child. When she confronts them and tells them that's not her child, the lazy asses say she's making thing up. When she refuses to dismiss the case, the cops end up locking her away in an asylum. While this is happening, some graphic details involving another child abduction case catches their attention feeling that the misfired details to the story is more macabre than the one's been uncovered. Why would anyone want to see this exhibition of manipulative cheapness? All it delivers here is just showcasing children's lives being threatened. In a nutshell, all that this movie stems down to is fear-mongering and the audience is just simply biting into it. From what I gathered this story was based on actual events and yes I admit it's sad that these cases do happen. However, at the same time, the movie is so one-sided it's preposterous. Aside from that the events following the case lack in anything uplifting, energetic or eye-opening or any other terminology words that the Oscar hacks like to utilize. This movie fails miserably that can't be repaired. Angelina Jolie stars as single-mother Christine Collins. She works as a telephone operator and is one of the best workers on the staff. When she gets called into work one fine Saturday she leaves her son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) at home by himself. When she returns home, the boy has vanished. Five months has passed, she gets the news that the cops have found a boy located in Illinois that suitably matches Walter's description. When she arrives that the station, she is surrounded by reporters and police who are just trying to conceal their corrupt reputation as they reveal the boy to her. When she sees the boy, she confirms that this child is not Walter. But the cops knowing they goofed still want Christine to take the child anyways. She then tries to take the case even further with the chief of police Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) that even though the proof that the boy they found was not Walter, he declares that Christine has serious mental disorders. And when she refuses to dismiss the case, the LAPD have her institutionalized to an asylum. While there she's befriended by fellow inmate named Carol Dexter (Amy Ryan) who instructs her on getting by in the loony bin. Meanwhile on her side, a local Reverend Gustav Brieglab (John Malkovich) who opposes corruption stands up to defends Christine's case while the token good cop Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) makes a grisly discovery involving a tip about a missing child who was abducted by crooked Canadian criminal. This movie clearly is every mother's worst nightmare. When we go to the cinemas, we want to be entertained and thrilled and to chase our troubles and insecurities away. So why do we need to watch a movie where real events like this one could happen to anyone at any time? What makes matters worse is that it is so surreal to actually think the cops even back then would be so corrupt and uncaring it makes this true story feel as though the production never once took this subject matter very seriously. It just never felt convincing. Sure director Clint Eastwood's intentions were good and Jolie did quite well in her respected role and had the emotions accurate in how any mother would react when faced in this dire situation. But the film quite insufferable and very painful to watch. When the final credits roll, there was no justice that truly prevailed. No feel-good moments were delivered here and it took a ton of excruciating frustrations for common sense to get through. And then some important details that could've been utilized to good effect were thrown out the window. Like why didn't they question the neighbours who were checking up upon Walter? That could've been a potential lead, but it was neglected because common sense was nowhere to be found. After all is said and done, \"Changeling\" is two hours and twenty minutes of torturous manipulation that took a serious story and made very little progression to make this story enthralling.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most versatile and respected filmmakers today. He started off his career as an actor in the 1950's and became a director in the 1970's, and moved on with both careers, until his retirement as an actor in 2008 with 'Gran Torino', but his directing career is moving on at a fast-paced rhythm. And the also 2008's 'Changeling' proves thar he, at almost 70 years old, still got it.'Changeling' is set in the Los Angeles of the late-20's. It tells the story of Christine Collins, a hard-working woman that finds out her son, Walter Collins, was missing in one afternoon. After searching for him during months, the police gives back Walter to her, but she doesn't fells that's her son. This is an actual story that really took place in that period, therefore the screenplay is accurately based on what really happened. The script is extremely well-written, taking the actual events and transforming then a little bit for dramatic purposes, based on actual statements, newspapers, etc. Even though this is a very powerful story and it was well-told, the script can be a little annoying at some parts, with the too-often repetition of Christine saying 'my son'.The acting here is nice. Most of the supporting cast delivers a nice job, the movie was well-cast, John Malkovich is great as the Reverend that helps Christine and no one else other than him stands out. The problem with the acting I have here are the child actors. Of course you can't expect much of children, but most of them don't act their ways out. The only child actor that delivers a good performance is Gattlin Griffith, as Christine Collin's son. The main part here went to Angelina Jolie. I've never saw a movie with her other than the 'Tomb Raider' series, so it's nice to see that she can act. She gives a strong performance as Christine Collins, and it was even Oscar-nominated for it. I really can't think of any other actress to portray the lead role so well as Jolie did.As always, Clint Eastwood directs this movie brilliantly. His talent as a director is absolutely undeniable, and he proves it once again. I think any script would work on Eastwood's hands. As of the other aspects, the soundtrack here is so-so, it serves for dramatic purposes but it isn't memorial at all. The cinematography is well-made, with some beautiful shots, but the art-direction and set-decoration transform this movie into a great representation of the 1920's.Overral, this is a very strong emotional drama. The true story is very interesting and used in a very nice way by the script. The cast is all nice, with a exception for the children actors. Jolie delivers an excellent performance in the leading role. As always, Clint Eastwood makes a very competent job directing. The soundtrack and cinematography are both nice, and the movie is a nice representation of the 1920's Los Angeles.8/10",

            "content": "\"Changeling\", one of Clint Eastwood's two directorial efforts from 2008, concerns a single mother whose son goes missing and is supposedly returned by the LAPD. However, she immediately realizes that the boy returned to her is not her son but is instead another boy apparently coaxed into co-operating with the police. Despite fierce resistance from the authorities she stubbornly sets out to uncover the truth about her son's disappearance.For those unfamiliar with the term 'changeling', it is a term from European folklore referring to a being left behind in the place of a stolen human child. The reference is metaphorical here since the story is based on actual events that transpired around the time of the Great Depression. I don't know how close the film sticks to the facts but the plot does manage to mostly steer clear of contrivances.Angelina Jolie is the undisputed star of the film and hers is a role made for Oscar consideration. She received a nomination for her performance though it is perhaps just a little too showy for my tastes. In my mind, the film's key performances come from relative unknowns like Jeffrey Donovan, Michael Kelly & Jason Butler Harner. Also of note is the always dependable John Malkovich in the film's main supporting role.The film's look is quite attractive and the Oscar nominations for cinematography & art direction should have resulted in wins in my opinion. Eastwood's direction is also impressive and, what's even more impressive, he also composed the score (which is reminiscent of Jerry Goldsmith's score for \"Chinatown\").Being a film about a mother searching for her lost son, \"Changeling\" could easily have been stifled by melodrama but instead it makes its mark as a compelling mystery. It's currently in the IMDb top 250, which attests to its general appeal but I would hesitate to rank it quite so highly.",

            "content": "As any trip to a cinema does, it started in the most mundane and British way \u0096 queuing, queuing for tickets, queuing for food and queuing for the bathroom, not the best start to an evening but one that is part of the cinematic experience none the less. So after over 15 minutes queuing, we are ready, we have tickets, we have exceedingly large paper cups of Pepsi max and between us all a combination of sweet and salty popcorn, chocolate raisins and my personal favourite, jelly babies. But still we are nowhere near the beginning of our film, first we have to sit in darkened room while bombarded with advertisements. We turn this into a game, a jelly baby for the first person to correctly guess what the advert was advertising, which then turned into a heated debate on how to eat jelly babies, head first or feet first. Then after what seemed like hours (although I am assured by friends it could have been no longer than 20minutes) it gets more interesting. The trailers begin, of course letting loose frantic (and unfortunately very loud) whispering between my friends and I, deciding which of these films look good, bad, terrible and ones that we will most definitely be going to see. Then after several rather rude hushing noises from the elderly pair sitting in the behind us and amused sniggering from the people in front as we got more and more irate in our opinions on films we hadn't even seen, the room got darker, the screen widen and finally nearly an hour after arriving at the cinema our film was about to begin. Clint Eastwood's newest project the Changeling is the true story of Christine Collins, a 1928 single mother living in Los Angeles, who goes to work one day to return to find her son missing. This film tells her battle with the Los Angeles Police Department as they, unwilling to admit a mistake after returning the wrong boy to her, get her institutionalized at the local mental hospital. The film opens with a stylised black and white view of Los Angeles setting the scene of being in 1928, and the rest of the film, although in colour, has an unsaturated colour choice that gives an immediate feeling of doom and sadness for the picture as well as creating a feeling of an older film. This film is not one of Eastwood's best achievements as at times the dialog feels forced. For example, when Jolie adds a \"Sport\" moniker or makes references to Cleopatra. As if Eastwood is saying to the audience \"Yes, this really is 1928.\" The tone of this story also seems to just go over the border from homage to 1930's dramatic cinematic style to over-the-top melodrama, particularly in scenes featuring Captain J.J.Jones, the \"bad cop\" of the plot who Eastwood pushes just a little too far in the stereotypical role. Angelina Jolie's portrayal of Christine Collins was the highlight of the film, bringing tears to the eyes of not only me but every member of the cinema audience. She gives a very believable performance of a mother who has lost her child. We can read the pain in her eyes, the determination and the disturbing reality that her obsession might be having unexpected results, but one thing is clear, there is a drive that won't quit, and it's admirable for those of us who want her to be reunited with her child. For a portion of the film Jolie returns to a theme that she has visited in many of her movies, filling a personality that she seems to slip effortlessly now, as she enters a mental asylum. If Jolie has a forte, insanity is it. Overall the film was powerful and inspiring. It was a tale of high drama, anguish and devotion, with scenes involving Jason Butler Harner who gives a distinctive performance as the wigged-out killer, Gordon Northcott, who sends a shiver down the spine of the audience. However the scene of his hanging was rather drawn out and graphic compared with even the murder scenes that had appeared earlier in the film and this sudden focus of his killing rather affects the feeling of justice being made, instead creating a sympathy with this killer. Walking down the sticky aisle of the cinema after this film the consensus from my friends and I: I film well worth seeing, especially if you enjoy a good cry. It leaves a lasting impression on the audience, and by the end of the film you have all but forgotten about the queuing and adverts that you had to survive beforehand.",

            "content": "Clint Eastwood once again has delivered another powerful drama in this movie about a missing child and the lengths a mother will go to to find her child even if it means taking a whole corrupt police force that has no qualms for unauthorized executions or sending women to mental institutions simply because they can.Eastwood has proved again that he is a master director in the likes of Scorsese and Ron Howard. His attention to details, the accurate presentation of the the 1920s, his skill in getting the best performances from the actors were excellent. Another strong point in his favour was that he resisted the temptation to turn this into a global conspiracy thriller. There was suspense of course, villains, unlikely heroes, allies as well as enemies but all this blended perfectly with the plot.The story concerns a missing child. As the mother, Christine Collins is going out of her mind with worry about her son's disappearance, she receives a visit from the police that her son has been found and this is when the real problem starts.The woman claims that the boy they found is not her son and the police Captain J.J. James(chillingly played to a hilt by Jefferey Donovan)insists that they found the right boy. I'm sure the question the audience will be asking themselves is, is there a deliberate conspiracy by the police or just a case of mistaken identity or is the woman deranged? Angelina Jolie initially would have not been my first choice for such a sensitive role but I have to admit that her performance was flawless. This woman can act. Her pain, fears, frustrations, strenght was there for the audience to see. I have read other critics that she was crying too much. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? The woman is looking for her child. Do you expect her to play cards and smile all the time. Jolie gave a realistic portrayal of a woman looking for her child. She certainly deserved an Oscar for this.John Malkovitch also gave a good, if not first class performance, as the reverend who offers to help the grief stricken mother.But special mention must be made of James Butler Harner who plays the the psychotic Gordon Northcott. That guy really gave me the spooks.Michael Kelly as the unlikely hero also gave a well delivered performance.But the real stars are the real characters that this movies is based on. The mother, the reverend, the missing boy who risked (and possibly sacrificed) his life to save another, the detective who blew open the case, and the lawyer who represented the mother pro bono. These guys were heroes. I wish there can be more of them. The world will definitely be a better place.",

            "content": "This movie surprised me somewhat. Positively! The movie is set out in America the 1920's. Here we meet Angelina Jolie who plays a single mum, coping with life both as a parent and a successful worker. Destiny wants it, that she looses her son one day - he has disappeared. Now we follow the struggle for the mum to find him again. This turns out to be very difficult indeed. In this movie there are different side-stories. It deals with six different themes. 1) The struggle with the corrupt LAPD in finding her son. 2) The inhumane treatment of women in the psychiatric wards in those days. 3) The story of a serial-killer, and the way he abuses his victims. 4) The story of the people wanting to help the single mum in her struggle with the injustice. 5) The situation at her work, that is presented very low-key and subtle, thus giving the audience an impression of genuine and honest storytelling. 6) Last but not least coping with the loss of a child. All these side-stories are masterly pasted into this movie with elegance and intelligence. Eastwood is really a master in connecting the story so it seems, and is, very reflective in terms of abstraction layers. We also saw that in his fantastic and epic war duology - 'Flags of our Fathers' and 'Letters from Iwo Jima'. This movie, however, is not to compare with these other two movies though.I can just say that you should watch this movie!",

Growing up in L.A. I had never heard of what happened in this sad but true story of the disappearance of one young boy and his mother's (Jolie) plight to find out the truth. Angelina Jolie who I have never thought much of as an actress has proved herself worthy of acclaim in this role. This is more than just a adaptation of historical events, this is a picture into police corruption and cover ups in a time when the checks and balances system hadn't yet permeated the Los Angeles police dept. I spent two days after watching this movie researching the actual events and found it to be a very accurate depiction of actual events.

            "content": "Many of us think we know LA in 1927-30, as we've seen it as background to the films of Laurel and Hardy, from 1929 also with sound. They carry pianos up steps and drive the streets of new houses going up and palm trees still quite young in many places. They also visit various plush-looking mansions, even though they are often just one step up from being bums. They are frequently hassled and misunderstood, even though they are typically gentlemanly in much of their conduct.God seems unable to stop all evil in this world, but He can be very creative and of course loving in offering other paths, and it is worth asking if he brought (British) Laurel and (Georgia-hailing) Hardy together in all their funny innocence in order to ensure that Angelinos might find some childlike joy and beauty in their wonderful films ... as some antidote to the evil present all around them.Maybe that sounds far-fetched, but 1927 LA brought the horrible and shocking murder of 12-year-old Marion Parker - by a man claiming \"providence\" told him to do the deed. Just a year after that a peak of evil would be reached with the (revealing of) the so-called \"Wineville Chicken Coop Murders\" that occupies about half of Angelina (!!!) Jolie's film \"Changeling\". She stars in the film as the mother of a kidnapped boy...The key person involved in that crime, and the grisly and appalling murders that followed in Wineville (though NOT the only adult wrongdoer in the case, as this movie suggests he might be) was tried in 1929 and hanged in 1930. The trial thus coincided more or less with L&H's first talkie \"Unaccustomed as we are\" in which Edgar Kennedy stars as a cop called Kennedy; while 1930 brought - believe it or not - \"The Laurel and Hardy Murder Case\"!In general \"Babe and Stan\" in their films regularly fall foul of LA authority figures, as well they might given the second strand to \"Changeling\" - the cynicism and corruption manifested by the LAPD, acting in support of the then city Mayor but also doing their own thing, and riding roughshod over rights and right (and truth) in the process.If that meant gaslighting, and even declaring people (especially women) insane or mentally incapacitated as a convenient way of getting rid of them and their inconvenient truths, so be it. Probably (??) better that than just murdering people straight out, which the Gun Squad from Police Chief (and later American Nazi) James Edgar (\"2-Gun\") Davis may well have done... We know this sort of things from \"Gangs of New York\", but that was the 1850s-60s, not the late 1920s!A fairly key religious belief (which I had always tended to reject, I must say) is that small sins help contribute to, and most likely become, big sins. This movie - which is hard to take in many places - shows us JUST how that works, as person after person shown here is willing to do small evil things when told to, because the hierarchy expects that; willing to lie and to prop up a whole edifice built on lies.In the midst of all that, there is one cop of sufficient courage and integrity to listen seriously when a kid speaks sincerely from a on overwhelmingly sad heart. The film's contrast between this one strand of goodness in the middle of all the evil is understated, but comes over just fine. And it only takes one good, kind, understanding man to bring the whole evil crashing down.Having made the film, Director in the shape of the legendary Clint Eastwood summed things up with his conclusion that LA never had a golden age. This is clearly 99% true, with the one exception that that era did produce the endlessly simple pleasures of Laurel and Hardy. Personally, I think that was a specially-intended divine gift, and one that was surely very much needed, as the film makes plain indeed.",

She looks a little anorexic in this one but it suits the character well, perhaps an indicator of the horrible stress she had to go through in her ordeal with missing a child, being forced to adopt another one, and repeatedly being told she is wrong about her misgivings about the new child.Malkovich is actually a minor character in this one and really doesn't have that much to do acting-wise. The serial killer on the other hand makes the most of his screen time and delivers a truly wicked and disturbing performance.Another excellent film directed by Clint Eastwood. His choice of camera angles, lighting, and especially the initial farmyard scenes were masterfully done.8/10",

            "content": "From ISawLightningFall.com - Stories, like people, have all sorts of different shapes. Some are short and lean, others long and muscular. Then there are a few -- pardon my political incorrectness here -- so flabby and shapeless that they ought to have a go on the Nautilus for a while. The Clint Eastwood-directed Changeling falls into the last category.Based on actual events from the late 1920's, the film centers on Christine Collins, a single mother from California whose son, Walter, mysteriously disappears from their home one day. After months of searching, the Los Angeles Police Department produces a boy to much fanfare -- only he isn't Walter. When Christine's pleas fall on deaf ears, her plight gets taken up one Gustav Briegleb, a fiery Presbyterian minister who has made it his goal in life to root out civil corruption.Some of Eastwood's dilemma comes from the complexities of history: The Walter Collins' case was far-reaching and multifaceted. Still, narratives require redaction, even the most factual, and here the film doesn't know its head from its tail, changing genre as often as a surgical nurse does gloves. What starts straightforwardly enough soon moves toward political-protest territory before shifting into a paranoid thriller and then becoming the most grisly kind of crime story. (I'll hold back on further revelations, but the inquisitive could look up the history of Mira Loma, California, if they want spoilers.) It ends -- mostly -- as a courtroom drama, but not before subjecting viewers to at least four pseudo-climaxes and then denying them a coherent resolution. This exercise in frustration reminds us that stories do best when assuming a single shape.",

However I was so irritated by the extremely positive reviews with nine or ten stars that I just had to give my five cents.I don't care that this film is supposed based on true facts, the story is so ridiculous that I couldn't watch it any longer. I can't believe that a mother whose child has been kidnapped would accept a strange child as hers, if she would have been more or less normal. If the press would be gathered there she would flatly tell them that it is not her child. Everybody in the neighbourhood, the teachers and the children would confirm it. So it would never work.I was not in the less impressed by Angelina Jolie's acting. On the one hand she tries to play a self-conscious single mother and career woman, but on the other hand she is helpless creature who lets them force a strange child on her. I wasn't moved in the slightest bit by it. Moreover it was very disturbing to watch Jolie with her painted botox lips. The whole time she reminds of a caricature of modern beauty craze and not of a woman of the 1920s.The only positive thing I liked were the streetviews with the oldtimers and the streetcars, that did remind of the past.

I wasn't sure what to expect - all I know it was about Angelina's character having a son returned to her which isn't actually hers. When I watched this, I was instantly glued to my TV screen from start to finish, absorbed into this time and this horrific tale of a mother's vow to get her son back.Angelina is fabulous as Christine Collins who is battling the Los Angeles police department and their corruption. She is claiming that they have brought her back the wrong boy when her son is missing, while the police department is trying to defend themselves.It is good to see Angelina take her acting to new levels. She has recently been in too many blockbuster movies such as Tomb Raider, Wanted etc in which she is reigned as the action queen of Hollywood. But in this movie, she shows that she is definitely one who can take on a role as serious as Christine Collins and her desperation to simply get her son back.This story shows the fragility that women feel in this period as they would most likely feel powerless against the men in the police department and how they are seen as insignificant in their own opinions. In a sense, this film is almost like political activism and brings about a change in society through this film. It is even more stunning to know it is based on real events which adds a sense of realism to this film.This is a heart wrenching and emotional story. I have read that a lot of people find this hard to watch, and I do see where they are coming from, as the film does go down some disturbing paths and scenes, but in the end you get a beautiful film with terrific performances. The relationships between the characters is very touching and you really root for Christine Collins in her fight to gain justice not only for herself, but also to other women in the story who have met with some nasty fates due to the police.It had me glued from start to finish and this is definitely one of those movies that sticks with you, simply because you can only imagine what it would have been like back in those days, and how one person's fight can change society.",

Cases involving slavery, civil rights , abortion, searches and seizures, stop and frisk and Sexual harassment on the job. The Changeling was probably the only movie that ignited my vexation. I was literally exasperated as the obvious was not obvious by the establishment Los Angeles Police Department. I getting ahead of myself here. Our story begins in 1928 Los Angeles. Single Mom Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) Comes home from her Job and discovers her son Walter is missing. Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) becomes the spokesman for her plight as our Man of the cloth rants on the injustices and incompetence of the Los Angeles Police dept. Moreover the Reverend spotlights the corruption (extrajudicial punishment) by the L.A. Gun Squad lead by Chief James E. Davis (Colm Fiore). An alleged crime carried out without legal process or supervision. Several months go by and the LAPD's Juvenile Division detective J.J. Jones (Jeffery Donovan) informs Christine that her boy is found. The problem here is the boy isn't Walter. Jones won't take no for an answer and pressures Christine to take the boy home for a trial run. It gets worse as Jones hires a rogue physician who intercedes tells Christine the boy shrunk and physically changed during his trauma. Christine and the reverend don't buy this ridiculous claim. The newspapers get involved with (Fake News) telling their reader that Christine is an unfit Mother. During the film I was intrigued with the boys determination to keep up the phony persona. Things go from bad to worse for our heroine as I was following the downward spiral of obvious corruption by the Men in Blue keeping up this sham, I was actually yelling, bawling at the screen . Thank goodness I wasn't in a movie theater because I would be asked to leave. The acting especially by the fraudulent Walter (Gattlin Griffith) was plausible. Discrepancies in dialogue for that time period were inaccurate. Terms not used in the 1920's i.e. \"Don't go there !\" , fridge, serial killer and Detective Jones says we have an APB (all points bulletin) this acronym wasn't used by law enforcement till the 1960's. Despite the continuity issues and there are many,.J. Michael Straczynski's script was inspired by the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders of the 1920's. The original milestone case of child abduction long before the popularization of demented scoundrels the likes of John Wayne Gacy and Jeffrey Dahmer. Apparent transparencies are thrown to the wind. The script accentuates profiling. Labeling woman as secondary child bearers who are relegated to the keeping house. Seen not heard so to speak in those days. Because your a single woman you should sit back and take the abuse. Fine direction by Clint Eastwood who by the way wrote the score for the movie. Oscar performance by Angelina Jolle. This film basically exposes the corruption of the LAPD. Other notable performances from Geoff Pierson as Collin's attorney who takes on the Police Board. Let's not leave out the source of this frustrating tale, the sinister child predator Gordon Northcott played by Jason Butler Harner who embodies the demented molester. When you get right down to the meat and potatoes of this landmark case, the motivated for the deception was by false Hollywood dreams. Films end will explain!",

One, Angelina Jolie rises above the hype to give a performance that should have won her the Oscar (I saw the Reader. It wasn't that great). Two, the look and sound of every scene is so crisp and polished that it's impossible to look away. Three, the mystery story with a dash of social justice that gives you hope for the human race.Changeling is about Christine Collins, (Jolie) a mother from Los Angeles whose son (Walter) goes missing one afternoon after a long day at work. When she discovers that he is missing she calls the police who won't send a unit over until 24 hours after the kid goes missing. The next day the cops show up but it seems to be too late. However, 5 months later the LAPD say they have found Walter but when she meets the boy at the train station, it's not her son. After weeks of giving the LAPD chances to admit their mistake, she goes public and with that the cops have her committed to a psychopathic ward filled with women who have caused trouble for the Police Department.What to say about a film of this calibre. The writing and directing are phenomenal. The lighting and the cinematography make every shot have a gloomy tone that fits perfectly with the story. It's obvious that Clint Eastwood put a lot of emotion into this film because not only do you feel for the characters when they are down but you have a great sense of pride in human nature when justice is served.One of the characters who will probably never be given enough credit is Rev. Gustav Briegleb (portrayed by John Malkovich). He is very reminiscent of X from JFK. His story of conspiracy and corruption within the LAPD gives you chills. Malkovich is only one of the supporting actors who is very deserving of credit. Jefferey Donovan as Captain Jones (the officer who claims that Collins is crazy) and Colm Feore (the police chief) also give stirring performances.The only problem with the film is that near then end they keep having scenes that could have been the ending, but then it continues. You only understand the reason for these multiple climaxes after the real ending comes. They show true growth in Jolie's character and although a bit confusing you see the amazing change from a woman who is content to let things go by into someone who stands up for justice and the rights of everyone who is oppressed by hierarchy.",

The acting of all the kids is AWFUL!, especially so the most crucial character of all, that has to do with the disclosure of the mystery. (There are lots of great kid-actors all over TV, how come they were not casted and hired?!) Jolie's performance is not good, though not dreadfully bad. All characters are poorly depicted and cartoonized, and in a simply unbearable fashion the doctor at the Psychiatric Hospital! (and that is, unfortunately, Eastwood's responsibility.) The film is well paced, well directed, well photographed, as should be expected from any good director such as Clint Eastwood is. However, somehow he does not convey the proper tension and terror in those moments that the script required such elements (I felt the same in \"Mystic River\"). I did pick the line that includes a word for a certain type of felony only coined decades later than the one portrayed by the film (the 30s), and it puzzled me as a flaw by the writer.I am a pro composer/arranger/producer/pianist from Paraguay (jazz-oriented), and knew right away from the first piano notes that that was Clint's musical statement. Very simple, somewhat corny, but effective melancholy-wise. Great composer-arranger Lenny Niehaus did not need to sweat too much throughout this movie. All in all:",

            "content": "Now, Clint, you really had me on board for much of this movie, but as it moved ever so slowly to its conclusion, the points started to peel away. The story is affecting, the settings and costumes great, and the suspense terrific. My main gripes are that progressively you become sensitive to the probabilities being stretched, bad behaviour being laid on with a trowel, and the audience being teased with false conclusions. I have to say that while we have plenty of opportunities to admire Angelina Jolie's chiselled bone structure, the consciousness that this is a star vehicle is to the detriment of the movie. She really doesn't look that good, with dark ringed eyes and improbably swollen and pouty dark lips. John Malkovich manages to keep the hamming down to a reasonable level, and everyone else is pretty good. I can give some credence to the bullying the heroine experiences at the hands of the police. You do wonder, though, why she has absolutely no family or friends in her personal life. As credibility seeps away, more doubts creep in. The behaviour of the child is unconvincing and his motivation never accounted for, which is a major weakness. The depiction of characters behaving really badly, but things then going to the other extreme with saviours stepping in to turn the tables, happens pretty much to formula. In fact it's childishly exaggerated and improbable, but you do see it so often in American movies. All in all, the pudding is pretty much \"over-egged\" and I was left feeling guilty at having wasted so much time watching the film. I was left with sore eyes too, as virtually all of the film is extremely dark, including ridiculously under-lit courtroom scenes.",

            "content": "The Los Angeles Police Department has come a long way since arriving at its current acclaim as one of the best law enforcing units in the United States. Brainchild of the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) now used in all major crime fighting units, the LAPD's tainted history in police corruption and brutality is brilliantly depicted here with shocking consequences. While \"L. A. Confidential\" and \"Mulholland Falls\" were also films with a similar theme depicting police corruption of a bygone era, this film exceptionally stands out for a varied number of reasons.At the fore, yet behind the lens is an actor turned director who needs no formal introduction. With a filmography list spanning more than five decades including winning four Oscars as a director, Hollywood veteran Clint Eastwood masterfully tells a story that is not only based on actual events, but tells it in a way where you get more than what you expect; And that is, a film made with such potent ingredients, the outcome is a rare achievement in film making these days.Meticulously set against the late 1920s backdrop, this grueling narrative has Angelina Jolie playing a single mother insistently pursuing the truth behind her son's abduction. As Christine Collins, she is met with brutal opposition from the very people sworn to serve and protect. In order to save face from public embarrassment and outcry, Captain J.J Jones (Jeffery Donavan) of the LAPD partially resolves the situation by finding an imposter that closely resembles the abducted boy. But a mother knows best, and Collins immediately points out this discrepancy, embarking on a single-handed confrontation with top yet corrupt LAPD officials. When Collins prepares to tell her story to the press, she is packed off to a mental institution and is branded a delusional mother dangerously spiraling out of reality. Locked up and treated like a psychopath, her only aide emerges in the form of Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), a high profile public figure hell bent on taking down corrupt police officers. Their victory however is short lived when she learns that her son, amongst several other boys his age, may have been the victim of a deranged serial killer, resulting in a landmark case against the LAPD.Precise scripting, stellar casting that makes for tight acting, flawless cinematography integrating factual geographical locations, costumes and props, and a nostalgic score also composed by Eastwood, are the ingredients I mentioned earlier. Acting alone is top notch starting with a visually and verbally influential Malkovich whose very presence forms some of the most commanding scenes in the film. The same goes for Geoffrey Pierson as Collins' attorney in a sensational court room drama. Jason Butler Harner as the serial killer and Donavan as Captain Jones are superb as the two villains in roles sure to invoke utter loathing. Saving the best for the last is Jolie in the most significant role of her career, powerfully portraying a mother's pain. A far cry from some of the mindless action movies she occasionally stars in, Jolie is to this film what Julia Roberts is to \"Erin Brockovich\", because at the core, this is one woman's true struggle against a male dominated world. Nominated for three Academy Awards including 'Best Actress in a Leading role', this film may have been the fuel behind Jolie's propulsion into Tinseltown's upper stratosphere from a supporting actress to a leading lady. Now all she has to do is stay the course.",

            "review_title": "Changeling: A Solid Offering",
            "content": "Clint Eastwood, in recent times, has returned again and again to my mind as a director of considerable prowess, the (modern, at least) films of whom offer consistently powerful stories with a deeply dark tone resonating throughout. The recent Warner Brothers release of 35 Eastwood films prompted me to begin a further exploration of his catalogue, a task I began with Changeling, itself\u2014a Universal release\u2014not included in the aforementioned collection.Apparently taken from real events, Changeling presents the story of Christine Collins, a single mother newly promoted to supervisor in a telecommunications firm. Forced to leave her son alone for a few hours when she is called upon to cover a shift, Collins returns to find him gone. The eventual discovery of a child she is resolutely convinced is not her own leads her to conflicts with the obdurate police force as they refuse to resume the search for the boy they insist is now returned.Following on from the intriguing companion piece projects that were Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, and released less than two months before Gran Torino, Changeling is a work from a man churning out films of a high quality at an extraordinary pace. From the beginning Eastwood's fondness for shadows is seen, the director's thematically synonymous usage of lighting among his most recognisable trademarks. Also apparent from the onset is a surprising modesty in Jolie's performance. Truth be told, I daresay I'd not have noticed who was on the screen had I not already known the cast. She blends perfectly into the well created period setting, her performance subtle in the film's beginnings. A minor hiccup encountered at an early stage is the film's pacing; the child has been lost and returned within approximately thirty minutes. Whilst the story that follows is of course the film's centrepiece, the rapidity of the earlier scenes is somewhat diminutive in communicating Collins' emotional response. The film\u2014and we along with it\u2014are given insufficient time to appreciate the loss, the lack of a decent plaintive scene portraying a mother's loss the evident problem. Once the primary narrative arrives, however, the film picks itself up and delivers a series of political messages alongside a succession of emotional scenes. Jolie begins to shine as the woman determined not to be silenced, Malkovich's supporting role adding a fiery criticism which works well to reinforce the damnation of public office corruption. What seems a side-plot integrates itself proficiently into the main narrative with a number of eerily fascinating scenes and a trio of fine supporting performances. The nature of this is perhaps a tad familiar in manner, not quite as original as we might have hoped for, but a fair excuse for Eastwood to indulge himself with replete darkness as he does so well. The film's finale is suitable, working quite well to replicate and maintain the overall tone of the piece.An atavistic portrait, Changeling is not without its flaws. Jolie's performance, though more impressive than ever I'd expected of her, falls short of brilliance through its stoicism, a little too neat emotionally. The character's strength is not\u2014in this case\u2014the film's. Aside from this, it is effective in what it attempts to do, delivering an enthralling story with a world-weary realism conveyed as much\u2014if indeed not more\u2014through its lighting as through its narrative. Though not quite as strong as many of its neighbours in the Eastwood library, Changeling is a solid offering from a man who is doubtlessly one of American cinema's finest working directors.",

The whole atmosphere of the movie, and the slow background music captured the old school feel so well. Overall, great modern classic. PS. I think Hillary Swank could have been good also.",

I've already watched this three times, and it never failed to make me cry. I really recommend it for everyone.The true story that happened in real life was a long time ago. I don't know why the director had an idea to bring the story up, but I am very grateful that he came up with the idea. The story really taught everyone that a mother's instinct was never wrong. She knew that it was not her son. And the best mother is the one who never gives up for their children.And she never stopped looking for her son. Although, we know that maybe she already knew deep in her heart that her son was already dead. But she never gave up because she loved him too much. This fact always made me tear up.10/10.

It is sad enough that Christine Collins lost her son, but to go through all of the horror that the police put her through is just unimaginable. As for director Clint Eastwood, I applaud him with a job very well done. I think it is important to portray true-crime stories in a way like this, that does not glorify the killer. I believe there are too many true crime films out there that allow young adults to idolize killers, therefore making them want to reenact the things that they see. Eastwood did not do this. Although he told the story of the Wineville chicken coop murders, in my opinion he did it in a much better way. Christine Collins was a very brave, courageous woman and I think she is someone that should be idolized, rather than a killer. This film effectively portrays Christine Collins' story of terror, hope, survival, and the power of true love.",

While Angelina Jolie delivered one of her most believable and moving performances, I still could not help feeling that she was somehow miscast. As for the story, it had some good twists but overall it got pretty predictable mid-way through when we realized that most likely this crazy killer had kidnapped walter and other kids. The rest played like a made-for-TV movie, but higher caliber because Eastwood is the directing. I also didn't like the ending, it came across as much sillier than I think it was intending to.

Angelina Jolie's performance is truly terrible. Watching her also, I thought, how can this be the same talented actor from \"Girl, Interrupted\"? But the truth is, Jolie is no longer an actress. She no longer takes risks. She just sits there, trying to look like Joan Of Arc(she does this in real life too now.) I don't like comparing someone's on screen persona with their offscreen persona, but Angelina Jolie invites it. I don't think we will see her anytime soon as a character that is vulnerable. And that's the problem. She is so busy playing strong(Marianne Pearl, Tombraider) that we don't feel anything for her. When she is sent into the mental ward, we know she will get out and endure. It's never a question. Contrast that with Jessica Lange in \"Frances\" and you see what Changeling could have been with a better actress and a director on his game. The acting time and time again doesn't work. The screenplay doesn't help anyone. Amy Ryan's character tell us a bunch of things about oppression against women that feels woefully extra... WE GET IT! Doesn't need to spelled out by a prostitute in a mental ward. Holy cow!The few decent moments come from Michael Kelly and Clint's opening jazz guitar.",

The movie stands tall with best work of Clint Eastwood who bring out the very best of Angelina Jolie and gives you a delicious cocktail of mystery, emotions, crime and drama. Angelina Jolie in her best form makes you root for her character. The detailed period setting of 1930s, neat characterizations and screenplay flooded with carefully written dialogues are a treat to enjoy. Clint might have chosen the thrilling pace for this chilling true story but he intelligently chooses the slow and absorbing approach to take you through the trauma that Christine experienced.

Eventually, after other members of the police department interfere with the way Christine is being treated, she gets released out of the asylum. Over time, more and more evidence about what happened to the real Walter Collins is figured out, as Christine Collins relies on one feeling that her son will be returned to her: hope.Angelina Jolie plays an Oscar-deserving performance in this movie as Christine Collins, the mother of the real Walter Collins. As usual, her acting remains consistent throughout her role, and through her amazing performance, it is possible as an audience to understand or at least try to understand the feelings that Christine Collins had after her son went missing. Her anger at frequent times in the movie also provides insight to how it feels to be lied to by the police, and to have strangers like the police tell her that the boy is the real son, when in fact, the mother knows in her heart that he is not.The overall plot in this film was very thought-out and intricate, as it relates to the true story of Christine Collins.

She's horrible in this. She doesn't even begin to fit the part and acts like a walking corpse throughout the entire film. Or maybe walking lips? In this movie we're watching Angelina Jolie in bad makeup and a flapper costume, not Christine Collins who lost a son. And someone needs to advise her to eat or at least hydrate more, she's looking exceptionally gaunt which was not the desired appearance of women in the 20's. Probably another thing her Yes Men dared not suggest, that she put on a little weight for the movie. This movie could have been good. Maybe Mr. Eastwood just wanted to \"work with\" Angelina and take her out for dinner afterward, who knows.",

            "content": "I intentionally waited a long time to see CHANGELING (as long as three months after its release) due in large part to the lukewarm reviews it received. I now believe that such reviews were given due to Clint Eastwood's long list of recent successes. While CHANGELING is not quite as good as his latest offerings, it is still a worthwhile and memorable watch.The style of CHANGELING (reminiscent of the 'early decades of the 20th century' style used in L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, CHICAGO and CHINATOWN) is visually stunning, and Eastwood manages to infuse an element of film noir into the Motion Picture that I happen to really admire.The story is a quite compelling and engrossing one, as expected of films of this nature, but in my opinion, there was too much focus on the secondary story and not enough on the primary one.Angelina Jolie's acting is not as outstanding as many make it out to be, but it is still a fine piece of work. It's just that she seems lost in the role (not in a good way) and comes off as uncomfortable with such a difficult character to portray. Her Best Actress nomination seemed undeserved when compared to other strong performances that year that didn't make the final cut (most notably Kate Winslet in REVOLUTIONARY ROAD). The rest of the acting is quite excellent, as even the secondary characters deliver solid performances, and manage to outshine Jolie in many instances.All I'm saying is that CHANGELING deserves a chance, regardless of its reviews. If you are a fan of CHINATOWN-styled film noir, you'll probably appreciate this. 9/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should just about enter my Top 200 at 198. Highly recommended.",

            "review_title": "Changeling: A Comment.",
            "content": "Almost everything within the film is calculated to hit extra hard at our emotional chords, to tug our heartstrings in support of the heroine, fill us with rage and disgust at the sight of the actions of the powerful leaders in the story, and, of course, jerk the tears from eyes. Eastwood's more recent films in particular are known to contain some sentimentality but, until now, he's refrained from hitting us over the head with the overexuberant brand of saccharin, meritless emotion found in many other films based on real-life accounts of peril and injustice. Yet, that is a particular test \"Changeling\" does not quite pass, though it is still far above some of the biggest and worst weepies in the room (\"Tsotsi,\" anyone? Or, perhaps you would prefer shedding tears to \"Central Station\"?).Part of the problem is the way the central character is portrayed, not entirely due to Jolie's work, but also to the fact that she, and as such her character, comes across as rather too glamorous for the predicaments she finds herself in. Even during the most trying scenes, such as searching frantically for her missing son, dealing with a police department that is, at best, apathetic and, at worst, one of the chief causes of grief Christine Collins (Jolie) and the audience are made to suffer, she seems oddly beautiful in a way that leaves a disconnect, to the detriment of any realism the movie may have otherwise had, with the drama that unfolds.As was the case in last year's \"A Mighty Heart,\" in which the actress delivers another impassioned performance as a woman who is, in many ways, in a similar situation\u0097tragically wronged by circumstances and people beyond her control\u0097it is often difficult to see past her movie-star glitter to get to the raw agony at the core of her character. A large part of this has to do with how the film visually presents her. Her hair and makeup are just right enough to flatter her, even during her most trying times within a grim psychiatric ward, many of the patients of which arrived unwillingly mainly because they were an inconvenience to the police and others in power. She is always filmed by the director of photography, Tom Stern, to look beautiful, almost saintly. That's not a criticism of his work in the film generally; it appropriately renders a vivid interpretation of a 1920s Los Angeles reminiscent of old Hollywood pictures. However, it does distract from Jolie.Despite the objections, the film is by no means ruined by the glamour and the oversentimentality. Rather, these are mainly a distraction from what is otherwise a compelling and memorable story, written by J. Michael Straczynski, otherwise told relatively well. The basic story is perhaps the best thing about the film, more likely than not because it it presents an inherently compelling situation. The way scenes are intricately intercut (by editors Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach) so as to play off each other is an old tool of storytelling that is used to good effect here, though more for dramatic effect than as an essential method of conveying the plot. Overall, the film could have been more efficient, with a few minutes being trimmed from the film, most obviously the aforementioned Oscar scene. Also, some sequences do feel repetitious in plot and especially in the emotions evoked.In the end, while \"Changeling\" is an engrossing story, its distractions interfere with the film, rendering it far from perfect, and, ultimately, minor Eastwood.",

            "review_title": "Engrossing",
            "content": "Clint Eastwood is a great example of an actor who made a smooth transition into directing. His films are always fluid and visually gripping, direct and deceptively simple, told with a straight face whilst retaining emotional weight. Though some of his directorial work doesn't quite achieve what it set out to, it is it is nearly always gripping on some level and interesting to watch. Whenever he delivers on a script that that allows him to use all of his expertise then he usually provides something engrossing. Never is this clearer than with Changeling, based on the true story of the disappearance of Christine Collins' son and the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Here you have a period piece that is tailor made to Eastwood's understanding of human struggle and involving story- telling. The relatively straight-forward story is set in 1928 and mainly details Collins' struggle against the LAPD after her son Walter disappears. The boy they return to her 5 months later isn't hers. Her protests fall on deaf ears as the police insist that she's just in shock and that she should give the boy a trial run. The film continues to build tension and unease brilliantly until Collins is sectioned, which leaves a crusading Reverend and a detective on a case as her only hope. Eastwood had shown previously that he could handle both mystery (Mystic River) and drama (Million Dollar Baby), so a story featuring plenty of both his right up his street and it certainly shows. He handles this story with delicacy and emotion, developing characters and their feelings without letting the story itself become unfocused. The deeper we get into Christine's plight, the more we want to know the truth.The further the film progresses, the more impressive Angelina Jolie's performance is. I was sceptical that should could carry such a film on her shoulders, but she brings everything needed to the role. What she does that is most striking is give us a woman who appears vulnerable on the surface yet contains an inner strength that cannot be broken. I believed every act of defiance and cry of anguish, as much as I believed every tear and melancholic expression. Above all she manages to make Christine authentic. Her reactions are just as you'd expect a real mother to act in such a situation. This isn't an easy performance to play off and carry with conviction given its complexities, I think Jolie did an extremely noteworthy job and received a deserved Oscar nomination.The film develops the themes of female disempowerment and corruption of the law with an appropriate subtlety. We see Christine's worries dismissed by men in charge, whether they are doctors or police chiefs, and just how easy it is for them to make her life even more of a struggle. The two high ranking police only appear to care about the public's image of the LAPD and Christine only finds support from a radio reverend. All of these roles are played with dependability, Jeffrey Donovan and Colm Feore as the seedy cops, John Malkovich going against type as the generous Reverend Briegleb. The film does well to reflect the nature of its period. There is an authenticity and stark beauty to the visuals, almost as if they were painted. You get a feel of the time and you never question it because it washes over you. The score provided by Eastwood fits the mood too, somewhat stark and lead by a sombre piano, it suits what is happening on screen perfectly. As the film builds we discover all kinds of secrets and corruptions. The film leaves you thrilled and shocked, upset but hopeful, it manages to bring in so many emotions without making them feel forced like so many films of its style do. Eastwood is clearly in his element with films that tell deep stories about people, he gives them heart without losing sight of the story that he is trying to bring to life. In Jolie he has an actress who handles the material with grace and courage, who becomes the person we care about and want to succeed. There is a mystery that unravels excellently and Christine's case becomes all the more engaging as it does. Most importantly the film very rarely sags or loses focus, I was completely engaged from beginning to end. It gave me plenty to be entertained by, be involved with and finally reflect upon.",

            "content": "The film is set mostly in the 1920s, but the hokiness of some of its scenes (although, according to IMDb, \"Virtually every event depicted in the film appears as cited in legal documents, with dialog often taken verbatim from court transcripts\") and its sappy score are straight out of the 1990s. However, all of that is overcome by tremendous acting performances, especially from Jolie (but not Eddie Alderson, who was not convincing as Sanford Clark), as well as by the incredible story, which is mostly true.I can't believe that this could happen to somebody. This is yet another frightening example of the dangers inherent in handing over unchecked power to any law enforcement organization. If we do not pay attention to history, we are doomed to repeat it.Additionally, this story reminds me of the value of today's technology and social media. While many complain about how much easier it is to invade someone's privacy, it is also a lot easier to expose corruption. Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Oscar Grant...these cases are not a new trend developing amongst police departments. This kind of rampant corruption and abuse of authority has existed for long before anyone can remember. But now we finally have the tools to expose them.And it's not just the police. As an attorney, I have personally stopped a mental health professional from wrongfully committing a person to a mental health institution over what basically amounted to a petty verbal argument between the doctor and the patient.Respect to Straczynski for getting this movie made. This is where filmmaking crosses over into activism. If someone just told you the facts of this case, you might struggle to fathom how this would play out in actuality...how many people would have to screw up, be complicit, or just flat out do nothing to perpetuate this evil...and just how many people would have to decide to do the right thing, even at risk to their own career, financial interests, or even personal safety, in order to unf*ck this mess. This movie very effectively portrays how this unfortunate situation could very plausibly go down...and while there are many more checks and balances today to help prevent some of the previous injustices from happening again, perhaps some who would previously dismiss all police corruption and mental health abuse as wild conspiracy theories might have their minds changed just a little bit by this film.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",

            "content": "At times, it is seen that the latter ones turn out to be absolute classics. And Changeling is one of those movies.Firstly, the plot. Inspired from real-life events in Los Angeles in late 1920s, the plot slowly and carefully depicts the social standards of people and the civil services of that period. Especially, it focuses on the inefficient LAPD and this aspect plays an essential antagonistic role in the movie.The story is primarily about a single, working mother , Christine Collins (played by Angelina Jolie) who comes home one night, late from work, only to find that her only son is missing from the house.She checks everywhere she possibly could, and eventually reports the LAPD about the incident. As months pass by, there's no sign of her son as the LAPD fails to find even a single trace of the boy.At this point, the viewer connects with the characters pretty well, sympathizing with Mrs.Collins and forming hatred for the LAPD. The story takes a twist, when, after a span of 5 months, they LAPD , in a glorified fashion in front of the media, reunites Christine Collins with her lost son, showing that the department can ensure safety of the people. Well, this is a very significant event, considering the fact that the boy is not the son her mother was looking for. And, as she speaks of the fact, the LAPD chief insists her that she might have been wrong, owing to the inner emotional conflicts and the time her son was away from her. She is forced to accept in front of the media this falsehood. Later on, she finds out vital proofs that the boy is not her son. And thus starts a journey and sequence of incidents of a mother who just fights to want her son back, and the dirty politics she faces played-off by the LAPD , let alone the dire consequences, the torture(being send off to a mental asylum forcibly etc.).In the meantime, a huge incident of homicide unearths in another part of the country, and this big incident ultimately connects to the prime story smoothly by the second-half.Secondly, the performance(s). Until now, we have seen Jolie in glamorous,action-packed roles, those which have very little scope of drama.But in this movie, she surprises by showing her real acting talents, of what she can be capable of. The way she manages to connect with the viewer is simply amazing. In fact, the movie is able to jerk tears in some sequences. Hats-off to Jolie. We would want to see more of her in such roles in the upcoming years.Almost all the actors in other roles manage to pull off a fine show, although i think the role of the Reverend could have been played better by Michael Caine. But apart from that, everything about performances is fine.Thirdly , the direction. Eastwood fan, anyone? Well I bet there are many, but if you are not, you will be added to the list, and would want to watch more and more of his movies, that's my bet! Making the film move in such a smooth pace(you never feel bored at any point of time), narrating the story of each and every character in such a delicate fashion, Clint Eastwood deserves to have a standing ovation for his work.So all in all, a perfect movie, that leaves you mesmerized in the end, and makes you feel and understand the agony of the protagonist. A serious drama, suitable for a repeat viewing.",

            "content": "How I wish I was Clint Eastwood's Editor! Changeling had all the makings of real classic - great story, excellent period location, solid actors, good score...etc, etc, but as usual with Clint, he's overcooked it, takes it one more step and the work skirts with the pornographic.He should take a leaf out of Hitchcock's book and realise that less is often more in movies. Scorcese also talks about the missing frame on celluloid being planted into the viewers mind (for examples see Tarantino's ear cutting scene in Reservoir Dogs or Danny Boyle's Shallow Grave burial scene.)What we have with the Changeling is a well produced, well detailed, well acted drama, but it goes to far.The drawn out execution scene was completely unnecessary, as was the over blown asylum scenes.Angelina Joli does well in a meaty role, but you can't help feeling she is going through the motions at times and not varying the emotions enough to make it interesting. At almost every dramatic turn we see her face crumple, a few tears fall, then the hands shake, the trembly bony fingers and soon it's the head in the hands and cut to next scene. It all looks a bit formulaic - the method gone sad if you like.Malkovic puts in a decent shift as the militant preacher fighting police corruption and bad cop Jeffrey Donovan is also pretty good if at times a bit too stupid to be a top cop with his completely narrow view of events.It's worth watching this movie for the sets and the good storyline, Eastwood delivers fine production values but he needs to get a grip of a decent editor to avoid these dark indulgences that we witness far too often in his movies - Mystic River (a terrible final scene), Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby to name but a few.Changeling? Watch on TV or rent don't buy the DVD as it's unlikely to invite a second viewing for most.One final side note - Eastwood might have introduced some typical 1920s entertainment in the back drop - i.e. there was no radio, no source music and the town and townsfolk seemed to be completely lacking in any form of entertainment - bear in mind the film is set in LA during the boom of cinema, live theatre, live music and speakeasies full of flappers - but there is not a sight of any of that. Eastwood's 1920s LA is like Moscow 1950. Disappointing because he had a big opportunity to capture the mood of the 1920s v the contrast of this dark story. All in all worth watching, but once will probably be enough!",

There's nothing worse than losing a son, daughter, brother, sister or parent. Being a single parent only made it more traumatic for AJ's character. Everything was on her shoulders...the guilt for leaving her child alone, the wonder if she'd ever see him again, the rising, then falling, then rising again of hope he was still alive somewhere. Then she skillfully portrayed the anger and disgust with the LAPD, who tried to force an impostor as her son on her. Then there was the outrage of being committed to the mental ward without provocation. Love her line after seeing her friend endure shock treatment. Give Clint Eastwood a compelling story and skilled actors and he'll come up with a gripping film just about every time. This was among his best, in my humble opinion.

Great examples of how sometimes people will do the most dishonest and unthinkable things, just because they are caught up in a machine, a bureaucracy, and go too far before they realize what they have really done.

I'll have to watch more of his movies to find out.Only a few positive things I can say about Changeling.I really liked the exterior shots of LA in the twenties. I loved seeing all the old cars and trams floating about. So a big credit to whoever designed that. Also the only acting performance with any real life in it was Jason Butler Harner who sadly only appeared towards the end. His performance as Gordon Northcott was the film's saving grace.

            "content": "Now more geared toward directing that his acting career, Clint Eastwood dusts off this amazing and unique crime thriller with the help of a few writers. The concept of Eastwood returning to Universal is a rather interesting move considering he's partial to Warner Bros. I don't exactly remember much about the film awards of 2008, but if I had been a judge to determine if this was in the rankings, I would most certainly call it one of the top twenty films for the year it was released. Angelina Jolie stars as an historical character, Christine Collins who at the start of the film plays a single mother who is trying to support her son, Walter. What starts out as a missing child turns into something bigger than the audience might anticipate. Since this is a period film of the late 1920s, you do have to remember on a historical note that this was the point in time when the L.A. police department was big into scandals to mostly cover up their ties to the mob. So with that in mind, you can imagine how frustrating it was for Ms. Collins to deal with the police as well as coming from the position of a woman of that time who had very limited roles in the public eye. Bottom line, if you like hard core drama that has suspense and is thrilling, this is for you. The acting is extremely professional. Jeffrey Donavan is very convincing as the head of police affairs who is stopping at nothing to keep Christine Collins from exposing his mistake by giving her the wrong child. This movie is not for the faint of heart. There are some disturbing scenes here. First and foremost it's a documentary, so some details cannot be avoided. As far as I am concerned if there is an updated version of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this should be in that version of that book. Excellent performances all around!",

            "content": "Changeling is a harrowing story of one woman's nightmare when she tries to find her missing son. For screenwriters it shows the benefits, but also the difficulty, of combining the thriller with the social drama.Drama is one of the great storytelling forms, but it has become rare in a Hollywood that requires all its movies to have blockbuster potential. Most writers of classic drama have moved to television where the level of writing has never been higher. But to get a drama made in film, you have to combine it with a more sensational genre that can pull in the big audience. Enter the thriller.At first glance, this marriage of forms looks like a good idea. Social drama lets you explore human nature and social conflict in depth, while the thriller gives the story excitement, jeopardy and narrative drive. But these same qualities dictate virtually opposite story movements. Drama wants to slow down and dig deep, find the underlying causes and explore the subtleties of human character. Thriller wants to charge ahead, to find out who is attacking the hero. No subtlety here; it's yes or no, he did it or he didn't.This is the crux of the problem that Changeling writer, J. Michael Straczynski, had to solve to make this film work. The story begins with the social drama. The hero, Christine Collins, returns home from work to find her son missing. Months later the police bring her a boy they claim is her son, even though she insists he isn't. Her desire is simple: she wants her son back. But that creates a big structural problem for the writer. She can't act on her desire. All she can do is repeat it to the corrupt cops. And while this generates anger in the audience at the arrogant injustice of the police who treat her as an incompetent child, it doesn't drive the story forward.This early part of the film also highlights another flaw common to the social drama. The hero has no moral need. All immorality is located in the opposition, the corrupt cops. This creates a good vs. evil contrast that is the kiss of death for good social drama, and exacerbates the hero's position as a victim already established by her reactive desire line.With the social drama line slowing to a halt, Straczynski introduces the investigation line and the story takes off with a burst of energy that's palpable. A cop in the same precinct as the corrupt captain follows up on a kid's claim that he helped a serial killer murder boys. The resulting investigation is not complicated, but it doesn't have to be. It gives the story a goal with clear action beats. The writer then cross-cuts this line with a thriller line that comes from the corrupt captain sending Christine to an insane asylum for claiming the police gave her the wrong boy.Does this story have a double desire line, and therefore two spines? You bet. And it does feel like two movies that have been cobbled together. But we also see here a writer making a unique story work on its own terms. Most stories have one or more structural roadblocks built in; they are part of the animal. If, as a professional, you have to make a story work, you pull from your bag of techniques and get the job done. Straczynski knows that neither desire line will support the story on its own. But by cross-cutting them, he creates a track with enough narrative drive to take us to the end of the social drama.But not without severe costs. The story's structural flaws prevent this from being a great social drama. Yes, the corrupt captain and chief of police are brought low and the mother is publicly redeemed. But subtlety and an exploration of deeper causes are nowhere to be found.So what can we learn from Changeling? I've already mentioned the importance of making the story work, even if you have to break a few of the rules of good drama. The lesson of never letting perfection get in the way of success is always good for writers to remember. Changeling also shows us the power, and the difficulty, of combining drama with thriller. The key structural element is desire. If possible, try to turn the two desire lines - of drama and thriller - into one. Each line should help solve the other: investigating the crime should lead to deeper layers of the social conflict while the argument about the social issue should lead the hero to new clues about the crime.Finally, Changeling shows us one of the keys to dramatizing a real-life story: finding the right frame. A true story must hit the same seven major structure steps as a fictional story. But a true story restricts you in how you find those steps, since you can't just create them from thin air. Instead you have to focus on the frame, where to begin and end the story, and that means you have to start by identifying your battle scene. In Changeling, everything comes to a dramatic head at the trial, actually a cross-cut between the trial of the killer and the trial of the LA police. This battle brings a convergence of the two lines that this real-life drama-thriller desperately needs.If you are interested in how to tell any story with maximum dramatic power, regardless of genre, look at our 22 Step Great Screen writing Class.

Although it is hard to connect with the story emotionally in the start of the film, as the plot gets deeper, we become attached to the characters and you are almost afraid to see what happens to them, because you are so connected to them.

            "review_title": "Not Eastwood's best",
            "content": "So, there I was, excited to watch a movie, from a director I respect very much. The story seemed interesting, the cast seemed interesting, everything seemed interesting, and I expected once again to be completely immersed into the poetics of Eastwood's directing. And it did happen. It happened in a manner that I wanted to get away; the only thing forcing me to watch it through - my incredulity of the whole thing. I managed to see the whole movie, after which I had a serious headache, and a feeling of deep anxiety. And, of course, a question which kept ringing in my mind, \"What just happened?\" Angelina Jolie is a great actress, and did her job well. But still, as all actors have their forte, here's where the problems start with this movie. It's hard to say what her character is like. Is she a mother, deeply disturbed by the missing of her child, or a cloaked tigress, trying to pose as a sensitive woman asking for help. Jolie's forte is her passion, her ability to portray strength, but in this movie, it seems that her strength is bridled to a degree it's implausible. Over-accentuated gestures, stares, make-up, everything, left an impression that she wasn't exactly what she was telling us she was. I believe it would be more interesting to watch an actress whose forte was sensitivity, and softness, become a tigress fighting for her child. Jeffrey Donovan did an excellent job in presenting us with all the anxiety his character was going through. Michael Kelly as Detective Ybarra also did a wonderful job. And a true discovery was Eddie Alderson who played Sanford Clark, rising up to the role he was dealt, and doing it in a truly professional manner. But, even though these actors, along with Malkovich, did an excellent job, by rounding up their characters into real people, they were merely touched, serving as a carrier for the role of Mrs Collins, who was pretty much one sided, and insecure about what she was actually portraying. Yes, she wanted to find her son. And she was willing to do anything to do it. But that's not all she was. And if her impotence at finding help was all there is to say about her, then it should have been her forte, and it should have been more deeply explored. Yelling \"Where's my son?!\" for x-times seemed like a superficial clich\u00e9. Another problem with the movie is its pace and tempo. It starts real slow, and after about an hour and a half, its tempo changes drastically, to a climax with the discovery of the murders. This is achieved through a series of disturbing scenes, leading to a denouement, adding a heartbeat to the movie. And for reasons, to me unknown, the movie continues. Again extremely slow pace, and then another climax, culminating with the scene of the hanging, leading onward gradually to the real ending. The dramatic intensity of the events completely being out of balance. The third problem is factuality. I'm no expert in linguistic peculiarities of the early 1930s, my only experience with them revolving around old Cagney movies. Still, the discourse used seemed like a combination of late 1950s as well as contemporary language. The scenery seemed authentic enough, so I wonder how other aspects of the time depicted didn't follow as well. Also, from what I've read about the actual events, there's no mention of Northcott's mother anywhere. If this is \"a true story\" which is clearly stated in the beginning of the movie, it fails to prove that it's indeed a true story. So, again with the question, \"What just happened?\"A horrid story about a mother trying to find her missing son, countered by a corrupt and extremely inefficient police force, which instead of using its power to do something about it, direct it against her, is disturbing enough. The social critique of a society, whose problems linger on till today, but with a different shade, is noteworthy and important. But it simply wasn't enough for this movie to work properly. If shock is seen as enough to stir people up, then it could as well have been directed as a thriller or a horror movie. If it was meant to convey an important message, it should have dealt more with important details instead of hasty directing. I can't wait for another Eastwood movie, since I'm convinced he can do much better than this.",

However, crime solver that I am, there were a couple of loose ends in the film that left me wondering. First, when Ms. Collins goes to the train station to get her 'son' and realizes it isn't him, and then is bullied into taking him home, why doesn't she think to have the kid's fingerprints taken and compared to her son's? Also, at the end, when the boy is being interviewed about the escape and said he didn't know what happened to Walter, why did the police not talk to the nephew of the killer, the boy who told the story initially? He was with his uncle (or was it cousin) when they chased the escaped boys, and surely he would know if Walter was caught and then killed. It seems that the answer would have been easy to obtain, rather than have her wait years and years with no closure.",

It's especially this element that weakens the potency of the film's main underpinning of a mother's loss and despair. What's more, it's ineffective and begs credibility because of the stylised manner by which it's executed.The way the film's historical period is presented is as an eye-catching and glossy ideal of 1920s Americana. Through its incongruous relationship to the downbeat subject matter it distracts from the suspension of disbelief. Are we suppose to admire the film's chic visual opulence or identify with familial heartbreak? I guess we could do both, but it sure is deflecting.The red ribbon winner for discordancy though, which one presumes was unintentional, is Jason Butler Harner's performance as a serial killer. He takes offbeat a beat too far and the results are plain clownish.More bizarre is Jolie. She regularly looks as if she's posing during her character's grief.

            "content": "This is a reasonably solid, well acted, interesting story, with good direction from Clint Eastwood. It just doesn't leave me overly enthusiastic about it. It has the requisite, if occasionally jarring, crowd pleasing moments, touches of Gothic horror, the darkness of the police corruption in the LAPD, a very disturbing and effectively done hanging scene. Yet it never quite goes deep enough in any direction enough to leave a lasting impact. It diffuses what could have been a very powerful compact tight film, by not concentrating on one or even two elements of the story. There are at least four or five different elements in this film that each could have demanded attention in their own right. So what happens is that film loses its focus, not in a fatal way; the film still is good make no mistake. Anjelina Jolie is good as Christine Collins whose son goes missing, and is convinced that the police have not found her son, but instead have landed her with an imposter. She then ends up being in an asylum through some law the police can use to incarcerate people they do not like or find awkward. As the story unfolds it becomes far darker, and it is clear that her son is unlikely to alive, and has almost certainly been murdered. Malkovich is good as the crusading preacher who takes her side against the police particularly Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) the overly done slick police captain. The moments of unintentional humour which soften the film, for example it is made to seem by a particularly clumsy scene that every one in the mental asylum is there because of police corruption. Then there is concession to a modern audience wanting a tough sassy heroine, rather than the probably terrified if still tough Chrisitne Collins. She says to the head psychiatrist ' f**k you and the horse you came upon' She may have said that in reality, but I suspect not, it was probably there as a bit of crowd pleasing. This lessons the reality of what must have been a terrifying ordeal. One scene such as the hanging scene although well done do cause you to wonder why it was there. Was it there so we could enjoy the death of the child killer, which I think in a film less subtle than this would have been understandable, but in a film trying to sophisticated seems awkwardly out of place. I could not help thinking that any chance of Christine Collins finding out the whereabouts of her son was gone forever with the killers death. If this had been the point of the hanging scene, then I think it should have been referred to in the story. There isn't much wrong with this film but some of the scenes to do seem awkward, and the tone of the film occasionally lacks the sensibility of the 20's and 30's in some minor but noticeable ways. None of the acting reaches the exceptional level, Angelina Jolie despite being a tad to glamorous for the role does show she has more range than I would have given her credit for. The film ticks all the good boxes, but none of the great boxes; not by much, but enough to be noticeable.",

The throaty, horn-dominated symphony, lurking dangerously below the surface.The thing is, it takes itself far too seriously.

From Captain Power to the Real Ghostbusters to Babylon 5 to his run on the comic book Spider-man, J. Michael Straczynski is not so much my favorite writer as he is my writing God. So, when I heard that a major motion picture, written by him, was being produced by originally Ron Howard, then Clint Eastwood and that A listers like John Malkovich and Angelina Jolie were going to be in it, not to mention Jeffrey Donovan, the star of Burn Notice, were going to be involved in it, I was excited and nervous beyond all hell. I'm not really a sports fan, but the feeling I had is the way I think a fan feels when they find out their home town team is playing for the World Series or the Superbowl. I was excited because JMS was finally going to break into Hollywood. I was nervous because, well what if it sucked? I mean, I loved JMS's work on TV shows, but while the Babylon 5's made for TV movies weren't bad, they were nowhere near as good as the show itself. I was worried that JMS might not be able to pull off a movie. Furthermore, a lot of hands end up touching movies before they get produced. I wanted to see my home town team win, not get humiliated. So, I was nervous.Also, I was confused. The movie was called Changeling, which to me, the Star Trek nerd, is the alien species that Odo from Deep Space Nine. I couldn't believe for the life of me that all these A-listers signed on for a sci-fi movie, despite the fact that JMS had made his name writing sci-fi. Then I heard it was based on a true story. This confused me even further.But, all my anxiousness didn't stop me from being a one man advertisement team for this movie. I bugged and threatened and bargained with all my friends to go see this one when it finally came out. In retrospect I think some of them might have decided to skip it because I was annoying them that badly.Well, the movie came out... and it was amazingly good! I mean, I know I'm a JMS whore, but it really, really was awesomely good. The cast was awesome, the visuals were awesome, the music was awesome, everything about it was freaking awesome, and the writing was beautifully, magically awesome! My only minor complaint with the movie is that JMS may have been too faithful to history and might have shortened the end by combining a few scenes. But, seriously, this is definitely my pick for best movie of 2008, and probably ranked number two or three of the decade, following Finding Neverland and (500) Days of Summer.

I don't want to give anything away, but there are scenes in the movie that partially show the killing of and killing by children. I was sick to my stomach the the final 1/3 of the movie and had to leave at one point. There is also a scene that disturbingly shows a woman being given shock treatment at a psych ward.I sadly cannot recommend this movie because of the few very disturbing scenes that ruined it for me. Otherwise, this movie would be highly recommended.",

            "content": "Changeling tells the story of Christine, a single mother whose little boy, Walter, is missing. After a few months of search, the LAPD finds a boy with a similar description to Walter's and reunites him with Christine, only to discover that she is stating that he is not her boy. What follows is a battle between the LAPD, not wanting to admit that they found the wrong boy and, therefore, be embarrassed further, and Christine, who wants her boy back.The story and the characters have both their strengths and weaknesses. While the main character's relentlessness is the driving force of the story and is entertaining, her lack of courage and passiveness in some scenes makes it hard to root for her. However, Angelina Jolie's performance of Christine, depicting a concerned mother, is impactful and emotional, which makes up for the character at some levels. The other thing to note here is the clever way of expressing oppression against women in the story; however, the plot and the overall theme can seem exaggerated. For example, the behavior of staff at the mental hospital was over-dramatic, in my opinion.Changeling is an OK movie with some enjoyable traits. I can not say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and there were times in which fast-forwarding seemed like a good option. However, the visual theme of the film and their depiction of the 20s was entertaining. For instance, every street shot is reminiscent of the good old days. Also, the costumes help\nbuild up this atmosphere.To conclude, I can say that Changeling is not a bad movie; if you are into the 20s period and enjoy drama with a side of mystery, chances are you would enjoy it.",

Unfortunately, Angelina Jolie detracts from the film by looking more like a glamorous 1920's Hollywood star than a mother who is living out her worst nightmare. I'm not a fan of Ms. Jolie, but her performance in the movie is not bad - it just seems more attention was given to her lipstick than to her acting. Both of the actresses mentioned - Hilary Swank & Reese Witherspoon - as lobbying for the part would have brought more substance to the part. Shame on Ron Howard for wanting Ms. Jolie because her look was more suited to the period. Hasn't Ms. Swank proved she's a chameleon when it comes to her looks - and Ms. Witherspoon pulled off transforming herself into June Carter! I agree with another poster who after researching the story of Walter Collins was less enthralled with the movie. Overall, though, it is a beautifully made film as are most films directed by Mr. Eastwood.",

So does everyone say we're sorry madam, we'll keep looking for your son, oh noooooo. They try to convince Mrs Collins she must be mistaken, and when she persists they try to convince her she is crazy, going so far as to lock her up in the nut house along with several obviously intelligent, sane women who had the bad sense to cross some man in authority.

Of course, there are some embellishments and slight inaccuracies, but they're minor. \nIn 1928 Los Angeles, single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a supervisor for the telephone company, is called in to work on a Saturday. She leaves her son Walter in front of the radio. She makes him some lunch and puts it in the fridge (actually, they were called iceboxes in the 1920's). She asks a neighbor to check in on him. When she returns home, Walter is gone. The cops are little help initially, but they eventually agree to investigate. They find the kid five months later in Illinois. They bring him back to L.A. to reunite with his mother and make sure the press is there to document what a great job they have done--since most of the press about the L.A. cops has to do with incompetence, corruption, and cover-ups.\nProblem is, he's not her son. But nobody believes her. Incredibly, she is eventually diagnosed as delusional and put into a mental hospital.\nThis movie challenged my credulity big time. I keep thinking that the film exaggerated the real story. This couldn't possibly have happened. But doing some research, I discovered that Eastwood rigorously stuck with the facts from court transcripts and police documents. \nI'll admit right up front that I don't like big  movie stars. I wish Eastwood had chosen someone other than Jolie, who is just too damn good looking to be realistic. But the box office rules, and Jolie does turn in a convincing performance. So does John Malkovich as a civic minded, rebellious preacher who is on a mission to expose the nasty deeds of the L.A police force. The other actors, including Jeffrey Donovan as  the crooked police captain, are also excellent. But it's the story that rules this film. There are further developments which add to the ever-increasing horror.\nThere's clearly a feminist polemic here concerning women's treatment by men in authority, as well as a diatribe about the Powers That Be---not just the cops, but the doctors and mental health people, all complicit in taking the cops' word against that of a mother.\nThe ending........Well, no spoilers. But it's pretty heavy.\nEastwood has directed many great films. Some critics say that this one doesn't measure up to his best work. I disagree. It's long (2 1/2 hours), and it's emotionally draining, but it skillfully recounts a sad, amazing story",

            "content": "Familiar and yet Changeling still rivets you.\n\nClint Eastwood's crime mystery and period drama Changeling (2008) feels like Eastwood trying to recreate his directorial magic from Mystic River with influences of David Fincher's Zodiac and Roman Polanski's Chinatown mixed in here. Changeling is certainly engaging as a film and well made. I just feel like Eastwood has directed even better throughout his illustrious career. Changeling is a fantastic crime mystery that reaches heights like Zodiac, but never reaches devastating realism in its drama like Eastwood's early classic Mystic River that Changeling bears more than a few resemblances to in hindsight.\n\nIt's nice that Eastwood tried to direct a feminist film, sympathetic to the plight of a woman who needed to be believed by the men around her, but this is laughable coming from a lifelong sexist, conservative like the notorious Clint Eastwood. Ridiculous sexist concepts that only could have been conjured by Clint seep through Changeling like the young, single Angelina Jolie's only potential dating prospect at the end being an older balding white man with a position of power over her. If only Eastwood had more women's voices and perspective involved while creating Changeling, this would feel more empathetic and sincere. \n\nIt's an infuriating true story that uncovers corruption, cruelty, criminality, and sexism from The LAPD and American justice systems in general. However, this is a strange subject for Eastwood, whose early films objectify women endlessly and who personally supports conservative police policies. So I cannot help but feel like Eastwood is disingenuous for directing Changeling, who I doubt actually felt deep sympathy for the female and child victims herein. It's hard to see kindness from Clint Eastwood. I'm glad he told this outrageous piece of history, but I feel like a woman director and writer would have elevated this material to something more polished and poignant. \n\nJ. Michael Straczynski's script is well written with heartfelt passages that strike you with emotional realism. Other parts have lame and predictable dialogue, especially everything the cops say throughout Changeling that feel like a television show. Joel Cox and Gary D. Roach's editing is sleek and polished with no flaws I can really see other than they could have cut a few minutes more to ensure Changeling's 141 minutes does not drag. Tom Stern's cinematography is so stunning for all the close-ups and medium shots to allow you to simply witness excellence in character acting. His shot choices ensure performances are as gripping as possible.\n\nJames J. Murakami's production design really looks like 1928 America. Same with Deborah Hopper's stylish fashions for Changeling's costumes and Zoe Hay's plush make-up. Clint Eastwood's score is beautiful with memorable and subtle piano melodies all over Changeling. It's lovely to hear Clint express his artistry to the music in his movies as well as directing them.\n\nAngelina Jolie is powerful and commanding in a vulnerable lead actress role as Christine Collins, the brave mother of a missing son. Her sincere acting has a striking aura and fearsome gravitas that you really feel the realism of her character. Amy Ryan should have got an award for her supporting actress role as the unjustly incarcerated Carol Dexter. She is arguably the best actress in the movie. That's really saying something considering how captivating Jolie's leading part remains in Changeling.\n\nJohn Malkovich is excellent as the sympathetic and helpful reverend who aids Angelina Jolie's quest for justice and answers. Jeffrey Donovan way overacts as the old timey cop captain, who feels cartoonish at best. His accent and voice choices were certainly a choice. Michael Kelly is fierce as the rough cop detective searching for missing kids. Jason Butler Harner is creepy and outstanding as the serial killer. His chilling performance is the special kind of character acting you only get in an Eastwood great film. I pretty much hated everyone else in this one aside from all the wonderful performances from the child actors, especially the killer's little helper elf's confession.\n\nIn conclusion, Changeling mostly holds up as a tender and authentic picture of classy sophistication and frightening realism from an old school director like Clint Eastwood.",

            "content": " I've been a fan of J. Michael Straczynski for many years. It's been impressive to see him make the leap from comic books to books, television, movies, etc. I see Neil Gaiman following very quickly in his footsteps. That being said, I was quite surprised to see JMS migrate out of his sci-fi genre into a historical film about a very odd criminal case from the late 1920's, more commonly referred to as the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. Years ago, a contact with Los Angeles County called JMS and told him that the county was about to go through a house cleaning and destroy some documents on a strange case in which JMS might be interested. Those documents, after years of development, resulted in Clint Eastwood's Changeling. While being an interesting niche story about a single, working woman in the late 1920s who, out of need, must leave her son home alone every day while she works. One day she comes home to find her son missing. After weeks of no progress by the oft-criticized, corrupt LAPD, she gets a call saying that her son has been found. Once reunited with her son, she realizes that this child is not hers. Only the LAPD, needing to save face, make her think she's crazy for thinking he isn't her child. The story then follows two different paths that eventually converge. One is the fight Angeline Jolie, who plays the mom, Christine Collins, endures with the LAPD, and all of the unethical and illegal actions taken against her as she tries to prove the LAPD has not found her child. The other is about the true perpitrators of the crime and the activities happening in the chicken coops in Wineville, CA. Angelina's performance is very good, if not, at times, overdramatic, which doesn't seem all that unusual given the subject matter and her role in it. However, what absolutely kills this movie is the directing. Like I've said recently, I just don't understand Hollywood. When is someone going to tell Clint Eastwood that he is a piss poor director?? I read an interview with JMS, who said that he wrote one major draft of this movie. And the only element he had to change was an incorrect reference about Scrabble, which this movie pre-dates by a couple of years. Other than that, he asked Eastwood about rewrites. Clint's response? No...the draft is fine as it is. Let's just shoot the draft. I'm convinced this is how he operates all the time. Now, admittedly, I have not seen Million Dollar Baby. And I've been told I would think differently if I saw it. And I did like Flags of our Fathers and I love High Plains Drifter. However, the list of bad, overrated Clint Eastwood films can wallpaper my bedroom. Mystic River? Space Cowboys? Bridges of Madison County? Unforgiven? Pale Rider? Firefox? Bronco Billy? My God...all horrible movies. The common theme in all of these films, however, is slow, painful pacing. Now, it worked in High Plains Drifter. Very well. In fact, the pacing is probably very good for most Westerns, even though Unforgiven and Pale Rider are two of the worst Westerns I've ever seen. In any case, his slow, drawn-out pacing in his movies can only be appropriate if the story lends itself to that pacing. Unfortunately, most of them don't. Changeling is no different. The subject matter is clearly very interesting. The actors perform very well, including an underrated performance by Jason Butler Harner as the main criminal, Gordon Northcott. Cinematically, the scenes are beautiful as well, with an almost black-and-white feel, even though it's in color. The problem is the pacing. Eastwood should have rewritten several scenes. Some were unnecessarily long. Some were unnecessary period. The movie was way longer than it needed to be and felt every minute as long. It should have been restructured as well as there were numerous times that the story felt as though it were ending, but then it wouldn't. There was a point at the very end when the Eastwood explains in succinct, printed words a short epilogue of what happens to the characters years later. What I couldn't help but think, especially after finding out that there were several pieces of history left out of the epilogue, as well as the movie itself, is that the movie could have ended about 45 minutes early and most of the later scenes summarized in the same epilogue. It's almost as though Clint's slow, soft-spoken demeanor is related to the pace at which he thinks, and therefore shows up in his slowly-paced films. The story is an interesting one though, but I would definitely recommend supplementing the mediocre film with additional research on the Internet.",

His disappearance created a lot of bad publicity for the Los Angeles police who were suffering in the press for a host of corruption issues.  Anxious to make the case go away, they leaped on a runaway boy found in Illinois who claimed to be Walter Collins under questioning.  They brought him to Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), who immediately denied that this was her son.  Police Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) browbeat her into \"trying him out for a few days\".  Of course this was not Walter Collins, and as the evidence mounted, Christine Collins returned to the police with a ton of physical evidence, only to find herself committed to a mental hospital for being difficult.  Clint Eastwood sculpts a decent, workmanlike film that gets a lot of mileage out of the infuriating outrage that this incident generates in any viewer and from good performances from a cast that also includes John Malkovich, Amy Ryan and Colm Feore.  It's a tad too long, dealing with additional subplots that seem eminently droppable.  The film was originally set to be directed by Ron Howard, which I think provides a perfect illustration of what the film's like.",

Clint Eastwood gets everything into this tight direction.  Angelina Jolie appears perfectly suited to play a victim of the sanitoriums of the roarin' '20's and her performance as a devastated mother makes her appear suited for motherhood and capable of caring for six children of her own.  I mean, this was before her six children I think, but anyway I was convinced.  John Malkovich seems oddly placed as a religious leader until he begins speaking on his pulpit against corruption, and later as a supporter of Collin's defense.  Jefferey Donovon's sleazy police captain is both hard-boiled as a performance and vile as a character.  J.M. Straczynski's plotting is elaborate.  Corruption, abusive authority, poor objective scientific application, manipulating truth, and sexism are all social norms in the Los Angeles town in the roaring '20's.  In this film, the authority figures seem to have dehumanized themselves in favor of a well-oiled mechanistic society and with their abusive manipulation of public opinion.  Anyone with power is hard and obtuse to anyone else's difficulties, while humane treatment and empathy are simply absent to those who've built their fortresses of power and dominance.  And if that wasn't enough, true sociopathy is revealed in a serial killer whose demise is rooted in corporal punishment brought over from the Nineteenth Century.  I mean, it's well worth the watch, even if it may have a plot hole.",

            "content": "What makes \"Changeling\" such a profoundly affecting film is the fact that its shades of outrage feel real.  It is based on a true crime(s), but there are no moments of biographical movie artifice - it's so unabashedly grim one could swear that the sun is a front for the underlying wickedness of the universe.  It tells the too-awful-to-be-true story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a 1920s-era working mother who faces her worst nightmare when her nine-year-old son (Gattlin Griffith) vanishes into thin air after she covers a late-night shift.\n\tEmotionally stunted and empty, she does everything she can to eventually hold him in her arms once again - and after months of relentless searching, the police find him in middle-of-nowhere Illinois.  One problem: it isn't her son.  This boy is three inches shorter, pudgier around the face, and is circumcised.  His teacher and dentist can vouch for her.  But the LAPD, being the corrupt beating heart of the city, insists it is.  The best medical professionals identified him themselves, they say as if a mother knowing what her son looks and sounds like is a completely absurd notion.  Christine simply wants her son back - and so she continues fighting for him, despite a mind-boggling police ordered mental hospital lockup.\n\tIt's clear that the LAPD knows the kid isn't hers, but, being the fraudulent public service it is, continues to stay stubborn with the objective of attempting to fix their tarnished reputation.  So imagine their panic when one of the few and far between good detectives, Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly), takes the word of a confessor and discovers the bodies of several young boys in Wineville, CA, a crime scene that could be related to the disappearance.\n\t\"Changeling\" is long at 141 minutes, but its ability to turn juicier and juicier at every turn makes it compulsively watchable, sometimes slow but never unrewarding.  Some critics have shunned its fascinating storytelling abilities due to its lack of nuance - but \"Changeling\" is a movie about story, performance, and direction; it wants to compel, and that's what it does.  Directed and scored by Clint Eastwood with one eye on metallically shaded period style and emotional subtlety, it's cold but not oppressively so.  \"Changeling\" lives in a world where the sun doesn't shine, where justice needs to be served but comes at an aggravatingly slow pace.  Eastwood sees where the story could deviate into various Lifetime movie directions and thankfully stays close to Christine Collins's story, giving needed side-plot a spotlight only when the plot really and truly needs it.  \n\tAngelina Jolie gives one of her greatest performances as a mother driven by pain but not blinded by it.  She, plain and simply, wants her son back, but doesn't lose her mind in the face of the maddening self-interest of the police.  In another film, she might have suddenly ceased to becoming a victim of circumstance and turn into a powerhouse of revenge - but Straczynski's screenplay never loses sight of the woman she was.  The closing credits assure us that Collins never stopped looking for her child; that's all she ever wanted to do, and if the LAPD hadn't been so worried about themselves, the possibility of reunion could have held potential.\n\t\"Changeling\" rides high on its outrage yet never loses sight of the Collins tragedy.  Its mission to tell a story instead of a heavily cinematic one is impressive, and the combination of Eastwood and Jolie's careful judgements make it all the more consuming.",

            "content": "The strategic February release and shameless touting for Oscar honours with unnecessary subliminally self-promoting scene insinuates that Changeling, directed by Clint Eastwood should be a shoe-in to sweep the Academy Awards, However does it really deserve it? \n\nFilms based on true stories have predetermined burdens to carry; portraying the truth of the situation as it happened, entertaining to audiences whilst being set in a particular time and having the ability to emotionally connect with viewers. Changeling is merely more than adequate on all of these fronts. \n\nChristine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a roller-skating telephone exchange supervisor in 1920's Los Angeles. After shifts, the single mother returns to her small-town home and her quietly independent nine year old son Walter (Gatlin Griffith).\n\nAfter promising Walter a day at the pictures, Christine is called to fill in a shift. Upon her return Walter is missing, as all mothers would, Christine calls the (less than helpful) Police Department for assistance. \n\nDuring a time of police brutality, corruption and laziness, Captain J.J Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) heads the police investigation to find Christine's son. After five months of no progression, bad publicity and claims of a failing system, a child (Devon Conti) surfaces across the country who claims to be Walter. \n\nCaptain Jones needing the child to help settle rumours brings him to LA in an attempt to reunite him with his relieved mother. However, standing on the platform in front of all the press, what should be a joyous moment for Christine, turns to sour when the boy produced is obviously not her son. \n\nWhen Christine unequivocally states that the child is not her son, Jones manipulates the distraught mother and states \"take him home on a trial basis, see how it goes, he has nowhere else to go\" and like any other mother, Christine accepts to take the boy.\n\nNo matter that Walter is now three inches shorter than when he left (five months prior), he does not know the basics of his life and he is now circumcised; the police and Captain Jones continue to bully Christine and try to force her into submission. \n\nChristine finally reaches a point where she can no longer tolerate and self-deceit and helped by a crusading radio evangelist, Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich) she decides to make her case public.\n\nAt this point the film shifts focus, moving from every mother's greatest fear to a horrific nightmare. After Christine's tell all to the press, she is rewarded for her insubordination and is secretly whisked off into a mental hospital for a D12 admittance; a term used for women who have fallen foul of the LAPD. \n\nSurrounded by unyielding matrons and doctors with their own agendas, Christine continues to wail her stance \"I want my son back\" and for her troubles is hooked up in readiness for electric-shock treatment. \n\nAt this late stage (over an hour into the 2  1/2 hour film) a second plot line begins to emerge, offering a new explanation to the location of the Christine's true son. At the same time as Walters disappearance there was a case brought forth on one Gordon Northcott known as 'the chicken coop killer'. Although at the time there was never any solid evidence linking the two cases, this is the path the movie inevitably follows.\n\nDespite its harrowing subject matter; Changeling is utterly unmoving and fails to truly connect with viewers. Eastwood's overdone style is too classical and too restrained to get inside his characters; they feel like well-costumed under directed showroom mannequins. \n\nStrangely trying to reincarnate the success of A mighty heart, Angelina Jolie brings all her superstar-wattage to a role that commands the admiration of a benchmark piece but doesn't have the staying power. Although she is stunning and the use of colour in her lips gives a strong timeline to the film, she does fall short of expectation. \n\nThe only acting light is shed by the truly talented Malkovich. Leaving his indelible mark, shining clearly through the uncultured professionalism of his TV cop style co-stars and after school special amateur drama child actors. Whether paedophiles or crooked cops the so-called baddies were woefully bad, leaving little scope for ambiguity or suspense.\n\nThe Verdict: With a mood of stateliness bordering on the sleep-inducing leaves audiences cold even in last week's unusual heat wave. Although a solid B movie, any kind of Oscar recognition for it would be a serious mistake.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 13/02/2009",

            "content": "I've been a fan of J. Michael Straczynski for many years.  It's been impressive to see him make the leap from comic books to books, television, movies, etc.  I see Neil Gaiman following very quickly in his footsteps.  That being said, I was quite surprised to see JMS migrate out of his sci-fi genre into a historical film about a very odd criminal case from the late 1920's, more commonly referred to as the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders. \n\nYears ago, a contact with Los Angeles County called JMS and told him that the county was about to go through a house cleaning and destroy some documents on a strange case in which JMS might be interested.  Those documents, after years of development, resulted in Clint Eastwood's Changeling.\n\nWhile being an interesting niche story about a single, working woman in the late 1920s who, out of need, must leave her son home alone every day while she works.  One day she comes home to find her son missing.  After weeks of no progress by the oft-criticized, corrupt LAPD, she gets a call saying that her son has been found.  Once reunited with her son, she realizes that this child is not hers.  Only the LAPD, needing to save face, make her think she's crazy for thinking he isn't her child. \n\nThe story then follows two different paths that eventually converge.  One is the fight Angeline Jolie, who plays the mom, Christine Collins, endures with the LAPD, and all of the unethical and illegal actions taken against her as she tries to prove the LAPD has not found her child.  The other is about the true perpitrators of the crime and the activities happening in the chicken coops in Wineville, CA.\n\nAngelina's performance is very good, if not, at times, overdramatic, which doesn't seem all that unusual given the subject matter and her role in it.  However, what absolutely kills this movie is the directing.  Like I've said recently, I just don't understand Hollywood.  When is someone going to tell Clint Eastwood that he is a piss poor director??\n\nI read an interview with JMS, who said that he wrote one major draft of this movie.  And the only element he had to change was an incorrect reference about Scrabble, which this movie pre-dates by a couple of years.  Other than that, he asked Eastwood about rewrites.  Clint's response?  No...the draft is fine as it is.  Let's just shoot the draft.\n\nI'm convinced this is how he operates all the time.\n\nNow, admittedly, I have not seen Million Dollar Baby.  And I've been told I would think differently if I saw it.  And I did like Flags of our Fathers and I love High Plains Drifter.  However, the list of bad, overrated Clint Eastwood films can wallpaper my bedroom.\n\nMystic River?  Space Cowboys?  Bridges of Madison County?  Unforgiven?  Pale Rider?  Firefox?  Bronco Billy?  My God...all horrible movies. \n\nThe common theme in all of these films, however, is slow, painful pacing.  Now, it worked in High Plains Drifter.  Very well.  In fact, the pacing is probably very good for most Westerns, even though Unforgiven and Pale Rider are two of the worst Westerns I've ever seen.  In any case, his slow, drawn-out pacing in his movies can only be appropriate if the story lends itself to that pacing.  Unfortunately, most of them don't. \n\nChangeling is no different.\n\nThe subject matter is clearly very interesting.  The actors perform very well, including an underrated performance by Jason Butler Harner as the main criminal, Gordon Northcott.  Cinematically, the scenes are beautiful as well, with an almost black-and-white feel, even though it's in color.  The problem is the pacing. \n\nEastwood should have rewritten several scenes.  Some were unnecessarily long.  Some were unnecessary period.  The movie was way longer than it needed to be and felt every minute as long.  It should have been restructured as well as there were numerous times that the story felt as though it were ending, but then it wouldn't. \n\nThere was a point at the very end when the Eastwood explains in succinct, printed words a short epilogue of what happens to the characters years later.  What I couldn't help but think, especially after finding out that there were several pieces of history left out of the epilogue, as well as the movie itself, is that the movie could have ended about 45 minutes early and most of the later scenes summarized in the same epilogue.  It's almost as though Clint's slow, soft-spoken demeanor is related to the pace at which he thinks, and therefore shows up in his slowly-paced films. \n\nThe story is an interesting one though, but I would definitely recommend supplementing the mediocre film with additional research on the Internet.",

            "content": "Changeling is a harrow and haunting film based on a true story. Angelina Jolie is phenomenal and I have to say I'm really beginning to gain respect for her. Changeling is based on the true 1928 kidnapping case of nine year old Walter Collins. Angelina Jolie plays Walter's distraught mother Christine. The film portrays a mother's battle to find her son and how the corrupt Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) don't do their job properly and hand her a child who is not her's and accuse of her being mentally ill because they do not want to be made fools of. Changeling is a very gritty and dark film and by no means a light watch. Clint Eastwood did a good job with this movie; the cinematography is excellent and really captures the essence of the time. \r\n\r\nChangeling is a powerful and gripping thriller and drama. It's also a subject that remains relevant today with all the child kidnapping and murder cases that still go on. This is probably a film that parents can really emphasize with. As gut wrenchingly sad and horrifying this film is it's also quite empowering as Christine battles to overthrow the unjust and merciless Los Angeles Police Department with the help of reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who often criticized the unjust police department on his radio show. John Malkovich too gives a good performance (you've just got to love John Malkovich's voice) as does Jeffrey Donovan who pays chief of the police department. Unfortunately abuse of power in authoritative positions is something that still exists, but this highlights it at it's most extreme. The Los Angeles Police Department was also hugely sexist and threw the women who questioned them into mental institutes.\r\n\r\nWhilst Changeling is a powerful and haunting film it's one that is hard to enjoy because of it's dark context. It's very bold and graphic in it's depictions of the horrors that went on such as the kidnapping and murder of the boys of the Chicken Coop Kidnapping and Murder case, which Walter Collins was part of. This is a very harrowing watch, so those who get upset easily should prepare themselves if they want to see this. I completely respect this film for it's poignancy and realness, but it was too heavy for me. It also brings home the horrifying reality that there are some truly sick and twisted people in the world like the chicken coop killer, Gordon Northcott played brilliantly by Jason Butler Harner, who is truly chilling to watch and sadistic. This is a film that you have to watch at least once.\r\n\r\nGrade: A-/B+",

            "content": "Directed by Clint Eastwood and scoring Angelina Jolie an Academy Award nomination, Changeling sounded like it would be an interesting film.\n\nChangeling consistently goes back and forth between the focus of protagonist Christie Collins suffering at the loss of her son and the penalties she faces afterwards and the focus of J.J. Jones and how he is dealing with her and the kidnapping of her child. The story manages to focus on both aspects of the story well and points out how they each contribute to the context of the story, but it means that the film is focused on the middle picture. The film does not focus on the characters and particularly how Christie Collins suffers as a result of the events in the story which means that whatever depth in the film comes from the performance of Angeline Jolie in the role, yet the film does not focus on the bigger picture either and therefore has little relevance to how these events affected the exterior town. It ends up focusing essentially on two central characters without focusing enough to get into the depth of their minds, and so it demans a lot from the actors without supplying them the best script. The language in the film is fine, the script just doesn't supply the most deep characters to the film despite the grim nature of its subject matter.\nBut aside from not being as deep as it could have, Changeling was a powerful film. The drama of the film was exceptional because of the way that it balanced focus on an oppressed woman in society dealing with the loss of her son against corrupt officials abusing their power to silence her and lie to the public. It is a kind of drama that I have seen touched upon before but never to such a complicated extent. Changeling explains how the corrupt authorities damaged individual people so harshly, particularly women who were forcibly silenced when attempting to make a change. Changeling strongly depicts the suffering and heroism of Christie Collins within an unfair society, and the pure strength of the drama is powerful because it easily depicts the harsh reality of the situation. Clint Eastwood injects a powerful atmosphere into the film to depict the nihilistic nature of society and the careless nature of the authorities in the story of Christie Collins which leaves audiences with answers about society and yet with more questions about the story. Changeling raises a lot of points and explains them well with a strongly crafted script, and so it is a powerful example of storytelling from director Clint Eastwood who proves time and time again to be able to handle the emotional power of a story with true tenacity as a filmmaker.\nVisually, Changeling is terrific. Capturing the time setting of 1928 Los Angeles, Changeling is full of convincing scenery and a strong production design which reinforces the nature of the time setting and the location of the film. The costumes the characters wear also reinforce this and give viewers a sense of the time which feels very legitimate, and it is all captured with very nice cinematography. The visual plane of the film has a certain feel of monochromatic grey to it on a consistent basis which establishes a grim feel. But the most powerful aspect of the film is the leading performance of Angelina Jolie.\nAngelina Jolie has never given a more powerful performance than her leading role in Changeling. I consider her a bit over an overrated actress, but I found a new level of respect for her after witnessing the endeavour of her acting skills in Changeling. Angelina Jolie involves herself deeply with her role in Changeling and makes a very sympathetic figure for the lead part which is very admirable as she projects a lot of powerful vulnerability which means that the emotional power of the film ends up striking. Her performance is exceptional and is so firm with how it deals with the powerfully hard hitting nature of the story that it is difficult to walk away from Changeling having not been mesmerized. She perfectly fits the profile of the 1920's setting because she has a face which matches the style of beauty that was popular in the time, and she goes into the role with serious depth. Angelina Jolie captures the frailty of her character with physical acting to exceptional extents and she delivers her lines with such emotional power that it is pretty shocking. Angelina Jolie gives a performance of clear Academy Award calibre in Changeling and it is so amazing that it is hard to walk away from it not feeling the pure strength that is the endeavour of her acting talents.\nJeffrey Donovan is also terrific. In a nice change of pace from his performance as Michael Westen in Burn Notice, Jeffrey Donovan takes on the leading role as corrupt police officer J.J. Jones in Changeling which has him turn in another powerful performance. The thing is that Jeffrey Donovan keeps his performance strong by consistently maintaining a level of sophisticated professionalism in the part and he rarely lets his emotions get the best of him because as a police captain he cannot let his own personal bias affect how people see him. Jeffrey Donovan takes on the part well because he never directly expresses an antagonistic nature in the role and it therefore makes him a manipulative figure. Jeffrey Donovan is a great casting decision in Changeling.\nJohn Malkovich also turns in a powerful supporting performance by putting his natural charm and determination into their part. Jason Butler Harner does a tense job as well, and Amy Ryan shares some strong scenes with Angelina Jolie.\n\nSo despite the fact that Changeling goes for the middle ground and does not end up as deep as it could have been, it is a powerfully grim film which benefits from tense direction from Clint Eastwood as well as an amazing leading performance from Angelina Jolie in the best work of her career.",

She fights the city to find her missing son with the help of an ally in activist Reverend Gustav Briegleb played by John Malkovich who is also looking for his missing son. I remember watching this movie a long time ago and I was amazed at how dark this movie was. Sometimes it can be difficult for a parent to lose their child and they search the world for them. But in other lives especially nowadays, it is different. Parents tend to not care about their children's lives and laugh in their faces thinking their dreams will never come true which is what causes them to run away in the first place.

            "content": "The Los Angeles Police Department was considered to be corrupt and incompetent in 1928. The police thought they'd scored a public relations coup when they found a 9-year-old boy who'd been missing for over 5 months. But the boy's mother, Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) said the boy they found wasn't her son. She made this claim so often, the police locked her up in a psychiatric ward, without a warrant or court order. This Clint Eastwood-directed film dramatizes this true story, which is bound up with that of a serial killer who may have abducted and killed the Christine's real son, along with several other boys.\nThis period film unravels the various threads slowly. This is a mystery and a police procedural, except some of the police procedures are brutal and misogynistic. Jolie gives an excellent performance as the working-class but intelligent mother who only wants to know where her real son is. The introduction of the serial killer sub-plot seemed a bit obvious and contrived (as a phone call to the police station while Christine is there to ask once again for the police to continue searching for her son). But the two plots are connected; as one of the DVD's special features said, if this story weren't true, you'd never believe it.\nThis is a long and slow-paced film driven mainly by dialogue. It is riveting and well-made, but some may find it overlong and slow. The performances and the look and feel all feel authentic to the period.\nIn a modern era of revelations about government surveillance and abuse of power, this story tells us that, perhaps, this is nothing new. People in positions of power will often abuse that power to retain it. And they'll convince themselves they're doing it for our benefit. Collins shows us, however, that, perhaps with a little help from influential supporters, abusers will eventually have to face the the fact that they cannot alter the truth forever.",

            "content": "This movie was captivating with great acting performance by Angelina Jolle.  The plot is taken from early history of Los Angeles, in which a woman Christine Collins says goodbye one day to her son, Walter, never to see him again.  This kind of story involving a child's disappearance naturally attracts most people's attention.  An added plus is that Angelina Jolie plays the mother and it is based on a true story.  Clint Eastwood goes to great length to make the setting right for 1928 LA.  You see the cars of that era, clothing fits perfectly and the buildings are definitely those from 1928 Los Angeles.  The fact that Christine Collins is treated so badly by LA Police Department and in fact thrown into a mental institution adds to an already stressful situation.  Some may dismiss this drama and refuse to believe that this actually happened.  Perhaps these people need to refer to their history books, especially about LA's history.  Their history is full of controversy, prejudice and racism.  Anyone familiar with this, would have no trouble believing this story.  All in all, Eastwood does an excellent job as always in casting the characters, perfecting the setting and the general mood of the movie.",

I can't fathom the amount of corruption and utter disgust in which the LAPD handled this situation. I can't imagine how a simple filmmaker like Clint Eastwood, the producer and director of the film, can transport me into the world of the late 1920s so flawlessly. Clint Eastwood is also the composer of the film, by the way. What? Clint Eastwood can write music? Apparantly.\r\n\r\nThe story is so touching and so unbelievable. A single mother, Christine Collins(Angelina Jolie in a breathtaking performance), comes home from work one day to find her son missing. When she calls the police, they tell her to wait 24 hours to see if he comes back. When he still doesn't, she calls again. The police begin an investigation and manipulate a young boy to pretend to be Collins' son in order to make it seem as if the LAPD is getting something good accomplished. They live off of the press, and the returning of a lost boy would most certainly erase the corruption they've been excersizing. Christine claims that the boy is not her son, and the LAPD does everything in their power to try to convince the public that it is her son, they go so far as to throw her into an insane asylum.\r\n\r\nIt gets worse, but I'll leave it to the film to explain what happens next. This story is amazing and should be told. It is every bit relevant to us today to look back at the past and examine what we want for our future. Clint Eastwood is a master filmmaker and this one is no exception. The pacing and editing are tightly wound, and the narrative is close to perfection. The performances are also great, by the way. Angelina Jolie is fascinating in the leading spot. Not at one single point in the film did I ever think of her as Angelina Jolie. She is a total embodiement of the character, and she deserves an Oscar nod. Malkovich is also good, and a stand out performance comes from Jason Butler Harner as Gordon Northcott.\r\n\r\nThe film is conceived as a film from the late 20s mixed with the films of today. Modern day philosophy(in one particular scene, a woman has this to say about the LAPD: \"Fuck them, and the horse the rode in on.\" When Christine tells her that that isn't proper language, the woman says, \"There are times when that's exactly the right language.\" Later, Christine uses the same phrase.) combined with conventional filmmaking of old. Critics will undoubtedly be hard on the film for using conventional techniques, but is there really any other way to tell this story? If it had been the least bit stylized, it would have ruined the emotional dexterity and narrative integrity of the film.\r\n\r\nI applaud the efforts of Eastwood to bring this story to life, and I hope to see the film again. If the Academy had any sort of a brain, they would nominate the film for Best Picture. However, since the Academy does not have any sort of a brain, the film will not be nominated. I could be wrong. There's a great moment in the film when Christine and her co-workers are placing bets over which film will win Best Picture. Every one else says 'Cleopatra'. Christine says, \"Overrated. 'It Happened One Night' will win; Clark Gabele, Claudette Colbert, what more can I say?\" 'It Happened One Night' ends up winning the prize. Let's hope this film follows suite.",

With the exception of Jack the Ripper (who was from an entirely different continent and belonged to a much earlier time-line), I'm sure Mr. Northcott's crime was still pretty shocking, if not unheard of for that era. But what is just as disturbing was the atrocities committed by the L.A.P.D. against Christine Collins and the other women who had the guts to question their actions (or in Christine's case inaction) and lodge a complaint against their incompetence. I think, I'm starting to like Clint Eastwood as a director more than an actor because I've seen a lot of his old Spaghetti Westerns and frankly, I don't see the attraction for that genre of film. But I've watched a lot of Mr. Eastwood's directorial projects like \"Million-Dollar Baby\", \"Mystic River\", \"Gran Torino\", \"Absolute Power\", \"Hereafter\" and \"Midnight At The Garden of Good and Evil\" and I can safely state that I like his directing style much better. I love Angelina Jolie, but as an actress, she's hit or miss for me. She's perfect for action roles like as \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\", \"Salt\", \"The Tourist\" or \"Wanted\" and can be cool in odd films like \"Hackers\" or \"Girl Interrupted\" but I also remember that God-awful performance in the period drama \"Alexander\".  Fortunately, this film wasn't like \"Alexander\" but although \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" either, she still gave a pretty good and convincing performance. I loved Jason Butler Harner portrayal of Gordon Northcott, chilling an truly creepy, but as much as I love John Malkovich, he was an odd choice for the role of Rev. Gustav Briegleb and I quite honestly feel was a miscast. I kept waiting for him to do something goofy for some reason. But overall, this was a pretty cool movie, beautifully directed, good actors and incredible story.",

Beautifully directed by Eastwood the period is captured perfectly, and the cast is strong - all providing emotional and believable performances. My one niggling criticism of this film is in the opening titles - a true story appears on the screen- well maybe Eastwood should have gone with 'based on a true story' as some of the facts have been changed/ ommitted from the real life case.\n\nApart from that I was completely engrossed in this story, the injustice and heart breaking insanity of the whole situation. A good drinking game would be to have a shot every time Jolie screams 'he is not my son!\" You'd get pretty smashed by the end :) \n\nDefinitely worth checking out, kept me hooked til the end.",

The LA Police are corrupt but we don't understand why they take the stance they did in the Court of Public Opinion.

Your gonna know its powerful by the prediction and your right it is. Changeling is shocking an a film that we never saw from director , producer Eastwood and a performance that Jolie has never done before. The Fact is this movie is about a mother ( Angelina Jolie) an her son is missing. but then the police find the assumed boy Walter Collins then is not him. Mr. Eastwood tells stories that are sort over ratted like (Million Dollar Baby) also Eastwood knows  the exactly how to create amazing movie he may not know if people or critics  may like it or not but he does have an earn a film makers eye thats something  that talent director earns. Grade A+. MY ADVISE TO MR. EAST WOOD IS KEEP DIRECTING MORE EXCITING MOVIES DO NOT LET ME DOWN !",

Partly based on a true case that took place about a hundred years ago, the film is loaded with feelings that are difficult to digest and absorb. SkillfullyI confess that I was not expecting this film to be so interesting. It's truly awesome. Partly based on a true case that took place about a hundred years ago, the film is loaded with feelings that are difficult to digest and absorb. Skillfully directed by Clint Eastwood, who once again presents us with a piece of great technical quality and good dramatic sense, the film is absolutely memorable.The script is the main strength of the film, and it's really worth highlighting. I think it is really difficult to remain indifferent to a story so fraught with suffering and where the police are so deserving of censorship. The whole story revolves around the disappearance of a child and the incessant search for its mother, against all expectations and against the will of the authorities themselves, who presented a child to her as their child and never took it seriously when the mother said not to be the right child. It is a well-written and skillfully developed script.Another aspect that deserves positive mention is the colossal and talented work of Angelina Jolie in the main role. She has, on several occasions, already shown us her talent, this is nothing new, but it is always pleasant to see a great actress giving us another excellent performance. Here, the actress was perfectly able to clearly express that mother's mental anguish and psychological torture. In addition, the film also has an excellent contribution from John Malkovich, in the role of a religious pastor who is determined to help that mother by seeing her as a victim of arrogant and cruel police, and Colm Feore, in the role of the Police commander, ultimately responsible for their mistakes and negligence.Technically, it's a film that has excellent production values. The film is not long and the pace is excellent, allowing each point of the plot to get its best development. Being a period film, the sets and costumes take on greater relevance, and were excellent in the task of contextualizing the audience and the story in time and space. Finally, a word of appreciation for the great soundtrack.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAngelina Jolie gives a good performance in this movie as the rightfully upset and very frustrated Christine Collins, who is determined to find her son and highlight how crooked the LAPD is/was. This movie is apparently based on a true story set in the late 1920s and it certainly puts a chill down your spine to see the sorts of things that went on, with the LAPDs treatment of women. Its a reflection of the times in terms of sexism in a more general way as well, I feel, not just in relation to the LAPD specifically but obviously back then women had less rights and men would probably think less of them than now, things weren't as equal for the sexes as they are now. Its quite disturbing to see the scenes set in the psych ward and to learn what we learn - certainly the term abuse of power is valid and indeed its the main theme present in this movie. I think Christine is, in a way, a hero figure, certainly to other women, who will likely be able to identify with her, especially mothers and single mothers - to go through the trauma of losing your only child is clearly a very upsetting and worrying ordeal but to be presented, months after the disappearance, with a child who your sure isn't your own flesh and blood, although the authorities won't take this and do everything in their power to persuade you otherwise - well, you can only imagine what that must be like - very troubling and frustrating. I found myself quite engrossed in this movie, sharing many of Christine's emotions, willing her to get to the bottom of what happened to her beloved son Walter while also learning with her about whats going on behind the scenes, so to speak and it was quite satisfying to see how some members of the community reacted to her plight, agreeing to help her on her mission to prove the child she'd been assured is hers, is in no way related to her. This is no mean feat and as the plot unravels, is quite shocking, disturbing even to see how far those in authority go to prove to Christine that she's wrong and given the fact that this movie claims to be based on a true story, its sad to think that such things may have happened. This is, of course, quite a dark movie and there are some scenes which make for uncomfortable viewing, including one of a person being hanged which was quite disturbing (I always thought that death was immediate from hanging but apparently not - yes, its not nice to watch) and one or two sudden flashback scenes as well. To be honest, the themes present are probably more disturbing than said scenes but I thought its worth mentioning all the same.The movie is quite long, at around about 2 hours and 20 minutes and I think it was perhaps a bit long drawn out, although on the other hand if it were cut back more than by perhaps 15 minutes or so, it may seem a bit convenient and rushed - still the story moves fairly slowly and if you rely on action and visual effects to keep you from being distracted then this might be an issue for you, not that you should expect such things from a movie like this but again, its perhaps worth mentioning. I also felt that the story was a bit unclear in one or two parts, though things became clearer later on, however I should probably admit that I had an issue with the DVD being scratched and a few times it would refuse to play and I'd have to skip the affected part on the disk so that was probably part to blame, I missed probably 10 mins max. of the movie but then in a way it was good for me as the movie ended a bit earlier than I expected overall - I still saw the majority of it and I feel I can still review it well enough. I haven't mentioned the ending yet, so I'll mention it now. I imagine that the ending divided opinon - I suppose its not dreadfully bleak yet its not fully a Hollywood ending either, in that the viewer is left with unanswered questions - even though there's an update of sorts written across the scene just before the credits roll. Ultimately, its up to you as the viewer to come to your own conclusions about certain aspects but I thought it was nice that the ending mentions what became of some characters (I suppose thats the more 'Hollywood' aspect of it).I'd recommend this movie, as I found myself quite engrossed in the story and I thought that the main character, Christine, was well portrayed and the fact that it is, apparently, based on a true story, in a way the themes present are really quite important, the messages at play are ones that people should be aware of even in the present day and for other women, it definitely makes you think about how women were perhaps perceived in the past, almost 100 years ago and the progress thats been made - although Christine was perhaps doing well as a successful businesswomen in the late 1920s which was quite possibly not often the case for women back then, the way that her actions were downplayed and perceived, it is disturbing.",

No-one is on her level per se, but there are very good performances from the likes of John Malkovich, Michael Kelly, Jeffrey Donovan and Geoff Pierson; kid actor Eddie Alderson also impresses.I will say that the story wraps up in a quicker manner than I thought it would, though the pacing of the 142 minute run time is in fact one of its positives - even at that length, I feel it could've drawn out the court trial stuff longer; though that may have hindered the pacing, so it's not really a noteworthy criticism of mine at all.One worth recommending, no doubt!",
