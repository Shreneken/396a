            "content": "Korean cinema does it again. \"The Chaser\" is another great movie from the Korean film stable. The plot stems around an amoral ex-cop turned pimp who after losing some of his \"working girls\" decides to track down and find the client behind this. He ends up finding himself involved in more than he bargained for, with the client being a serial killer, and its then a chase to find his last girl sent to him whilst the police also try to pin him down but are hampered by legal red tape and politics.As you'd expect from a Korean film from the cop thriller genre it can be very violent, and there's no denying that for this film, however thankfully it doesn't overshadow the rest of the movie. The chase is on, and the roller coaster of emotions following the pimp and the cops trying to stop the serial killer is nothing less than gripping, watching them go from one success to despair in short spaces of time. The tension is high and will tug on you right to the end.Importantly there is a lot of humour. The main character (Joong-ho Eom) is incredibly dry-witted, and is a release valve for the tension in the film. As he carries the film, the acting is important, and both he and the serial killer are exceptionally good. Can't argue with either or even the general ensemble.There is possibly an American re-make in the offing. Fair enough I guess as that's become the norm now, but I hope it doesn't dilute the central story or the action. This film is a great gem, and follows on from some of the other greats in the genre such as \"Memories of a Murder\" which is a classic. It will unsettle but for an intelligent thriller, it really is up there with the best in the past few years.",

I fully stand behind this, because this was one of the best movies I've watched this year (at the Fright Fest in London).There's only a little thing that you should bare in mind: If you actually don't like Korean (or Asian movies for that matter), than this won't be for you. Especially if you like your movies to be according to a somewhat linear structure. While with other movies of this nature, you might foresee things happening, I was baffled (in a good way) with the directions this movie took. Very brave choices and a great script. The actors of course are phenomenal too. It all fits together in one whole perfect piece. If you like your thrillers to be ... well thrilling, than this is the one to watch!",

He goes on the chase to find this guy and put an end to his missing girls...and missing money. What begins to unfold is something him, the police or anyone for that matter, were unprepared to take on. Time and time again the film-makers from South Korea succeed and The Chaser is no different. With believable writing, fantastic acting (especially the lead who reminded me of Min Sik Choi) and an air of originality, Chaser easily became one of my favorite flicks of 2008. With side-stories aplenty, an evil villain and some brutal violence this is something any fan of darker film should enjoy.If you enjoy serious drama, investigation films, serial killers, great acting, you'll definitely enjoy this picture. I just wished they had a different title for the film. I like my title better. :)",

            "content": "What a movie. When I rented this movie I didn't know what to expect. It is usually is a hit or miss for Korean movies but this was a grand slam out of the park type of movie. The film is about a former detective turn pimp trying to catch a serial killer who is killing his prostitutes. It's a big cat and mouse game between the two throughout the whole movie. The plot sounds thin but there is so much more than what meets the eye. This is one of the best thriller/serial killer movies I have ever seen and I don't want to say too much about the plot because it is very edge of your seat kind of stuff. The film never drags and it becomes more intriguing the more you watch and you feel like you know the character because the actors portray them so well. This is a very violent and gruesome film that shouldn't be viewed by the squeamish even though there isn't that many bloody scenes for being a serial killer movie. The movie achieves so much more with less, which hardly ever works in films that need violence to be a success. I wish that Hollywood or even European films would have the brass to make a film this unique and daring at the same time. The thing that this film has going for it the most is that it's wonderfully erratic. You can never guess what is going to happen next and that is the reason why Korean movies are so fantastically entertaining. I rank this movie in my top three greatest thriller/serial killer movies of all time somewhere between \"Seven\" and \"Silence of the Lambs\". The characters of this film really flesh out the story and let you jump right in. I can't help but stress the point that this film is very unpredictable and the style of the story telling is subtle but very effective. This film is a sure bet and you will not leave disappointed.",

He killed girls with hammer, chisel and amputated the victims. Some of them were cannibalized. He mashed victim's liver with food processors and drank it. Now the serial killer is sentenced to death and his existence throw serious questions about execution of death sentenced prisoner to the Korean society. For ten years Korean government never executed prisoners and now UN approved Korea as a No Execution country.This movie is a product of these social circumstance. Of course any modernized country can have notorious serial killers. But this is most brutal and abominable criminal act as reported to the public.Another phenomena described in this movie are the inactive police act and ugly politician. Koreans are very disappointed at this and this movie is quite accurately visualized the situation.Whether or not crime is the best motif for movie and this movie successfully hold the breath of viewers.

This story of a detective-turned-pimp who decides to look into the disappearance of his prostitutes makes Seoul look like one gritty polity. All manner of nasty things take place throughout the movie, but none of it is gratuitous. Quite the opposite, everything is there to show the unpleasant existence that the characters lead. And boy are there some unpleasant things here! This movie has no place for subtlety.The movie reminded me of another South Korean crime drama that I saw recently: \"A Hard Day\". What I conclude is that the bottom half of the Korean peninsula turns out some of the most intense movies in the world (I suspect that the upper half only makes propaganda movies). There are lots of intense movies made throughout the world, but South Korea's crime dramas are possibly the most extreme. I doubt that you've seen anything like \"The Chaser\". I recommend it.",

            "review_title": "Suspenseful, thrilling and funny, S Korea is at it again",
            "content": "This film is so Korean. The way it is shot and the way the story is told doesn't conform to the way many Americans think genre clues should be presented and adhered to. At it's heart, The Chaser is a crime drama about a serial killer and the guy who's chasing him, but it evolves from many different angles. It's a comedy of errors in the way the police and politicians are portrayed; a melodrama with its inclusion of the precocious little girl who belongs to the woman serving as the film's primary \"chase\" and investigative point; a psychological thriller in the way the serial killer messes with the minds of the police; a mildly gory film in the way the bad guy uses a hammer and chisel; a bit of a tragedy in the way it ends. The only thing missing from this film is romance. Thank god they didn't make one of the missing girls a love interest of the pimp\u0097he's only after the money they owe him. That's where the brilliance of the chase begins.There's a fight scene early on where our protagonist, an ex-detective gone bad turned pimp, is beating the crap out of some guy he thinks has kidnapped and sold some of his girls. A long uphill foot chase precedes the brawl so both combatants are extremely winded when the fighting begins\u0097punches don't land and there's a girly incompetence to the whole thing, which is to say, it's realistic. After finally landing a few punches that subdue his opponent momentarily, the pimp gets up and starts kicking him in disgust. He's very angry, still a bit winded and out of control. One of his kicks only grazes its target causing him to lose his balance and fall on his butt, and because of momentum he begins to roll and his feet fly up in the air. It seems funny, but it's not. You have to sneak in your chuckle as he gets up and continues kicking the guy. When he's finally pummeled his adversary into unconsciousness, he uses his foot to roll him onto his side so he can get to the wallet in his back pocket and ID him. He attempts to sit on him, not to keep him down, but because he's bone tired from all the fighting. He doesn't land squarely and ends up rolling on his butt again. It seems funny but it's not.After the fight scene both men are brought to the police station for questioning. Because the pimp is an ex-detective with a reputation, the cops initially sympathize with the other guy, thinking the pimp over-reacted\u0097not to mention the causal fender-bender that brought the two men together in the first place. The pimp doesn't know that the other guy just took a hammer and chisel to the head of the girl he is trying to get back, he thinks she's just freshly been sold, making his sense of urgency misplaced, where it remains throughout most of the film. It's kind of awkward for the police to find much urgency in one pimp accusing another of stealing one of his girls. The bad guy insists he didn't sell the girl and then mumbles under his breathe \"I killed her\", and confesses in great detail how he killed her and several other girls. The pimp screams at the cops, \"Can't you see he's just pretending to be crazy now?\"And so it goes. We know there's been killing going on and we know who's been doing it from very early on in the film but it manages to remain suspenseful throughout. The Chaser is a gripping thriller from the beginning until a few minutes from the end. The two main characters are portrayed with impeccable nuance. It's Yun-seok Kim's performance as the bewildered pimp that takes this film to great heights. There are so many things that don't go the way he wants them to, like people hanging up on him when he's talking to them on the phone, a little girl who startles him and asks too many smart questions, the cops can't do anything right; and every time, his subdued response of confused disbelief made me laugh. He brings a Kang-ho Song-ish melancholy humor to the film, (I can't think of an American actor to compare him to), while Jung-woo Ha as the impotent serial killer is so normal and unmoved it's creepy.There are a handful of groan out loud plot moves in The Chaser, but so what. There are also more than a handful of plot moves this film doesn't do, moves that most people will be guessing it will do, that it more than makes up for it. This is a film I know I'll watch again just for the performance of it. The plot won't matter. It's that good.More reviews at sitenoise-atthemovies.blogspot.com",

I was asking myself the question: \"How can a movie from South Korea with only 59 votes deserve a 8,9? \" But after watching the movie I can say this is one of the very best movies EVER made. I have been watching movies for quite some time now. And I have seen almost all movies from the IMDb top 250. But this movie deserves to be in the top 20. No question about it, no exaggeration. Just look at my vote statistics and you will see that only gave a few movies a ten.So what's the story of the movie? A former detective who is now a pimp, thinks 2 of his girls ran away from him. So he tries to find those girls. After some research he learns the truth is a little bit different. From that point on, the movie never loses your grip. Never get's dull. Always keeps you right on the edge of your chair. For the rest, you really gotta see it. I won't spoil any of your viewing pleasure by telling you too much about the story.The other comment said something about a horror element, and a bit gore. But in my opinion there is no horror. Sure there is some blood, but it doesn't play a big part.So, why are you still reading my comment. Go and see where you can watch this movie!!",

            "content": "Wow! I caught wind of this through a magazine review and checked it out and was very glad I did. Some of the great stuff coming out of South Korea will blow your mind and this is no exception. The references people made to this movie being in the caliber of Oldboy and Memories of Murder are well substantiated but I would liken it more to Memories of Murder and not quite in the same league as Oldboy. The only movie in league with Oldboy is Seven. While the plot kind of reminded me of some of the classic 80s and 90s psycho-killer thrillers we have had come out of the US, it does hold up well on its own for being a foreign film. Not the most original plot but a decent twist on it nonetheless. Nothing in the plot or sequence of events stood out as unbelievable and there are some real gripping scenes that'll make you white-knuckle. There are some good character developments and reversals that I enjoyed as we see our main character, a former cop turned pimp, trying to find the guy who's been killing his girls and coming to grips with his personal responsibilities and justice. I don't want to give away the plot other than that as it would detract from your enjoyment. It does burn a little slow after the first 20 minutes of the movie as we see events unfold so be prepared for the reward in the last 30 minutes of the movie as the sequence of events crescendo.

            "content": "\u00a8I killed them.\u00a8 After reading several blogs about the best Korean films I decided to watch Hong-jin Na's film, The Chaser. Korea is making some great films in this decade, but I wouldn't consider The Chaser to be among their best. I had some issues with this movie, although it still left me with some great impressions. My favorite thriller of all time is Seven, and this film had a feeling similar to it, especially with the dark setting. It is a different kind of thriller because in the first 20 minutes the protagonist has already managed to catch the serial killer. The thrills come once the serial killer is interrogated by the police officers who show their complete ineptness to solve the case even when the killer has admitted his crimes. The problem is that the police officers aren't able to find the bodies and have no evidence other than his testimony to accuse him in trial. They have only 12 hours to discover the whereabouts of the bodies before they have to set him free. Why isn't his testimony enough? Because the killer is acting like a lunatic who doesn't know what he's saying. The thriller almost turns into a comedy after watching the complete ineptness of the police officials. That is where the film lost me a little bit, because it goes a little too far with this issue that Hong-jin Na is trying to point out: Korean officials are completely inept and incapable of solving a crime that has been placed right before their eyes. The crime seems like a simple one to solve, there are leads they can follow all over the place, but they keep on screwing up and get nowhere. I did however like the twist near the end of the film that you would probably never see in a Hollywood film because it's just way too dark.Joong-ho (Yun-seok Kim) is a pimp who is worried about his business because some of his work girls have disappeared. He believes that they've left him, but what he doesn't know is that there is a serial killer who has been killing them off one by one. After realizing that his last girl left the cell phone in his car, he begins to believe that someone is kidnapping his girls and selling them abroad. He goes back and retraces the number of the person who solicited the girls when they last disappeared and realizes they all come from the same number. When the serial killer, Young-min (Jung-woo Ha), calls again he sends another girl and orders her to give him the man's address once she arrives at his place. Why? Because the killer always asks the girls to pick him up at a random location and then has them drive him to his place. The problem is that when Mi-jin Kim (Yeong-hie Seo) arrives at Young-min's house there is no signal and she can't send the message. The pimp doesn't know the exact address of the house, but he knows the whereabouts because that is where the last girl had left his car and he finds Mi-jin's vehicle there too. Young-min kills his victims by hammering some sort of stake to their head and barely hits Mi-jin with it before he is interrupted by a couple who are searching for the owner of the house. This is where we realize that Young-min has been operating from someone else's home and has to kill the visitors as well. Before burying the victims, Young-min decides to get rid of their vehicle and that is when he crashes into Joong-ho's vehicle and he discovers that he's the man he's looking for. Joong-ho beats him up and the police officers intervene and that is where the search for the bodies begins.Some of the problems I had with the plot beside the fact that the ineptness of the police officers was greatly exaggerated (but I guess that the director succeeded in trying to point this out) was that there were too many bad decisions made by Joong-ho and too many coincidences. First of all he lets the girl go to this man's place without following them, then he accidentally crashes into his vehicle (a great coincidence here), then he goes around driving everywhere in the car that should've been in the police's hands after the accident. That car should've been their most important lead, trying to figure out who it belonged to and what Young-min was doing with it. The only person who investigates this is Joong-ho and he isn't thorough enough. Then near the end of the film there are several plot holes as well but I don't want to spoil anything for the viewers. Everything I've discussed before happens in the first twenty minutes of the film. There are just too many coincidences that take place and they felt really forced at times. The thriller does work however as a dark and violent one, and it leaves you haunted by some of the things that happen. Some of the images stay with you long after the credits begin to roll. I did enjoy this thriller, I just don't think it is amongst the best Korean films considering there are so many great ones.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",

            "content": "The Chaser is yet another example of the excellence of South Korean cinema. Since the millennium there have been several absolute standout movies from this country. Often what makes them so good is that they have materialised from a culture hitherto sparsely represented in the movies, meaning that we in the west often find their films less predictable than we are normally used to. The Chaser is quite a good example of this because what we have is a staple of the thriller genre \u2013 the serial killer film \u2013 presented in ways that go against expectations. Structurally, it's unusual in that not only is the killer's identity revealed very early on but he is also caught near the start. This means that the focus then switches to the police bureaucracy that hinders everything bar the maniac himself. But even with this switch of direction, the plot-line still retains a high suspense narrative whereby an abducted girl remains in the killer's lair, a place totally unknown the police.The story-line itself has an ex-policemen turned pimp apprehend a man whom he believes has kidnapped one of his girls. This man then confesses to police that has murdered this girl but without any direct proof he is set to be released in 12 hours by the powerless authorities, leading to frantic detective work. This story results in a cat and mouse standoff. But with a hero who is hardly whiter than white \u2013 he is after all a pimp who is distrusted by his former police colleagues; who themselves are shown to be fairly incompetent. So the dynamic between the characters is fairly complex and leads to some unpredictable results. The two main characters are especially good here and very well played by the actors. There is great use of the back streets of Seoul too. Especially in the case of some high octane foot chases which unusually show the sheer exhaustion of such an endeavour, equally the several frantic and messy fights have a similar realism. This approach is distinctive and adds a lot. The violence is often so realistic it offers little distance to the audience, particularly horrible is the hammer and chisel sequence which made for extremely grim viewing. This grit and grime adds a further dimension to a film which has already taken a genre film to unpredictable places. It ends in a way that is neither happily wrapped up not one dimensionally nihilistic, it's something in between. In a film of many contrasts and surprises, it feels right that it does so.",

            "content": "Well not sure how I can start this,but 1st of all this movie is based on one of South Koreas most notorious Serial Killers by the name of \"Yoo Young-Chul\" He killed mostly rich men and Korean Prostitutes. He also admitted to eating some of the victims. He went on a killing spree from 2003 to 2004. Anyway well I was stationed in South Korea from 2007 to 2014.After I transitioned out of the Army in 2011 I decided I was going to stay in Korea as a civilian. I was young,had no money and honestly did not know what I was doing.I had a korean gf at that time and she was pretty much taking care of me. I started to feel bad for her because she got involved in some shady work just so she could support the both of us. I started feeling bad for her,because I could not support her and I didn't want her to do what she was doing any longer. So I conspired to import some drugs into Korea with a friend of my. \"I seen some guys sell weed in Korea and they were selling it for 10times the amount in Korea then they would usually sell in the states. So my friend and I thought we could make easy money as well. Long story short my friend bought some stuff it got caught by Korea's Customs Officials and he was arrested. But the Koren Police and Prosecutors offered him a deal.Basically if he helped them to catch others they would let him go with a period of probation. So he set me up, I was arrested publicly at a Dunkin Donuts in Hongdae(Hongdae is a famous University Area in Korea where lots of University Students and Foreigners go drink and party) I was sent to a prison in Uijeongbu.After a few months I had my first trial and the Judge Sentenced me to 4 years in Jail,I quickly filed for an appeal and was transferred to \uc11c\uc6b8 \uad6c\uc9c0\uc131(Seoul Prison)My gf at the time still worked at a \ud150\ud504\ub85c(High End Escort) and she was making around 30K a month doing that job,so within a month she saved enough money to buy me a lawyer. The 2nd trail was around 4 months away. When I was in Seoul Prison,thats where I met the Notorious \"Yoo Young Chul\" The Serial Killer that this movie is roughly based on. He was in the \"FOREIGNERS BLOCK\" of the jail,because the guards wanted to segregate him from the Koreans. Well some of us foreigners that lived in Korea heard about him while we lived there and we couldn't believe that he was there,3 doors down from our room. So of course we talked to him and asked questions.The man was a genius,with an exceptionally high IQ (I believe he was like a Korean Ted Bundy. He was artistic and a very skillful person at being able to draw. He was able to carry regular conversations as if nothing was ever wrong with him. He had a passion for Travel and was obsessed with Japanese Culture and said that he frequently visited Japan. It was highly against the rules for us to communicate with him but we would always pass notes back and forth to find out the truth about him,and not what the media,movies,and other propaganda made him. I do not praise what he did at all but this movie definitely twisted the facts about him. Anyway if you guys have any questions feel free to ask me. This is all truth. I even have my prison documents and a few letters from him to prove that this experience I went through is real. O and by the way on my appeal I was granted probation because the judge found me not guilty of the actual crime because my friends at that time did admit that he ordered the drugs and admitted to trafficking the stuff. All I got was a conspiracy charge,I wasn't deported. I left Korea in March 2014 on my own and now live in Shenzhen China, Im planing to return to Korea in April of 2015",

Solid acting, good opening, nice pacing, and then after about 30 minutes in the movie makes a turn for the worst.The entire last hour and a half of the movie are ridiculous, completely unbelievable garbage. The main killer is caught, and get this...for no reason at all...they free him almost immediately. It literally makes no sense at all. In the movie they act as if there is no proof of his deeds, although there is heaps of proof. They collected DNA evidence, they found that he beat a kid with a hammer three years prior, the way he conducted the murders matches the case descriptions exactly, he stole a car and he has called all of the missing girls.I was so angry at the end of the movie. I just wasted two hours with a movie about catching a brutal killer...he is caught...and then...lets just set him free to kill yet again in his unpatrolled empty neighborhood in broad daylight and then he walks back home to bury more dead bodies. RIDICULOUS!!!If you want to waste two hours with a ridiculous story about a murderer being treated like a princess, watch this.",

            "content": "THE CHASER is a another example of the cutting edge of Asian cinema and its universal influence, especially on western cinema, as this is currently in the process of being set to be remade in Hollywood, by the team who created the INFERNAL AFFAIRS remake, THE DEPARTED. The story follows, Jung Ho, an ex cop who is now a pimp, and who is looking for two of his girls, who have disappeared. Unbeknowst to Jung, the girls have become victim to twisted serial killer, Young min, who Jung suspects to be instead a rival pimp, buying his girls off him, without his knowledge. Through a series of events Jung ho and Young min, clash into each other and eventually a chase and beating ensues with Young min, being taken to the local police station and eventually confessing to nine murders. The police task force behind the murder investigation strongly believe that he is the murderer and have 12 hours to find and gather evidence against him, or he will be set free without charge, and the same time Jung ho, has to look for another one of his girls Min jin who has become captive by the psychopath. Aside from a slow start the film really kicks in once Young min is detained and the police have 12 hours to build a case against him. At the same time, Jung ho's character undergoes a change from being a bit of a bastard to eventually setting out on a desperate effort to find Min jin, especially as he finds out and develops a kind of bond with her daughter. The performances are superb, and the portrayal of psycho Young min, is excellent as he is an instantly dislikeable person, who is playing the police at there own game and leading round in circles. The direction is tight and stylish, with some superb suspense and nail biting scenes, and there's also a strain of humour throughout the film that provide a slight relief from the dark undertone. Overall another strong and impressive entry that highlights the excellence and originality of Asian cinema.",

The whole movie relies heavily on chance and I always hate when a twist or closure is achieved by a mere coincidence. Twists by chance in this movie are too many to count.\"no signal\" on the mobile is a pure Hollywood clich\u00e8. You just don't take refuge in a shop when you break loose from a psychotic killer, especially not after you received a beating to the head with a hammer. And he runs out of cigarettes and shopkeeper hands him a hammer, that is not irony, that is bad idea.Let loose a self-confessed murderer of 12 people and have him followed by only two cops, one was incompetent and the other is too naive, he disappeared before her eyes. Good thing for her, otherwise she would be dead too.Also if you are going to save a life or catch a criminal you don't run across the whole city, just take a cab.Another thing that bugs me, incompetent cops, they never interrogate the suspect properly , all we see lots of blubbering and shouting and some occasional pissing contest. This is a crime movie but we don't see cops following any clues such as missing people, mobile signals, plate numbers all we see a pimp sniffing around the city and pimp's guy, also dumb, with lots of keys looking for the right gate in a large area.If you ask me, the real trouble is the poster of the movie. You can always speculate if it has some deeper meaning but for me, it's completely awful and unintelligible and uninviting.I like Korean movies but this movie didn't satisfy me least a bit.",

What's amazing about this movie is that it lets you know who is the killer right from the start. It shows what its cards are, but it still controls the game completely from the beginning to end, without ever giving out any dully moment.Having loved some of the recent Korean movies such as 'Memories of Murder' 'Old Boy' 'The Host' etc, I had a high expectation of this movie after a strong recommendation from my Korean friend, who advised me not to take my pregnant wife to the movie due to gory violence.It is indeed gory, but at least the scenes stop before the actual execution of bloody things, such as hammering a huge nail into a victim's head, etc. I guess it's less violent that the Saw series.Fantastic direction (from a rookie director), fantastic acting & a fantastic thriller.

            "content": "When it comes to thrillers, no film industry around the world has done even half as great a job as Cinema of South Korea has since the dawn of this new millennium. Inspired from a real-life Korean serial killer, The Chaser tells the story of an ex-detective turned pimp whose girls have been disappearing lately without clearing their debts, leading to financial losses in his business. While tracking back, he finds out that all girls had vanished after meeting the same client whom one of his girls is meeting right now & decides to find him before it's too late, not knowing that the client he is dealing with is a sadistic psychopath.For a film that presents such an expert level of craftsmanship in nearly every filmmaking department, it's even more surprising to find out that this is director Na Hong-jin's debut effort. He has filmed it amazingly well, kept it very grounded & emotionally layered, portrayed imperfect characters perfectly & retained the story's cruel intensity from start to finish. The screenplay also deserves a praise for the little humour its writers were able to infuse in the film's appalling nature. Cinematography & editing set an ideal tone for its plot and the performances by its cast is very impressive, sturdy & spectacular.By approaching the story as realistically as possible & paying extra attention to small details that most films skip over, The Chaser effortlessly manages to avoid falling into its genre's clich\u00e9s. And for a film that has 'chaser' in its title, it's astonishing & heartwarming to see how brilliantly those chase sequences are executed by not giving in to silliness like absence of fatigue, leaping over a 10-foot wall etc. On an overall scale, The Chaser is a deeply unsettling, mercilessly violent & unflinchingly brutal cinema from South Korea that paints a disturbing portrait of a serial killer while also making a subtle statement against the jurisdiction and, in my opinion, is one of the finest thrillers ever made.A genre masterpiece. Not for the easily distressed. Strongly recommended.Ful review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",

He not only gets a nomination at this year's Asian Film Awards, but the film also won seven 2008 Korean Film Awards including Best Picture, Director, Actor and Screenplay and was a massive box office hit in South Korea. It premiered at Cannes in the Official Selection and was quickly snapped up for an American remake by the producers of The Departed and Warner Brothers. I just hope they don't screw it up like they did with Infernal Affairs.Joong-ho (Yun-seok Kim) is a pimp that keeps losing his girls. They go out, but they don't come back. he doesn't know if they are running away or kidnapped and sold. The cops are too busy watching out for politicians to look for missing prostitutes.Fortunately, Joong-ho is a former cop and decides to solve the mystery himself. When he sends out Mi-jin (Yeong-hie Seo), he tags along. Unfortunately, he cannot save her from her fate, but he does find out who (Jung-woo Ha) is doing it; he just doesn't know yet what is being done.While Joong-ho is searching, he discovers that Mi-jin has a daughter and now he is stuck with her while he looks. She is cute and funny, so it really adds to the story. Of course, she is not funny when she realizes her mother is missing.Things take many twists and turns that add to the suspense. What is most upsetting is what happens while the cops are snoozing nearby.Outstanding writing and acting, and incredible suspense. A real winner from Korea that keeps you on the edge of your seat.",

The graphic content and nature of this film is just way to much.Basic plot is a former cop turned pimp keeps having his girls disappear so he decides to investigate. He stumbles upon a guy who constantly calls his service and one of his cohorts mentions that this guy is nuts. They finally arrest the guy and through police incompetence/red tape they let the guy go and revenge ensues. Sound familiar?There are endless points in this film that are too ridiculous to count. I'll start off by mentioning the ending and the beating this guy takes and he just gets right back up. This skinny little nut job just gets his second wind and gets the upper hand? Gimme a break. No man on earth could take a beating this guy does and gets back up. After this an monumental fight happens where they beat each other senseless until guess who shows up? You guessed it...the police.This one was clearly made to embarrass the \"system\" or the \"powers that be\". They make the police and government officials look like complete morons. They're to blame for letting this guy get out etc. They really pour on the syrup on that point. The incompetence displayed in this film is just beyond reason. How could any cop or government official be trusted after watching this? According to this film almost every cop on the beat is on the take. If this were the case what a depressing thing to wake up to every morning in Korea.I really enjoyed Oldboy but this was just ridiculous to the point is was so obvious the shock was to get a reaction. This may be based on a real case but if this is what Korean society has decided is a good film then I think I've seen my last film from Korea.",

Being interested for a good while in seeing this title after catching part of the Bollywood remake Murder 2 (2011) when visiting a pal, I was thrilled when a friend very kindly sent me the film, which led to me deciding to play a round against The Chaser.View on the film:Leaving the police in order to become a pimp, only to end up as a amateur detective in search of the kidnapped Mi-jin, Kim Yoon-seok gives an incredibly raw performance as Noir loner Eom, whose moral ambiguity (Eom was Mi-jin's pimp) is peeled open by Yoon-seok with the new responsibility Eom gets of having to care for Mi-jin's young daughter, whose cries for her mum are answered by Eom crossing the lines that even the police do not dare go near, and going deep into a murky, murderous underworld,which Eom charges through holding onto hope of finding Mi-jin.Stating in a chillingly unsettled matter of fact manner the way he killed each of his victims to the cops asking question, Ha Jung-woo gives a nerve- wreaking turn as Yeong-min, whose body language Jung-woo expresses as meek, paired with a mild manner vocal tone, which wraps Yeong-min in a false, calming appearance, that Jung-woo shatters with abrasive outbursts of bloody rage.Going on a chase for his directing debut, co-writer (with Won-Chan Hong and Shinho Lee) / director Na Hong-jin & cinematographer Sung-je Lee rub the city in a bleak Neo-Noir charcoal atmosphere, grinding the camera in expertly performed hand-held shots, that follow Eom down every dark alleyway.Almost completely drained of colour,Hong-jin cleverly uses the darkness as a canvas, for the ultra-stylized, unflinching killer set-pieces, splattering lines of blood across the screen, as the latest victim screams in pain, and Yeong-min screaming in deadly madness.Not giving a single character an offering of light, the writers superbly twists the screenplay from a gripping Thriller into doom-laden Neo-Noir, via the corrupt police force only figuring out Yeong-min's next move, long after he has committed another killing, Yeong-min teasing anyone who will give him attention with cryptic mutterings over where he has buried the deceased, and Joong-ho kicks against remarks by the police that Mi-jin is long dead, by dipping further into the darkness, in order to chase the chaser.",

The movie also has great interactions between the characters, as the pimp and police use every hook and crook to find the missing girl. The interaction with the psychotic serial killer is well done as well. The acting all around is sublime. Unfortunately the forced termination of the girl in question is madness-inducing. Also the way the killer is released from the precinct is stupid and ridiculous. Anyone confessing to being a serial killer will be held until all leads are exhausted, and there was extensive evidence to be processed while he was detained - whether there is a political upheaval over the mayor being assaulted with a cup of crap or not.7 stars removed due to the terrible ending3/10",

Just like all these brilliant movies, \"The Chaser\" is a South-Korean production and one that is so good that it will unquestionably receive an Hollywoodian makeover in a couple of years. \"The Chaser\" offers a widely versatile mixture of nail-biting tension, virulent action sequences and \u2013 oh yes \u2013 biting satire. It's primarily a raw and gritty cop-thriller, but writer/director Hong-Jin-Na (what a debut!) leaves no opportunity unused to criticize and mock the malfunctioning of South Korea's police system. In fact, the whole movie sort of looks like a promotional campaign stimulating the South Korean population to take the law into their own hands. Joong-Ho is a former cop turned pimp, who lately noticed that a lot of his call girls have disappeared after they all received a buzz from the same phone number. He's convinced the number belongs to a competing pimp and plots to catch him red-handed by intentionally sending his best prostitute Mi-Jin over to his address. The guy turns out to be a depraved serial killer instead, responsible for several still unsolved murders in the area. Joong-Ho captures the scumbag himself and reluctantly delivers him to the police, but they mess up dramatically. Following a series of blunders and internal authority conflicts, the police is forced to set the killer free again after 12 hours, forcing Joong-Ho to continue is chase again as Min-Jin is still missing and presumably imprisoned somewhere in the city.This movie is aptly title, for sure, as the numerous chase sequences truly form the most adrenalin-rushing highlights of the entire film. Every new twist and every tiniest breakthrough in Joong-Ho's private investigation launches a brand new race against the clock that feels more involving and blood-pumping each time. You really grow to care for the characters Min-Jin, her witty 7-year-old daughter and even for Joong-Ho as well, even though he basically is a sleazy and money obsessed pimp. The serial killer character is fascinating as well, as he remains stoically clam and menacing the entire time; even when Joong Ho is beating the hell out of him and the police looks the other way. The fact that he doesn't look like a perverted serial killer also definitely makes his behavior more bone-chilling. The blunders of the police are often laugh-out-loud funny but the overall tone of the movie is undeniably grim and deeply embittered, with also a couple of misogynistic bits of violence that really aren't appropriate for all types of audiences. Masterfully directed and benefiting from sublime performances of the ensemble cast, \"The Chaser\" is an instant cult classic continuously balancing between sheer brilliance and admirable modesty. A must see for every self-respecting fan of thrillers and/or Asian cinema in general.",

For lovers of such films, there's nothing more you could wish for.THE CHASER manages to break the boundaries which normally films don't. Be it the mind-boggling thrills or the highly octane action sequences, everything about this film is excellent from the start to end. Na Hong- jin is a great director, we all know, and he uses the two lead actors Kim Yoon-seok and Ha Jung-woo brilliantly. The film never gives you what we usually expect in movies of this genre. It delivers everything out of the box. In other words, the film is unpredictable and there's no chance of being disappointed with this film.Kim Yoon-seok and Ha Jung-woo are amongst the most talented actors from South Korea. Their performances are extraordinarily excellent. Other actors deliver decent performances. Visually, this film is both stunning and appealing so try to catch it either on a Blu-ray or simply in high quality. The tension and atmosphere of the film are both built brilliantly and the solid action sequences hold your breath as they unfold. The humour present throughout the film is decent. Cinematography is also praiseworthy. The editing, however needed to be tighter in a few portions but that's absolutely fine and this minor flaw can be ignored.With that, THE CHASER turns out to be another out-of-the-box, unpredictable and unexpectedly very gripping and amazing action thriller which deserves to be watched. Due to the overall product being excellent, it can be watched more than once.",

But fundamentally, it's a nasty film. The violence is simultaneously horrifically real yet milked for shock value; I'm all for flawed heroes, but a pimp who spends the first half of the film complaining about how someone is costing him money by stealing his girls is too unlikely an avenging angel; and the notes of black comedy jar just after we've seen footage of a man cracking open a live woman's skull with a hammer and chisel. The film appears to want to be a thriller, comedy, exploitation movie and a journey into one man's soul at the same time; and it can't pull it off. There a nice touches, but overall, it left a sour feeling behind.",

            "content": "When I heard comments on a radio program that \"The chaser\" is better than \"Oldboy\", my curiosity was aroused to the extent that I went to see it. After two hours of intensely disturbing cinematic experience, I understand why. Five years ago when \"Old boy\" came out, it was hailed as ingenious, mainly because of the novelty. Looking back, the movie is better described as showy, shamelessly contrived and not really that clever. \"The chaser\", on the other hand, is brutally direct and gustily uncompromising. It is easily mistaken to be a suspense-thriller but while it superficially has all the ingredients of one, it isn't. A thriller-suspense usually relies on the \"restricted narration\" style \u0096 the audience sees only a part of the truth, which is very often through the eyes of the main protagonist. \"The chaser\" adopts the \"omniscient narration\" style \u0096 the audience sees everything that is happening, things that the main character doesn't see. There is no \"twist\" in the conventional sense, only twists in that it dares to defy conventional Hollywood predictability, for example (see SPOILER at the end of these comments).The plot line is quite straightforward. A fallen-cop-turned-pimp Eom, suspecting that two of his disappeared \"girls\" were actually sold by a weird client Jee, sends to him Mi-jin, his favourite prostitute and also a mother of an 8-year-old daughter, as bait. Jee turns out to be a psychopathic serial killer. In the midst of torturing Mi-jin, Jee encounters unexpected intrusion, kills and flees. By sheer coincidence (this is the only contrivance in this movie) he bumps, literally, into Eom who discovers his identity through his cell phone number. This is only the beginning of the story.In his debut, director Na Hong-jin tells this gritty story with apt bluntness, blow-by-blow fashion (figuratively and literally). While graphic violence, blood-in-profusion notwithstanding, is not particularly out-of-line, it's the atmospheric oppression that is intensely disturbing to the audience. At the centre of it all is the character study of Eom, the last person to be considered a hero, trying to help the little girl to find her mother. Also in the backdrop are social and political issues, including a rather sharp jab at the inept Korean police force.SPOILER: For example, in \"Kiss the girls\" (1997), no Hollywood director would ever dream of having Ashley Judd's character going through all the troubles of escaping from the serial killer AND THEN killed.",

            "content": "The Chaser is a skilled, talented synthesis of detective adventure, desperate dismay and dark comedy from South Korea and a prototype for what a well-made thriller should be in the West, too. Its foremost chase scene features a foot pursuit through the derelict constricted nighttime streets of Seoul. No car bombs. The climax is the outcome of everything that has come before, not an obligatory display. This is excitement, and a fine instance of a film gripping the audience by the lapel with vicious kicks, hectic foot chases and some authentically revolutionary variations on the police procedural.The film's structure is unyielding in sustaining suspense. The plot is an task in audience treatment. First-time director Na Hong-jin knows precisely what he's doing. Like Hitchcock, he gives the audience exactly enough information to be irritated. It's clear to us what the characters should be doing, yet there are brilliant reasons why it isn't clear to them. If you can engineer that in a screenplay, you've already exceeded the standard of the typical modern thriller.Another power of this gruesome thriller that expands into a cry of indignation at the ineffectiveness of the system is in its thought toward characters. The villain is seen as a psychological low-oxygen area, a man without a sense of right and wrong to whom both are uniformly irrelevant. The pimp starts out with plain mercenary motivations and steadily develops his trepidations in reaction to a somewhat predictable but extremely well-handled revelation.In between sporadic but crucial moments of chisel-scything terror there's some strikingly black humor and excellent acting, but what you react to before anything else was the gravelly realism. There are no supermen and no larger-than-life stunts. When the actors run, we see that they're running. These shots continue in time and are not manufactured after inexplicable cutting. The physical truths of the action sequences are appreciated and obeyed. We start to familiarize ourselves with the neighborhood. The cops are not run-of-the-mill characters but simply well-drawn everyday officers. No one in this hard-bitten actioner seems to be in automatic.When I see a film like this, it evokes to me what we're overlooking. So many mainstream movies are just snake oil. Even if you're essentially exhausted with this stuff, the film is marked by the grimy pace of its foot chases, and the efficiency of its craft as it modifies its tone naturally between delirious tension and procedural excitement, not to mention the unfortunate real-world outcome of at least one character.",

            "content": "Korean cinema takes the spotlight once more with this surprise box office hit thriller in it's native Korea. The story of a former cop turned pimp trying to figure out what is happening with several missing call girls. The positive reviews have been pointing out how clever the movie is in not following some of the usual traps and clich\u00e9s of this kind of movies, yet they seem to fail in realizing that the plot, in order to work here, seems to follow even worse tricks and gimmicks.Maybe i'm missing something here, because i seem to be on the minority, but for a movie that is trying so hard in being more \"realistic\" than other offers in the genre it relies heavily on silly coincidences and the characters making dumb decisions. Not only that but the movie seems to forget a lot of the things it establishes with the characters. How can a man that has killed so many people seems to be so inept in trying to kill one person? There's also an attempt of socio-political commentary that is actually just another plot device used to further complicate things even more. Then there's the attempt of giving some kind of psycho-religious motivation to the killer, that once more, adds nothing to the plot whatsoever.In the technical aspects the movie is tight, it knows where to put the camera, how to keep the pacing and how to hook the viewer, at least for a while. Performances are convincing and help enhance the sense of tension the movie builds early on, but as the story progresses you just can't help to shake your head at all the stuff that is happening on screen. The weight of so many gimmicks and plot tricks fall over the movie eventually, and makes what it should be an intense cinematic experience into just a very annoying movie that doesn't know when to stop. Maybe if the script wasn't trying to hard to \"impress\" with it's twists and tricks things could be different. I think i can agree with the core idea of the movie: many times the chase is better than the actual catch, but sometimes, after so many complications the catch ends up being not that exciting or even worth the wait. Korean cinema can do a lot better than this. It knows how to combien thrills and wit in far better ways, Memories of Murder is a fine example of that, a movie that by the way, doesn't deserve to be put in the same league of this one.",

We probably all wish to believe, while seeing this, that it is all utter nonsense and that people just can't be this stupid. Sadly, they can be, as maybe not so much news reports illustrate but rather one's own life experience: it's hard to stick the blame to a culprit, even if the issues at hand seem to be clear.If the viewer believes that entertainment cinema should rather not address the realities of this world so bluntly, then you'd better stay away from this.

A scene with a hammer got me squirming for some reason (yes, a jaded f**k like me!); I guess director Hong-jin Na's refusal to stage most of the violence conventionally really paid off. The film is long but fascinating. It plays like a crime thriller, but it qualifies as horror because it's so damn bloody and vicious. If you're looking for redemption, steer well clear of this -- it makes no concessions to the mainstream, except for the fact that its production values are top notch. A pimp, who used to be a cop, is starting to worry about his girls because they go out on jobs and never come back. Convinced that a particular client is selling them into slavery, he begins a clumsy, one-man investigation into their whereabouts. What he finds is not exactly what he was expecting. Because I deal with idiots and incompetents on a daily basis, I had no trouble believing the actions of the police in this movie. That they fail to cotton on to what's really happening -- until it's all too late -- just felt like business as usual for me. \"Edge of your seat\" is a well worn clich\u00e9, but I'm happy to apply it to \"The Chaser\", easily the best horror film I've seen this year that was made this year.",

            "content": "This film is based on a true story about some gruesome murders that happened a few yrs ago in Korea by a serial killer that killed multiple call girls. The real killer's name is Yoo Young-chul and his killing span lasted from 2003 to 2004 with a total of 21 dead victims, and even if the body counts aren't that high in this film it's one of the best and suspenseful thrillers I have ever seen with unpredictable twist and turns. Most critics seem to bash on films for it being realistic while they give higher ratings on unrealistic style of films, not that unrealistic films are bad or anything. But it just seems they are trying to give higher ratings on films like that just to show how artistic there critiquing technique really is, when the film itself isn't that much of a work of art sometimes. But than again as for the realistic aspect of a movie goes, sometimes it's the opposite. And if it's not them it's some critics that thinks things need to blow up every second or there has to be a big gun fight with martial arts thrown in, and maybe even some futuristic robots which is why some films usually don't get the rating it deserves. This is a realistic film compared to a lot of other films that are based on a true story and to top it off it keeps you on the edge of your seat and it's entertaining from beginning to end. Eom Joong-ho is a former police officer that turned pimp but a several of his girls go missing. So the next time he gets a call from a customer and finds a reason to be suspicious of him, he sends his call girl Min-ji and tells her to call back cause he thinks the guy is selling off his girls, but when she is with the killer the phone doesn't work inside the house. And in the bathroom she finds a scalped piece of another call girl's hair, so she tries to leave but it's too late. And since Eom Joong-ho don't know her whereabouts he tries to track her down and eventually crosses path with the killer and the killer gets caught and he is arrested but that is just the beginning and than the thrill ride keeps going. A phenomena that is in the film is the inactive police act and ugly politician who are incompetent, which is nothing new but it really pushes it in this movie and is actually quite a nice touch. And the interaction between Eom Joong-ho and Min-Jin's witty 7-year-old daughter is actually quite amusing and even sort of funny at times. This thriller is masterfully directed and the cast put on a great performance especially Jung-woo Ha who played the villain, the pacing was well done as well, it even has a good climax. It's just well crafted, it's a suspenseful, gripping and tense film that has all the right elements to make a amazing thriller.8.6/10",

This surely isn't your typical Hollywood murder mystery.A pimp named Jung-ho (Kim Yoon-seok) was simply trying to find his missing girls. He assumed they ran off on him and he just needed to find them. It wasn't much later that he came to the assumption they'd been sold by a competitor or a sex-trafficker. Jung-ho used his police training to get him on the right track, but he wasn't simply looking for runaways or a sex-trafficker, he was looking for a murderer.\"The Chaser\" was delightful in its darkness. Both the setting and the mood was dark from start to finish with very little light moments. A murderer was in police custody, but they couldn't get anything useful out of him while Mi-jin (Yeong-hie Seo), a woman he'd recently captured, was in peril. Jung-ho was probably her only hope as the police drowned in their ineptness. \"The Chaser\" was intense, suspenseful, and riveting. Even the parts of the movie that upset you as the viewer with a rooting interest were fine because they were an expression of the writer's art.

            "content": "I'm a person who hates bulls**t. And this movie is full of it. Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is pretty good. Let me explain.Here be spoilers. The movie is about a pimp whose girls go missing one after another. The pimp is also an ex-detective. After sending one of his last girls to a client, he suspects said client to be the cause of his troubles. At this point in the movie, though, he still thinks that the 'client' kidnaps his girls and sells them elsewhere. Long story short, the ex-detective pimp starts searching for the girl-abductor, accidentally bumps into him, they end up at the police station, and that's where the movie starts going downhill.Question: what should the police do after they apprehend two men who fought each other after a common car accident, and after one of them, in the presence of at least 3-4 other policemen (can't recall now), commits to having murdered 12 women? Did I mention that the police are also looking for an unknown serial killer known for at least 3 homicides? The guy continues to mention in great detail how he killed the women (all details match police records), he has blood all over his shirt, was apprehended while driving \"a friend's\" car (he forgot the friend's name, how unfortunate), doesn't have any form of ID, \"can't remember\" where he lives, etc. All the while the other guy, the detective-pimp, is shouting from the other side of the room that the 'client' abducted his women. Surely, this is no difficult puzzle. If you're a sane person and answered at least, \"put him behind bars until everything's cleared out\" - you're wrong. It appears that the policemen are most concerned not about the fact that they have a serial killer in their station, but that said serial killer is badly bruised. I'm not kidding, the cops' main topic of discussion is how they will explain to the press why the guy is beat up like that (the pimp did it). So they do the next best thing - leave him alone in an office-like room with what seems a 90 pound woman, who is more interesting in typing up something on her computer, than watching a serial killer who IS STILL NOT BEHIND BARS, but on a chair in the middle of the office-room. Apparently, they don't have jails in Korea. The police fail to gather any evidence (it's the middle of the night, and to be honest, they're not really trying), so they let the man go some 12 hours later.Next problem: you're the pimp. You found where the guy lives, finally. You fight. You throw the serial killer on the floor and choke him for 5 seconds. What do you do next? If you're thinking - check if he's dead or keep choking for a few more seconds just to be sure --- you can't be more wrong. Apparently, what you do is you get up, look to the side and stare at an aquarium some 5-6 metres away, for some time. Just enough time for the serial killer to regain consciousness. I could go on. I refuse to believe that people in Korea are that stupid. The film is filled with one logical fallacy after another, it's just horrendous. Everyone is an idiot, incapable of logic thought, everyone seems to have their heads in the clouds, missing the point. The prosecutor, who should be the one man most interested in catching a serial killer, gives the following reasoning to let him go: previously that evening, a crazy person smeared feces on the city mayor, and one of the policemen was unofficially held responsible for not preventing the event. Because the same policeman was in the room at the police station with the suspect serial killer, the killer should be let go, so as to not make it seem that the station is desperate to hide the feces smearing event. As in, they're trying to blame the innocent man of the murders so the public would not focus on a cop who let his guard down which ended up in the politician being humiliated. Seriously? The only thing that saved it was the ending, hence the three stars.",

It's an entertainment about serial killers, and the people who catch them just before they off their last victim. I mean, mass murder is tragic, and it's wrong, and we knit our brows and purse our lips when a real-life report comes on the nightly news, but it's still kind of neat to see what new twist the hacks can come up with. After all, there have been dozens of series about the same thing. And movies. And if you know letters, there are also crates of books.But if you want to enjoy a story about a serial killer, don't watch \"The Chaser.\" I didn't know that it was based on true events. I don't know just how much of it is, though I hope as little as possible. It's ironic that by taking a story from real life, the Koreans would create something that shines such a brutal, contemptuous spotlight on all the clever fictions of American typists, whose every accidental splash of paint outside the lines is hailed as the reincarnation of Jackson Pollock. \"The Chaser\" is a film about what actually happens when a man decides that his favorite hobby is murder.The protagonist is a pimp. He used to be a cop, before getting fired for not being craftier at taking bribes. He's mad because his employees have been vanishing after receiving their advances - all after getting hired by the same client. Finally, he decides to find out who's been poaching his cash-cows, and have a serious talk with the bastard.He's worth his salt as a detective, and manages to track down Client Zero. He catches the man in the first of several raw, sweaty foot chases. He tries to beat the money out of him, and they both end up in police custody. It is there that the man, like a schoolboy who's played a prank so delightful that he'll explode if he doesn't spill it to the nearest bystander, tells the officers what really happened to the women.Oh, but that's just the first half-hour. Let me tell you a secret. The only difference between a happy ending and an unhappy ending is the cut-off point. I mean, if the creep has killed five high-school girls, and the handsome detectives catch him before he does the sixth, there's happy music playing over the credits, right? However, end the movie five minutes earlier, and it's a tragedy. If the terrorists are stopped before they blow up the airliner, the hero gets to smile and flex his giant muscles. But if the movie focuses on the security guard that gets callously shot on his birthday, it turns into one helluva downer.I won't tell you who lives and who dies in \"The Chaser,\" and who gets caught, when and by whom, but it doesn't really even matter. Without any further summary or analysis, I give this film my highest recommendation. It's an astonishing piece of filmmaking; it will enrich you and deepen your emotions. However, if you decide to watch it, know this: a film about a serial murderer cannot have a happy ending.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: The Chaser",
            "content": "The Chaser become a box office hit in South Korea earlier this year, and as the byline on the poster goes, it's highly acclaimed, and it shocked moviegoers. I won't dispute either claim though, because it reaffirmed that there are quality crime thrillers coming out from their film industry after dismal efforts like Typhoon or Fate. The DVD has already been out in the shops overseas and I was tempted to get it just to experience what the fuss is about. Finally being released here this week, The Chaser boasts plenty of nail biting sequences, and scenes that would work the heart despite having most of its violence done off screen.The protagonist happens to be quite an unsavoury character Joong-ho (Kim Yun-seok), an ex-cop turned pimp who's running into some severe manpower issues when his girls start to disappear from their work. A pattern he noticed though is a peculiar caller, Young-min (Ha Jung-woo) being the last customer serviced, and unwittingly he had sent one of his girls, Mi- kin (Seo Yeong-hie) to meet up with him for business. Smelling a rat, and thinking that the caller might be a human trafficker of sorts, he tries to spring a trap, but Murphy's Law kicks in, and hence begin the cat and mouse game.In some ways the movie reminded me of the Hollywood movie (and now Hong Kong remake) Cellular, where a female in distress tries hard to contact the outside world for help, and those on the outside trying to work their way in to locate that needle in a haystack. What surprised me though, is that the film adapted a strategy used by Confessions of Pain in showing the hand of the serial killer very early on in the film, but unlike the Hong Kong movie, The Chaser somehow pulled it off through pacing done correctly, and managed to sustain interest and attention all the way to the end. The title might suggest pursuit, but it's not always having characters on the run, with nicely punctuated moments of human drama to provide a level of humanity, or inhumanity, to its characters.Kim Yun-seok as Joong-ho starts off as an uncaring boss whose priority is money, and thinks the world revolves around riches. His motivation for getting into the sex trade never really gets explained, though one can suspect that his hot headed temperament would have made it extremely difficult for him to function as a cop, or to gain support from his superiors when he goes berserk. There's still some good in him though through his redemption, when he starts to realize just how much of a jerk he had become, and goes all out to look for his staff when the police all but knock on the wrong doors.The Chaser also became a commentary of the inefficiencies of the police force, of the huge disparity in quality between seasoned investigators, and beat cops. It's also bogged down by the usual bureaucratic nonsense of covering the backsides of superiors or situations that put the department under bad light, and questions certain situations when investigations are carried out only for various avenues of politicking. What's more of a shocker here is, despite that which we've seen on investigation integrity in Memories of Murder, that fabricating of evidence still is a norm, where superiors tell their underlings that it is perfectly OK to cook up a story to fill in some blanks in reports, or when legwork turn out to be unfruitful, and in extracting confessions.Granted the movie paces itself against the clock given that suspects have to be released 12 hours after an arrest without a warrant, it makes for some excellent race against the clock moments, especially with the villain overtly taunting the cops with red herrings and mocked insanity, which actor Ha Jung-woo does a fine job with. Investigations get carried out in both the orthodox, proper way involving the authorities, and one working outside the system, where you'd be put in a spot to cheer the vigilantism and absence of red tape, which even the cops support, and mock the ineptness of policing with one hand tied behind the back.If you're one who's easily worked up through injustices put on screen, then you might want to keep your temper in check when sitting through The Chaser, as the last act will almost inevitably make you feel exasperated, and seethe with rage at the developments in the narrative. It might not be as good as the excellent Memories of Murder, but this stylish package comes close. Recommended!",

If you are into dark and bleak noir thrillers, you have to watch this. This is based on a true story involving a cannibal in Seoul who raped, killed, and ate his victims in the mid 2000's. His crimes shocked the country, similar to Jeffrey Dahmer who still continues to have an impact on American culture. This movie has great character development, particularly the main character who you don't like at first but in the end you are cheering for him when he decides to take the law into his own hands.

            "content": "I like Korean movies. The acting always seems top notch, the cinematography is worthy of Michael Mann and the stories are usually quite different.One thing among many bothers me about Hollywood is the predictably of their films. You always know how they end and the exceptions are few (Arlington Road maybe).Korean/Asian movies don't have that. Sure, some are a bit predictable too, but even the \"bad\" ones can still entertain with some other qualities.The Chaser draws you in from the start with beautiful scenes of Seoul at night and a woman picking up a man in her car. You immediately get the feeling something isn't quite right, but won't know yet why or what.We soon find out that the man who picked up said woman (a prostitute) is a serial killer. His motives are implied throughout the movie, but until the end, it isn't quite certain why he did what he did. That's quite excellent, as this doesn't seem to matter. It doesn't matter to his victims and it certainly doesn't matter to the police (they even suggest to make up a motive).The movie for me, despite being a tense thriller is also about politics and the police. Corruption, incompetence and career seem to be the main issues that allow the serial killer to succeed. The police is sure the guy did something, but can't hold him to it. And due to an unrelated case, involving a bag of feces and the mayor of Seoul (a rather harmless crime), the much worse crime of a person killing 14 other human beings becomes unimportant because the victims aren't famous.The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, although veterans of Korean cinema might suspect that there may not be a happy ending (Korean movies often go for a more realistic, yet \"unhappy\" ending).That's ultimately the case here and that's where we see another big difference to Hollywood. Whereas Hollywood \"punishes the bad and rewards the good (and audience)\", \"The Chaser\" doesn't do that. It rewards nobody. The police lost their face when details are leaked to the media. The victims lost. A child lost. The former detective lost. In a way, even the killer lost, for he really doesn't seem to have a shred of what we call \"sanity\" left.But that's what I like about Korean/Asian cinema. It doesn't sugarcoat or glorify things. So it ultimately digs deep into those raw emotions we usually try to avoid.",

            "content": "How this film ever garnered the awards it did, or how it ever came to be considered a great movie is totally beyond me. The movie is so funny at times that I literally burst out laughing.The plot is ridiculous. The people including the cops go bumbling about like Keystone cops, a woman is bludgeoned so badly yet somehow she survives to be bludgeoned again, a woman sees a guy with a hammer in his hand (this is where I really started laughing) she says she feels safe seeing him with a hammer in his hand, then by some miracle of contrivance the bludgeoned woman escapes & somehow goes to just the place where her killer buys cigarettes. The antihero former cop, now pimp, is apparently so strong that the Terminator couldn't stop him, since we see him throughout the film beating everybody up and even a platoon of police officers can't control him.And all of this is shot in pretentious slow motion that goes on forever, with pretentious intercutting of shots of the little girl in the film, the female victim, etc. Equally pretentious is a scene with a Crucifix.The movie is absurd. For some odd reason the former cop takes the little girl along, curses at her, likes her sometimes and hates her other times, curses around her all the time but when a prostitute mentions the word d*ck, he scolds her for talking dirty in front of the girl.The movie is almost mindless. There are so many chase scenes in it that it would fill several James Bond movies.A scene where the psychiatrist (?) says the killer is impotent is similarly funny, as if that's a deep insight. The related story is also unrelated to the main plot, about the mayor being attacked. The final fight scene between the killer and the former cop is supposed to be deeply symbolic, with the former cop now with the hammer in his hand, reversing roles of killer and cop.There are only two good scenes in the entire film. The opening sequence where the victim tries to phone out and cannot receive a connection because she's in a basement room, had promising potential, if the movie had continued along those lines of pure suspense. But then follows a needlessly brutal bludgeoning scene, which doesn't even make sense. Most people would have been killed with a single hammer blow or at least two, but this woman never dies, and even if technically she survived she would probably have been in a permanent coma.The other scene where the little girl cries behind a car window is also well done.I have scanned other reviews on this site and I just cannot understand how different aesthetic responses can be.As for casting, the actor who played the former cop just doesn't have the face for this kind of film. He reminded me more of a comic John Belushi than a tough former cop.The police part of the plot similarly doesn't make sense. A guy confesses to a murder, or several murders, and the police can't think to charge him at least for street fighting or vagrancy, since he tells them he can't remember his address?",

            "content": "This was a very dark movie, even by Korean standards. The movie starts of as a kind of black comedy. The protagonist is a pimp who has a hard time controlling his prostitutes. When one of his girls doesn't return, he believes that someone is picking them up and selling them. He calls his former buddies in the police force, that unfortunately is busy dealing with a case of someone throwing feces in the face of the city mayor. The comical mood changes when the perspective changes to one of his girls, who finds herself in a very creepy house with an even more creepy customer. This is not about a typical chase, where the protagonist has to track down and capture the antagonist. That all happens inside the first 15 minutes. This chase is about tracking down the girl, and later, about tracking down evidence in order to convict the antagonist. But it also becomes far more complicated than that. During this chase, you are really feeling the frustrations that the main character is having. You get equally mad at the incompetent police force, and you will feel a need to scream \"pick up the phone moron!\" or \"Noo, don't go in there!\" on several occasions. The chase scenes are very well done, and the action/fighting scenes are also very well done. They feel very realistic and are well choreographed (and violent). Also, the villain of this movie does not look like a villain. But you will still end up getting the chills every time he looks into the camera. The dialogue is harsh. It's mainly the protagonist throwing insults at the people he is encountering, it can be comical at times, but it can also be the exact opposite. No one is talking nice to each other in this movie.The cinematography is well done. It's a very dark toned movie, but that doesn't bring down the beautiful shots of the city (Seoul). It really helps set the correct mood for the movie.My only complaints would be that it becomes a little too long for it's own good, and some of the scenes felt a bit forced in order to finish the storyline.",

It was quite impressive, however it's been ripped off way too many times in the last three years that some of it's impact has been lost.The plot has a crooked cop turned pimp losing all of his girls. He thinks they are running away, actually they are the victims of a serial killer. In a case of bad judgment he sends one of his girls to meet the guy, figuring he'd track her- but there is no cell reception and she quickly learns the terrible truth. He does to in a fashion and the chase is on, first to catch him, later to find his missing girl.Violent, bleak and occasionally darkly funny this film has been copied any number of times. For me coming late in the game (I've had the import DVD for years but only just watched it) I found it tense but not all that remarkable. As I said I see how the film radiated out to influence things like I Saw The Devil, but I also found troubles with the plot, things don't add up, and how the villain operates doesn't make a great deal of sense. I also found that once the film flips from chasing the killer to finding the girl the film loses steam.I do like the film and can recommend it, but where it once stood above the rest it now is down among the pack.Definitely worth a look, especially on a big screen where I know it will play so much better.",

The movie was critically acclaimed everywhere; even internationally. Oh boy are we in for some surprises.The movie has a very dark tone and it instantly sucks the audience into the plot. The whole plot is simplistic while disturbing and sets up a good exposition. The Chaser starts out well paced and engaging but it starts to lose focus during the second act. A lot of the suspense is dropped and it becomes a flat investigation plot that runs in circles.Rather than external anxiety, the majority of the suspense comes from the atmosphere itself. The movie is very suspenseful and horrific when it's supposed to be but it doesn't occur as often as it should. This is the reason why the climax didn't do it for me. The movie doesn't keep building and by the end it's just a violent dog fight.Most of the violence is not directly shown and is edited so that the audience can use their imagination. Points for that.The audience can relate to the characters and feel sympathetic throughout the film. The movie can be funny when it wants to be from time to time; there are some cute moments here and there especially with the child actor accompanying the protagonist. But I just hate s*** like that (when Korean movies try to add humor to a serious movie). All the characters are distinguishable at a first glimpse. The characters have a lot to work with which is why the actors do a pretty good job.The main problem with this movie is that the protagonist and the antagonist don't conflict throughout the movie as much they should. The antagonist doesn't propose much of a threat except in the exposition and the climax. He is rather a spectator and I felt that the interaction between the two was missing.The ending was subjectively bad for me. It's somewhat of a surprise and I like how it's clich\u00e9 free. However it all comes down to the point where I just don't care about anything anymore.It's not a bad film but it's certainly overrated. Hopefully the remake is better.",

It looks like some comments has been written by people who had never watched a good crime thriller. Nowadays directors and the screen writers think to satisfy the audience they just need to depict a crazy guy killing and axing innocents brutally; they do not trouble themselves by making a character believable.

            "content": "Jung-ho has gone to seed. Once a cop in Seoul's police Task Force, he now claws a dubious living pimping out girls of his 'massage parlour' business keeping them, his meat-headed assistant Meathead and sometimes dangerous clients in check with a mixture of sweet-talking, intimidation, bull-headed business-acumen and the odd beating. Imagine the cop out of Public Enemy as a pimp, and you're halfway there. Jung-ho, however, is more vexed than usual (he's a pretty surly S.O.B.) because three of his girls have absconded of late, along with his generous loans. Coincidence or bad luck? Then he gets a call from an infrequent but regular client, a chap identified by his phone number, 4885. The same client the vanished girls were last sent to. Smelling a rat, Jung-ho rushes to the rescue, or re-acquire the prostitute he just sent out to service 4885, that prostitute being a sick but absolutely devoted mother to a little girl. Blessed with both a crook's and ex-cop's savant (and a stroke of luck), Jung-ho quickly tracks down 4885: a placid, seemingly totally ordinary Ha Jung-woo. What Jung-ho doesn't know is that 4885 has already mauled his girl, and done for two Christians investigating his pad. This is an intriguing set-up; the killer is unmasked right at the start thus allowing for an unfamiliar narrative progression as Jung-ho tries to discover the killer's lair, the anti-hero as a sad-sack ex-cop pimp immediately introduces ideas of moral compromise and self-doubt, and as the film unfolds it neatly subverts our pre-conceptions of serial-killer police procedural films.Bloody, brutal and laced with that Korean tang of black humour, it's a gutsy and exciting film. I admired the excellent location cinematography, great production design which neatly (and convincingly) integrated real locations and genre flourishes such as the killer's doodling on walls, and go-ahead performances which push the film forward. There are two well-choreographed foot-chases trough dimly lit alleyways and for all the stylisation, the film manages to suspend disbelief (for the most part) thanks to the scuzzy, ordinary setting.Also very impressive is how the sub-plots of the mayor being heckled at a PR event and being daubed with faeces and the legitimate police investigation being run parallel to Jung-ho's feverish efforts. Jung-ho's moral quandary, desperation and slow self-realisation are well-conveyed; we watch him slowly but surely come to see how he is part and parcel of the system that has allowed so many young women to be murdered. The escalating tension is generated not so much by the search for the killer's lair and his impending release but Jung-ho's attempt's to redeem himself through this long, long dark night (and dawn) of the soul.On the down side, this is also quite manipulative film-making which finally doesn't have the courage of its convictions. Crucial flaws are evident in the way the director uses children to tug at our heartstrings and demonstrate how Jung's paternal instincts are being reawakened. Worse still, the film betrays one of its strongest elements: its killer. Neither terribly charismatic not outwardly menacing, Ha Jung-woo is superbly cast and gives terrific performance, a worthy counterweight to Kim Yun-seok's volatile turn. The film up-ends many of the clich\u00e9s that surround cinema's mass-murderers, showing it to be a grubby human failing rather than a super-human achievement (re: The Silence of the Lambs, Seven). But as the film continues, it reverts slightly to type, with the powers-that-be deigning the police investigation unfit (thus unleashing the killer on the innocent public again) in attempt to provoke our anti-establishment ire. This change of direction results in a act of bludgeoning violence that is gruesomely compelling, beautifully horrific and rather suspect, since it also undercuts some the sympathy that previously been extended to the victims and gives Jung-ho carte blanche to lather the sh**e out of the murdered, any pretences of moral complexity now having gone out the window. The climax is disappointing: a run-of-mill punch-up that bears too great a resemblance to the finale of Public Enemy. At the end, the film is left poised between gripping, semi-realist policier and a messy, vaguely dull genre piece.The film's stupendous success at home and rapid international distribution is cheering, but as Memories of Murder showed, film-makers can have it both ways: to be simultaneously entertaining and witty, while also incisive and caustic. The Chaser doesn't get the balance right quite as well \u0096 but it's still a very superior, thought-provoking thriller.",

Now thanks to Netflix and those who purchase the rights to distribute these films in America I've gotten the chance to watch everything Mr. Park has to offer. I've since moved on to Joon-ho Bong's work and after watching his three masterpieces: Mother, Host and Memories of Murder I decided to delve into any and all Korean drama I could find. This brought me to the easily accessible Chaser on Netflix.Chaser sports the usual gritty cinematography, conflicted anti-hero (Yun-seok Kim) and a despicable villain (Jung-woo Ha). Both of their performances are very strong, however neither truly wows, primarily because of the lack luster writing. My overall displeasure with the film lies here. Every thrilling event or spectacle seemed contrived in order to produce a scene of explicit tension. The best scenes of the film all occur out of luck (which when written, is actually just the writer deciding something is going to conveniently happen). This same trial is faced in Bong's Memories of a Murder, though the same air of realism is not found in Chaser to support the moments of happenstance. Likewise the film is also reminiscent of Kim Jee-woon's I Saw the Devil (which in fairness came after Chaser). And perhaps the failures of Chaser needed to occur so they could go further in I Saw the Devil (which had its flaws as well). The problem is that Chaser doesn't define it's own choices strong enough. It is neither subtle and sprawling as Memories nor voracious and uncompromising as Devil. It struggles with the monotony of a overused plot without the flare of anything unique or engaging.Summation: Chaser has some very intense and memorable scenes, however the artifice leading up to them is poorly managed and unforgivable. Hong-jin Na is not a terrible director and there is a good film in here somewhere, though it's likely found in either Memories of Murder or I Saw The Devil.",

The rest doesn't give any sense. And it is so surprising to read many comments with 10 points. It is misleading.",

            "content": "Hong-jin Na's The Chaser is all at once a really well played black comedy running in perfect tandem with the fact it is a brutally effective, perfectly pitched causality thriller the whole time playing out with this biting, sociopolitical slant running underneath proceedings on top of a really quite affecting character study. The film follows the South Korean capital Seoul based Joong-ho Eom (Kim), an unpleasant character; a former police officer turned pimp seemingly turned police officer again with a penchant, it seems, for long distance running. The man operates out of a small, dingy office with what appears a long suffering male employee working via several mobile phones in the process of running his prostitution business, as said employee distributes nude fliers advertising the services. Such a tactic is wholly necessary, since business has not been particularly good in the recent run what with the disappearance of numerous girls, most of whom still owe him money, Eom's enterprise is flailing. Eom's jittery mannerisms and somewhat panicked dealing with each problem and person as it arises suggests a man on the proverbial edge; his violent reaction as pimp to one of his few remaining girls as he deals with a male client wishing to illegally film his session with the young woman demonstrating his aggressive characteristic and telling us he is nary afraid to deal with a problem in such a full on, assertive manner.In amidst all of this is one of Eom's other few remaining call girls: the thin, softly spoken Mi-jin Kim (Seo); a call girl we like a little more than we might usually since she is the mother of one very young daughter, their bond or what-have-you put across via some of the daughter's drawings pinned to a fridge door in their flat. Kim is forced out to a client by Eom against her influenza influenced wishes, a job over at an apartment complex housing many which seems routine enough but is only enough to see her fall foul of a yet unmasked serial killer named Young-min Jee (Ha), whose targets are call girls and whose humiliating, sexually perverse modus operandi involving penetration of-sorts with a phallic shaped object, but not as you'd think, the film in no way is shy of showing. When the initial sequence of Kim and Jee coming together in his apartment rendered house of pain unfolds, the scene is an agonising set piece highlighting precisely what has unfolded time after time in the past without much in the way of action from those employed to stop it. The sordid interaction additionally appears prolonged, as if the inevitable is ages way; the methods the serial killer is to apply to his latest victim only really hinted at in amongst all the threat: they are demonstrated without actually being successfully carried out, and for the rest of the film the incident is successfully used as precisely the fate which awaits the helpless Kim should certain parties fail in their quests.Undercutting most of these events is an interesting tract which is more broadly linked to that of the proper authorities running around trying, and persistently failing, to find the rouge whom threw excrement at the mayor of the city. This mayor, guarded by some of Eom's ex-police friends whom anyway appear disenchanted at this political figure of authority, and his aide's attempts at trying to finger someone for a crime relatively small in comparison to other events unfolding sees Na hinting at a distinct flaw in South Korea's police procedural and politically minded system; something which begins with an important man whose bodyguards dislike him and continuing with their abject failure to correctly prioritise situations. Their panic over, and failure to deal with, such an occurrence is made all the more agonising when it is slowly revealed young women are being killed off in amidst the lower echelons of the city's underbelly.The second item is more broadly linked to that of Eom, the film going on to cover certain redemptive themes linked to him, but with the overlying idea that he is initially doing what it is he's doing because his cash flow in low and a missing call girl does little for business. This clashes with the fact a girl's life is perilously close to being ended in a desperate fashion because of his own selfishness; his misogyny initially putting him on a similar tract in this sense with the killer very early on, the disregarding of women and essential objectification of them as either tools capable of bringing money in or as victims for an ever-escalating psychotic episode effectively the two mindsets shared by both Eom and Jee. Director Na doesn't so much blur the lines that dictate Eom's apparent motivation for what it is he eventually comes to undertake in the form of a quest; instead, beginning his lead in the firm mould of an anti-hero on a set side of the proverbial line before seeing this violent and somewhat pig-headed individual having to go through a realisation process which sees him come into contact with the myth behind one of his anonymous female employees: thus effectively leading him on to deeply care for her and tempt himself into changing his ways.The film is everything a race-against-time thriller ought to be, tight; well-woven; simplistic without having to dumb-down and without anything too brash nor overcooked to have it feel overdone and convoluted. The entire thing a really well played, quite gripping thriller, in which the good guys aren't as necessarily competent nor upstanding as you might think and those of a more sordid nature are hinted at as perhaps having a mite of righteousness inside of them; Na balancing each of the strands, character plights and tones wonderfully well to produce one of the better films to have come out of the Asian region in recent years, and one of the better entries to that recent South Korean wave of films that has emerged.",

            "content": "The Chaser, original title 'Chugyeogja' is an involving yet distressing South Korean crime thriller and directorial debut for Hong-jin Na. The film centres on 'Joon-ho', an ex-detective turned pimp who begins his own investigation after his roster of prostitutes begin to mysteriously disappear. It quickly becomes evident to us, but not immediately to Joon, that his girls have been falling unfortunate victims to a psychopathic serial killer. What follows is not so much cat and mouse, but more mouse and cat and cat and mouse and mouse and cat and mouse. Na winds up the tension to almost unbearable levels, only to let you breathe again before once again putting you through the mincer. Such is the level of horror visited upon certain characters, that the film does become hard to look at. Na's film could be interpreted as being overly pessimistic, and it's impossible to deny that it doesn't weigh heavily afterwards but this story of innocence caught in a web of evil is all the more powerful for it's ugliness. In the central role of Joon-ha, Yun-seok Kim is excellent. Initial introduction paints him as a conflicted but ultimately unsympathetic man, but as events unfold and his search for the missing girls becomes increasingly frantic and more personal, he's hard not to feel warmth toward as responsibility and shame begin to catch up with him. In your average Hollywood thriller, there's often a sense of being able to relax as genre conventions can tend to dictate a kind of predictable inevitability. Not so with The Chaser and be warned, it's not going to let you off lightly. 3.5/5",

            "content": "Jung-Ho, an ex-cop turned pimp, is not too happy as he retrieves his car, abandoned by one of his girls while on a job. But Jung-Ho will never catch 'the bitch'; she has already been murdered by her last client. And, besides, Jung-Ho has other problems to deal with: he owes money he can't pay back since several of his call girls have gone missing without clearing their debts and another one, Mi-Jin, is sick.Jung-Ho forces the feverish Mi-Jin to meet a client. However, he soon figures out that this client, Young-Min, was also the last man that all the disappeared girls saw. Convinced that the guy is selling his prostitutes behind his back, Jung-Ho asks Mi-Jin to tell him the client's address as soon as she gets there. But things don't quite go as planned, given that Young-Min is into murdering, rather than selling, prostitutes\u0085 After box-office success in South Korea, and with plans for a US remake set to star Leonardo di Caprio, Hong-Jin Na's debut feature Chugyeogja - opening in the UK today as The Chaser - lives up to the hype. Don't fret if you're planning to see the movie - this potted guide to the plot is no spoiler. In this unusual thriller, the identification of the murderer, his arrest by the police and the confession of his crimes all take place in the first quarter of the movie. The 'thrill' in this thriller is that if the police do not find enough evidence to build a case against him within 12 hours, the killer will be released, free to pursue his morbid endeavours.So begins a tense race against the clock, during which the audience \u0096 who at the very start of the film get to see where Young-Min buries the corpses of his numerous victims \u0096 watch Jung-Ho and the police struggle with limited time and no other lead than a set of keys. Meanwhile, somewhere in this labyrinth of closed doors, Mi-Jin is struggling for life.The tension in The Chaser comes not from fear, but frustration: the frustration of knowing without being able to tell, the frustration of witnessing distress without being able to help, the frustration felt in the face of Jung-Ho's powerlessness and the incompetence of the police. In one scene, a psychiatrist suggests Young-Min's physical impotence is the source of his urge to kill. Ironically enough, as the narrative progresses, it seems that everyone else \u0096 the audience included - is impotent, too.Yet, however frustrated the viewer might feel, director Hong-Jin Na maintains interest by a perfectly balanced use of all the ingredients of the thriller genre, impressively mastered for a first film \u0096 crude, even cruel scenes of violence, a dark and desolate setting drenched in rain, disturbing religious elements, peculiar supporting characters. And, of course, the core of any self-respecting thriller: a serial killer and a detective, both beautifully interpreted, ambiguous yet complementary characters, whose numerous confrontations give the narrative an intense rhythm.In The Chaser, nothing is quite as one would expect. The usually heroic figure of the detective turns out to be a dirty cop turned pimp, whose investigation methods come closer to assault and battery than brainy deductions. In contrast, the serial killer looks like a socially retarded and apparently inoffensive young man - while underneath being a seriously disturbed and seemingly motiveless killer.One of the most controversial aspects is the portrayal of the police. No wonder Jun-Ho got out: these guys are clowns. Take their motivations for example. One would think that having a serial killer on their hands and a dozen missing persons would be enough to start an inquiry. But no, this is of little significance compared to the major scandal they have to deal with: the Mayor just had some human feces thrown at him during an official visit under the police's watch. Now their only preoccupation is to try and hide the scandal, and they see Young-Min's potential conviction as a welcome distraction. Only when these cops are confronted by the violence of a murder scene do they realise that it is the potential victims, not appearances, that need to be rescued.The Chaser successfully subverts the generic 'whodunnit' form and exploits the viewer's most human feelings of frustration and empathy. With humour, and a good dose of cynicism, Hong-jin Na even succeeds in adding a sharp and infuriating social commentary.This might be Hong-jin Na's first film, but it certainly won't be the last. Leonardo Di Caprio and screenwriter William Monahan (the pair have already worked together on The Departed) were wise to option the remake - although it remains to be seen whether a US version will retain the cruelty and impact of the original.by C\u00e9cile Schublin -- C\u00e9cile Schublin is a former intern at spiked.",

            "content": "Frankly... This is amateur work hiding behind great talented actors, a great edition and a great photography, but ultimately being orchestrated by a bad, green or arrogant maestro. And... a criminal story as background based on true facts camouflaging the void of its unnecessary \"unpredictable\" and annoying plot. Just to fill the \"un-plot\" concept and just to contradict the classical ones, just because. Because nowadays the hysterical alternative style of permanently surprising the spectator with an aerial sense of complexity is fashionable, to be labeled as different and modern a synonym of the director's geniality, ultimately demonstrating futileness remaining very little of it when squashed, showing its lack of juice. That's it. In fact while you're seeing this movie you feel somehow that you already know what's going to happen next: anything except what you're expecting, like a dogma. A question of practice which at some point turns to be very predictable simply because it's a succession of improbable situations extremely boring by their inconstancy. Either you are stimulated by this kind of narrative and you steep over the contend of it or you start to feel deceived. I was sincerely expecting (\"hoping\") for a momentum to come (the only possible \"salvation\" for this movie); a illumination that somehow would justify the contagious virus of stupidity which was affecting either the characters, the director, the plot and by the way myself by keeping watching it, foolishly believing: The \"hope\" is definitely fragmented when you confirm you're really watching these absurd coincidences that repeat themselves over and over, taking place on a narrative coated as real (moving camera, anti-predictable end, anti-stereotyped characters, transposition of inefficiency situations, etc.): you start to realize this is a paradoxical work of fiction of bad, stupid and sadistic taste.It reaffirms its inherent paradoxical matter when the emotional empathy with both the hero or the anti-hero and the spectator is again built upon clich\u00e9s and pastiches and not by an evolution of a realistic storytelling, hence neutralizing its pretentious realistic form.Because it's a banal technique often seen on modern alternative cinema. Because it refuses to accept simplicity although at the end uses clich\u00e9s as the essential resort for not letting the movie drown. Because this kind of pseudo-art wants to be flattered by its pseudo-geniality.This movie could be saved merely using the true kafkian reality which happens everyday, nowadays, when non-functional social organs are the direct consequence of political interests or economical strategies. It would be real, but not with such degree of improbabilities, not with a \"Ronin\" (or should I say a penitent?) with so much information sprawled on his face, in fact everyone's faces. I could see the Hero (or my own mental performance of excusing) being somehow infected by this bureaucratic virus. Several never-ending long years of disappointment and collusion with a damned spoiled system consequently transforming him into the lowest level of human exploitation, a pimp that starts to chase his salvation at the last moment being finally illuminated by the hidden secret love for his best sexual employer. The hero starts to patch his \"penitencia\" ultimately reaching his salvation by suffer. It pretends to have a spinal cord, a obvious connection to Catholic faith hypothetically (in my view) associating the extreme belief to manipulation dressing it with a \"baroque\" narrative (religious philosophy of filling empty space saturating it with the sense of God's grandiosity) narrowed by flashy glimpses of clues; it pretends to be a critical manifestation against bureaucracy, political corruption and to be against the subversion of justice and police force protection on a modern unbalanced society. It becomes an indistinctive mass that wants to have everything within it, but ultimately fails in its purpose.For me it's a pastiche of other works like \"This Country is not for Old Men\" and more directly a pale shadow of \"Memories of Murder\" which also demonstrates the Korean police force inefficiency, its submission to political agendas, the philosophical question of death penalty, and a society that had been opening its cultural doors to Christian beliefs not so long ago, but in \"Memories of Murder\", in a much much more elegantly way. Memories of Murder is a good movie, this one is pretension.",

It really does keep you on in a heightened state of suspense throughout as time ticks away for the main character. It moves along very quickly and the characters are well established and I got a real feel for the area and the locale such was the realism of the piece. That aside the story is excellent and certain plot devices work very well that in a lesser movie would have been discarded or used much less effectively. I didn't feel it was contrived and for most of the time I was completely absorbed by this fantastic film. The two leads were excellent and played off each other very well. It had a wonderful evocative atmosphere to it and this is the one thing I take away from it. A hot and rainy Seoul full of labyrinthine alleys and disorganised cops. I thought of it afterwards as being comparable with Seven. It didn't have the latter's tightness of script, lushness of cinematography and claustrophobia of the city. What it did have was two sides of the same coin in a battle of wits, a nasty serial killer with the cops running around like headless chickens and a cracking ending. Stunning. Very efficient. Thrilling. Brutal. Violent and bloody. Highly recommended. It leaves you with the taste of a great film in your mouth.",

The story itself was a wonderful ride, but not as confusing as some Korean flicks tend to be. It also shied away from the usual Korean tendency to weave together a story so abstruse that needs an explicit visual explanation towards its denouement. Instead, this is simply a driving movie that never lets up, with side-stories constantly interfering with our players best intents to motor on with their nefarious deeds, whether they be pimping their chicks or otherwise exacting their iniquitous designs. Heroes and villains alike are thick in character, some being richly complex and unlikeable, others hiding their filth behind a wall of believably simplicity. The action is so wonderfully authentic, spiced with occasional bumblings, that we come to appreciate each and every blow with with some well earned flinching. At times a tad gruesome and brutal, a Hollywood ending is definitely not in the cards. Merci beaucoup.Evil Eye Reviews",

            "content": "The Chaser (2008) :\nBrief Review -A decent serial-killer thriller with Korean realism feels better just because of true story factors. When i looked at The Chaser from cinematic aspects, i found it okay, decent actually. But when i learnt that it was inspired from real events, the entire perspective of looking at it has changed for me. I was like, there is no thrill, no suspense, why does it feel so regular and dumb? Then i realised, ohh that's how it happened in real, okay then. I don't have to ask for filmy elements now, it's just about creating the visual of those shocking real incidents. This one thing has forced me to call it a good thriller otherwise i have lot of complaints about the writing, screenplay and direction of the film. A disgraced ex-policeman who runs a small ring of prostitutes finds himself in a race against time when one of his women goes missing. It is inspired by real-life Korean serial killer Yoo Young-chul who brutally killed many girls. Somewhere, it reminded me of Hollywood Classic 'Silence Of The Lambs' (1991) where similiar kind of impotent man kills young girls. But that film was very detailed about the reasons and immensely thrilling with some psychological tricks. Here, The Chaser does not provide any concrete reasons for the crimes and even for the protagonist's heroism. It could be relative to those real events i don't know but i would have liked it more if the writer had used cinematic liberty correctly with some dramatic and fictional changes. Anyways, let it be. The actors are considerably good, the screenplay is little dragged in the second half, the dialogues are decent, the cinematography is nice and the direction is okay. This is one of the rare occasions when i loved the Bollywood Remake more than the original Korean Flick. Murder 2 came out really well with proper reasoning and emotional bonding. The Chaser might have looked better if had seen it 13 years ago, now after watching thousands of Classics, I didn't find anything special about it.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",

            "content": "There are a handful of moments in The Chaser \u2013 the feature-length debut of Korean director Na Hong-Jin - that tease its audience with smirking conventionality: We watch a sweet but sickly prostitute traipse into the proverbial lion's den and a good-natured but worldly pimp extemporaneously take an orphaned girl under his wing and we momentarily feel the film slipping from its director's control. The slipperiness, however, eventually defines the movie's milieu. The Chaser is a clever riff on cops-and-criminals formalism that interpolates old-fashioned plot devices (a missing girl, a cryptic phone number, an epicene serial killer, a corrupt mayor) into a Borgesian web of forking paths and gleeful McGuffins, ultimately deriving its primary tension not from the vulgarity of corporeal harm - though there's plenty of that both off-screen and on - but from a lust for inductive discovery that, at most times, refuses to teeter on the precipice of genre clich\u00e9.Jung-ho (Kim Yoon-suk, an intriguingly complex anti-hero), is a disgraced ex-cop who has turned his hand to pimping and now runs a stable of girls in Seoul's red-light district. When his escorts keep disappearing, Jung-ho suspects the worst, unaware that he has just sent his best girl Mi-jin straight into the hands of creepy serial killer Young-min (Jung-woo Ha making a deliciously wicked sociopath). When he realizes his mistake, Jung-ho tracks down the killer, but Mi-jin is nowhere to be seen. Worse, the police can't hold Young-min without evidence, so Jung-ho uses his old sleuthing skills to frantically search for Mi-jin \u2013 not knowing whether she's alive or dead. Yoon-suk approaches the ensuing chick-hunt with vaguely frustrated amusement, as though he can't quite entirely believe his career has been reduced to the fretful need for sellable bodies, and even after learning of his chattel's grisly resting place, he expresses compassion like a fleeting form of emotional exhaustion.To say anything more would be a sin, since the story unfolds with the kind of unexpected twists you won't see coming. 'The Chaser' lets loose with a jolt every few minutes, from a gross-out torture sequence to the death of an innocent that leaves us gasping. However, in between moments of chisel-hacking horror, there is some impressively dark humor and top-notch acting. But be warned \u2013 emotionally this movie will reach deep into the pit of your stomach and wriggle your guts about before wrenching them out. Just as the lead character avoids the soft pain of sympathy by remaining passionate about his seedy profession, Hong-Jin Na reserves his cheeky ardor for subtle displays of craftsmanship. His superb direction ensures that the film remains suspenseful on a number of different levels, by sustaining an atmosphere of rhythmically festering futility without the possibility of facile redemption.The Chaser is a superbly directed, thoroughly gripping and morally twisted crime thriller that's worth every minute of your time!",

It certainly gets points for trying.A clear evisceration of Police incompetence and to a lesser extent, the sex-trade, CHASER makes nary a misstep right up until the final quarter, when coincidence and melodrama, heretofore tightly controlled, seem to slip out of hand. I cannot convey how much i hate it every time this happens.It is Yun-Seok Kim's kinetic lead performance that anchors this movie. His moral crisis is palpable and his desperation is entirely believable. The audience feels just as helpless as he does, and as time continues to run out, the suspense is masterfully maintained. The film's attempts at addressing some big ideas are commendable and mostly it succeeds, but the overly sentimental and improbable final series of events just squanders some well-earned authenticity (the unnecessary single-frame inserts of the recently deceased girl and her daughter are a case in point).One other constantly niggling nitpick is the colossal level of physical violence the characters seem to be able to absorb. This becomes altogether absurd during the final showdown.CHASER just barely misses an 8/10 in my book, but is still recommended to fans of the genre.",

It's an outcry to the flawed justice system, the incompetent law enforcers, and the corrupted politicians. I love the authenticity the film managed to accomplished. There's no fancy, choreographed fighting sequences - just men brawling and running and chasing. There's no superman-saved either. Another thing I like about this movie is how it doesn't have the clich\u00e9 \"good\" guy entirely good. Joong-ho's an a**shole, a heartless pimp. He only comes to term with himself when he meets Min-jin's daughter. He realizes the precious emotional attachment between them. I was so drawn into the movie that I could feel the agonizing frustration, it was almost tangible, that they all know who the killer is. In fact, he's sitting right in the police depot detailing his slaughtering method while one of his victim is left for death (she's pretty too, and it just adds more fuel to the fire) but the cops can't do no sh*t to him due to unprovable evidences in court and time constrain. It is a brutal and intense cat and mouse game that would paralyze you on the seat, catch you out of breath, tense your nerve, race your heart, sweat your palms, and dry your mouth. It is a 2-hour breath-taking ride thank to the exceptional acting of the lead actors, an amazing script (based on the true story), and an ending that no one would expect and it is hard to accept. I have never seen any movies that drain me, both emotionally and physically, so much like this movie does. Although this movie does posses entertaining value, it's not the kind of flick that would relax and put you at ease after a long day at work. It will stress you out. A relentless movie. A true gem.

But at the same time, it feels like it goes too far. The amount of coincidences and stupid decisions from the characters is almost too unbelievable. It should be so simple to catch and keep hold of the bad guy, but somehow they can never quite do it, which again, also leads to the tragicomedy nature of many of these films which is so entertaining, but also a little ridiculous and infuriating.I think whenever you watch foreign films, no matter how hard you try, you miss a little something, and I would say I probably don't fully understand or appreciate what exactly this film was getting at. What am I supposed to feel? That no matter what you do, providence always has a way of intervening? That life is unsatisfying and that there are never any clear and clean answers and things are never quite as simple and rational as we hope?All of this being said, of course it is an excellent movie. Well made, dramatic, but also very funny at parts, and I guess this review is proof that it makes you think. But the ending will leave you feeling somewhat unsatisfied, which might be the point.",

            "content": "\"The Chaser\" is a exceptional example of Korean cinema at it's finest. Magnificent cinematography, odd twists of dark humor injected in the most unexpected moments, and the beautifully-crafted and often visceral violence. Finally, \"The Chaser\" boasts a plot that twists and turns, presenting 'the third act' in 'the first act' of the film, offering a truly unique and engaging thriller unlike any you've ever seen. The film is a police procedural with a difference: The hero is an ex-cop named Jung- ho (Kim Yoon-suk), now a pimp, and he is only interested in making a buck. He is angered because a client of his call-girl service has been, he believes, kidnapping his girls and selling them. When another girl disappears, a phone number raises an alarm. He then sets out to track down the client. Playing his counterpart is Ha Jung- woo as the serial killer--a much more traditional leading man in South Korean films. Despite Jee being quickly identified as the killer, there is not enough time (for anyone), nor is there any desire to make any sort of psychological attempt at discovering the motives of this serial killer. He lives simply moment to moment, and kills at will. The film's structure is relentless in maintaining suspense throughout without resorting to big explosions, or long, extended fight scenes. The greatest strength of \"The Chaser\" is the fact that, despite what might sound like a familiar premise, it never plays out as expected--with Na weaving a complex and expertly crafted web of twists and turns. Self-serving motivations soon trump concerns for justice, but the pessimism of Na's slick debut never breaks false. Na consistently defies convention, revealing the identity of the killer early on. He makes perfectly clear what the killer is capable of, and then further flouting with form by bringing the two leads into direct confrontation early in the first act, and allowing the chase to begin.",

There's menacing atmosphere to its from dawn to dusk struggle, which is strangely inviting in its occasional humorous tone. The premise of serial killer is straightforward, but it has subtle details, the eerily real life feel in the streets and closed doors.It focuses on a retired officer now branching to the other side of the law as a pimp. He loses girls on frequent basis recently, and while this man is the crude anti-hero, he's still protective of his girls, for many reasons. He decides to investigate it and soon finds out that a client might be involved, and so the night turns into a figurative and literal chase before the client gets another victim.Acting is really well done throughout, the former detective looks very brash and unkempt, although he is completely driven to solve this case. The antagonist appears to be a man without empathy, he might look dazed or startled when faced against adversities, yet there's a hint that he would snap at a moment notice without even realizing the gravity of his actions.Another good thing is the use of locations. The movie never seems far fetch, the situations are well designed and they do resemble the quiet time or bustling area. There's a slight tone of humor as well, the occasional banters give more respites even though the case gradually becomes more sinister.\"The Chaser\" is a compellingly dark story, unapologetic for its bold moments and entirely riveting for one night stand.",

In fact, as this scene unwound I began to think 'here we go again', but Hong-jin Na, in his debut picture, uses that intriguing but mediocre start as a solid base around which the rest of the film unfolds.The performances in this film are generally. The supporting actors have a few OTT arm wavers reminiscent of certain Stephen Chow films but the main performances, the guys who we see on screen the most, are, in the main, solid. The only exception being the guy who played the character 'Meathead'.At first you care not for the fact that Joong-ho (Yung-seok Kim) seems to think that his call girls are being sold to other pimps. He's a pimp, we should not love him. And his crusade to find the owner of the magic '4885' number does appear bent more personal wealth than interest for the girls. But then, Mi-jin (Yeonh-hi Seo) goes missing and in his thick eared approach to find Mi-jin, Joong-ho discovers that Mi-jin's disappearance has left her daughter Eun-ji 'home alone'. Out of character, but key to the film, Joong-ho takes Eun-ji into his indifferent care. One scene where the fate of Mi-jin is unsuspectingly laid out in the presence of Eun-ji is particularly upsetting.As Joong-ho attempts to find his 'property' he aided and abetted by a Korean police force that would be better suited to some kind of farce. Incompetent, lazy, disorganised............these are some of their better adjectives. Joong-ho's fate with the police is not helped by the fact that he is a disgraced copper himself who looks for help within a paranoid organisation more concerned, it would seem, about self interest, than solving crimes and banishing evil.And there is much evil in this film, from Joong-ho himself as a struggling pimp, to the state prosecutor who seems more intent on being a defence attorney, to the main evil of the film, Jung-woo Ha, played expertly by Young-min Jee.The story meanders slightly at the start of the last third of the story which knocked a mark of for me, but it was a minor complaint for a film that captured my attention for the full 2hrs.I'd recommend this film without hesitation.",

The look of the movie was low-budget, the directing was pedestrian, and the only enjoyable aspect of the movie was the comedy.The cast was decent, so the movie's mediocrity can't be blamed on the actors. The plot and pacing seemed the fundamental weakness. The story kind of lumbered along and the conduct of the protagonist, the villain, and the police seemed frequently hard to believe.As a B-movie, it's alright, but if you're looking for something gripping there are many much better Asian crime dramas out there. The movie is currently rated 7.9 out of 10, which seemed absurdly high to me.",

            "content": "This film wouldn't exist if a South Korean pimp wasn't protective of his ho's.Now I'm not saying for a second that he cares for them in any special way that isn't directly related to either their lady-bits or the income generated by same \u2013 in fact he drags one off her sickbed demanding she get back to work (I guess his argument may have been \"Well you're already on your back, might as well be getting' paid!\") \u2013 but if Jung-Ho didn't order a search for the missing Mi-Jin a dangerous serial killer might just have gone about his merry depraved way.Yep The Chaser is a serial killer movie, but not in the standard sense. We meet the killer early and he never makes much attempt to hide his identity or true nature once it becomes clear he is in trouble. The film becomes more about whether the gruff and disagreeable pimp Jung-Ho will find his 'staff', if the afore-mentioned 'staff member' Mi-Jin will survive or if the bad guy Ji Young-Min will get away\u0085 or get his just desserts.It is here that there is little doubt, Ji Young-Min deserves everything coming to him. He finds his targets in various brothels and parlours around the city, then casually has them drive him back to his residence. Once inside he cares little if they realise he isn't your standard client (the bloodied tufts of hair and scalp in the bathroom are a bit of a giveaway). The house is locked tight and soundproof enough that struggle is irrelevant and merely energy wastage.25ish Ji Young-Min has no special trick or trait that makes him especially original or memorable, nor does he standout due to his appearance, he is average height build and looks. But Ji Young-Min is a straight up nasty guy. His tools of the trade are quite literally tools, he tells the girls what will happen and gets to it. Later on he calmly explains the ins and outs to the police force in graphic detail, so calmly that they aren't positive he isn't just having them on.After a (little too) coincidental meeting that lands both the killer and pimp in the police station for questioning the fun really starts. Jung-Ho is an ex-cop who didn't exactly leave the force in a blaze of glory, so his ex colleagues are loathe to believe that Ji Young-Min is really the man responsible for three of his women going missing. Ji on the other hand initially and persistently claims that he was randomly assaulted for no reason, eventually though his web of lies and evidence start catching up with him, at which time he becomes far more truthful and co-operative, opening up about a series of unsolved murders from previous years.Many further complications arise when the several bodies that are alleged to exist aren't found. Is Ji really a mass murderer or merely a wannabe that claims to be one as Jung-Ho believes? The political side of the police force also raises its head when lawyer's ponder if the whole thing hasn't been trumped up to distract the media from a recent \u2013 and very public \u2013 embarrassment to the force.To top all this off Mi-Jin's young daughter gets involved, and despite his better judgment Jung-Ho finds himself ferrying her around as he continues his search. (Whether the rest of his ho's got the day off is never mentioned, they must be a trustworthy bunch.) This isn't a case of the gruff guy learning to love and care, Jung-Ho is not the sensitive parenting type and doesn't convert along the way.Phew. It really is that complicated but it is all held together pretty well by strong performances and some effective chase sequences.I found the 2 major coincidences that occur near the end and the start just a little too much to bear \u2013 even though this is purported to be based on a true story, whatever that means these days \u2013 and the continued inability of the police force to make logical decisions was frustrating to me as a viewer, it would obviously be even worse if this was the 'true' part! The action holds it all together though, some foot chases through the streets and alleys of the city are especially exciting and will leave you breathless, and that's before the finale; a blood-soaked no holds barred doozy of a contest between two men with absolutely everything to lose.Also don't expect a Hollywood style happy ending, as in real life the good guy doesn't always win, the innocents aren't always saved and the bad guy sometimes gets his way. This is South Korean after all, the land of Sympathy for Mr Vengeance and The Host.Final Rating \u2013 7.5 / 10. An amazing looking, well acted serial killer film that is actually more a 2 hour adrenalin-fueled chase flick through the back alleys of a South Korean city.",

It is such a shame though as the originals are rarely bettered and I can think of no other reason than some people are too lazy to read subtitles, so they make an American version. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the Departed but I find it hard to believe that anyone from the UK, Australia, Europe, the US or anywhere outside of Korea for that matter would not enjoy the original version of The Chaser.The acting is very good and as is so often the case with Korean cinema, the cinematography is faultless. The plot keeps you gripped and doesn't let up until the credits roll. There are a few twists and turns along the way and I enjoyed an experience of complete escapism throughout this movie.I am often lost for words with Asian movies. I'm not sure if it is because I have seen so many US movies but I find them fairly predictable and I often figure everything out long before the end of the film. Asian cinema is often a different beast though. I think this may be down to the fact that they pull no punches and are not scared to shock the audience. Again, this movie had a finale which I truly did not expect. I don't want people reading this to think that I am having a pop at US movies. Far from it! I just find that whenever I watch an Asian movie, I think about it for days, if not weeks afterwards, something that I have rarely been able to say since such classics as The Usual Suspects and The Shawshank Redemption.I think the fact that so many Asian movies are being remade in Hollywood, including this one, paints it's own picture.Don't wait for the remake, you will not regret it! 10/10",

If you saw the movie and became enraged by the level of \"stupidity\" and \"nonsense\" in the plot - especially the ending, and if you are also thoroughly disgusted by the the unnecessary violence, so much so that you feel like this is just another wannabe noir movie that is just all gore and no substance, please sit back, take a deep breath and ask yourself, when was the last time you were this emotionally engaged??sure white chicks was bad but you didn't despise it so much you had to log on IMDb and warn other people about it right? the truth is however empty the plot was, the final delivery was thought provoking: the good doesn't win, there is no happy ending. You are presented with a couple one dimensional characters, that, unlike fincher's characters, are not exactly full of personalities, and while in-depth character development may give fincher movies that extra layer of sensitivity, the lack of it actually adds to realism, which in the chaser's case, made the tragic ending even more spectacular. anyways the point is maybe you don't have to be entertained all the time, if you reacted to it, maybe the movie may have just done something right.",

Or is it a satirical indictment of South Korea's incompetent and corrupt police force? Hong-jin Na, making his directorial debut, handles both elements with skill, and they do gel somewhat. But at times it feels that The Chaser is suffering from the cinematic equivalent of multiple personality disorder: it thinks it's two films.Both films follow Joong-ho Eom (Yun-seok Kim), an ex-cop turned pimp whose girls have been disappearing recently; he thinks someone's selling them. When he gets a call from the guy he thinks is doing the selling, Joong-ho sends Mi-jin Kim (Yeong-Hie Seo), telling her to text him the address. But before she can, Mi-jin finds out that the client, Young-min Jee (Jung-woo Ha), isn't selling Joong-ho's girls \u0096 he's killing them.Mi-jin now lies dead in a filthy bathroom. But Joong-ho thinks she's only been sold, so he sets out to track down Young-min and get her back. He finds the killer fairly quickly, and proceeds to beat him up, for which he is promptly arrested. Though at the station Young-min confesses to the murders of Joong-ho's girls, the police are more concerned with saving face (a protester has just thrown feces at the mayor, for which someone needs to take the blame) than with convicting a wanted serial killer.It's these interactions between Joong-ho, Young-min and the police that really stand out in The Chaser. Not that the gritty cat-and-mouse game is badly done; it's handled quite capably by Hong-jin Na. But these parts of the film try too hard to be like other violent thrillers, like those of Chan-wook Park's Vengeance trilogy.The police procedural aspect of The Chaser, however, does seem unique. Maybe it isn't in South Korea; perhaps the South Korean box office is jam-packed with scathing satires of the police. But such comedies in the West are rarely, if ever, so critical or cynical. The obsession with a slight incident with the mayor over a confessed serial killer; senior officers demanding that vital evidence is fabricated; and roomfuls of police shouting obscenities at each other and the suspects \u0096 The Chaser does not paint a pretty picture of its national police force.Of course, I call it a satirical, but it's hard to tell if this is an accurate representation of law enforcement in South Korea. The small West Midlands audience with whom I watched The Chaser certainly found it a humorous representation; but I doubt that any of them, myself included, knew if they were watching something that even remotely resembled reality.That's the problem with exporting films to foreign markets: they'll be subject to completely different cultural climates to that in which they were made. Which is why I'm already curious about the American remake that has been announced. It'll be interesting to see if it retains The Chaser's odd and sometimes jarring mix of thriller and comedy, but I doubt it will. American cinema tends to like its thrillers less violent, and its satires less scathing.",

The mood had been set and the story was ready to unfold, but it just didn't, and started to become farcical.This was supposed to be a dark grizzly thriller and it created that setting perfectly, shooting it almost entirely at night, the grizzly cut scenes to the killers house, the blood and brutality. But this was its only success.The South Korean Police Force maybe flawed, but in this movie they were portrayed as bumbling clowns. The director tried to get a laugh out of them, and this didn't fit with the nature of the film, a true story about a brutal serial killer and an inept criminal justice system.The film itself is filled with so many unexplained mysteries and so many implausible situations. Whilst they may have really occurred, the director fails to transfer this honestly to the screen.The film leaves you with more questions than answers, I know some critics will say, \"It's a true story, its what really happened\". But this isn't enough. If you're going to make a film there has to be a satisfactory resolution to the questions asked in the film, and that can only be answered by the film.The film itself does contain mystery and suspense, enough to stop you from switching it off, and at times it does draw you in, but the excitement fizzles out slowly.If you're a fan of Asian cinema then I would recommend it, I'm sure some fans will love this movie, I loved it it for about 40% of the time. It will become an important part of Korean cinema & culture. For fans it is worth a watch. But if you don't watch many Asian films, steer clearMy Favs/Recommends 1. Twilight Samurai (Japan) 2.

Story line is fairly complex, characters nicely developed throughout , grate foot chase scenes, good cinematography with lots of night scenes (with none of the midnight FM shakiness)Storyline is about how the life of an ex-cop, a pimp, runs into coincidently a suspected serial killer.I don't think there's a gun fired in this but some of the scenes are pretty violent. what works is how you the audience are slowly tied to the emotion of the chaser(s) in trying to discover the nest of the killer. What also helps is the pimp seems to have a conscience. Along with the down and out ex-cop. With the backdrop of police image problem to a recent mishandling of a case. The details are there to provide a sense of boundary, and control.The tension comes from you see the hideout from the beginning, you know the killer from the beginning. And it is because you are given more information then the 'chasing' characters, you want them to find out quicker then usual. But the story holds it back.

I said a korean silence of the lambs (even tho it's not silence of the lambs) bcuz it's korea's best serial killer movie ever made to what America's best serial killer movie is. Anyways give it a watch if you can find the english dub version the voice over in this one was done well or just read the subtitles if you don't mind. The ending is absolutely INSANE!!! Check it out.",

The characters hooked me, especially the lead. The claustrophobic nature of the inner city hill-side suburbs adds to the atmosphere - much the way foggy London does for the story of Jack The Ripper.I gave the first half 9 and the second half 7 (mostly due to some plot weakness) but the acting is a 10 and I found myself fully engaged until the end.",

He is moved to help by her daughter, and his own guilt in being the one to put her in harm's way.With a normal Hollywood directing job, this would be a standard story about how the pimp rediscovers himself as a detective. Since this is a Korean film, it is much more than that. There is still the underlying theme of the pimp redeeming himself, but it's a suggestion, not a constantly repeated device that's jammed down the audience's throat. There is a large amount of dark humor in the movie, especially near the beginning, where constant comical misunderstandings and coincidences make the situation no less tense. The killer is made even more sinister by his incompetence, a big stretch from the standard superhuman serial killers in American films who all too often seem all knowing and all powerful.Things never slow down, and the movie never quite lets go of its distinctive sense of humor (consider that that Mayor of Seoul is ambushed by a man wielding his own feces--and this has consequences for the police trying to prosecute the killer).Although there is a lot of humor, this is a violent movie, and it does not shy away from its inevitable conclusion. Sadly, there's already an American remake in the works. Don't see that one, it will be bad. See this one instead, it's the best movie I've seen in a long time.",

In fact, this john has been straight up wasting them because he's a serial killer. So when the pimp ex-cop tells the prostitute with the flu to memorise the guy's address and text it to him from the shower when she gets there the plan goes belly up and we end up with a something of an unpleasant situation.This film looks like it's going to be all action and brawling and it does start out that way, but the mid-section is mostly procedural drama. That sounds boring but it's so smoothly handled, whilst remaining dramatic and unpredictable, that you won't get bored.There is plenty of violence, lots of twists and turns and funny moments. The fact that the serial killer was based on a real-life one adds a creepy vibe to the whole thing. Definitely recommend this one.",

While at times it does remind us of Se7en, the treat here is a bit different. The Chaser's directing is undeniably very good. Photography and filming are a feast to the eyes. Plus, The Chaser doesn't forget to make itself believable: details like the main character running and slipping on the floor while chasing a suspect getting up instantly will make you interested on the uncertainty of that chase's outcome, as of the plot's outcome. And that is only an example. However, this is also The Chaser's flaw. While trying to be realistic, there are periods where the movie stalls, ruining the pace with more details, inconsequent characters are introduced, and one or two plot holes give themselves up. The Chaser is a quality crime thriller, even if it builds up too much expectations to end up flattening them. Visit thefadingcam blog for more!",

Both of them show them show the same internal message at times, the corrupt police system and the ultra corrupt political system.'Salinui chueok' had a mystic element in the scenes with rain in them and ditto here too!.Definitely the director was inspired from 'Salinui chueok'.But all this ends here.This movie is far different from 'Salinui chueok' in many ways. While half way through the movie, I intended to give it a 7/10. When three fourths of the movie finished, I intended to give it an eight. When there was still 15 minutes left for the film to complete, I thought to give it a nine. But when the movie ended, I gave it a straight TEN!Everything is perfect in the movie, right from the cast to the music. The screen play is one of the best in times. I think the serial killer in the movie is the most blood-curdling serial killer ever on celluloid. And the actor who played the serial killer (Jung-woo Ha) is charismatic in the role of the serial killer and so is Yun-seok Kim in the role of the pimp who goes in search of his missing prostitutes. The way the scenes develop is interesting and at times you have to anticipate at the edge of the chair to guess what happens next and for all the time the director delivers the thrills.The chasing scenes are well done but a few parts seem extremely filmy like the one in the interrogation room, where the interrogating officer brags the suspect as an impotent man, and also the scene in which the killer goes to the same market where his victim is hiding. But I forgave these filmy parts for the deft handling of the climax. I was wondering as in many cases before many directors have smudged the climax of many good movies and I was expecting the director to smudge this movies climax too but it didn't happen. The climax is so well made that you would feel like standing up and salute the screen in respect to the director who made this movie.The kid who played the prostitutes child was simply mind blowing, considering her age she did an extraordinary job.The killing scenes are very brutal and at times even exceed the level of brutality shown in David Fincher's movie 'Se7en'. There are innumerable examples of great film making in this movie and 1000 words aren't enough to describe them!. Watch this for yourself and see the greatest crime/serial killer movie EVER made in the history of world cinema.Note: I heard that this movie is being remade in English.If so please do avoid the English version and go for the Korean version as it is more raw in detail and expression. And usually with the exception of 'The Departed' all other remakes have been considerable duds at the box office.I would conclude saying that, this movie is only for people who respect Koreans and their life style and culture. If you find their appearance annoying or their speech cacophonous then please stay away from this majestic piece of cinema as you would do more insult to it and also for people who watch movies with a sensible thought!.'Chugyeogja' is the BEST crime/serial killer/police drama movie ever made, watch it for yourself and experience the adrenaline ride on your own!",

Joong-ho is a dirty detective turned pimp in financial trouble as several of his girls have recently disappeared without clearing their debts. While trying to track them down, he finds a clue that the vanished girls were all called up by a same client whom one of his girls is meeting with right now. The plot stems around an amoral ex-cop turned pimp who after losing some of his \"working girls\" decides to track down & find the client behind this. He ends up finding himself involved in more than he bargained for, with the client being a serial killer, & its then a chase to find his last girl sent to him whilst the police also try to pin him down but are hampered by legal red tape & politics. Excellent thriller IFC made excellent choice with this one except I cant believe it did not make really big hit when it played here in USA. Must not have been that big of a release. A little gory but overall really believable. Film is based on a real serial killer episode in Korea. I guess the actual killing were even more gruesome than presented here. Old Boy & Memories of Murder were my all time fave Korean films but no longer this one is TOPS. The film is really Korean thru & thru & does not have much of a linear structure. The way it is filmed & cut & the way the story is presented doesn't conform to the way many Americans think genre clues should be presented but that is what makes this a really truly great film! It is in many ways a shocking film & even film goers in Korea were shocked. Parts of the film were problematic for me by allowing silly coincidences & the having characters making dumb decisions (creating or ignoring certain facts & logic of mind) however here I just suspend my belief & let the complete enjoyment of the film come thru. Highly recommended don't miss it. There are a lot of negative reviews about this film & I obviously don't agree. Read Roger Eberts review of this film.",

For me it was more a resemblance of modern BBC TV Detective dramas. The Chaser (a 2010 remake) is slick, deep and packing intelligence, emotion and multi-level story into what is an ex cop enters a serial killers world.It is shot well, with great South Korean filmography in feel and character. It is deep, engaging, entertaining and well cultured. The plot involves an ex policeman turned prostitute guardian (pimp). One of his girls goes missing, captured by a twisted customer, who has scared girls before, who turns out to be a serial killer. As the police detain the killer there is a race to find the imprisoned last victim, as she is till alive in an unknown house. More of the killer's character is unraveled, whilst ex-cop Jung-ho has to look after the victim's young daughter, helping to save her mother before it is too late. All of this is shot well in a gritty, but greatly real, Mangwan in Seol at night amongst the streets, back allies and shady homes near the mountains.If you are into World Cinema and these style of cat and mouse detective dramas, then this film will please fans. I do feel sorry that it suffers from top-billing and raving reviews as a cult gem, when it was for me slick and well produced, rather than being anything special, unique or extra-ordinary. The film is slow, long (2 hours) and thus an asking watch, but a debatable worthwhile one none the less.",

While cathartic to see the outside \"chaser\" freed to pursue the sadistic criminal on his own terms, the film does a beautiful job of showing how such free-form retribution can be as counter-productive as it is unethical. However, at the end of the film when I found myself whispering, \"Do it, just do it\" as a hammer was poised over the suspect's head, I realized even an anti-capital punishment, ACLU lovin' middle-aged teacher from Ohio can be lulled into the catharsis of violent retaliation- well, at least on film.

It turns out the same customer has a connection, and not only, with all the other girls that disappeared from work of duty. Now a whole police force is set loose on finding Mi-jin Kim and some clue's.Joong-ho's character played by (Yun-seok Kim) is really well performed, such as the character of the little girl.That kid has potential. The storyline started slow, but after half an hour you had to try hard figuring out what's the relation between the two case's, at that point i got lost, but after a while the movie puts you right back in.It's grotesque style reminded me of (Chan-wook Park's) Old Boy. The only part i didn't really get was when the kid was found beaten up.What was that?To get to the point.This movie despite of being a real story, which is really sad, has an amazing casting, storyline and film crew, who created a must see for everyone that just dares to watch a worthy foreign movie thats so hard to find these days.I'm really looking forward for some new work of this Director and hope Hollywood stops being so shameful and learns something from this one.Well Done.",

The film presents two characters that are so opposite that we could say that they are the protagonist and the perfect antagonist, both men enter a fascinating and captivating cat and mouse game, with each sequence and new track that discover did the tension increases, this is partly thanks to a script so intelligent and intricate that at no time seems to stop, although from the beginning we know the culprit, taking into account that in thrillers of serial killers is a routine that the clues are given to us as the characters discover it, but it is not a universal rule for the films since The Chaser tells us who the murderer is from the first moment, however the characters they live an intricate story behind the murderer who seems to be a master and disturbed mind.The film does not give us a puzzle like most thrillers but a fight of moralities and incredibly twisted characters, the characters obviously had to be written in this way so they could fit into the movie's history. I don't remember having so much anxiety and anguish in just the first 30 minutes of a movie, this is just the preamble to the true story full of smart twists, situations ranging from the hilarious to the grotesque and a depressing representation of the streets of Seoul and its incompetent police forces.",

Just speechless.Loosely based on the true crime that rocked South Korea in 2004 about a cannibalistic serial killer who targeted mostly old rich men and prostitutes, we are thrown in a nasty yet masterful piece of filmmaking.Na Hong-jin directs a crime thriller about an ex-detective turned pimp who personally investigates his missing prostitutes and (to him), more importantly, where his money has disappeared to. He then stumbles upon the person doing all of this and it turns out worse than ever.Ha Jung-woo, who plays the serial killer, is downright scary, sadistic and thrilling. Incredible acting. Never have I wanted to see someone get hit so much in a film and that just shows how damn good his acting is. Kim Yoon-seok plays the ex-detective that plays right out of a film noir. A damaged and violent yet sympathetic human being. The two leads are just amazing to watch.Korean films seem to be dominating the film world right now with their uncompromising, brutal and very real look at modern day society. Not just in South Korea, but every country. But it's not always too bleak as there is plenty of dry, dark humour in these films. Here we have a masterpiece. A psychologically terrifying, film noir about two different yet harrowing journeys. An artistic masterpiece.",

Let me clarify: -The innocent woman dies.-She gets killed. -Brutally murdered (basically twice).-There is no happily ever after. -The murderer does not get what he deserves in the end.Don't waste an hour and a half hoping to see a good ending, the little daughter is left without a mother, alone. The mother goes through the most horrific experience of her life, and then just when you think she's escaped, surprise! She gets absolutely beaten to death. Just awful. If you want to see something this tragic and depressing, just read/listen to the news every once in awhile. There's already enough sad endings in real life, movies are meant to be entertaining and enjoyable to watch, and seeing that ending certainly made this movie one of my least favorite movies of all time.",

The Chaser follows the formulaic Se7en conventions;the film never transcends the genre. However, despite having a generic plot, the film manages to be entertaining with its excellent direction, and with the successful mixture of genres. The direction is astounding-- all the chase sequences are complicated, yet remain easy to follow. Like the most of the \"Korean New Wave\" films, it blends many different genres. In instances, it is horror, while in others it is comedy. The genre smashing never get out of control: it appears natural to the personality of the characters. Despite being an entertaining,the film fails to reach greatness. The film simply contains too many directorial clich\u00e9s that could of been easily avoidable.

I feel though that I should touch upon some things that I noticed that people aren't bringing up. This is a very very cookie cutter Korean film, it is nothing like a Hollywood film and that is attractive and probably why it is getting so many 10/10. 1. slapstick comedy and bumbling sidekicks in a suspense/thriller movie. You cant keep suspense up forever because the audience gets numb to it, but that doesn't mean you need to alternate between suspense and dumb & dumber every time. 2. The unwilling hero at odds with the police is far too common. The character grows from abrasive to lovable as the move progresses. 3. Everyone is broken, there are no winners just people who lose more than others. 4. The little girl in distress to tug at our heartstrings. None of these things make a movie bad, in fact they may all make a movie better but its when you keep seeing this formula that you start realizing you are just watching the Korean clich\u00e9 of a Hollywood movie. Being different than the west is expected but being a formula that the Koreans are used to does not get you a 10/10. Being a formula doesn't make it a bad movie either. The main character is great, the little girl does a great job as well. The story of how he is caught is interesting and the fact that they didn't need to wrap it up in a happily ever after is much appreciated. Other than some minor plot holes this movie doesn't fail me in any other way than making me suspiciously aware that I have seen this all before.",
