            "content": "I went into this expecting a bad movie, you could say I was hoping for the best but expecting the worst. I'm a fan of Jason Statham which made me want to see it despite my expectations, plus I work at a theatre and see movies for free which makes me less picky about the movies I watch.Now I don't typically leave reviews for movies, but after seeing this I felt that I needed to warn people. Up until tonight, I'd never seen a movie directed/produced by this Uwe Boll guy and believe me, as I write this I wish that was still the case. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie and you realize it within the first ten minutes. The cast is brutal, Statham, Liota and Reynolds are all laughable as the main characters. The evil army of 'Krug' reminded me of the dudes in monkey suits in the early Planet of the Apes movies. During action scenes you see the same shot over and over again as if they only had one shot of 'bad guy hit by arrow'. Even the props were bad, Stathams sword looked like something you'd give a six year old on Halloween.I don't even know if I can accurately put into words how bad this movie is. The best way to describe this pile is to piture you and your friends trying to remake 'lord of the rings' in your backyard, because what you ended up with would be of similar quality.If you read this review, don't make the same mistake I did. Don't watch it to see if it is as bad as the guy on the IMDb said it was. This movie should only be shown to criminals in jail as further punishment for their crimes.",

There is no way that anyone sane would think this movie was anything more than laughable tripe.I saw it at a preview, and have to say that I was expecting much more. I didn't realize that Ewe Boll was directing, otherwise I would have skipped it altogether (he should never be allowed near a camera, ever). However, I like nearly every star, enjoy the genre and have been a big fan of the video games for years now, so I figured that this would be worth seeing (nothing will ever compare to LOTR, but it sounded promising).So yeah, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said here already. Horrible dialog, two-dimensional characters, lousy cinematography, cheesy effects and a plot which is nearly impossible to care about makes this one worth skipping.Seriously, don't pay to see this. It will only encourage them to give Ewe more projects.",

The way the film is shot is in an incredibly shoddy and repetitive manner, and the film is one of the most ineptly directed films I have seen in years. And if that wasn't any worse, just listen to the dialogue, which is so clunky and juvenile. The story is too thin for the running time and the pacing is constantly on and off, while the characters are clich\u00e9d and I felt indifferent to every single one of them. The scenery is gaudy, likewise with the costumes, while the props look like fancy dress items more than anything else. The acting is also dreadful, Burt Reynolds and Ron Perlman can't do anything with their roles, Jason Statham is handsome and charismatic but his acting range is limited here and I have never seen Ray Liotta overact so embarrassingly than he did here. Overall, a mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Never buy,rent, download or even think of borrowing it from a friend. Its a waste, and a huge one too. And be advised never to watch a Boll movie again, its enough already.EDIT: I've posted this a while back and I just wanted to add something.If you're reading this and you happen to work at a store where you sell video games, please and I beg you memorize the name and face of Uwe Boll and if you see him crossing the street immediately shut your doors and windows and put that close sign.

Boy, I was wrong.Like previous reviewers that have posted before me, I would say that this movie was \"choppy,\" in that you never are watching one scene/actor for more than 5 minutes at a time. The back and forth between all the characters makes you feel a bit overwhelmed at first, but after a while when you get to grasp the plot it just becomes annoying. It's like the Director is saying \"Okay, now we've got to show you what's going on with these characters right this second,\" even if what they're cutting to is inconsequential.The acting itself is underwhelming, as is the script. The script calls for the cast to sound noble or poetic at times, but it just comes off as cheesy. The plot was a bit outlandish, but I cannot complain here as I knew it could be as this was a Fantasy. So you'd think that the special effects would redeem this as it's a big Action/Adventure/Fantasy type? Sorry, the monsters didn't look more than a pile of mud wearing mud colored armor, the battle scenes weren't anything special, and the magic special effects weren't anything we haven't seen before with a few twists.Pros: Jason Statham finally shows that a Boomerang can be a deadly weapon. Much Better than Paul Hogan in Crocodile Dundee. Cons: \"Choppy,\" too long, bad acting, bad script, sub-par effects.",

Thrilling and spectacular movie full of fantasy that introduces us a brave hero and appointed to juvenile public and full-blooded adventure aficionados. Sword-and-sorcery saga with stirring action , spectacular images and fantastic scenes including witchery ,witchcraft and necromancy . Set in the kingdom of Ehb, the tale tells a good man called Farmer (Jason Statham), who was adopted by a family . The man married a gorgeous woman and a son sets out to rescue his abducted wife named Solana (Claire Forlani) and revenge a death , two acts executed by the Krugs, a race of monster-warriors who are dominated by the wicked Gallian (Ray Liotta). When Farmer's wife and his son leave their hut to sell cabbage at the village of Stonebridge, Farmer's farm is attacked by strange creatures called Krugs. With the help of his neighbor Norrick (Ron Perlman) he travels to Stonebridge; however, the Krugs capture his wife. With the assistance of Norrick ( Ron Perlman )and Bastian (Will Sanderson)Farmer's brother-in-law, and a magician (John Rhys Davies) he tries to encounter and save his wife. Furthermore , they are helped by an intrepid Amazon woman (Kristanna Loken) . The Krugs are being submitted by the sorcerer Gallian with the collaboration of the King's nephew Fallow (Matthew Lillard) who intend to amass an army to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds), being supported by his commandant (Brian White). At the end takes place an impressive battle between wizards (Ray Liotta , John Rhys-Davies and his daughter played by Lelee Sobieski) and Farmer .This exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, violence and is pretty entertaining , though mediocre .This is a tale of magic , imagination, blood and wizardly set in a mythical world from Middle Age full of barbarisms . It packs large amount of fights in \u00a8Lord of Rings\u00a8 style , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense several struggles in which the warriors are staked bloodily in the chest, beheaded or slashed . There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood . Most of monsters called Krugs and humans victims are relegated to being stabbed in the chest ,throat or neck. Breathtaking images , spectacular battles and duels and lots of amusement and entertainment . Made on a fairly big scale with spectacular set design and glimmer photography . Quite budget for a German/Canada/US co-production and lavishly produced by the same Uwe Boll. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score and colorful cinematography ; furthermore spectacular production design . The motion picture is regularly directed by Uwe Boll . All four of the films he has realized that were based upon video games, House of the Dead (2003), Alone in the Dark (2005), BloodRayne (2005) and BloodRayne II: Deliverance (2007) were listed on the bottom of barrel by the reviewers. Most of the other films he's directed, including Heart of America (2002), and Blackwoods (2002) are not widely available in America, but have received similarly low ratings among those who have seen them. Having directed 25 movies up to 2011, Boll is panned by the critics and he has received below average reviews. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of adventure films or those enjoy in general.The film will appeal to fantasy buffs with action enough to make it worth looking in on . In other words, it seem likely Sword-sorcery genre enthusiasts and juvenile viewers will be delighted because action and adventures are thrillingly presented and edited to offer the maximum impact. Rating : 5,5 ; average though some moments is amusing.",

            "content": "Uwe Bol has made some terrible films. I certainly won't defend his making crap like \"House of the Dead\" and \"Alone in the Dark\". And, I noticed that quite a few of his films are on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List...including this movie. But I also noticed that \"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\", despite it's pathetic score of 3.8 that it's really NOT a bad film. Flawed, yes...but overall rather enjoyable if you like fantasy films.The story is about an evil sorcerer (Ray Liotta) who is in league with a pathetic wiener, the King's nephew (Matthew Lilliard). And, using the sorcerer's power, he is able to make the brainless Krug attack the people of Ehb and in the surrounding countryside. Amazingly, the fate of the people all rests on the back of a simple farmer (Jason Statham) and his small band of allies.So what are the film's weaknesses...other than having Uwe Bol's name on the picture? Some of the characters (in particular, Statham) are underwritten and wooden and a few of the casting decisions are strange...though they mostly work. Some of the dialog is a bit silly. And, sometimes the film was very easy to predict. But, if you turn off your brain and just enjoy the story, the great music and the lovely BIG cinematography, there is a good movie here. Great? Certainly not...but not a bad film at all...and one I found I enjoyed even though I was totally expecting to hate it.By the way, I noticed some reviewers called it, essentially, a bad \"Lord of the Rings\" knockoff. Despite having John Rhys-Davies, the film really didn't seem to be trying to copy the trilogy. The closest movie to this one might be one more like \"Krull\" or \"Conan\"...which is also quite watchable.",

But there is no exploitation of women in this movie, and some of the women even take up swords. So, okay, this isn't Shakespeare. If fact, prepare thyself for character arcs that are vapid and almost theme-less. It's basically a medieval/supernatural revenge tale. But if you're just looking for a no-brainer fix of non-dragon fantasy and action, especially on a weekend afternoon, you will enjoy this. Jason S. is excellent.",

I had already ordered it as part of my mail-in DVD program, so I was stuck with rental, even if I had been thoroughly warned by the folks here. At least I had low expectations now, so I wasn't disappointed when I discovered - yes - it's certainly was not up to what you'd think by looking at the famous names in the cast.The actor who astounds me the most is Ray Liotta. What has happened to him since \"Goodfellas\" fame to do something like this? Has his career plummeted this bad, or did he just make a poor choice of roles to play? I can see Burt Reynolds taking anything since he's peak days are long gone, and Leelee Sobieski, because she's never been a star, but Liotta?Actually, to present both sides, the action scenes, the costumes and the story overall are not boring and not the worst thing I've ever seen. Some of the special-effects were a lot of fun to watch, so it's not all bad.....but the dialog is horrendous. It totally ruins the film and makes the whole movie appear like some B-grade cheapie. It's why I also was disappointed to see Ron Perlman and John Rhys-Davies being part of this.The worst acting performance in here, by far, was not Liotta but Matthew Lilliard as \"Duke Fallow,\" the son of the king. How Reynolds, who had a fine career, could work opposite this over-the-top guy and keep a straight face, is beyond me. Lilliard overacted so bad, it was embarrassing to watch. I can only hope he was supposed to act that ludicrously, but if that's the case his character is so annoying, it's not fun to view.Jason Statham: well, I've had it watching his movies. I loved his early work (\"Snatch,\" \"The Transporter,\" etc.) but now he's just a ridiculous action-freak-character, one of these guys who can beat up 50 people by himself in every film, especially this one, as \"Farmer.\" I have to admit, however, I did like him using a boomerang as a weapon. I thought that was pretty cool. I like Claire Forlani, too, who played his wife.Sadly, the dislikes far outweigh the likes and I can see why so many reviewers here panned this film.

I actually enjoyed it.Things that let it down are: 1) Matthew Lillard is a joke - he really cant act, and makes you cringe when he speaks its so bad. 2) A terrible music score - people talk about how music can make a movie - imagine Jaws without the theme, and Halloween without the tense music!! Well the music is so bad in this film it spoils it. I wonder how well it would have done with Hans Zimmer or the late John Williams behind the music 3) Nothing particularly new in the story, very similar to parts of LOTR and EragonOverall i liked it, and people who gave it such bad scores must not be into this sort of genre, or are being too picky, as its an enjoyable movie to watch.",

I barely did even so (I swear this flick made me even more nauseated than I already was). Another reviewer was kinder when (s)he wrote that it wasn't that the actors were bad per se -- because most of them certainly were. Only John Rhys-Davies, who's done this kind of crap before, taken it seriously, and taken it to the bank, and Claire Forlani were making any kind of effort at all. Not the rest. Ron Perlman was hamming it up on autopilot, but at least his ham act wasn't half as objectionable to the ones put forth by Matthew Lillard and Ray Liotta, which were grossly annoying. Leelee Sobieski basically sleepwalked through this thing, reprising bad bits form her St. Joan effort of several years ago, and Jason Statham frowned and grunted his way through the film, whereas Burt Reynolds couldn't even bother to be conscious for it and stared his way through it all, projecting the most godawful monotone and excruciating boredom with the whole thing (remind me again: **WHY** does anybody consider this fossil an actor??!). Reynolds and Liotta delivered their absolute worst performances of all time in this wasted effort. What the whole mess deserves is a mercy killing.

Some weird choices when it comes to editing (especially three locations at once in the final battle scenes, with a cut at about every ten seconds - so much for developing any kind of tension...). Image quality was uneven, especially when it came to \"souped-up\" scenery with the castles or the evil's lair, which seemed blurred or coarse compared to the close-ups of the characters. Some laughable ideas (using catapults in a forest? Suuuure...). Dialoge was really weird at times (at least in the German version), just short of holding up signs saying \"LISTEN UP! THIS IS MEANT TO BE PROFOUND AND/OR MOVING!\" (of course, being neither - just talking slowly and incoherently is most likely not character development...), while at other times it was ... like something straight from a certain group of New Zealand TV fantasy series of the nineties ;)Impressive list of cast members, though their characters are all a bit flat. Like, \"slide through beneath the door\" flat. Not even cardboard. The combat scenes are fast-paced, almost all the time in close-up (aka \"what's-going-on\" mode), except for the final fight, which was along the lines of \"who can spot the most MATRIX imitations\". The evil wizard (Ray Liotta? who cares...) somehow lacks any qualities of being someone you love to hate, *spoiler?* combined with evil's usual incompetence when dealing with the almost defeated good guys. */spoiler* The good king (Burt Reynolds) seems more bored than bothered by the events throughout the whole film. Ron Perlman is seen without a ton of make-up. Camera knows of two color tints for the film: brown for all the outside scenes, and reddish brown for all the dungeon scenes. Sky is generally either blaring white or pitch black, image contrast is harsh, and on some occasions when the camera sweeps across the (rather nice) landscape, the results are blurry blotches.

You read right. And despite all kinds of comedy that sentence might imply, the film is bitterly unfunny. Some comedy might have eased the pounding boredom.I couldn't begin to describe what's wrong with this movie, but I'll try. Firstly Jason Stratham's character is known only as \"Farmer\". Even his wife doesn't know his name. He's a hard-edged working class character, and one of only two Brits in the entire movie. He shouldn't have any sort of combat skills. Yet when the call to battle is raised, Farmer suddenly wipes out fleets of stock bad guys with an odd mixture of swordfighting, kickboxing, and the occasional poorly done CGI boomerang toss. Where the heck did that all come from? Why is \"Farmer\" named \"Farmer\"? That's the poorest descriptor I could ever pick. Oh and *spoiler*! Farmer's the son of King Burt Reynolds. Take that as you like. My explanation is it's the script vomiting up blood in its last dying throes.Next, I mentioned that Stratham was one of two Brits in a fleet of Americans doing poor British affectations. The other British man is John Rhys Davies, whose presence makes the whole thing that much sadder. He does the best he can with the poor material offered. Ron Perlman is here too, presumably paying the rent before the Hellboy2 check came in. Kristanna Loken strangely comes back after sucking....blood in BloodRayne. It's unusual to see anyone of even minor celebrity status come back to Boll after one outing. It must be because the script gives her so much to say about war and the environment. Nearly everyone over or underacts, and it's ridiculously uneven.Sidenote: Being lectured on the environment by Uwe Boll is like being criticized by a meth addict. God knows how many reels of film and gallons of gas and carbon dioxide emissions were spent making this film.Anyway, back to the acting. The worst sinner here is Ray Liotta. Goodfellas fans, be warned. You may experience a heart attack during his acting. Hammy doesn't even begin to describe it. He just yells half his scenes, often in a pitch that could put Wallace Shawn to shame. He didn't have as far to fall as Ben Kingsley did in Boll's BloodRayne, but it's still one of the worst performances outside of the Sci-fi channel (Where this film belongs). Liotta also has telekinesis and psychic abilities, which he could use to murder everyone, but just uses slavish idiots instead. It's all just plain retarded.It gets worse. The story is impenetrable. The aforementioned enemies resemble something from Power Rangers. I kept waiting for Goldar. The editing is ridiculously confusing and sloppy. The battles just go on forever and are ridiculous. Example: One side has no archers. Technically the other side could just pick them off and keep retreating. But no. Instead we get increasingly muddled and boring combat involving characters we don't care about. The film is more soporifically effective than a glass of warm milk.I could be kinder as funny enough, it's still not the worst film Boll has ever unleashed on the world. That dubious honor goes to House of The Dead. It's not even Boll's most boring film, which is Alone in the Dark. But I'm so malicious because in the end it's a two hour long unfunny parody of The Lord of the Rings. Virtually shot for shot you can pick out a scene reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, except not in the same realm of awesome. Not even passable. It's so especially painful for such a devoted fan that I give this a vengeful and hateful F.",

I was very pleasantly surprised.The movie I saw was very entertaining fantasy story with a great cast, great scenic locations, engaging battles, outstanding costumes, that kept me thoroughly entertained for it's entire running time.I would describe the acting as \"adequate\". Some of the characters seemed over the top and the worst by far was Ray Liotta (I've never been a great fan of his), but overall they got the job done.I liked the magic in this movie. It seemed very \"physical\" and hands-on. The fight near the end with the floating swords was very nicely done, and all the magical effects seemed \"believable\" as far as magic goes.The scenery and costumes were fantastic, it gave \"dark ages\" feel to it, dirty and gritty.All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. I'd give it a 7, maybe an 8, but I'm giving it a little extra considering how pleasantly surprised I was due to all the negativity, ending up at a 9.",

            "content": "Set in the medieval kingdom of Ehb, a man known only as Farmer is caught up in the battle for the kingdom. A powerful magus by the name of Gallian is using magical powers to control the orc-like Krug. Also working with him is Duke Fallow, the King's nephew, who wants power for himself. Farmer wants nothing to do with the war but when his son is killed and his wife taken he has no choice if he is to save her. He heads off in search of her with his friends Norick and Bastian; together they face various difficulties and are ultimately separated. Farmer later learns a hidden truth about himself before helping lead the fight against the Krug and ultimately facing Gallian.I was surprised to see just how negatively reviewed this film has been; it may not be great but it is far from terrible. There is plenty of impressive action; this is exciting and stylishly choreographed by Siu-Tung Ching. The story may contain many clich\u00e9s but just about every film in this genre does to some degree. Jason Statham does a solid job as Farmer and there is solid support from Ron Perlman as Norick. Some people weren't too keen on Matthew Lillard's performance as Duke Fallow but I rather liked it; the character was never meant to be heroic in anyway. Not all the performances impressed though; I never bought Burt Reynolds as the king and the less said about Ray Liotta's Gallian the better... he was more camp than commanding; certainly he never looked a match for Statham. While the highlight of the films were the battle scenes there were other impressive moments; I particularly liked the mysterious women of the forest and the way they moved on long vines. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the genre; it may not be the best example but neither is it the worst that I've seen, by quite some way.",

I love epic fantasy, but this movie relates to LOTR and Gladiator as a bottle rocket relates to the Starship Enterprise, and to mention them in the same breath is a monumental insult to those fine films. I really wanted to like it, honestly. I love Jason Statham and Ron Perlman, and the rest of the cast (yes, even Burt Reynolds, who didn't deserve the audience's derisive laughter every time he appeared) were fine, although Ray Liotta was comically miscast and mis-costumed as Liberace. The British Columbia scenery was nice. The storyline, scriptwriting and editing, however, were absolutely abysmal. Just awful. The attempts at mid-battle banter were incredibly inept - they actually stop fighting to say things like \"What took you so long?\" and \"They don't scare easily!\". Jason Statham fights off big monsters who are armed with broadswords with what looks like a flimsy machete, while Ron Perlman uses a pickaxe(!). The opening scenes are amazingly clumsy, they just dump you randomly into the story with no preamble. And I am so tired of the overused Chinese martial arts film clich\u00e9 of showing the audience a plain shot of mysterious badguys who suddenly aren't there as soon as the movie characters look - it's so cheaply manipulative. Lame, predictable line follows lame predictable line. When John Rhys-Davies comes to the bedside of the (unbeknownst to him) just-poisoned king (Burt Reynolds) I said to myself \"If he says \"The king has been poisoned!\" I'm outta here... and guess what he said?",

(I.e., with a sledge hammer!)It is sad how much I wanted this move to be great! Some of the back ground shots, the cgi, is amazing.

We don't recommend the film to anyone with serious cinematic intentions, However, as kitsch this film almost succeeds. So, OK, we tried to come home and convince our \"knowing\" kids that \"In the name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\" was worth the Friday opener vote, but broke down laughing about five minutes into our rave when they just were not having any of it.So let me add a few cogent notes. For 'entertainment' value, given what we were looking for after a long Friday, we were very satisfied, though we worried at times that our guffaws and groans, and open commentary, might have disturbed some of the other 30 or so people in the theater (but for their own laughing). King Burt Reynolds? Oh well. We have to admit that Ray Liotta's \"Goodfellas\" reprise as an evil mage was the most amazing thing we've seen since Jack Lemmon's service as Horatio in Branagh's \"Hamlet.\" Of course, this mention of Uwe Boll's effort alongside Kenneth Branagh is totally appropriate, except that Branagh's \"Hamlet\" had little entertainment value of any kind. School is still out on which of these two can make the worst film of a decade. If Matthew Lillard's over-the-top contributions to \"In the name o...\" (which is all of the title that fits on the ticket marquee at the theater) served well in a film with vine dangling amazons, synchronized ninja archers, prolonged out-of-focus long shots, granular irrational close-ups, and some of the most inane dialog in the history of film, one wondered in that case why Scooby Doo didn't put in a cameo in one of the dungeon or castle scenes. Nonetheless, many of the second tier characters were convincing and well acted, amidst all the mish-mosh of incongruous effects and disaffects. So there were moments when one, though not entirely forgetting how bad this film was, felt sorry for many of those who found themselves in it. Or should they all have known better? But laugh! Oh my, did we laugh, to the extent that it became uncomfortable laughing at a screen strewn with dead bodies and actors struggling for motivation. Oh, we could have seen high drama or thought-provoking art, but this way our Friday night was pure poetry... the dungeon it was dark and dank the bodies in a pile and there atop the smelly heap was Ray Liotta's smile. his polyester wizard suit bespoke a man with guile but then behind a squeaky line was Ray Liotta's smilewhen Uwe Boll directs a film the casting's done with style that's why for evil, nothing's like sweet Ray Liotta's smileand though we hoot and holler at such feckless goofy bile now laughing all the way to bank is Ray Liotta's smile",

Boll the whipping boy of film fans everywhere continues to make movies despite the fact that people \"hate his films\", which they go to even though they hate them. Yes I've disliked a number of his films, House of the Dead is one of the worst films ever made; Alone in the Dark is horrible, but plays better if you come in 25 minutes in and can make up what you've missed; and BloodRyne I liked, despite performances that ranged from good to nonexistent because it reminded me of the Italian Fantasy Films of the early 1980's. Boll is back in theaters with one of four films released world wide in 2007. (2007 is a busy year and included his boxing, literally, critics who despised his films-he won)The plot of the film has something to do with Jason Statham, a farmer going off to take revenge after an evil horde invades his town, kills his son and kidnaps his wife. He travels with Ron Perlman and several other in a quest that leads them into several big battles and to the castle of the evil wizard Ray Liotta.Watching the film I came to a rather odd conclusion, this is actually a pretty good, if very dense little film.The film looks good. the actors are all pretty much on the same page, the action is nicely staged, and the story is light years better than most of the direct to video films that were spawned by Lord of the Rings. This plays very much like we are in a real place so is unlike the dress up/ Ren Faire we've been getting lately (the Dungeons and Dragons films anyone?) I liked the film enough to look forward to getting it on DVD and the hunkering down and watching it on a rainy Sunday with my brother.To be certain the film is not perfect. I could see tell at the outset that Boll's means of casting (through lots of money out close to the time they shoot in order to get any actor in need of quick cash to get bigger names then he has a \"right\" to) was going to be a problem in a few places. First off its going to produce a cast with accents all over the place, Ray Liotta, Jason Stratham, John Rhys-Davies, Leelee Sobieski and Burt Reynolds are all in different places vocally. Its also a problem in that the acting styles clash, with Liotta seemingly out of place and Reynolds, whom I never ever expected to see in a film like this, a bit too knowing.(I won't discuss the hair styles of any of them because that would take too long)If the film itself has any problems its that its a long dense haul.A great deal happens and is discussed and after a about an hour I did begin to wear down. I'm sure once this hits DVD or cable it will play better where there can be breaks.Boll is growing as a director. He's made a decent little fantasy. I look forward to seeing this again, and I'll even go see the threatened sequel.7 out of 10",

No, scratch that... top five. The dialog is awful, the writing is boring, the action scenes are jerky and stupid and the characters are one-dimensional and phenomenally uninteresting. This movie's got it all: the humble farmer who just wants to be left alone, the noble king who knows about seaweed and a villain who seems to have picked up his \"bad guy speak\" by following Skeletor around and taking notes.So, with storytelling and writing in general being somewhere between incomprehensible and grating let's look at the fight scenes. The choreography was bad, the same shots were used over and over again and I got the impression that nobody working on the movie knew how to actually USE a sword (you do not fight with a longsword like you would with a rapier, you simply do not), nor did they have any comprehension on battlefield tactics. A few gems including why the Krugs are bringing siege engines to a battle in a forest and exactly where the human army traveling on foot with no wagons or ships managed to acquire boulders huge enough to roll down a hill and crush the enemy.So... pretty much this is the first and last Uwe Boll movie I'll ever see, there is nothing good in this film and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at anytime.

C'mon people, give Uwe a chance. This movie is awesome.We also get Claire Forlani as Statham's wife, Leelee Sobieski in plate armour, why not, a comic relief secondary villain who wants to be king, and Mike Dopud -- Stargate fans, for one, will know his name -- doing his best bearded impression of an Anglo-Saxon warrior. Oh, and let's not forget that Jason Statham, who is so very important in the final act, is never given any armour and fights in the thickest of m\u00eal\u00e9es in a cloth shirt. I guess the armour might hamper his ability to drop-kick orcs and run on their shoulders... or was that some other film?...This movie is Uwe Boll's masterpiece. With a very high budget (especially compared to its atrocious sequels), it's Boll's \"Lord of the Rings\". Massive battles with actual actors, costumed orcs in fairly large numbers, sweeping shots and good matte paintings.\nDon't get me wrong, this movie is very far from the quality of the actual LotR films, but still manages to be truly entertaining and fun.Don't take it too seriously, don't go in expecting a cinematic masterpiece, and don't let Boll's infamy cloud your judgement. This one is worth a watch... even two in my case, as I rewatched it years after seeing it for the first time, and was thoroughly entertained throughout; I'll probably rewatch it again after a few more years and enjoy it greatly once again.I swear to God, it's ridiculous how much Burt Reynolds looks like one of the guards in Seyda Neen in Morrowind (that's \"The Elder Scrolls III\", a game from 2002, for those not in the know). It's glorious and I can't take him seriously at all.This film is much, much better than people give it credit for.

Sadly she had a small part. Jason Statham's performance wasn't awful, but his character was such a cardboard clich\u00e9'; the humble farmer with phenomenal fighting skills and with a mysterious past.I don't quite understand why Ray Liotta was dressed like Liberace. I expected him at any moment to stop controlling the evil beasties and start playing the piano. He certainly had the cheesy banter and flamboyant moves down pat. His dialog reminded me of the villains from Scooby Doo.Speaking of Scooby Doo, normally I like Matthew Lillard. He was perfect as Shaggy in the Scooby Doo movies. He was funny in Without A Paddle. He has great comedic timing. What he doesn't have is the presence required for his role as the slimy Duke in this cinematic disaster.As for Burt Reynolds, well, he gave us his best Cannonball Run performance. His rug looked nice, though.Kristianna Loken managed to dig out the same costume she wore in BloodRayne, another disaster from director Uwe Boll. And she had the same wooden performance.And last, but not least, the soundtrack was as subtle as an elephant stampede. The whole idea of a a soundtrack is to enhance the scene without actually being noticeable. In this case, someone took the Renaissance Fair Greatest Hits album and slapped them on the audio track in the oddest of places.Some movies deserve to be seen on the big screen.

In the Name of the King is a competent picture in the fantasy film genre and above all Boll has finally made a film without resorting to his old clich\u00e9s of sex and bloody violence. What this film owes a lot to is its cast. Jason Statham, Ron Perlman, Burt Reynolds and especially John Rhys-Davies and Ray Liotta contribute to the film with firm performances.Even though the trailers promised a film filled with Xena-level special-effects and over-the-top acting the film keeps itself together with good pacing and competently shot action-scenes. I have to say that while LOTR and Narnia almost bored me to death with epic battle scenes In the Name of the King somehow pulled itself through nicely, even though at times the bigger forest-fight was difficult to follow. Also Boll's films have always had surprisingly good CGI effects and in this department the film didn't fail either.By far the most impressive achievement for a Uwe Boll film is the genuine sensitivity found in the scene where the king finally dies and he and Farmer exchange a few but important words. Even though this plot-twist element was perhaps slightly too predictable I'm happy that it actually got a very smooth ending.Naturally the film is not without its weaknesses. Most persistent of these is the fact that the Krug look like they escaped from the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers. A few plot movements such as Leelee Sobienski's decision to put on an armour and ride out come at a slightly hurried pace. Despite the surprising climax the ending felt a little hurried and I wouldn't have minded if they would have bothered to give the film a proper epilogue.However, in all, In the Name of the King is a good fantasy-adventure film with successful points of levity, surprisingly good actor-performances and a well paced plot which doesn't begin to bore you even in its two hour length. Uwe Boll has done good.",

The acting is pretty good as least for most of the actors. Jason Statham and Ron Perlman are the best. Matthew Lillard was upright annoying. He did good in Scooby Doo, but this kind of genre is not for him. Ray Liotta is so-so, might have been miscasted. There is some good scenery to look at. I also liked the music in the film. Not Lord of the Rings like, but still good. There are some holes in the plot and things that are misbelieved. Overall, I have to say that this is Uwe Boll's best movie. I rate this movie 8/10.",

It seems that whenever some lame-ass hack like Uwe Boll brings a film based on a video game to the big screen, the result is excremental (albeit from either his mouth or the other \"thing\" that, fortunately for you moviegoers, I won't mention to spare you the insanity). Boll's resume of films should have indicated to moviegoers that this \"film\" is gonna suck. And I can never understand why the hell Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds are in this POS? I guess money goes a long way of snorting cocaine at the end of a \"hard days work\" should suffice but the latter states the obvious. With that being said, doing that provides \"remedial\" relief for the actors and critics who presumably were subjected to Boll's unique brand of \"film making\" which I'm sure gave them the feeling of being like Alex DeLarge in \"A Clockwork Orange\" forced to watch unspeakable horror.If you are a bright, meek, intelligent individual, skip this excrement of Uwe Boll. If, however, you've never understood the meaning of \"curiosity killed the cat\" and went to see this anyway, you may suddenly find yourself in a catatonic state were there's very little chance of recovery.

            "content": "What production did Uwe Boll come up with when he was given 60 million to make \"in the Name of the King?\". A very tragic case of a Bad Video Game Movie. I am not going to rip on Uwe Boll too much. But I hope he hears me out on this. I think he should get some education from whatever school he goes too and learns and relearns directing techniques to keep people interested in his movies. Uwe Boll is good at getting mass gatherings of actors, including an all star cast. But none of it works unless he applies patience and time to each scene. It was all over with that initial fight scene when Jason Statham takes on his first orc (At that time, half of the audience in the theatre walked out). Uwe Boll has all the elements to make good choreography and realistic special effects in \"In the Name of the King\", but he doesn't utilize them very well. Bad sound effects also ruin this epic. In exemplifying the first scene between Jason and the Orcs, I hear bad pig noises from a poorly costumed Orc. All these villains in this scene were wearing were poorly designed rubber masks with no animated features to detail. They literally looked like a bunch of people who were picked off the street to put on masks to take on Jason Statham.It goes to show that Uwe Boll makes these movies way too fast and spits them out to the public. If he is pressured under a time constraint to produce these mass projects, he shouldn't take these productions on. And the release of this film took forever, so that shouldn't have been an excuse.He needs to make sure the casting suits the actor. Don't get Burt Reynolds or Ray Liotta just because they're great actors, get them only if they fit the story line. This applies also to Matthew Lillard. Jason Statham barely fits into his role merely due to his English heritage. He doesn't act much in this either. What Uwe Boll should have done is get actors who are more adept at playing fantasy roles instead of getting actors who have more experience in cop- and-crime films. He should have invested more in gathering uprising and talented stars who have a lot to prove. Uwe probably would have saved money doing this. At least get some actors who have studied Shakespearean roles and the Middle Ages. The actors here sat around getting paid and didn't study their role or at least improve on the ones they were given. They were reciting what was scripted.The CGI was atrocious and needed more realism. Like when those two sorcerers were fighting with magic CGI swords. Some of the settings were decent, I'll give Uwe that. I do think he should have used better lighting techniques in indoor screening to give this movie at least some credibility.As said before, Uwe was good at mass gatherings and tried (more or less) to create these epic battles to match that of the LOTR trilogy. He did okay in producing them, but I think he should have demanded more out of the extras and the editing. he needed to give them better costuming too.I've bashed this movie enough, but a score of 3 is appropriate.",

It sounds like a lot of people trash his films before they see them just because it is directed by him. I think that is both insane and unfair.So I really had no idea of what to expect. After a few moments it was clear that this was a LOTR clone, with an infinitesimally smaller budget and done in a \"B-movie\" style. Taken on that level, my wife and I really enjoyed the film.I honestly cannot fathom the hatred for Dr. Boll. The film was competently directed, and I found some of the photography breathtaking, the music beautiful, some really cool stunts and fight scenes, and found at least some of it really suspenseful. Whatever one may feel about this movie, to say it is done by someone who has NO talent is - in my opinion- a grossly unfair and unreasonable statement.Yes, some of the acting was poor (the mother in particular), but most of the acting was fine and I took Liotta's role as a hammy-over-the-top performance that it was meant to be and really enjoyed him chewing up the scenery. You really can't take his scenes seriously - and I don't think they were meant to me.The plot was decent, and made a lot more sense than the National Treasure 2 disaster I saw. And the movie experience was infinitely more pleasurable than sitting through any of the Star Wars prequels or Matrix sequels. And those were done by some of the most respected directors by both critics and audiences alike.Personally, I think Dr. Boll was having fun with this film. And if I could fault him for anything it was to be too ambitious with a modest budget in a genre that has films like LOTR associated with it. But that can be viewed as a complement for a man who obviously is trying to stretch himself as a filmmaker.I understand his other works may be turkeys (I will refrain from judgment until I see them for myself), but each film needs to be judged on it's own merits. Personally I found the Hulk, Matrix Reloaded and Phantom Menace to be real turkeys- so does that mean it's OK to call those directors 'the worst directors ever to have lived' and sign a petition to have them stop directing? This film struck me as a Saturday matin\u00e9e experience - at 2pm with a bunch of friends and a big bucket of popcorn. A \"B\" movie to be sure, but one of the better ones to me.No, this isn't a great movie, but an enjoyable one if you can let go of comparisons and previous comments about the director. When I see reviews start off with \"just like any other Boll film, you can expect garbage..\" it makes me wonder how many people really gives his films a chance.Count me as a minority of one, but I look forward to seeing more of his films. Certainly more so than another film by Lucas or the Wachowski brothers.I gave this a 7. If you want to take into consideration all the unfair crap this director has gotten, I would bump it up to an 8 just to help even out the score.",

There.It was MUCH better than Bloodrayne, which was laughably bad, and in fact I'd say Uwe was starting to get a handle on making movies that don't cause eyes to roll .I know it sounds silly, but I liked these characters, the acting wasn't so terrible and the dialogue wasn't painful.Flaws: The film ends too abruptly, and there are story details sort of pushed through in a clumsy way, and some of the acting is over the top.It IS a cheesy movie (look out, there are NINJAS!!!), but this movie was much more fun than Eragon or Dungeons and Dragons. Plus, I can certainly appreciate Uwe's shaping of a fantasy world, it's mythology. I also appreciate how he went all out on the action and fantasy element.The actors handled themselves very decently. I was very impressed with Burt Reynold's restraint as the King. I really had doubts about his part, but he did a decent job and did it subtley opposite Matthew Lillard's more frantic pacing (Lillard was having waaaay too much fun, lol)Leelee Sobieski was adorable and John Rhys Davies was a joy to watch (and he's done some truly bad movies) Jason Statham, Ron Perleman and Will Sanderson were fun to watch as a trio of brothers in arms, and they carried some nice chemistry. Brian J White was particularly good also. Overall, the cast was not bad.If you are one of the many that crusade against Uwe, my review will not make much of a dent, and it's a shame because maybe, just maybe he is getting better in small steps.

It's insulting even to compare this heap to such a great series, but now you know there is nothing original about this crap fest.Jason Statham was probably the most wooden performer in the film as he tried to pull of some strange farmland accent but at times let his English accent slip out, and his character seems extremely stupid because he never puts on any armor and just attacks enemies with his normal farm clothes.This movie just proves that Uwe Boll has not any creativity or originality and doesn't have the slightest clue of how to direct a film.

However, this movie is so terrible on so many levels that it doesn't even have hopes of making it as a \"bad\" cult classic. The script was poorly written, the acting (even by an all-star cast) was terrible and ran the gambit between lack-luster and over-acting. The dialog was boring and, depending on which character was speaking, ranged widely from having a stilted \"old-style\" tone to nearly modern - which was jarring. Also jarring were the horrible costumes and prosthetic monster make-up, both of which looked like they came from a local, cheap Halloween costume store...the special effects were slightly better and the backdrops/settings and set dressings were truly of good quality but this is about the only thing that can be said in favor of this film. The movie didn't know whether it wanted to be a comedy or a drama and mixed elements of both...poorly. There was virtually no character development and two of the main characters (played by Jason Stratham and Ray Liota) did not even feel like they fit in the time period/genre of the movie. Jason still had the look of a modern-day action star caught erroneously in a medieval setting and his martial skills were way, way under-used. In fact, the fight scenes in general were long, boring and poorly filmed. And Ray's modern-style haircut (complete with styling gel) was distracting and made him look as if he just stepped out of a salon - and his performance was so over the top as to make the main villain of the movie appear ridiculous and pathetic. Only three actors are worthy of mention as providing consistent and worthwhile performances: Brian J. White, Claire Forlani and John Rhys-Davies(in that order). Ron Perlman was also not bad....but unfortunately, none of them are the main focus of this film which just drags on and on and on..... Wow...what else can be said....the music was bad, ranging from melodramatic to Saturday-morning cartoonish - all of it noticeable and distracting. The editing was poor - some scenes were blurry or had a totally different color tone from other frames - again very noticeable. Some of the special FX were good but they too were few and far between. Lastly, the plot is entirely predictable with every clich\u00e9 imaginable being used and nothing new or memorable to look forward to. As a lover of fantasy movies (and games) I felt compelled to sign-on and warn others about this movie. I am a fan of Conan, The Barbarian Brothers and many other \"B-Grade\" Fantasy movies...this one is an F-Grade!!

It also features a reluctant warrior hero by the name of Farmer (Jason Statham) who is forced to give up his pacifist ways after the dastardly Krug - and the sorcerer who telepathically controls them - kill his son and kidnap his wife.\"In the Name of the King\" may seem novel and exciting to anyone who hasn't already immersed himself in the glories of the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, but for the rest of us, the film is little more than an awkward mix of sentimentality and low comedy, punctuated by endless uber-violent battle sequences. Moreover, the acting styles range wildly in caliber and tone. Ray Liotta and Matthew Lillard are all flamboyant mannerisms and hambone line-readings as the evil sorcerer and the king's callow nephew, respectively, while Statham treats the whole thing with a gravity and seriousness worthy of a \"Becket.\" Similarly, as the magus to the king, John Rhys-Davies delivers his lines as if he were giving a command performance in a Royal Shakespeare Company production of \"Hamlet.\" At least Burt Reynolds, who exercises some restraint in his performance, avoids unduly embarrassing himself as the king.There's no denying that the look of the film is often jaw-dropping and spectacular, filled with mist-shrouded landscapes and vistas of computer-generated armies stretching as far as the eye can see, but that is just about the only compliment one can pay to the movie.",

It could have been good, but it reminds me of another film I saw the other night, Storm. They both copy topboxmovies or games, in this case: War of worldcraft. Peter Pan. Braveheart or 300 Spartans. (We fight for blablabla, Auooh!) The Lord of the Rings. (made me laugh the intro, when you see Frodo, or was it Farmer, plowing his land) and some other films.so my opinion is! see it. its worth watching!",

But when it comes to Uwe Boll it is different, he has no heart or soul or an ounce of love for what he does. he seems to have the same enthusiasm as a convenience store clerk. There are many young filmmakers out there who could take the same script and a small portion of of his budgets and do a much better job than Mr. Boll.In The Name Of The King in my opinion is the worst movie ever made. Complete laziness from everyone. No actor took the time to work with a speech coach to achieve the proper accent. Ray Liotta sounds like he was fresh of the set of Goodfellas and Burt Reynolds as the king is laughable with his southern draw. But worst of all is Matthew Lillard, who brought this turd to it's lowest point. I have been a fan of every actor in this movie, but I have lost a lot of respect towards all of them. None of the music fit the tone of the scenes, the editing was done by a blind two-year-old. All of the fighting and battle scenes were stolen from Walker: Texas Ranger. The only thing this movie had going for it was the locations, they were beautiful. But that's it, no other redeeming quality at all.How on earth Uwe Boll continues to get money to make movies is beyond me. There are so many young filmmakers out there with the talent and inspiration that can't get a nickle to make what could be great films. Yet some continues to finance Bolls talentless pursuits into film making. Now is the time we should all stand together and stop buying tickets to see his films and stop renting or buying anything with his name on it. And maybe he will disappear with all of the crap he has given us The only reason I am giving it 1 star is because I can't give it negative stars",

The action scenes are really cheesy, I felt I was watching a Power Rangers episode for a second, it was that bad. The magic scenes felt like a Harry Potter wannabe. Stay clear away from this film or any other Uwe Boll films as they are a complete waste of your time. This movie should definitely be on the worst of all times list, it at least deserves that much.

I knew I was in trouble once Burt Reynolds appears on the screen. And what in the world was Jason Statham thinking of when he decided to do this. It is COMPLETELY out of his element, so much so that you would think that this is some sort of Lord of the Rings spoof. It is horrible and a complete mess. The only one who wasn't Over Acting was Claire Forlani! Lets face it, people, its just not a good story and at times I wanted to stop the DVD. I had no idea that this was based off a video game and now that I know that (from the credits), this inspires me to never play that video game. Ray Liotta is his usual over the top self as the bad guy with that crazy laugh of his and yet it doesn't work for him here. Other than playing a wonderful Shaggy in Scooby Doo, Matthew Lillard is just a plain bad actor and an annoying one at that. How does he still get roles? Did he make a deal with the devil? Leelee Sobieski may have decided to do this because she wasn't getting the roles she wanted. she has to be better than this picture. Ron Pearlman was completely flat and just looked as if he was going through the motion and wanted to get this film done in a hurry. Everyone, even the two decent actors (Forlani and Rhys-Davies)were just out of place. It was like watching bad actors at a Reinnassance Festival. Jason Statham does not belong in the middle ages. He is his same old deadpan self and that deadpan delivery doesn't fit here. He only real role is to speak until it time for action and in films like Crank, War and The Transporter, it works, in this film that deadpan delivery just don't cut it. I clearly blame the director, who's movies that he directed have all been bad (Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne, House of the Dead). It is clear that he doesn't have command of the English language or he wouldn't have accepted these wooden, lifeless, lines deliveries that the principal actors all gave. I am telling you, you will get bored with this movie before you get a third, heck, a quarter of the way through. Do yourself a favor, when you reach that point, just go ahead, eject the DVD because it's not worth seeing this movie to the end. Help yourself and needlepoint, watch paint dry, do shadow puppet, all those are better than watching this movie completely through to the end. Completely disappointed in all this big name actors who decided to do this turkey!",

Let me start with the commentary track, it could be better. Uwe Boll leaves to get something to drink and to eat, comes back, and talks a lot about things that aren't about the film, and let's you 'enjoy a lot of scenes'.. I've seen the movie, I don't need to enjoy the scenes, I just seen them?? Tell me about the film, not about how Peter Jackson committed tax-fraud with the 14 billion of stolen money from Germany, next Commentary track, give me information which I care about, how did the actors do on the set, how did you create the movie itself, and why did you make certain choices. The movie, The main actors did a good job. Easily said. They were believable, they were into it, and well typecast. The Krugs, were just bad.. instead of spending 8 months of getting the right sound of the krugs, which could have been done in an hour **rrooaagg**, it should be checked how to make them scary, instead of reminding me of the power-rangers... Jason Statham in a serious role, he simply did a good job!! (and is a great actor) CGI, some parts are very good (swordfight, books, fog's etc.) some where simply bad.. Don't exaggerate just to make it more fun.. the catapulting of krugs, was just giving a bad touch to a good movie.. I know Boll wanted to give the battlefield something no one has seen before, but maybe there is reason that other directors never showed it to us???? Continuity, there are some mistakes, but I don't think you will see them the first time you see it... Breaking the rules of nature.. When a boomerang hits something, it won't come back, unless it is a magic boomerang, which it was not. Story, Yes, the story was fun, it wasn't the script from e.g. Shawshank Redemption, but it was OK, This was just a nice movie to watch, there will be some moments that you will be annoyed but there will also be a lot of moments on which you won't say a word. A nice movie to watch on a night off, and I will rate this film with the 6 it deserves. Michael",

Plus, could it be any more obvious that the Krugs were just men in costume? And, who did the sound editing? Something would happen on screen, and there would be no sound to go along with it.

            "content": "Well, I've pretty much read a lot of reviews and comments about Uwe Boll and his series of game to film adaptations, I have seen I think five of them, namely House of the Dead, Alone in the dark, Bloodrayne 1 and 2, and this film, and I have also seen one of his earlier films before he began with his game to film trend, a film called Sanctimony, and to be honest, I wouldn't call Uwe Boll the worst director of all time, but I will definitely say his more of a lazy director, by that I am referring to his idea of casting.Take for example if you go back to Bloodrayne, it was more like Boll just picked a few names off the top of his head, instead of really thinking who would really be able to bring the characters to life, I mean come on, I'll bet even a first year film student wouldn't put someone like Micheal Madsen in a film where he doesn't belong, and this film where even my parents, who are not even big movie freaks, said that Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds didn't really belong in this film, although Uwe does show that he does want to make films, but he seems to have a knack for taking shortcuts.My advice to Mr. Boll would be if he wants people to stop writing such reviews that are so harsh, that Niagara Falls won't be able to wash him clean, and trust me I have read some really harsh reviews, he should stop with this lazy ass B.S of his and make a film the way his suppose to, but hey he doesn't have to take me seriously I am just another film geek who posted another comment on IMDb, but keep in mind and this I know for sure, guys like Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese never took shortcuts with films they made, and thats why they have tasted Oscar gold.Finally, I am going to issue a dare and honestly, I hope somehow this part finds its way to Uwe Boll, either start making movies the way your supposed to or go back to Germany and think about taking up a career in filming wedding receptions, just be careful not to screw that up, because you wouldn't want to be at the front end of an angry bride's fist, because no boxer can pack punch when it comes to a brides special day.So, Uwe Boll, your choice, think about it.",

The only down side was the creature makeup let it down some as it was clearly basic masks with no 'hero' character with better makeup. Now for the good parts,The locations were amazing to look at and a lot of work had gone into the buildings (should have aged the thatch though)the fight scenes are all you could want,up close and in the large fights you see the chaos of m\u00eal\u00e9e fighting between armies. I had no problems with any of the acting even though some people have knocked the dialogue its a d&d type of film and its what you would expect (thankfully its not full of thee's and thou's). At about 2 hours it has the time to tell the story well but do not expect any big surprises if you are a fan of this type of film as it ticks all the box's that you would expect.

Even LOTR was stupid in this regard-- you never really understand why they kill or harm humans-- they just want to.

            "review_title": "Uwe Boll does 'Lord of the Rings' and fails once again",
            "content": "Apart from the fact that we know Uwe Boll as being one of the worst directors of all-time, we also know him due to the fact that he likes to copy the likeness of other films ( That are actually successful ) in a blatant rip-off kind of fashion. He has many times ripped off the Matrix with many hilariously terrible slow motion sequences and has copied Alien a few times with his design and name for monsters. It seems now it is Lord of the Ring's turn to be made a fool of.For some unknown reason i cannot quite put my finger on Uwe Boll keeps being able to cast grade A actors like Burt Reynolds, Ron Perlman, John Rhys Davies & Ray Liotta. However, this is combined with absolutely horrible B movie actors such as Matthew Lillard ( Yeah, Scream was an exception ) and the horrendous Will Sanderson, of which the latter is in nearly every one of Boll's films. It is a weird combination of great and terrible actors and it doesn't work. None of the grade A actors deliver a convincing performance in the film except for possibly John Rhys Davies. However, none of them seem to be truly touched by the 'Boll' syndrome of acting. It seems more like these great actors could not convince anyone because of the poor script, Spouting out lines no actor could have said convincingly such as: 'Life.... has never been more exciting!!'. It does mean, however, that this is one of Boll's better films ( Or shall we say, 'least bad'? ) because of the fact the acting is ever so slightly less terrible than a lot of his previous efforts. I still have to mention that performances like Matt Lillard's, Will Sanderson's & Leelee Sobieski's in this film are still absolutely atrocious and beyond the concept of 'horrible'.Jason Statham is, as always, Jason Statham. That unfazed dead eyed rock of masculinity. Unfortunately, this is a role that requires some emotional depth, and the scene where Statham is burying his son is laughable due to Statham's performance because he shows absolutely no emotion whatsoever. Once again, i get that Statham is supposed to be this tough guy that is too 'cool' for crying, but this moment really makes his character cease to be human. Was Maximus in Gladiator a wimp? No, he was the definition of cinema 'masculinity', but what did he do when he saw his wife and son dead? He gave an extended sob fest which is exactly what every human being would do at this sight no matter what your personalities are. It made him human, and it never felt out of character for a minute. Ofcourse Statham doesn't have any emotional range, so he could never have pulled off a scene like that, but it does make you wonder about this horrendous casting. Let us also not forget the hilariously wooden responses of both Sobieski & Sanderson after seeing a loved one die. There is not an ounce of emotion in their faces at all during these scenes.There are too many obvious greenscreens in the wideshots. Especially one in particular with Burt Reynolds setting out with a small army outside his castle has terrible CGI and special effects, which is also one of Boll's trademarks. Some of the side shots of this sequence seem to be filmed on location without CGI, and the visual change between edits in this scene are just ridiculous. Also let us not forget to mention that a couple of particular catapult 'firebombs' also look like absolute garbage. The lighting is many times much too bright and the sets look obviously artificial.The enemies in are 'Krugs', which might aswell have been called 'Orcs', because this seems like a blatant Lord of the Rings ripoff. Gallian ( Ray Liotta ) is the villain. We do not know why he is the villain, but he is the villain. His motivations or reasonings for his actions are never shown. It looks like Henry Hill entered a multi dimensional time machine and ended up in a fantasy medieval world, which really goes to show how miscast Liotta was.Action sequences are a bit better than a lot of Boll's previous films but there is still loads of quick cutting and shakycam action going on. It is still a difficult task to tell what is going on during a fight sequence. The film doesn't really have a narrative, and there are a lot of these extended fight sequences that take up the entire runtime, so the lacking choreography and mediocre editing really does become even more noticeably as time goes by.In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale has poor and wooden acting, a terrible script with horrendous dialogue and many blatant LOTR ripoffs, ( A lot of the still frames look like ugly & cheap copies of the beautiful stills of LOTR ), terrible characters & ugly production values. Even though as stated before the acting is wooden ( Particularly when friends or family of characters die ), performances of John Rhys Davies do still shine a little bit and in combination with its scale and the pretty decent music it is still one of Boll's greatest efforts. ( Which is saying little. )",

It looks expensive as opposed to other Boll flicks.Also the fight sequences are mighty fine with above average choreography.",

            "content": "After seeing Uwe Boll whine about not getting his kickstarter money and what a prick he is, I looked him up and came here. I never heard of him or his movies prior to today. I really wanted to hate this movie. I was going to do a whole \"forensic accounting\" style review talking about how he vaporized 60 million. Oh how I wanted to hate him. Oh, how I loved the comments. The one about how Scooby Doo should have a cameo, and all the ones complaining about every single thing in the movie. I loved the Japanese guy: \"I think {Uwe Boll} should get some education from whatever school he goes too and learns and relearns directing techniques to keep people interested in his movies.\" Oh god, I laughed until I needed oxygen, all that home-spun Japanese decency. I was ready to pile on, and then, get this, I watched the movie.What I saw was a 120-million dollar movie delivered for 60-million. I was amazed. There were some shadows crossing actor's faces, but the cinematography was so good otherwise, I have to believe this was hip and intentional. How neo-postmodern. Decent score, decent acting, good audio, all around pretty good, plot not so hot.I know this movie was a flop. It barely moved the needle the first week, and fell off a cliff the second week. I know that Uwe must have offended some gamer Asperger sensibility, but I'll be darned if I can figure it out. Perhaps he respected women too much. Was he too socially adept? Viewers sure hate him for something. Yeah, it was goofy in places, but I liked it way better than any of the Lord of Rings movies, none of which I have been able to watch beginning-to-end. I try again every few years, maybe its time.Perhaps it was not goofy enough, I mean, maybe with this genre you do have to go full retard and have walking talking trees and flaming hemorrhoids in the sky, like Lord of the Rings. This movie was pretty mild, some particle effects, I thought rather well done. So maybe you have to have wildly implausible things to get a true following, like Scientology or Mormonism. Gosh knows it works for Lord of the Rings, talk about stupid stuff going on. That movie makes gold plates and personal planets look sane.As you can surmise, I am not too fond of this type of movie, so rather than push it into full retard mode, I would scale it back. You have to realize the demographic is not the 13-to-16 year old Howard Stern demo. Its the 8-to-12 Caucasian boy demo. Its a little tougher.Since mom and dad may well be at the theater, lets just take out Ray Liotta. I liked him, despite it looking like he just had a Botox enema, but all this mystic debbel crap will just get the parents looking at each other and going \"huh?\" Sad fact is that the antagonist goes from the hyena people at the beginning to Liotta at the end. So half the money shots are with Ray. Too bad, now we're in rewrite.Just as well, since the other problem is that 8-year-old Caucasian kids might idolize their brothers, and they still remember momma's breast feeding, but they really don't want to root for dad. So both Burt Reynolds and Statham are father figures in a movie trying to appeal to a demographic that is starting to resent and hate their fathers.OK, easy fix. The weaselly slightly effeminate son of the king--Lillard-- that is the guy the kids want to identify with, not Burt. So switch those two roles. Now the weaselly kid can be the boy regent hero, and Burt can be the evil vizier, like in Aladdin. Now we are right back to Boogey Nights and Burt is in his element. Leave Burt in it, or replace him with Statham, to get mom and dad into the movie. For Statham's character, same deal, instead of his son getting killed by the hyena people, let Statham get killed and have the son be avenger. Now the 8-year-old boy has a reason to watch, and to watch the endless sequels as well. I surf the web while I played the movie so a lot of it made no sense. It seemed like there were the hyena people so it started out like 7 Samuri/Magnificent 7. Then it went kind of Bronson/Walking Tall, which is just fine. But keep it with the hyena people, not Ray Liotta at the end, its too confusing for me, much less 8-year-olds. I loved the Tarzan Girls that dropped out of the trees. I was struck by how artistic and visual it was, while still being dirt cheap to film. Remember, they are not sex-objects to an 8-year-old, so give them bigger breasts to serve as momma reminders.That Ironboy.... ahhh...jethead---- ahhn no, Hellboy, that Hellboy guy was in the movie and he is always great. Not sure who he was or what he was doing, but keep him in for sure. With Liotta out, that should get the time closer to 90 minutes, that is another key thing to fix this.The mom character was way too old-- this is for 8-year-olds so she should be 25 tops. Wasn't the mom in the Stargate franchise? Gosh I love her from there, but sorry, ya gotta work the demo.So, switch Reynolds and Lillard's roles. Switch Statham and Ford's roles. Write out Liotta. Substitute any teen vampire fluff babe for Claire Forlani. (I now realize she is not the Stargate girl, Claudia Black, sorry ladies.) One kid dies from an arrow, the other kid saves his mom and the kingdom, 85 million domestic gross, but the action figures will haul in 40 million easy. Hellboy can be the kid's new daddy, how cool is that?",

I was entranced by the bad acting, and marveled at how so many good actors could be fooled into thinking it a good idea to do this movie. I feel bad for Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds in particular. Ray Liotta looked like a cross between a dark wizard and a fully pompadoured gangster Liberace. And Burt Reynolds as the king with that southern accent was hilarious. And while we're talking about accents, could we throw in a few more? Everyone just talked in their normal voice, except for Matthew Lillard, who put one on, and none of them matched. Dee-lightful. I really can't stand how Claire Forlani pouts her lips and squints her eyes all the time, and I can't get past that to really judge whether she's a good actress or not. Her face just bugs me. And the guy that played her brother, in the scene where they where in the wagon cage, was another delight for me... did you notice that he was really cross-eyed? It was a really dramatic moment, but I have no idea what happened because I sat there snickering to myself through that whole part. The best thing about this movie is that these are really good actors. Almost all of them have been in other movies that I really love. The fact that they all got together and made this little gem is amazing. The list of awful/wonderful moments in this movie could go on and on. If you sometimes enjoy sitting around with your friends Mystery Science Theatre 3000-ing movies, you'll love this beautiful piece of crap!",

            "review_title": "One of Uwe Boll's Better Forays into Film-making!!!",
            "content": "\"Alone in the Dark\" director Uwe Boll's PG-13 rated, medieval sword & sorcery saga \"In the Name of the King\" with Jason (\"The Transporter 1 & 2\") Statham, Claire (\"CSI\") Forlani, Ron (\"Beauty and the Beast\") Perlman, Jonathan (\"Sliders\") Rhys-Davies, Ray (\"Goodfellas\") Liotta, and Burt (\"The Longest Yard\") Reynolds contains enough hand-to-hand as well as sword against sword combat and surprises (though you'll probably see everything coming) to make it tolerably entertaining for its two hour plus running time.Burt, by the way, is the white-haired monarch--King Konreid--of the title, while an unshaven Statham plays an anti-social protagonist named Farmer. Farmer occupies himself with his farm and family and ignores the outside world. He appears to have forged from the same mould as the Clint Eastwood hero in \"The Outlaw Josey Wales.\" A former warrior himself, he spends his time tilling the soil. Rather than sell his produce at market, he lets his wife Solana sell it. Solana has become very astute about selling, too. Meanwhile,a short-haired, clean-cut Liotta is the villainously evil wizard Gallian that loves to laugh insanely. He is the equivalent of the Christopher Lee wizard from \"The Lord of the Rings,\" but his leather jacket wardrobe is a cross-between of either Marlon Brando from \"The Wild One\" or Henry Winkler as the Fonz from TV's \"Happy Days.\" Meanwhile, bearded Rhys-Davies is the heroically good wizard named Merick that gives Gallian a run for his money. Liotta's villain is out to vanquish the good guys, but he doesn't count on Statham being as resilient as he proves himself. The fight scenes are standard, gravity-defying Hong Kong type stuff. These scenes are edited in whiplash fashion. There's cool sword fight between Gallian and Rhys-Davies where they use their telekinetic powers to levitate swords and clash them. As Elora, sexy Kristanna Loken of Uwe Boll's \"Blood Rayne\" heads a band of nimble Amazon babes that live in the forest and hang by enchanted vines. They use the trees like Tarzan did to deliver them to wherever they want to go. They don't appreciate the presence of outsiders. By the way, my compliments to whoever designed Loken's push-up bra that conspicuously accentuates her knockers. Matthew Lillard of the \"Scooby Doo\" movies is cast as the cowardly but treacherous nephew of King Konreid; he's really convincing in a dead-end role. The dark-haired Forlani plays Jason Statham's wife Solana. As the film opens, Krugs--animal-warriors controlled by Gallian--are hideous warriors that descend on the village where Solana's father lives. They burn the village, kill virtually everybody in sight, and kidnap Solana along with Norick (Jonathan Perlman) and transport them to Gillian's castle. The same Krugs attack Farmer at his home, but he kicks their asses. He reaches the village in time to help drive away the Krugs, but not before his son is slain and his wife taken hostage for Gallian, the obnoxiously egotistical adversary who spends most of his time in a castle looking at what his troops are doing. This epic was lensed in British Columbia and the photography features some sprawling landscape long shots with the usual computer-generated special effects. The Doug Taylor screenplay boasts a beginning, middle, and a happy ending. The blood and gore are held to a minimum owing to the PG-13 rating and there is no prurient sexual scenes. The familiar cast bolsters this tale and Boll makes it look like a sprawling, larger-than-life actioneer.In an interview, German director Uwe Boll has said that he made two versions of his $60-million dollar \"In the Name of the King.\" The theatrical version runs just over two hours, but his DVD director's cut will supplement the original material with another 45 minutes of action sequences and story.",

The battle sequences are rather good, with a bit more in the way of tactical movement than a lot of similar movies. Jason Statham is, well, Jason Statham up to his usual action tricks.

I thought Liotta was gonna pop an aorta, he was EMOTING so hard. Burt Reynolds should never play anything but versions of his own wisecracking self, and he is cast as a king - a medieval king. Experienced character actors like Perlman and Rhys-Davies come off the best, because they can play anyone in any time period. But still, given the execrable script, even they manage to suck at times. I've never seen such tone-deaf casting and writing in my life, and remember, I've seen Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus. If you value your time and your sanity, stay FAR away from his movie.

Many of them are well respectable and shouldn't have signed up to do this film (Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Claire Forlani, Leelee Sobieski, Ron Rerlman). In general 'In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale' is just a boring film with rip-offs from The Lord of the Rings. The characters were boring and bland, the fight scenes were bad directed, and the dialogue was just cheesy.The film runs at a 1hr, 55mins (excl. end credits), but it feels so much longer. I was checking my watch and the clocks quite often while watching this film waiting for it to end. The film was just boring (save for some fight scenes in the forest).

This film is NOT like Resident Evil, DOA, Resident Evil 2 or Hit-man and some others.. but it is similar to other Uwe Boll video game films but it is best attempt so far IMHO. The flick BloodRayne comes to mind, but this better. I was equally as impressed and not impressed by the film D-Wars which is NOT a Uwe Boll movie.The film is a bit campy and canned, but it's enjoyable. It's well filmed, good cinematography and the story told is interesting. The actors and actresses are great, they are A list performers which really adds to the film.I can see why there were some negative response to the film, possibly due to some of the editing and perhaps some of the cut up story telling. This dodginess is evident in a few scenes. Maybe a bit of embellishment in some close ups that were not necessarily needed for the scene and for instance, when the General walks in and the lowly soldier speaks of the Krug, it seems that was probably part of a longer scene but cut really short... and it is noticeable because it teases you with information, but then doesn't give it :) The other instances are very similar.. seems like there were longer scenes but were cut really short.This film has a good TV marketability and is something for the youngsters and family to enjoy. Clean, a little violence in action, nice cinematography, good actors. It seems like this is a made for TV feature film. It doesn't have that \"epic\" film feel like D-Wars (if you've seen it) or even borrows some concepts from LOTR, but how not sure how one would compare this film to LOTR... they are two very very different films.

With the help of drifting dust, changing light and twinkling stars (both heavenly and human), producer-director Uwe Boll and cinematographer Mathias Neumann have created an atmospheric epic that keeps viewers engaged front to back. The tree-dwelling forest elves with sometime Terminatrix Kristanna Loken in the part of saucy elf queen Elora are my personal favorites. I recommend the sequel explore her fling with the magician's daughter (Leelee Sobieski) in more detail.

I simply have no desire to- I kept falling asleep during my previous attempts to watch it, it was so \"blah\" and uninspired! And as he demonstrated with previous atrocities against both cinema and video-games such as \"House of the Dead\" and \"BloodRayne\", director Boll once again proves he simply doesn't have a clue.Even with capable (and good) actors, and a fairly large budget of $60 million, he delivers a film that looks like it was made for TV, with lame CGI effects and atrocious-looking monsters and villains. There was some nice production design and a few cool costumes, but the cinematography and lighting really took away from them. Plus, I actually laughed out loud when the supposedly ferocious creatures arrived and attacked a village near the beginning- the monster suits the performers were wearing were pure \"Power Rangers\"- silly rubber costumes that just make the actors look like actors in costumes and not resemble anything monstrous at all.The plot: Something about an army of creatures that is controlled by the evil Gallian, and a Farmer who goes after Gallian after his son is killed and his wife is kidnapped by his evil forces. Yeah, something along those lines, I couldn't tell you exactly, 'cause the movie put me to sleep. Although it was nice of Boll to give me an alternative to counting sheep to help me catch some \"z's\"! I should have been more suspicious when I saw the film's previews, which boasted a generic font displaying generic catch-phrases, while a generic hero delivered a generic pep-talk to generic allies.As I mentioned above, the film has quite a talented cast, including leading man Jason Statham (of \"Transporter\" trilogy and \"Crank\" fame), Ron Perlman (\"Hellboy\" series) and even Burt Reynolds (no notation needed), with supporting roles by the likes of Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken and others. We even get Ray Liotta as the villain! In other words, the cast is great, but none of them really seems to give a darn about the film. I never had a feeling of intimacy with the characters that a viewer should feel... I just felt like I was watching people reciting lines. That's about it.I should mention Boll's direction as well- mediocre in this film, which is actually a surprising improvement over his past few films! He still can't really tell a story visually, but mediocre is a big step from where he was before, which was \"god awful.\" I suppose I could go on and on about how bad Boll's films are, but by now you should really get the picture. So I guess I'll say that while still really bad, \"In the Name of the King\" isn't Boll's worst, though it isn't his best, either. (His best, and only, decent film being the so-so drama \"Heart of America\") There are a few nice details here and there, but Boll's amateurish style and the apparent lack of charisma from anyone and everyone involved really shows through.I really can't recommend this film. It's one of Boll's better films, but that isn't really saying much. Frankly, it's just another fantasy film trying to cash in on the success of \"Lord of the Rings\" by having big battles and lots of special effects. A 4 out of 10 for me. Avoid it unless you need something that will put you to sleep.",

            "content": "I have scarcely the words to express how much I had wished that the presence of Reynolds, Rhys-Davies, Statham and Sobieski would have shielded the now proved tragically ephemeral majesty of the Dungeon Siege saga, from the influence of Uwe Boll. Undefined characters, haphazardly thrown together for no apparent reason in randomly pieced together storytelling void of passion or heart, flailing aimlessly in and out of unchoreographed combat sequences with no apparent motivation, to a music score that seems as clueless about the plot as any other aspect of this movie. To cap it all off, some desperate unheard creative voice pollinated this putrifying corpse of a movie with surprisingly good special effects by comparison, perhaps in a last ditch effort to scrounge any scraps of production value. I made myself sit through this movie, and the sequel, start to finish, as I had done with the Bloodrayne movie. I can honestly say I believe Uwe Boll neither glanced at the games, nor had the remotest intent to convey them in these works. In fact, if I'm perfectly honest I can find nothing in either movie to dissuade me from the conclusion that Mr. Boll created not only these two, but all his game-derived works, out of some malicious spite or searing hatred towards gamers and fantasy fans. I pity any actor that is forced to have their life's work poisoned by this odious malcontent, and any story that must suffer the indignity and torture of being made into a lampshade in Boll's personal Buchenwald of film. Unlike many others however, I would advise people watch at least as much of this film as they can stomach, to gain a deeper appreciation for the artistry of producing and directing a film. And, if for no other reason, as a warning. A warning that when stories as marvelous as the Dungeon Siege saga are brutalised and ravaged by Mr. Boll, silence.... is as bad as the crime.",

            "content": "\"In the Name of the King\" easily ranks in the \"top\" 5 listing of the worst movies I've ever seen, and the other four were independent shoestrings which at least had creativity going for them. ItNotK, ironically, receives its highest marks (in my book, anyway) where the independents usually fall short: costuming, props, and scenery were spectacular, as one might expect from something with Microsoft money behind it somewhere. It's flashy and impressive on the surface, with no substance beyond that, no depth. Very much like the game(s) on which it was based (while technically based only on the first game, it included elements of the second which should not have been present, such as the Dryads).Aside from being generally contrived in its \"coincidences,\" poorly plotted, inexplicably illogical, and utterly predictable at every turn, Uwe Boll added in some apparent ideas of his own which have no place in the plot line on which he was supposedly basing the film. Oftentimes, his input specifically contradicts elements of the established story. Whence comes the idea of magic being virtually extinct, or requiring loyalty to a king... and what the heck is with the Ninjas? Technically, given the existence of goblin technology, you could've had steam-driven mechs falling from the treetops to fight for the King, and it would've actually made *more* sense. Did anyone else ever see the episode of Family Guy where Peter twisted a classic piece of theater-work by randomly tossing in mechanized warriors, mutant ninjas, and the like? Enter the Ninjas in ItNotK, and I felt like I was watching that all over again.Uwe Boll also threw in some liberation head-nodding towards \"God,\" courtesy some of the military leaders. Are we single-handedly trying to pacify the Catholics after the whole Golden Compass debacle, now? Apparently not, since (plot-appropriate) polytheistic references are inserted later, although the highly plot-relevant deities present are not specifically mentioned anywhere. Maybe he was just trying to confuse people (which might also explain the overall rather useless Ninja... am I the only person who noticed that they didn't really *do* anything except climb some trees?).Let's hear it for the old King's death scene. Apparently, the powers divinely inherent to the holder of the throne in Uwe Boll's universe include being able to survive being shot in the heart with an arrow (and, subsequently, ripping the arrow out, which any five-year-old who's had Lord of the Rings read to him a few times can tell you is a Bad Idea) long enough to clearly and painlessly relate one's entire life story to one's long-lost son, as well as hold a philosophical debate with him, read him a few bedtime stories, and inquire as to his general well-being.\"Last words\" lose their dramatic effect when there are several hundred of them.What Uwe Boll has done, is achieved the creation of a movie which will appeal equally to everybody who might want to see it, for whatever reason. Whether you're a Microsoft game buff, a fantasy fan, a fantasy movie buff, a medieval armor and weapons enthusiast, or a dedicated Dungeon Siege gamer, whether you are a Christian or an anti-Christian or a \"why'd you even bring religion into this discussion\" apathetic type, you will find all that you hold dear about your respective area of enthusiasm ruthlessly steamrolled in this abominable effort.

The characters are all flat and uninteresting. I'm not sure there was much of a plot because stuff just seemed to happen on screen for no particular reason. The fight scenes were no better than what I've seen in stuff like the Power Rangers, or Xena. I've seen better from low budget TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.All of the acting is flat.

I have read how he deserves to never be allowed near any camera and have seen endless assault on him online and other sources. I have had no interest in watching any of his film except that this one was on and there wasn't anything else I that piqued my interest. I had expected it to be bad but I have to admit I've seen worst as a matter of fact the last movie I saw before this, \"Delta Farce\" was even worst.The movie was supposed to be based on the video game \"Dungeon Siege\", there by itself is a clue as to where it first went wrong. For the life of me I could never understand the desire of any movie producer to make a movie based on a game. It just seem like a bad idea. It's even worse when there's no attempt to make a good movie. This film unfortunately does not even try. There seem to be an idea to just follow a story laid out already. No reason for the actions, no character development, very little background development.The main problem with this film of course is the script. It just basically plunge us into the action without explanation. I know that the wizard or magi Galien wants to take over a kingdom and we have no explanation as to why other than it's land and that he wants it. We also have no explanation as to how he made alliances inside the kingdom just brief hints at what his allies really wants. The dialogue is cheesy and there are used of phrases and words that absolutely did not belong in a Medieval sword and sorcery film. I mean they were using modern colloquialism like \"Don't be so melodramatic\". It just doesn't work. Also the characters are underdeveloped. They all are just one dimensional characters that basically just exist to do their deeds on this movie. They're not really characters that you think about after the movie is finished neither are they characters you could really care about. They're about as transparent as can be. There are no surprises in what they're going to do or how they're going to act. They are what they are.The acting is mixed, the older actors at least gave it a try. John Rhys Davies has done numerous of these horrible B and C grade movies and remains professional, so has Ron Perlman. neither just recite their lines you can see in their eyes that there's something behind them. Burt Reynolds on the other hand just gave up after a few scenes, he was good in a few scenes then it seems as if he just fell asleep. Leelee Sobieski is just not a good actress neither is Matthew Lillard. Jason Statham is a martial artist and you don't expect them to be good actors, he's almost as bad as Steven Seagal. Claire Forlani and Ray Liotta did what they could and it makes you wonder how their careers can sink so low. Mr. Liotta had an auspicious beginning appearing in \"Goodfellas\" and Miss Forlani had appeared with Brad Pitt and was on her way to bigger and better things. Both could use new agents.As for Mr. Boll's directing his camera work was not bad at all, I would have to say that some of the action sequences moved a little slower than you expect from a film like this. I don't know Mr. Boll's background I would suspect that he was a music video or television commercial director. He knows how to handle the hardware but he knows absolutely nothing about story telling or creating characters. To top it all I don't think he knows how to work with actors.",

            "content": "Review: In the name of the King ( a Dungeon Siege tale).Directed by Uwe Boll. I think I should have known that this would not be worthy purchasing, And I would have left it in the store if I spent 1 millisecond looking at the production house BOLL KG or the Director. But I saw Jason Statham, who turns out quick good action movies, mostly with a higher level of dialog than the average Die Hard movie. So Jason made the sale, that and I love the LOTR genre of movies. And surely though the rest of the cast isn't that actual there are some big names out there: Ray Liotta, John Rhys Davies and Burt Reynolds. So why did this film not bring what it should? Starts with a capable director: Uwe Boll has produced quite some movies, and has an impressive list of actors and actresses, but where he scores on the acting list he sucks in the department of script, cinematography, music, and to certain extent costumes, props and sets. Script, well the story arc has no tension, emotion, excitement there is nothing there, just a whole sequence of shots without anything, and it lacks continuity and basically is pretty meaningless. Example: Spoilers head: \"A kingdom in peril, an ambitious idiot of a kings cousin, starts an allegiance with an evil sorcerer, to overthrow the kingdom. The evil sorcerer makes/or uses Orc like creatures called Krugs, call them Orcs, somehow I don't think the term is trade marked. Consistency wise there is no continuity in the script on this point, the Krugs are a know race which seem to be disorganised creatures who don't harm anyone, because everyone is surprised when they start attacking the kingdom...., later one Ray states that he simply will make more. So what is it going to be?\"There is no emotion: Jason loses a son, and goes about it quite matter of fact, he is now going to destroy the world of the culprits all by himself if required. The characters and quests are meaningless: Someone who doesn't carry any other name than farmer, is pretty lame anyway. Call him James the farmer, it is already better, but he has fighting skills, nice side plot, let him be ex-military or something, give him a bit more credibility, and makes his quest a bit more feasible. And makes the name James the Farmer logical, someone who hung his guns up and decided to live a peaceful life.So the basic story lines of our main characters are: the idiot cousin: power the evil sorcerer: absolute domination The farmer: revenge ( oh yeah and rescue). The king: Saving his kingdom The rest: filling in the gaps.plot line 1 and 2 are conflicting, neither characters support each other. plot line 3 he has a conflict with himself, one would expect someone wrought by hate and pain with the loss of his son and wife. we get a action figure with endless energy and strength. the king, doesn't really seem to be really impressed with the whole thing. The rest, as said filling. Cinematography/choreography/scene build-up: Even though some people where involved as extra's there is a lack of scale, there is no feel of a kingdom, it feels as if it is shot in someone's backyard. large backyard. but every sense of a kingdom is lost, there is as stated earlier no scale. That goes for the \"massive armies, which posse a threat, or are going to solve it, to the empty feeling of each opposing main castle\" Lighting: absolutely awful, please get someone who understands light for these movies UWE, a basic photography class will already help, the feeling of the movie can already be improved with good lighting. it is absolutely lost here. Shots, if you are filming a fight scene of a main character, don't have the other one in the background messing up the focus and not doing anything with it, you don't respect the quality of your character if you do that. Try to stick with a sequence, it is really horrific to be flicking back and forward between shots, you lose the audience that way, no one knows anymore what they are looking at. Leave the Chinese circus in the circus, and the jazz dancers in a dancing hall. seeing simultaneously 10 people doing a back flip in Ninja outfit is lost on me, we where in a European style middle age movie, not in shanghai. Having the circus actors, gliding down Lian's is also awful, this is not Tarzan and his family. The music: it is to much, i feel as if I am at the ring of the Nibelungen. The music doesn't support he action in this film or the delicate scenes, it basically overwhelms it. Well that is it for me, another one for the movie academy on how not to do it. I have to say that reflecting on for instance alone in the dark or blood Rayne, that the fight scenes are better. But that is about it. It doesn't have to be lord of the rings, that is not within the capabilities of probably any aspect of this movie, but try to make it at least a descent movie, I feel as if it was a scam, the package looks as if it contains a movie, the package feels as if it contains a movie, but the package contains nothing that represents a movie.",

The movie had poor continuity, as well one clich\u00e9 after another. For example, did you know that the the hero is really the long lost son of the king. No, No, really. I didn't see that coming. Well, besides the wooden and forced acting, the miscasting of Ray Liotta, poor sound quality - not that it mattered, and poor dialog (for instance the king makes some comment about sea weed)I would have to say the only way to improve this film is to use a flamethrower on all prints in existence.",

            "content": "Uwe Boll has earned a reputation over the past few years as being considered as the Ed Wood of 2000. For a director who has made movies, mostly about video games, every video game he has touched has been ruined. The video game, if it had any strong points, has fallen, because the movie that bases itself on that game means nothing to anybody. Of course, I have watched Uwe Boll's movies, and have deeply regretted to waste time on such a venture. Will this movie be the final nail in the coffin? You'd be surprised, but this movie is good as average schlock.In the Name of the King is a supposed chapter based off the Dungeon Siege video games, although, I haven't played the game, so it makes me question just how close to the video game it's basing itself off of. This story follows Farmer (Jason Statham), a man in a little village, who lives with his wife (Claire Forlani) and his son, along with one of his good friends, Norick (Ron Perlman), who we find, had found him as a child, and brought him to the village he lives in today. A war involving two sides, King Konreid (Burt Reynolds) and Gallian (Ray Liotta) is about to arise. When Krug attacks the Village that Farmer lives in, a race of beasts with human like characteristics, He realizes that his family might be in danger too. With his wife kidnapped and son murdered, Farmer takes up arms in an attempt to find Gallian and kill him, as always in fantasy movies.Now for the criticism part. This movie isn't \"Lord of the Rings\"; it's not even \"Lord of the Rings\" Lite. It's like watching \"Dungeons and Dragons\" the movie, with Jason Statham and Matthew Lillard (Shaggy from Scooby Doo has an appearance in a serious role, but it's not too serious, trust me.) fighting in the background.Now to say D&D is a better movie would be an insult to an otherwise lackluster movie. Does that make sense? Uwe Boll has made a movie that is in essence, Power Rangers (The Krug make me think of the Putties from the 90's Power Rangers series) with Fantasy Lore (Mystical Forests, magic abilities, swords and archers) and rather crappy acting, but you have to admit, even \"Conan the Barbarian\" or \"Beast Master\" had all these little touches to it as well.I tried to compare this to Peter Jackson's \"The Lord of the Rings\", and it failed miserably. The Editing sucks, the plot is rather average, the CGI is okay, the fighting is long, and about 1000 points under the fight sequences to LOTR's fight sequences, and the acting is silly, but every fantasy film compared to LOTR is going to become rather lame, because LOTR is a far better film than most movies already, especially fantasy movies. If you don't look at the director for one second and his crappy reputation, you have a mild, watch once and be done with it, Fantasy Movie.For that I give it a six out of ten. It's a double-edged sword when you show liking to a movie like this, but it is an okay movie. Compared to all the other movies he has done, it's better than all he has ever touched. That doesn't mean I'm ready to sign the petition to let him continue movie making.",

Another question is who let Uwe Boll direct - the blighter should not be let within 10-mile range of any major film studio. The acting in the resulting... err... product is more two-dimensional than that of the computer-generated characters in the game, the costumes and props are worse than those you'd expect to see in a Sci-Fi Channel Saturday night special, the CG is laughable... and again, what the HELL is Leelee Sobieski doing here?

Jason Stratham is excellent in the lead, as is Ray Liotta as the villain and John Rhy-Davies in the role of the good wizard. I also really like the two female leads in this movie, Leelee Sobieski and Kristanna Loken. And who doesn't like Ron Perlman? This movie was not unlike Season of the Witch with Nick Cage and Ron Perlman, the quintessential sidekick. Great stars, decent plot, great character development, slightly below average dialogue, still makes a good movie.

I just can't look away. The cast is amazing yet the acting in wooden.

Clearly Liotta is a perfect \"devil\" with Matt Lillard playing his bitch with actual scenes of hell in this film and then Liotta has the audacity to knock up Jason Staham's wife Claire Forilani. Even the young and actually attractive Helen Hunt knockoff Leelee Sobieski and who could forget Burt Reynolds as the king. A Uwe Bowl production unlike any I have seen in a very long time.

Often it seems almost comical, such as when Farmer is saving his two mates from the river.Unfortunately, as the score distracts, it is least present at times when it would be nice to be distracted by the poor acting. Look at the credits and you won't expect much acting, but most of the lines are delivered as if they're being read for the first time and the actors don't really know where the story is going. Sometimes it sounds like they ad lib, like saying \"What the hell does that mean?\" in such a colloquial way, just after asking with great feeling \"What games are the gods playing with me?\" and getting a response that sounds creatively zen.The effects of course aren't special. They pale next to movies of the same era. This is all about budget of course, so I won't criticize too much. Much can be done with little, given the right eye for the look of the scenes, and these scenes stage very well, even if they look like castoffs from the Lord of the Rings prop department.The story isn't very interesting, the acting isn't very interesting, and the filming isn't very exciting. Overall, it's only of interest to devoted fans of a.) any of the leads, just to complete the chore of watching all their respective works; b.) the fantasy-action genre in general, although this only moderately qualifies as either or c.) movies that are bad in the not- laughable way.P.S.

            "content": "Ah, director Uwe Boll. How this man keeps on getting money to make movies is one of the great mysteries of the modern age.Dungeon Siege is a terrible movie. What's surprising is that for the first time in a Boll movie, I at least found myself laughing at (some of) it instead of just wincing in pain. That's not to say bad movie lovers should go see it, but it might be worth a rental some time. If you're planning on being drunk.The most astonishing thing about this piece of trash is the cast. True, many of them have seen better days in their careers, but have they really fallen this far? A good chunk of my amusement at this film was seeing a new actor/actress show up and laughing that they were even in this thing. I divided them into four categories while watching- horrible actors, apathetic not-even-trying bad actors, over-top-hammy bad actors, and Jason Statham.Picture, if you will, Burt Reynolds as the king. Yeah... it was obvious even Burt couldn't picture it, and he doesn't even try. His nephew and heir? Matthew Lillard! How could anyone possibly take a fantasy epic with Burt Reynolds and Matthew Lillard as the only royalty in evidence as anything other than a joke? Lillard plays himself, and his hamminess is only outdone by Ray Liotta as the evil wizard villain. Liotta is so amazingly bad it's hard to believe he ever had a career.Jason Statham actually appears to be trying, and the sheer amount of physical effort the man puts into the endless fight scenes and stunts is astonishing. Maybe he just doesn't know how to not try. He does a good job, but he certainly can't save this turkey from everything else that's wrong with it.At over two hours long, the movie seems more like three or four hours long. To give Boll some credit, at least the score was decent. The plot and dialog are laughable- quite literally at some points. Whether or not you'll want to sit through the whole thing to laugh at those parts is kind of questionable.One more thing. I almost forgot the synchronized ninjas. Amazingly enough, Uwe Boll even manages to make ninjas suck.",

            "content": "People wonder how Uwe Boll still has a career. It's my fault. His movies make me feel so great as a person, I watch every single one of them. When all else fails, at least I'm not Uwe Boll...Uwe Boll likes Lord of the Rings. He homaged the first one in House of the Dead and now he's made a \"best of\" compilation with Jason Statham. If imitation is the highest form of flattery, then consider Peter Jackson flattered to a gooey, dripping mass on the pavement. This movie is literally Lord of the Rings without acting or plot, cut into bits and mixed back together. With Jason Statham, which means it'll be a successful rental no matter what.At any rate, this is the best Boll film, in that it shows that he actually has something resembling a \"visual sense\". Of course, since that \"visual sense\" is frame-to-frame copies of scenes from a popular fantasy trilogy, really it just shows that the cinematographer and CG artists knew what he was referring to and shot what they knew. Also, Boll lucks out with cast this time around, with the aforementioned Jason S, Burt Reynolds, and the always hot (but always bad acting) Kristanna Loken officially becoming Boll's first return actor!Honestly, if you're like me and will actually support Boll's movies just to make fun of them, this one is pretty fun going, too. A nice game of \"Name the LotR scene!\" is a good way to make the two-hour play-length go by quickly. Here's a sample from last night's game:Andy: \"And now it's the scene where they take on the four orcs...excuse me, 'Krugs'.\" DiB: \"No no, this is the scene where the orcs drag Merry and Pippen along to Fangorn forest.\" Andy: \"No it's not, it's... oh wait...\" DiB: \"Yeah, there it is! There's Fangorn Forest!\" Elves: \"Welcome to Cedric Forest.\" Andy: \"Did they just say Fangorn Forest?\" DiB: \"No, they said Cedric Forest.\" Andy: \"Hellooooo Kristanna Loken's breasts...\" DiB: \"Mmyep...\"I still think the guy is slowly improving almost each movie. The problem is that by the time he actually makes it up to decent or mediocre, he'll be retired or dead.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "This movie was probably the worst movie I have seen in many many years. I have unknowingly seen Uwe Boll films before this one, but did not know this was the same director as those other flicks while watching. So, I can say truthfully that I am about as un-biased as I can get with this review.That being said, where do I start? The horrible score? The amazingly childish dialog? The half cooked story? Or the incredibly poor character development?First off, the person responsible for writing this story seems to have ripped off nearly a dozen different fantasy films without bothering to veil the attempt. And the screenplay appears to have been written by a 13 year old. For example: Each scene simply jumps from one thing to another without any connection at all. They show you something, and say \"here are these people and this stuff, look at them for a moment\". And a second later they show you something else and say \"here look at this now\". No continuity or connection at all! I truly felt lost after the first 20 minutes. And believe me, I am not at all easy to lose in a movie. Even really bad ones! The dialog is choppy at best, at worst it's moronic. And integral characters pop up randomly, say \"Hi\", and then vanish till they are needed. Like flash cards before a test. If this had been a book before it was made into a movie, I would almost think the screenplay was written from the Cliff's Notes of that book.And now for the Score! Oh my god! I have never seen a movie scored so badly. I mean I have heard 8 bit video game music more compelling and better placed than this. There are parts of this movie where you are watching and you want to feel something, but you can't! And it is because the music is either utterly goofy or far too weak. And you are left with this empty \"why am I bothering\" feeling that makes you want to just turn it off.And I truly feel so very bad for the actors in this film. One of the big draws for this movie is the tremendous star power it holds. OK, I know a lot of you are snickering at Burt playing the part of the King. But I really think he would have been great if he had been Directed right. There were scenes here that really screamed for that Burt Reynolds charm, but instead he had an almost robotic dialog that I couldn't believe was coming from him. Oh, and Ray Liotta. Holy moley! Ray, you could have been awesome as an evil mage! I was sooo disappointed by the lack of character development there. I have to say one of the major reasons I wanted to see this movie was, Ray Liotta as the big evil. On the plus side, John Rhys-Davies held up OK in his roll. But then, having so recently done the \"Lord Of The Rings\" films, he had something of an advantage over many of the other actors. But still, his character again suffered from that really poor development. The only character the writers and director seemed to have felt it necessary to put forth any effort on was Jason Statham's. And that was poorly managed at best. Where there should have been mystery, there was half said lines. Where there should have been epiphany, there was apathy. And the point at which there should have been a profound sense of justice, there was lack of surprise and tired, overused, one liners. A third of the way into this film I was bored. Towards the end I simply had a very mild curiosity about how it would finish out.The only real compliment I can give this movie is, the well choreographed fight scenes featuring Jason Statham. But to tell you the truth, I think he's done better work in his other films myself.So in short, if you wish to see a really bad film. Or perhaps you are really incredibly bored. Quite frankly, I would say watch something else. This wasn't worth the time it took to watch. Much less the slot on my Netflix schedule.",

What were they thinking when they cast him? He's not even good in his comedy movies. Jason Statham acted as he does in almost every movie, scowl and talk in a rugged voice, so I was not too disappointed with him.I love fantasy movies and I must say that this is one of the worst I've ever seen. Usually fantasy movies at least have good action scenes, which is all I expected from this one with Statham, but the fighting was pretty bad. A lot of the times you would see Statham jump and start to swing his sword then all of a sudden he'd be fighting with a different creature. No continuity at all.Overall this movie is worthless. The only reason that it has a two instead of a one is because there were a few scenes that were okay to watch, such as the battle in the forest. Other than that though, this movie is terrible.",

Matrix, LOTR, Charlotte's Web/Babe (who gives pigs as gifts to little boys?), Scooby Doo, among others. The cast itself wasn't so bad but for the terrible directing, however next time I see Shaggy doing fantasy I shall think again. By far the highpoint of the movie was seeing ninja's in the first of the major fight scenes in the forest. Ninjas and Orcs, I thought my friend was going to suffocate from lack of air. The lack of explanation is terrible,the bells on the arrows? What did those actually do? How did they get siege weapons through a forest? When the first Krugs appear we see Farmer owning them all them, it is never explained why a farmer is such a beast, where did he learn the crazy skills? He goes the whole movie without armor, even when he gets proclaimed the king and he goes to fight Ray L, like my god, still using a 3rd grade machete, a boomerang, and that ugly brown shirt he was wearing while picking turnips, he goes to fight a Mage.

I have noticed this trend in many other Uwe Boll movies.Their is comedy in this movie, but it's nothing side splitting.The plot twist about Farmer being the King's son was good but it came at the wrong time, not much was built around the characters to really give it some meaning.Naming a character Farmer is one thing but trying to explain it with a meaning less quote is really unacceptable.Love it or hate it, this movie is a drastic step up for Uwe Boll, however factoring in how many movies he has done so far that is really unacceptable. Hopefully Postal will follow the quality of In the name of the king more so then his other films, and of course then some.The DVD release was terrible, those wishing for a pack in will be surprised when they are greeted with a digital copy of the film and, best for last, a Demo of Dungeon Siege 2! Don't bother throwing in the whole game this time like what was done with Bloodrayne 2!

It's as though Uwe Boll would periodically say, \"People, the movie is coming along far too well; everyone do something stupid for a scene or two. Can't go raising everybody's expectations of me.\" Despite the Uwe Boll trademarks of stilted dialogue, poor character development, and generally murky storytelling, the movie was entertaining and well-paced. Almost despite the directing, the plot had some semblance of logic, and none of the actors were particularly horrible.Don't get me wrong; it's not a good movie by any normal criteria, and has a host of problems.

Sure, we're not dealing with a prodigious talent here, but Boll must be doing something right to assemble such a recognisable cast. Who else would think to produce an Arthurian pantomime with Hellboy, The Transporter, the Bandit, Gimli the dwarf, Shaggy from Scooby Doo, Hallam Foe's mum, one of the GoodFellas and a Terminator? A triumph of enthusiasm over ability, it has all the traditional fantasy ingredients: reluctant yet vengeful hero, damsel in distress, evil sorceror, good sorceror, world-weary king, cowardly duke, orc-like hordes, and even throws in a boomerang and a few babes in the wood for good measure.Unfortunately, it's all dungeons without dragons and lords without rings. In the event, Boll overcooks and overcuts the whole caboodle to make it seem more exciting than it really is. But you have to admire him for playing it so straight.One question: is Statham's character called Farmer because of what he does or because his brow looks like a ploughed field?",

They are attacked by Krugs controlled by the magician Gallian (Ray Liotta). Zeph is killed and Solana is captured. With Norick (Ron Perlman) and Bastian, he sets off to rescue Solana. They meet Elora (Kristanna Loken) in the forest. King Konreid (Burt Reynolds) is undermined by his scheming nephew Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard) who is in league with Gallian. Merick (John Rhys-Davies) is the King's right hand man but his daughter Muriella (Leelee Sobieski) had also been seeing Gallian in secret.I probably gave this an extra point because I actually played the video game. Uwe Boll is a horrible director. This movie has enough money to work. The acting power is there on the screen. Statham is solid. However, this is an Uwe Boll movie. The story is boring. The dialog is horribly clunky. All the royal intrigue is unnecessary. It could have simply be Statham on a quest but that would be too good to be true. There's no way Boll would make anything good.",

The movie was based on this dungeon-crawling adventure, but to those that have played it, could you honestly tell? Why make a movie based on a video game if it has little to nothing to do with the original plot? Isn't the point to make the fans happy? I thought, oh well, as its own movie it should still be okay, but what did we get? A main character actually named \"Farmer\" (The originality is baffling!), a half-baked story-line with characters more two-dimensional than the cast of \"Alien Resurrection\" (No, Jason, less subtlety!), the odd mention of the most important enemy of the game known as the Krug with costumes about as convincing as an episode of Power Rangers, and a fight between sorcerers that was more boring than their flat, emotionless monotones.

The movie made no sense, it started as if it was 20 minutes into the movie already and you never had a clue what was happening . It was 2 hours of randomly changing shots that did not fit together to make a movie. The bad guy charter looked like Wayne Newton and could not be taken seriously. The movie did not end, it just stopped and resolved almost nothing. The movie it self was very poorly made. The colors would totally change each time the shot changed, like each camera was using different lenses and had not been white balanced. One shot would be full color and clear, the next shot washed out and grainy, as if shot on a home video camera. The props did not fit the movie.

I'd never seen a Jason Statham movie before and while I wasn't blown away, the guy is good in action scenes. He also appears to channel Bruce Willis and Steven Seagall as far as talking in a whisper to appear tough. Oh, well. I know Uwe Boll is derided as the anti-Christ, but come on, this was good stuff. the photography, music and pace were all good.The story is about a man named Farmer, who has a wife who loves him nd a little boy who adores him. He lives off the land and just wasn't to be left alone, no such luck! an evil wizard named Gallian, well-played by Ray Liotta, has unleashed the Krug, beasts that fight like men. They raze his village and kill his young son and in-laws!! Whew, shades of Conan or Beastmaster! Daunted but unyielding Farmer sets off with his friends to see if his wife might have survived. Ron Perlman is really good here.going on at the same time is the Gallian's seduction of Muriella, a much better than usual Leelee Sobieski, who looks gorgeous in this. Her father is the king's mage, the always welcome John Rhys-Davies (from TLOTR!!) and King Konried, Burt Reynolds of all people, is being betrayed by his slimy nephew, played by Matthew Lillard. initially I thought Lillard was miscast here, but apparently the part is supposed to be humorous, so he did a good job too.I like the part in the forest with Farmer when he runs amok with the elvish women who live there, Kristanna Loken is one of them, what a babe! And I like the rescue of Farmer's wife and the revelation about his lineage. OK, you could see it coming ,but so what? I like this move, the special effects were good, the action fierce and you could really root for the hero. There is depth here, not everyone makes it without being scarred, beat up or outright killed, which was refreshing. The ending is a little abrupt, but people complained it was too long so... Overall I think this is a good flick, much better than the two Dungeons and Dragons movies. Check it out for yourself, you might be pleasantly surprised.",

I felt it before you came.\" Gallian (Ray Liotta): \"You are developing your powers well, Muriella. Our time together is paying off!\"Pretty much encapsulates what's wrong with this flick. The dialogue is horrible, the script and director give the actors nothing meaningful to work with and the setup is completely cardboard in its appeal.Don't get me wrong, cardboard can be entertaining, so long as some of the other elements of successful filmmaking come together, as well. No such luck, here.As other reviewers have pointed out, the action choreography is lame, the camera work weak, the editing often insane, the art direction and cinematography limited or nonexistent, the musical score pointless at best...where to begin?Well, I have nothing personal against a silly, anachronistic, amateurish action movie script that is concocted as a means of wiling away a harmless hour or two, even when it results in bad acting because of the director's complete lack of vision. It's kind of fun to observe how certain actors manage themselves in such a void. And as bad as he was in his role as King Konreid, Burt Reynolds was quite entertainingly cardboard, in my opinion. He walked right through the role playing his bored, wig-wearing self, and he was the only thing I could readily remember, months after I had seen this movie. He was so bad he actually stood out amongst this filmic muck...for the wrong reasons, of course.A friend of mine had loaned me the DVD, along with several other movies he owns, but I couldn't be sure, months later, whether I had returned this one or something similar. So after searching my place recently to no avail, I was racking my brains for the name of the title, and I finally resorted to searching online using Reynolds' name and the word \"king.\" That was all I could remember of this dud.Pretty sad, huh? That my memory seems to be failing me. Or that Burt Reynolds in a miscast role is the most memorable thing in a movie starring Ray Liotta, also miscast, with Matthew Lillard, also miscast. The list of miscast actors taking away career embarrassment and (presumably, hopefully) a hefty paycheck in exchange for their participation in this $60m stinker continues most of the way down the line. A possible exception, and what stands out in retrospect for me the most since my memory has now had a chance to be prompted by IMDb's cast listing for the movie, is that I was barely able to recall John Rhys-Davies or Kristanna Loken in their respective, fairly substantial roles here. I think this may be a compliment to the jobs they did, because it may mean that they turned in acting performances that rose above the level of outright ridiculousness, and they thereby avoided the WTF stare I was giving the rest of the cast.I can't be sure, though. 'Cause none of this movie was memorable for the right reasons.",

Did Burt not save a few of those Sharkey's Machine dollars?This movie is a train wreck from scene one.A boomerang?

Did Michael Madsen get thrown in the drunk tank and Liotta owed him a favor?Statham? STATHAM? There is no realistic chain of events that I can come up with that would actually encourage Statham to be in this film. Maybe he wandered onto the wrong set and figured it out about 90 days into filming?The only good casting decision was Kristanna Loken - Lesbian wood nymph leader who kills men. Yeah, that makes sense. The only problem with Loken's casting, is the movie was rated PG-13 and she couldn't use her two best assets to win favor with a select portion of the audience.Did I mention Burt Reynolds was cast as a medieval king?

From my point of view, I find \"In the Name of the King\" to be his best movie to date(granted I haven't yet seen House of the Dead).Of course that isn't saying much, considering the caliber of everything else he's done.I saw somebody complain about the CGI.Well it's better than in some far superior movies I've seen, and definitely above TV standards(I'll try and not think of Dungeons&Dragons:Wrath of the Dragon God).Who cares that the castle in the background is visibly CGI?It's not you would've believed it was a real castle anyway, and I doubt there are many fantasy movies that can actually boast with a realistic CGI medieval castle(not even LOTR managed to pull that off every time).Sure, the plot is awful, maybe that's even an understatement, but it's Uwe, he surrounds himself with incompetence with a skill unsurpassed by anyone(I truly think, had he found a decent, capable crew of men assisting him with his movies, he would be past the 5 star mark here on IMDb).Which brings us to the acting.Well, what can you expect from people miscast who've been handed a terrible script?Still, familiar faces sure do help with the viewing of such bad dialogue and intrigue.Burt Reynolds, why did you do it?Was it worth the money?Was the sum THAT high? Jason Statham and Ray Liotta.Well, Statham is only suited for some roles, this isn't one of them.And Ray, well he fell off the wagon long time ago.This is just another movie in the company of Mr. Chelios that makes me forget why I once liked him(the other being Revolver).I've never liked Claire Forlani, always seemed wooden to me.Seems miss Sobieski learned something from her.Why is that, I don't know, since Leelee showed some promise early on in her career.Rhys-Davies and Perlman can be forgiven, they're not at their first mischief of the kind.I kind of liked Will Sanderson(again) and Brian White in their roles though.On the other hand, I liked this movie enough to give it a 5.Well to be honest it's more of a 5.5, but IMDb's rating system isn't my cup of coffee.Why did I rate this \"insert insult here\" movie a 5?Because, unlike the others, it's a little better directed, it's a fun popcorn movie, and looks a lot better.Probably the best looking Boll film to date.Plus it manages to be fantasy, despite the poorly written script.And some of the excesses of Boll's previous films are missing.Which is good(even though the misplaced music is still there, the overly long emotional wannabe scenes also).Thus proving my theory that Boll is learning with every new movie he makes(hopefully, even though he'd need hundreds of movies to breach the decent barrier).I still don't understand why people are so keen on attacking the guy.Has he reached that kind of cult status?Because that is achieved by overly despised people as well as the overly appreciated.I wonder why people keep seeing his movies, or at least keep an eye on what he's doing, when they consider him so despicable.If only you wouldn't pay attention to the man, he'd probably think he has nothing else to prove and retire.Then again, why should we care if he continues to do his movies?No one forces us to watch them.",

            "content": "I'm sure this movie sounded like a good idea on paper. Why else would anyone bother to even attempt to put this mess together? It's pretty apparent that they were going for the whole Willow meets Lord of the Rings meets Kingdom of Heaven meets...you get the point. The end result is pretty abysmal to say the least. I've seen some really bad movies in my day, as I'm sure we all have. In the Name of the King makes a serious push to climb atop \"worst movies I ever saw\" lists everywhere. Bad story, bad acting, bad special effects, bad costumes, and hell, even the DVD menus suck. For about the first 10 minutes I was actually fooled into believing that this might not be a total train wreck. My optimism soon turned to despair as I got my first look at the evil creatures referred to as The Krug and I cringed for the first time of many as I immediately realized what I had gotten myself into. The Krug are a race of animal warriors but remind me more of villains from Power Rangers and thus lead to laughter every time you see them which I'm sure wasn't the intent of the filmmakers. Unfortunately this was only the beginning of my nightmare. Despite the fact that there is some decent acting talent in the movie, none of them really belong in this movie. I would be very surprised if whoever did the casting on this film still has a job. Burt Reynolds as the King? Ray Liotta as a sorcerer? Matthew Lillard as anything other than the quirky funny guy? The only thing worse than Lillard's horrible English accent is everyone else's complete disregard of one. Even Claire Forlani who is actually from England, decided to forego her natural way of speaking for this role. I guess she didn't want to show anyone up. I have to admit though, it is pretty funny to listen to how out of place Ray Liotta sounds with his Jersey accent in what's supposed to be some medieval time. When it comes to the fight scenes in the movie, they're actually not as bad as everything else, but I guess that's not really saying much. The fights could be pretty entertaining to look at if I could actually see them better. Bad camera angles and quick cuts negate what seemed to be respectable choreography but I guess we'll just have to take their word for it. The story is basically non-existent. If someone told me right now that this movie was 95 percent improvised, I wouldn't be shocked. Actually, I'd probably be a little bit relieved. The movie jumps around scene after scene not really doing or saying anything different from other movies of it's kind and not nearly as good. The dialogue will remind you of a junior high school play and I can probably say this again, not nearly as good. Altogether I'd say you can probably get a more enjoyable story by reading a kid a fairy tale at bed time. As if the movie wasn't bad enough, you really get nothing else on this disc. I don't know if there were different versions of this released but the version I got from Netflix has very poor special features. Then again I guess that's a good thing because once you're done watching this movie you probably don't want any more. Fact is, you're probably gonna want to stick it back in it's envelope, run to your nearest post office and make sure this gets back to them as soon as possible. I would've over nighted the thing to them if I could've. On another side note, this did not come to me in Blu-Ray as most of my movies do. I guess this movie looks so bad that Netflix did not want anyone to see this atrocity in high def. Speaking of Netflix, this teaches me a lesson. I am no longer gonna add everything they recommend to my list, especially when the first 15 to 20 movies in my queue are all on \"very long wait.\" That's how you end up with a movie like this in your mailbox and disappointment in your heart :-( Sorry, veered off the review for a bit. In closing, from the outside looking in this movie might look like it deserves a chance. Epic battles, burning villages, hideous creatures, Burt Reynolds' ninjas (yes, I said Burt Reynolds' ninjas), and tree dwelling lesbians led by Kristanna Loken. Sounds fun but truth is I was looking at the clock the whole time and at the end I wasn't sure if I should be glad it was over or disappointed at the precious two hours of my life that I'll never see again. Honestly, I felt a little of both. If you feel the urge to watch this kind of movie just do yourself a favor and watch one disc of any of the Lord of the Rings movies and get on with your day. In the Name of the King gets half a star out of pity and another half a star just because Jason Statham is so freaking cool, even in this piece of garbage. Best line in the whole movie, \"Are you gonna fight, or talk me to death?\" So a grand total of one star or if you don't understand the star system, it's really, really bad!

Ray Liotta in most of his scenes looks like all he's missing is a white tiger and Sigfried in the background.

I highly recommend you don't follow suit.",

            "content": "It seems to be very popular among reviewers to pan this film. I think it depends on what you value as a viewer. If you are a fan of the fantasy movie realm (eg. Lord of the Rings) and especially if you are a fantasy role-play gamer (eg. Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer Quest, etc.), I think this movie has a lot to offer. I have to say that I enjoyed myself thoroughly the whole way through.Firstly, the setting is sublime - I think everyone would have to agree with that comment. Vancouver Island has never looked so majestic - the mountains tower over gorgeous lakes with a rugged pastoral quality mixed in for good measure. The castles are extremely well done as well. Overall, I think Vancouver Island stands up nicely to the epic landscapes of New Zealand in this film.The armour and weaponry are absolutely first rate. Again, if you're not a fan of medieval constructs, this might not hold much sway for you, but for me, it was sublime. The armourers did a tremendous job of creating a unique look for the different ranks (from royalty to elite guard to the rank-and-file), and the Krugs had that nasty kind of raw iron look to both their armour and weapons.Next, the fights were extremely well done. I would say that the fights were more varied, more realistic, and more skillfully done than those in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is high praise indeed. The sheer numbers involved in the mass battles were also awe inspiring. I think they actually had several hundred actors playing those scenes out, not just 20 or 30 and CGIing the rest. Speaking of special effects, the budget wasn't huge, but what was done was effective and fairly original.As for the acting and storyline, it wasn't of the same calibre as Lord of the Rings. Several actors in the cast put in wooden and amateur performances. However, I found myself drawn to several of the characters: John Rhys-Davies, Burt Reynolds, the head of the royal guard, and the main character (Jason Statham). Statham was convincing in his \"First Blood Rambo\" sort of way - a super proficient fighter who just wants to be left alone to his simple ways. The storyline is not grandiose or particularly original, but really, there are very few original story lines in film; for audiences to connect with a theme, it must strike familiar chords. This plot touches on many of these well-worn archetypal patterns: the long-lost son returns, the good mage turns mad with power, the honest man overcomes, the power-hungry entitled nephew gets what's coming to him, the peasant outdoes the royalty, etc. I don't see this as a negative - these plot lines are part of the greatest stories in history as well. Are they brilliantly pulled off in this movie? I wouldn't say so, but they are not badly done either.Anyway, this is certainly not a perfect film, but there are many very fine elements to it. If you love seeing this type of world put into film, I think you will find much to enjoy.",

All these reviews on this film mentioning lord of the rings should watch this film as its own film and stop comparing it to a series of films that will never be matched in its genre (even tho I think they all sucked) I enjoyed this film, its was never going to be Oscar winning but its alright. Ray Liotta, Jason Statham and Ron Pearlman are all good actors and that alone gives you a reason to watch this. Burt Reynolds is king!!! That's genius in itself. I will stand up and say \"I ENJOYED THIS FILM\". Fight scene's are well done, the story is passable. Wouldn't ever call this one of my fave films but its worth a watch if you fancy something different. I must also add I like Leelee Sobieski a lot.Give it a go.I did and am pleased about it and YES I watched the added 37 minutes.",

            "content": "In a kingdom of Ehb, ridden with fantasy clich\u00e9s and bad dialog, lives a farmer named Farmer(Jason Statham) with his family. A sudden rise of krugs, creatures of poorly made rubber masks, take on the land and Farmer must stand up against them, to save his family. The king (Burt Reynolds) is trying his best to protect the kingdom against evil Gallian (Ray Liotta) with the help of his loyal magus (John Rhys-Davies). Meanwhile the kings idiot nephew (Matthewe Lillard) is trying to take over the kingdom, him being with league with Gallian. Other players in this drama are Murielle (Leelee Sobieski), the daughter of magus, Norick (Ron Perlman) who is Farmers buddy and Bastian (Will Sanderson, Boll's goto guy), brother of Farmers wife (Claire Forlani).Now let me say this at first: \"In The Name Of The King\" is far, far better fantasy film than \"Dungeons and Dragons\". It also is the best Uwe Boll film I've seen to date. And still, it is ridden with the exact same problems as Boll's other films: bad pacing, terrible script, lack of tension, bad casting and terrible, terrible acting.With the exception of Rhys-Davies and Perlman, the main cast is out of their place in this film. This goes especially to Reynolds and Lilliard, who look out of their place like a priest in a bordello. Ray Liotta does a terrible role as Gallian, he almost rivals with Jeremy Iron's performance is \"Dungeons and Dragons\". I'm having hard time of deciding whom of the two did the worst job as evil wizard. What comes to Lillird, he over acts with his manners and his accent so much, that he'd deserved a award of a sort from it. Reynolds in the other hand just seems lost and doesn't know how to act in a period piece. And Statham does what Statham does: fights and grunts.Now, what comes to visual quality of the film, Boll has managed to over do himself. There are some pretty shots in the film and the scenery is pretty. The biggest flaw are the krugs, that look like poorly made LOTR orc Halloween costumes.The battle scenes are also a miss in this story, as they are mainly pretty boring. They lack tension and at least I just couldn't care less about them. They also contain some of the most idiotic things I've seen, like sudden entery of ninjas and krugs shooting themselves in the air with catapults. I mean, wtf?. Also the editing is all over the place and the scenes jump around seemingly without logic.Surprisingly enough, I managed to watch the film through. Boll has really managed to do a flick that is at least mediocre at best. He still has a lot to learn, but maybe after ten more film he manages to a film, that is mediocre all the way, not just at its best.",

It's not \"holy crap, I'm gonna slit my wrists\" bad, which is usually the case with Boll's movies, but more of a \"yawn, I need more coffee\" kind of bad. It was truly too boring for me to concentrate on, but I got that the story is about an evil magician who's trying to take over a kingdom. He takes a farmer's wife along with some other would-be slaves, and kills her son, so another part of the story is the farmer trying to get his wife back. Oh, and he becomes a hero, of course.There's soldiers, magic, some sort of monsters, dryads and other things here, so hey... a lot of fantasy elements. However, the action scenes are outdrawn and repetitive, editing is terrible and the pacing is equally bad. Practically everything in the movie meant to come as a surprise comes at the wrong time, and all the characters are horribly shallow and uninteresting. When it comes to the soundtrack, I can't remember it, so I guess it was neither good nor bad. Some other commentator called the special effects \"top notch\". I'd say they're average.I don't really feel like wasting more time on it than this, so I'll sum it up with as few words as possible: Uninspiring.

The acting is below the actors standard. The orc things / evil creatures costumes are really bad and the armor is rubbery of plastic. I personally think i could have made a better movie with a bunch of Live action role players with there own gear and actors who just graduated from acting school and a 10th of the budget of this movie.The running point of this movie is the actors that don't rely feel for the movie or the script.

I had hoped that maybe Bloodrayne was a crap-luck situation, but no; the other reports are dead-on. This movie, though, was BY FAR better than the other. Here's my take: First, the acting. Let's just get it out of the way right now: there really wasn't any to speak of whatsoever from half the cast. The actors were just reading the lines. A couple of the others were over-the-top all the way through--Ray Liotta and Matthew Lillard (hope I spelled those correctly, sorry if I didn't). The only one who came close to not sucking was John Rhys-Davies; he was not bad (that's the best I can give him for this one). The rest--pathetic, and it's ALL Boll's fault.The action, though, was pretty good. Lot of mixed genres in there--Western-style martial arts, Midieval, Kung Fu, fantasy. Thing is, it was all done well. The actors were physically on par, and the choreography was really well done.Also, kudos to the special effects guys. The costumes, weapons, effects, etc., were all high caliber and creative. That crew gets points for doing their job right.Last but not least, the plot. Not completely sure what to say here. Not horrible, but not that memorable either. So I guess the plot is just fairly ho-hum.Final judgment: if you want some mindless violence, watch it. Turn the sound off while they're talking or just fast-forward to the battle sequences. The rest, forget it. And feel pity for the actors that they had to suffer under Boll's lack of ability to direct.",

It suffers from everything any B-movie does: sub-par acting, cheesy special effects, cameos by famous people obviously in the hopes of making the film seem more credible, and so on.However; as a B-movie, this thing is pretty good. Nothing new, nothing groundbreaking, nothing epic, but definitely something to watch. The fight scenes are reminiscent of old-school '90s karate movies, and are decently choreographed. The story, while delivered with all that lovely B-movie cheese, it rather well crafted (even if Boll makes a few holes here and there), and I found it surprisingly entertaining.Really what I'm trying to say here is Uwe Boll is not as bad a director as I had initially thought. I am a rather large fan of B-movies, and before this flick I was ready to hang Uwe by his Bolls for his previous atrocities. Now I see him in a new light. He is not, by any stretch of the imagination, the next Wes Anderson or David Cronenberg, but neither is he the Michael Bay of the B-movie set (not anymore anyway).",

The lighting was atrocious, no grading to add depth. Special fx weren't that spacial. The script was well lets just say a room of monkeys could do better. The actors I thought could save this but they didn't, it looked as though in each scene they were repeating a mantra in their heads \"think of the money, oh god just think of the money\" Cus their performances looked phoned in at best.

Jason Statham is a surprisingly good fit, though Ron Perlman was merely okay, which I though was somewhat weird. I expected it to be the other way around. Most of the fight scenes are pretty cool, though the end could have been a lot better, in my opinion. There are plenty of silly little things that make no sense at all (ninjas?

I didn't realize that until the end of the movie and seeing his name there, it all made sense.This movie is really bad. If you watch it with a bunch of your friends while toking some homegrown wacky weed or having some beers... laughing at all the plot holes and stupid bits, then you might enjoy it (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1).I couldn't understand how Uwe Boll can continue to make movies and how he could recruit such an all-star cast for this movie. I think I understand now.My first theory is that Uwe Boll is, in fact, proof of God. Because the only way I could imagine that he could still be making movies is if he had sold his soul to the Devil. However, I have since been educated that his films are backed by the German government. Corporate Welfare again rears its ugly head.As to why such big names appear in his movies... I think I realize the answer to this too. The worst director of all time was Ed Wood. His movies are truly awful. They were so bad, that they gained a following of fans who would get drunk or stoned and pick apart how bad his movies were. Ed Wood gained further notoriety with the movie about him which featured Johnny Depp. I think Hollywood and Hollywood actors have come to the insane idea that Ed Wood was actually a misunderstood genius. That awful film will immortalize you just as much as a work of genius.As I was watching \"In the Name of the King\", I paid attention to the acting of Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, etc. I think they were having fun in their roles, not taking them seriously at all. They knew the movie was a steaming pile of fecal matter and they were reveling in it.Anyway, I cannot recommend this movie. Not for rental, not to illegally download for free. If your kids think that Power Rangers are cool... then I would think this movie would be adequate for them. This is definitely elementary school level.",

Claire Forlani could have saved a little the movie with her agreeable presence, but when calling her husband \"Farmer\" all the magic was gone ( imagine being called by your wife - a \"peasant\"). So if you expect a new Lord Of The Rings you will be very disappointed, but if you really pay attention to the movie is the funniest crappiest movie I've seen in a long time.

Hiring Tony Ching to direct fast, elegant fight scenes was the icing on the cake. \"Dungeon Siege\" has a hero who isn't interested in saving the kingdom, he just minds his own business which only by accident becomes the same as saving the kingdom. That attitude keeps him with both feet on the ground with all the black magic around. This movie realized swords and sorcery are the most important ingredients for a sword and sorcery movie - I needn't point that out if it wasn't for too many films of the genre which failed here and thought it was about a princess falling in love or elves in nice spotless dresses discussing the burden of immortality.",

Which is especially ironic given his Doctorate in ... Literature! On the evidence he has provided (ie his films) he does not know how to evaluate a script, or cast actors, establish or develop characters, or anything else that relates to the job of 'Director'. Bearing in mind that his movies are produced with money from his own investment fund, he is obviously a highly skilled fund-raiser. Instead of continually hiring himself, perhaps he will someday allow someone else -- a real Director -- the opportunity to tell us a compelling story.

Those expectations were unfounded, and those two factors were both deceptive: the plot and characters were surprisingly well-crafted, and Reynolds put in what may be the performance of his career. (That may not be saying much, I'll admit, but it's something.) The acting all around is quite good, particularly at spots (most of them Ray Liotta's) where the action lent itself to over-the-top bravura but the performers opted for a more subtle approach. Some of the plot twists you can see a mile away, and others come out of nowhere, so while you know things are going to work out in the end the viewer can't be quite sure how it's going to get there. The only part I didn't care for, and that not by much, was seeing, without comment or explanation, two black men in charge of the army in what is clearly a society based on medieval Europe -- Brian J. White and Ron Selmour are both fantastic and deserving actors, but as out of place logistically speaking as the equally distracting lin-kuei (Chinese ninjas) who also serve in the King's army.

Jason Statham - Imports his role from the Transporter into this film.LeeLee Sobieski - Imports her role as Joan of Arc, reluctant savior of the Kingdom of \"Ed\". Burt Reynolds - Imports his nonchalant attitude from just about every movie he has ever done. The only thing missing is his half winded giggle. Matthew Lillard - Imports his persona from the first Scream movie. Ray Liotta - I don't know where he tapped into to get ready for this role but it was simply ridiculous to watch. Ray, I know Saruman, I've worked with Saruman and Ray you are no Saruman. John Rhys Davies - Actually the only actor to give a decent performance in this movie. I think the only reason he signed on was to give it some credibility following his success from Lord of the Rings. The costumes weren't too bad but the getup that Ray Liotta had was just nothing short of idiotic. He looked like a wanna be Liberace. I half expected him to start playing the piano as he described his plans to his captives. Some of the dialogue was half-assed as well. In one of the scenes towards the beginning, I heard something like \"C'mon over here\". I swear I almost expected that phrase to end with Dude.

Can anyone tell me why directors still do that? I mean, who does that?? I've never seen a boxer knock out his opponent and stand there with his arm stretched out posing in that \"final blow\" pose. Another critic saw the same thing we saw- the \"krug\" were reminiscent of the original Planet of the Apes mixed with a little Orc.Also, I couldn't believe how long the movie was. It seemed like it dragged on for ages. I knew I didn't really want to watch it, I'm just glad we didn't pay to see it.",

But 'In the name of the King' is this biggest disgrace to film in the history of man! appalling plot, script, directing character development. I don't think there were any lines that would even make it into the first draft of the 'LotR' script, A blind, dyslexic, disabled monkey could write a better script than Boll. All the banter is appalling and the chat is cringe worthy, my favourite is where Ron Perlman says to the kid: 'give me the chicken', I mean that is the poorest most badly acted scene in the history of cinema. I'd rather get cancer, AIDS and be castrated all at the same time than watch this disease to the cinema world ever again.

So i watched it and i have to say Jason Statham you rock. OK that being said there are a few problems with this film Burt Reynolds although Im a fan he wasn't meant to play a king and then there is good ol ray some thought he was miss cast as well i think he did a fine job the costume designers on the other hand did not the story is typical and the action scenes in a couple brief moments it reminded me of when i was a kid watching power rangers yes i watched power rangers. So now your thinking well thats a lot of problems right well not for me it wasn't i was completely entertained i truly enjoyed this film i think Jason statham is phenomenal I cant help but root for him as a hero. But let me tell you this is one you definitely have to turn the brain off for just enjoy it .but this is a fare warning I am seriously easy to please when it comes too films I wish other could be too i think it would suck to have your enjoyment confined to a certain stable or type of film i count myself lucky I apologize for my spelling and punctuation etc and oh i didn't even quote poetry or use crazy large words and if i did I'm sure that i spelled incorrectly and or miss used them",

But then I saw Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, and other recognizable actors. Given that it's the quality of a B movie, I was really surprised to see the class of actors they were able to get. I was intrigued by this and somehow sat through the rest of the movie. But unfortunately it never improved beyond bad.A bad director can make ANY actor look bad. This was a very amateurish film, and without the charm of a B movie.

But other than that give me a sword, a peasant on a quest and a few extras covered in a splash of claret and I'm happy.Saddly I just cannot excuse sloppy direction and lazy editing. Which is what the problems with this film really are. I have no real issue with cheesy dialog - A new Hope anyone? - and the occasional dodgey prosthetic won't destroy my movie experience if the story has drawn me in. But this film is so riddled with holes and confusing bit's of information that I just could not bring myself to enjoy it.I've not played the game that it is based on, but I assume that the reason for such bomb shells of 'a magus' power being linked to the king they serve,' or weird tree women dangling upside down in some forest comes from the source, but these concepts feel crowbarred in here, and jar uncomfortably.Unlike many reviewers I wasn't disgusted by the acting. Here is a handy hint regarding films. If you want to see great acting, you do not go and see a movie with a subtitle following a colon. (Jack Sparrow does mess this rule up a little) Seriously, did anyone really see the fact that this was staring Jason Statham and Burt Reynolds, notice it was directed by the man who thought that BloodRaye deserved a sequel rather than a prison sentence and spotted that it is also based on a computer game and yet still thought they were about to watch a film acting master class? In short the actors all do what their paid to do here, though the accents do grate from time to time.Re-reading that last sentence I do like both Reynolds and Stratham, but I'm not sure I would call them great actors.Basically no, it's not a great movie, but I'm finding it hard to slate as I feel that this is like an abused child who's father has ignored and left it to go about it's day unloved.

It's a mess and a amateur attempt at that.Dialogue \u0096 Dull, uninteresting, and just plain silly most of the time.Directing-Producing- it's Uwe Boll; well known for getting sucker investors to fund his film work.Casting \u0096 The miscasted actors are (in order): Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Jason Stratham, Matthew Lillard and Claire Forlani. These respectable actors must have needed money to pay their delinquent taxes, child support or alimony. Acting \u0096 The actors must have laughed off camera to have to speak such ridiculous dialogue. I would have loved to seen the out-takes. These are talented actors that appear talent-less in this film. Exceptions are Kristanna Loken and John Rhys-Davies who do pretty well in their roles. Music \u0096 The score is underwhelming at all times. Completely dull and forgettable.Color \u0096 The color is so washed out it almost looks like it was shot with 3 colors; black, white and brown.Location \u0096 Lackluster location used for this film. Apparently, all the good locations in Canada were being used.Camera work \u0096 At times, it seems like they have a child running around with a hand held camera. The camera is jumpy and does amateur like zoom ins.Fight Action scenes \u0096 Fair to poor and at times, silly. (Not sure how the main character appears to be the best fighter in the land without any training). This is the worst movie I've ever seen\u0085.and perhaps; the worst movie ever made.

When a farmer's family is adversely impacted by the evil beings he decides to take up with some some of the other locals and go toe-to-toe with the evil sorcerer and the king's son.This movie is directed by Uwe Boll (BloodRayne) and stars Jason Statham (Crank), Ray Liotta (Goodfellas), Ron Pearlman (Hellboy), Burt Reynolds (Gator), Leelee Sobieski (Joy Ride), John Rhys-Davies (Lord of the Rings), Matthew Lillard (Scream), Kristanna Loken (Terminator 3) and Brian White (Stomp the Yard).The storyline and cast for this had tremendous potential. Unfortunately the execution was absolutely awful as were the special effects. The magic scenes by Liotta were painful to watch. I'm not sure Liotta was a good selection as the villain. The action scenes were uneven. Some fight scenes with Statham were good, some that needed CGI (like the rope scene) were as painful to0 watch as Liotta's magic. The creatures in the forest were awful and wasn't as menacing as the orcs in Lord of the Rings. The movie run time was also way too long. The film obviously tried to ride the Lord of the Rings coat tail...it fell way short.Overall this felt like a bad episode of Xena.

I came to the conclusion about halfway through that even black-cloaked Power Ranger ninjas couldn't save the movie. But give them credit for trying. Some winning quotes: \"They don't scare easy.\" Repeated in the ballpark of five times throughout the course of the film.King to Farmer: \"Why do you think you did so well in the battle? Growing up as a farmer has made you strong.\" You know, because pulling turnips and acting as a human scarecrow translates really well into combat skills.Evil genius: \"You want to accelerate?! Fine! Then I... will ACCELERATE!!!!\" I mean wow. Somewhere in the Pacific, there's a school of sharks that just got mugged.(Apparently Schizo) Man in prison: \"Don't worry, we'll get you out of here.\" Sorry, long-haired blonde guy. So far you've gotten your best friend killed, your brother-in-law captured, your sister taken into custody, and yourself imprisoned. Not only are you all by yourself, you've got a pretty bad record.Creepy Hippy Tree-Lady: \"Men. Not only useless, but helpless.\" Later, hippy-tree-lady confirms that this is a gender discrimination and not a race discrimination by maiming forest intruders on a Bust Basis.General: \"They don't scare easy. But they don't have any archers.\" Repeated for good measure. But don't worry, because projectiles in this movie fly in relative slow-motion anyway -- yes, even the Flaming Orc-opaults.Merrick to poisoned king: \"Your time is coming to an end.\" Nothing particularly bad about this quote, except that the writers, and producers, and director simultaneously forgot about it five minutes later. No, the king makes a full and unexplained recovery. I need to get with his HMO.Spoiled prince to king: \"Can you pass the chicken?\" It's a regular knee-slapper.Evil Genius to Magi (question has just been raised, \"the rules say you can only be a magi as long as you serve the king): \"It turns out, the (orcs) don't have a king. So do you know what I did? I made myself king!\" Awwww, crap. We forgot to say which king! We'll remember that next time we make a rule-book for how magic works. Side-note, I'm totally naming myself King of the Grass. Side-Side-Note, how is it that the evil genius can make swords fly around when he's fighting the other magician, but when it comes to killing Farmer, the best he can do is build a giant Transformers robot made out of books?Emo Prison Lady: \"We're going to die here.\" Me: Yeah, with that attitude, probably.All that said, I think you should definitely pay money to go watch this movie. Treat it like Mystery Science Theater, and bring a couple robots to help you shout insults at the screen. To the best of my knowledge, this wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but my friends and I are still laughing ourselves insane twelve hours later. It's rich.",

            "content": "The movie market is full of movies based on video games. I even dare to say that practically all the most popular games have already known a film adaptation, from \"Super Mario\" to \"Angry Birds\". I've seen quite a few of them, and so far I haven't found one that I could say I liked. Or rather, what I can remember right now...I don't know the game \"Dungeon Siege\", but from what I saw in a quick search on the Internet it must be very similar to other games of the pseudo-medieval genre. Wicked kings, dungeons and sorcerers are part of this universe. They are fantasy, intended to stimulate the imagination and thirst for action of those who have never picked up a real medieval sword.Directed by Uwe Bol, a director I didn't know until now, and of whom I have not very recommendable references (but let's not, because of that, judge in advance!), the film I've just seen is relatively pleasant, and is based on a struggle for power in a kingdom called Ehb. On one side we have a wicked sorcerer and the late king's nephew, who wants to reign in his place, and on the other we have a poor farmer, at the head of an unlikely revolution. We've seen a lot of this, medieval themed films are always exploring these themes.While originality is lacking here, the film works reasonably well and isn't as bad as some have claimed. There are far worse things floating around between big lauds. All right, the film lacks a more effective direction and a greater epic sense, much of what you see has already been done in other better films and the characters are sketches without personality. But considering that the movie is based on a game, I think a decent effort was made.The cast has several big names. For me, the best and most competent is Ray Liotta, who really makes an effort to raise the quality of what he does with the poor material he receives and manages to steal our attention whenever he appears on the scene. However, I also liked Ron Perlman and John Rhys-Davies. I didn't like Jason Statham, he seems to be in the movie just for the pay, and the rest of the cast has little or little time to do something.Technically, the film deserves praise for its excellent cinematography, the good shooting options and the chosen locations. The soundtrack harmoniously unites an excellent original soundtrack and several hard rock themes that appear more during the credits, and stays in the ear for some time.",

I saw other people saying : \" In dungeon siege u start as a Farmer and what did Uwe Boll think lets name the main character Farmer\", or at least something like that, the fact is that it is explained at the beginning of the movie why they called him Farmer, it was popular in those ages that a man would be called by his craftsmanship, Blacksmiths where usually called by that name, and not many ppl gave importance to what their real name was. About the story, it's pretty much classic, girls gets in love with the wrong guy, a traitor relative, a lost son of the king, bla,bla,bla.... But it is well put on screen and that is what counts, it is pretty predictable but it is not boring, and it has it's funny moments some times. So overall i think this movie is above average.

A nearby village is attacked by Krugs where a farmer mounts a rescue mission to save the captured villagers and gain vengeance for the death of his son. Swords, magic, large scale battles, sorcerers, woodland women, ninjas, a CGI boomerang and a myriad of famous actors destroying their careers. Yes, you guessed it. It is a discounted version of 'Lord of the Rings' except it's an adaptation of a video game that hardly anyone played. Aside from Statham's standard stuntwork and Lillard's enjoyably campy performance, there is nothing to enjoy here. Everything about this production looks cheap. Authenticity ventured across the land, into another kingdom called \"Middle Earth\". All that remains is laziness. The houses look like plastic. The Krugs clearly resemble extras wearing 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle' costumes. Perlman is using hair gel in a middle aged kingdom. The protagonist is a farmer called Farmer. \"He's taken two legions out of twelve!\", \"how many are left?\", \"...two thirds!\". Boll loves filming a one-dimensional make out session. Liotta and Reynolds are unfathomably terrible, as two kings fighting for...something...I guess power? Look, the story was so basic that I simply switched my brain off and admired the passion that Boll attempted to inject. I mean, he tried bless him. But this isn't an eating competition where you get a pat on the back for giving it a good go. This. Is. Film critiquing! You don't get points for trying. He failed, miserably. After the final showdown, which has more swirling books than a library in a storm, the film ends. Done. Finished. No more. Two hours blurred into one gigantic mess.

            "content": "I've heard so much negativity & just plain hatred for this swords & sorcery adventure & it's director Uwe Boll but i Never listen to what everyone says because i usually like the films that all the \"Critics\" usually hate, so i wanted to see this \"disaster\" for myself!!!In The Name Of The King: A Dungeon Siege Tale is a fun & fairly Epic action-packed fantasy adventure & i enjoyed it!!!Now when i started watching this i thought how weird the casting choices were of Burt Reynolds & Ray Liotta & Mathew Lillard but as the film went on these bizarre choices actually all fell into place perfectly!!!Hollywood Legend BURT REYNOLDS (R. I. P) actually suits being the old king & the manic MATHEW LILLARD was a great choice as the slimy, mental & cunning traitor as the Kings Nephew that is in cahoots with the evil magician played by a hammy RAY LIOTTA who is wanting to take over the kingdom & the land by gathering an army of monster warriors named \"The Krug\" (yes similar to Orcs) & those three strange casting choices actually worked out so well.Now our hero of this epic tale is action legend JASON STATHAM as a peaceful family-man named \"Farmer\" who is a farmer & lives a quiet life with his beautiful wife (Claire Forlani) & their young son & STATHAM plays the type of scowling & hard fighter character he always plays & that's absolutely fine because we expect that & he delivers his kick-ass action in spades & we get one of my all time favourite actors ever as his best buddy \"Norick\" played by the great RON PERLMAN, this guy is in his comfort zone here in these period pieces of fantasy & action & has done many of these pictures such as \"Season of the Witch\" & \"Outlander\" & \"Conan\" & \"In the Name of the Rose\" & \"The Scorpion King 3\" among others, Ron Perlman is great as the kind-hearted but strong warrior Friend & gives another classy & likeable performance & a good character who gets plenty of great fight scenes.Also another really good performance comes from the underrated LEELEE SOBIESKI (Road Kill) who is a warrior with powers & the daughter of the kings wizard friend played by JOHN RHYS-DAVIES, another very good performance by a guy who is really into his role & a great character. The cast is actually great.Great points:\nThis film will obviously be compared to \"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy\" & yes there's similarities as both are about the same type of stuff but i would pick \"Dungeon Siege\" over any \"Lord of the rings\" film as i enjoyed this B-movie fun fantasy way more & it's not as long & overdone as those films & i like this cast better, i mean Statham & Perlman together, Great.The production levels are also actually Awesome most of the time except for some poor c.g.i times but it's mostly nice set pieces & real locations where all the action takes place.The battle sequences are fantastic & the fighting is exciting, fast & kickass especially from Statham.Mathew Lillard is over-the-top manic but it's suited to his annoying & horrible character that you so want to die.Ron Perlman steals every scene he's in.The \"Krug\" have a fun B-movie vibe to them & how they look, proper late-night B-movie fodder monsters.The look & cinematography is often beautiful especially the scenes with the Forest warriors that come down from the vines in the trees.Some Bad Bits:\nThe music score tries to be too Epic & emotional & weighty & dramatic for a fun B-movie adventure flick.Some of the c.g.i is cheap looking & some scenes look very artificial.The film takes itself abit too seriously.The opening scenes with Statham & his family is way over sweet & comes off ridiculously cheesy & feels like some Hallmark advert or something.It is probably abit too long for a simple fun B-movie adventure film but it wasn't boring i gotta admit, it was entertaining.I think I've given an honest review here & from not a Hater of the director or anything, i watched it for Statham & Perlman & it was a fun & action-packed fantasy adventure exactly like i expected it to be & i enjoyed it & would watch it again!!!Pretty decent in my opinion.",

            "content": "Recap: Seemingly without cause the wild krug beasts suddenly organize and arm themselves and start attacking the towns and farms of Ehb. Soon most of the country is set aflame. Behind it all is an evil magus and Duke Fallow, who wants the throne. In the midst of it all is Farmer. A simple farmer whose kid was killed in an attack and now his wife is missing. And her fate is tied together with the fate of the kingdom.Comments: This is thin, at best. The story is sketchy and thinner than crust, some cuts jumps in place and time and adds to the confusion. Also the characters, as the story, are thin. There is no depth, no history, no real motivation for anything. And with no depth or character to build upon, the acting is poor.And it is a shame, because the cast is actually quite good. Jason Statham has proved himself solid in action movies and manages the action well here. Rhys-Davies and Perlman is good veterans, as is Forlani. Loken seem to appear in many of Boll's movies, but is given very little screen time, which is a shame because she handles these types of movies well. And then there is Burt Reynolds, Matthew Lillard and Ray Liotta. It's a big cast, full of actors and actresses that have shown to do well before. But their characters are so thin, so sketchy, so devoid of any complex feelings they have little to work with.What saves it for me, and by saves it I means I give it an average rating, is the genre. I really like fantasy movies. Swordplay and magic, and there is a lot of it. Nothing spectacular, though some cgi effects are quite nice, but enough to make up for some of the basics that is lacking.It is unfortunate that this type of movies doesn't get better material and effort to work with, and I sincerely hope that Boll doesn't own the rights to the brand. Hopefully someone else can make a better effort.5/10",

And, indeed, the movie kicks of with this memorable dialogue between two lovers laying in bed:She: I knew you'd come.He: I told you I would.Next, about the greatest cast of all times storms the silver screen. It's so great that Robert de Niro couldn't even get the role of 3.rd dungeon toilet cleaner's junior assistant despite sleeping with the director's mother. Those that made it include Burt Reynolds, Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, Ron Perlman ... those are my favourite four actors right there! What are they doing in this, to quote Bill Hicks, POS film? One marvels at the incredible cast, the cinematography, the scenery, the SFX, the action choreography and the stunts ... and trips over the nonexistent dialogue, the self-explanatory plot and the hammy one-take acting. And the blatant visual ripoffs from Lord Of The Rings and The Matrix. I don't think the actors had any lines, I think they were improvising. It must have been like: \"Jason! You have just caught Norick rogering your wife, and a bunch of wolf-beings attack, and Leelee Sobieski's got a dizzy spell. And, action!\"Uwe Boll is basically a producer who also directs. I'm sure he's a unique kind of guy, somebody who feverishly loves movies, like Quentin Tarantino's evil twin. If he learns to handle dialogues better I'm sure that he'll make a great movie eventually. For now, Name Of The Kign is probably the greatest \"schlocker\" ever filmed.",

How can you hate a movie that has Forest Lesbians swinging from vines, Forest Ninjas running up trees, the Krug (who were obviously played by extras from Planet of the Apes), Ray Liotta who simply makes a movie better by appearing in it, and to top it off Burt Reynolds as the king of this truly magical land.I'll never be able to forget some of the many memorable scenes in this movie. Like the touching scene when the cross-eyed guy received the sword from his father, or how he hit on the girl that was chained up next to him in the caves, despite there they\u2019re very dire situation. I'm still recovering from the shock I felt when I found out that Jason Statham was the king\u2019s sons, honestly who saw that one coming. I nearly cried, as Burt on his death bed gave an incredibly heartfelt, informative and lucid speech to his son only be shown dead as the camera returns his darkly tanned and well groomed face.Besides the characters and deeply intriguing plot the soundtrack and special effects were top notch. This movie was clearly made a crack team of professionals and I for one, am glad that they were able to produce this timeless classic that will be enjoyed year after year.",

Did I mention that SHAGGY was one of the bad guys? And what is with the ninjas and the acrobats with cleavage on ropes? There there was the Jolie look alike. The choreography for the fight scenes was pretty entertaining. Seriously, I loved the pointed feet on the flying leaf vixens and the ninjas, well that was just cute. This was a cross between Lord of the Rings, Die Hard, Jackie Chan and Dude, Where's my car. But I don't think that the director intended this to be a comedy.

As for the character selection, I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. Jason Statham is the best choice, the producers could have done. He plays his role, like he is born to Farmer! Also to have chosen Burt Reynolds as the king was a very good choice. He plays his role lovable. The only distracting thing was Ray Liotta, who plays his role very awful and the costumes of the kurg, which had something missing over it.I, as a very big Dungeon Siege fan, must say that the movie totally lived up to my hopes. Many elements are similar to the original Dungeon Siege world, but sadly there are also some mad differences. But if you know that in forehand (and you should, because it's a typical Hollywood movie), you will enjoy an entertaining time. I can't agree with other reviewers that the movie takes all too long to watch. For me the movie was over like in an instant, so exiting was it! This movie is definitely on my \"one day, I will watch this movie again, because it's so great\"-list.Now I'm very much hoping Uwe Boll will produce Dungeon Siege 2 and places the storyline exactly on the Dungeon Siege 2 computer game - that would be my movie wish of the year!",

I can't understand how Uwe Boll persuades such famous actors in his movies or how those actors dare to be in a project with Uwe Boll.

The production values are high considering the moderate budget, the make up and effects are well done, the writing is decent and the action sequences are well choreographed. Admittedly it falls short of the lord of the rings (saying that, keep in mind, very few fantasy films could compete with LOTR, and this film didn't have the same budget and perhaps more importantly didn't have J.R.Tolken as a writer) but it certainly does its best, and at times even comes close! Personally i would happily rate this up there with classics like willow and dragonheart, and it is by far superior to the dungeons and dragons films which have been offered up. Frankly its sad this film hasn't achieved the cult status it deserves. well worth the watch if you're looking for an action fantasy film!",

No character development at all. No exposition or explanation of any key plot point. The dialog is forced and hackneyed. The performances of virtually every cast member are disjointed and senseless. There is not a single time in the film when a character reacts to anything in a way that makes any sense at all. I personally saw hints of what might have been a few decent performances,(namely by Ron Perlman and Leelee Sobieski) but there is no way to know because if there was originally any good in there it was edited out.My recommendation, do not see this movie. I do have a few questions though. How does Uwe Boll keep getting work? And why do seemingly decent actors keep agreeing to work with him?

            "review_title": "A tedious, dull and cheap-looking knockoff of Lord of the Rings",
            "content": "The fantasy genre certainly has its ups and downs. On the one hand, we've got epic, multi-award winning sagas like the \"Lord of the Rings\". In the other we've also got a good amount of laughably bad, shoddily made ones like \"Dungeons & Dragons\". Earning itself a likely permanent spot among the worst of is \"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\". It's a film that is not only poorly acted, written and made, but it's also tedious and excruciating to watch. The story follows a man creatively named Farmer (Jason Statham) whose son is killed by an army of orcs I mean Krugs. His wife is captured so off he goes to rescue her from the creatures and their foul overlord, the evil wizard Gallian (Ray Liotta?! Say it isn't so!). He gets some assistance from an old friend Norrick (Ron Perlman? Seriously?). We learn that Gallian is planning on raising an army to overthrow the king of the land (Burt Reynolds) with the help of the king's sniveling, slimy nephew, Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard). Time for some sword battles, epic battles in the rain, wizardry, some Ringwraith knock-offs and some silly political backstabbing. Take it away Uwe Boll! I'm not going to say that this movie rips off the Lord of the Rings, but there are some elements that are surprisingly similar. We've got the dueling wizards, with John Rhys-Davies (who played Gimli in the Peter Jackson films) playing the good counterpart to Gallian, we've got the armies of orcs, the elf-like forest creatures, the shadowy horse riders that Gallian uses to command his armies and a couple of scenes here and there. I'm not saying that this is a terrible movie because of these though, I'm saying the movie's so bad even if it was the first fantasy film you ever saw it you would have a hard time sitting through it.First of all, what kind of protagonist are we given? A guy named \"Farmer\". Apparently he calls himself that because he believes that a man is whatever he does. Does that mean that if he becomes the mayor of the town he'll change his name to \"Mayor Mayor\"? Jason Statham has had his share of bad movies but he's never been more wooden or less charismatic than here. Even when he's throwing boomerangs or inexplicably doing karate kicks, you'll wish the film was following someone else. Singling out Statham isn't quite fair though because pretty much everyone here comes off as an amateur. Matthew Lillard plays his character way over the top. It's a wonder the guy hasn't been thrown in a dungeon under suspicion of every single unsolved murder in the city. Ray Liotta looks absolutely bored in every scene he's in, but might just be trying to turn invisible so no one notices him. Overall, everyone is trying to get through the cringe-worthy dialog as best they can but few escape unharmed. I'd give some examples, but the film's lack of subtitles (an inexcusable sin considering this DVD was released in 2008) makes it hard to quote.I was actually taken aback by how shoddy the action sequences were. Every scene where farmer goes around kicking looks very staged and are not the least bit exciting. Late into the film they explain why our titular character is able to kick so much ass, but until then these Krugs come off as real chumps. A significant amount of them fall down after being kicked in the chest and then never get up and come on, they can't take down an old guy armed with a pickax? Story-wise, it comes off as pretty laughable often. I know it's for dramatic effect, but I'd like to imagine that the reason there happened to be a wedding going on when the Krugs first attack is that they're just jerks and wanted to ruin this perfect day by setting the town on fire and killing everyone in sight. Even the special effects aren't very good. Whenever Farmer throws his boomerang, it's an obvious computer generated effect and several of the environments looks downright cheap. I'm not talking about the sets, which are decent enough. I'm talking about the wide shots with castles and such.To the film's credit the Krugs and done with practical costumes and while their armor and weapons look cheap, at least they don't clash with the hapless villagers they're slaughtering. The elves (or whatever they are called, to my knowledge they were never named in the movie) are played by talented acrobats that do their own stunts. Hurray for faint praise! The fact that I had to re-watch part of the film to jog my memory brings me to the film's biggest flaw: it's too long and it's boring. This beast runs at slightly over two hours and there's just nothing here that will capture your interest. The characters barely have any personalities, the legions of opponents aren't menacing and their masters are one-dimensional. The battles are edited frenetically, meaning you're going to have a hard time figuring out who is winning and which character is dying when things get rough. It's really difficult to explain why the film is boring, but I can easily see people turning this one off before finishing it. It's Uwe Boll's shoddy direction that sinks what could have been at the very least a film that's so-bad-it's-good into an absolute bore to sit through.Not even a reasonably big budget could save the curse of Uwe Boll. \"In the Name of the King\" proves itself to be a film that is utterly devoid of any fun moments, aside from a few action scenes where you can laugh at them ironically. It's absolutely terrible and I beg of you to stay away from it. (Theatrical version on DVD, January 24, 2014)",

I would take this film over a bushel of films like the English Patient or Shakespeare in Love or Out of Africa or Gosford Park, yada-yada-yada. Snobby, desiccated films about boring people living futile, boring, wasted lives centered around their own bloated egos. SNORE! I would much rather see a film like this than have George Lucas defecate another of his Star Wars turds on us, or see another Twilight saga sequel vomited at us.

Uwe Boll's clone of LOTR is total rip off from other movies and it's totally predictable and unwatchable. Stupid dialogue, poor script, acting of all stars in this movie is forgettable. I can't understand why and for whom this movie has been made? For DVD rental store? It's a real shame that such nice actors like Statham,Ray Lliota and Ron Perlman took their parts in this garbage. Maybe they did not write the script beforehand? Or they are ready to star in any movie for money. PLS SKIP THIS MOVIE OUT, DO NOT REPEAT MY MISTAKE!!! I never saw any Boll's movies before and I guess that in case I'll find his name in the credits to the movie,then it'll be a sign for me to miss it. And what about Burt Reynolds also? How he can to act in such film, I can't understand it either. So this flick is another one stinker to be totally forgotten...BE AWARE AND ACHTUNG!!!",

No, no it wasn't. The dialogue was clunky, the storyline random, the music even worse, the film itself 2 hours too long, it has no redeeming features!First off when \"Farmer\" first meets the nasty Krug, he uses a boomerang to knock them down! The little kid in Mad Max 2 had a boomerang and threw it with more venom than Jason Statham did! Ron Perlman giving the kid a pig, why? A whole line from the King talking about seaweed? Maybe I just drifted out but it was definitely there. The whole scene where Jason Statham is proclaimed King, yet they still refer to him as \"Farmer\", maybe even King Farmer? (Surely he has a proper name, though I doubt that cos his wife even calls him \"Farmer\", gotta love those writers), the Ninja bells, purpose of these were? And could someone explain to me why the Krug decide to lob themselves on fire from their catapults and not use rocks instead? So, what we've learnt, 1. If you find this movie, anywhere, try your best to burn it, smash it, snap it, anything to prevent others seeing this or buying it and encouraging Mr Boll further. 2.Uwe Boll should be banned from owning a camera or coming up with ideas unless under strict supervision from a responsible adult. 3. Avoid this like you would every nasty disease ever known to man, even if you like S&M you will not enjoy this movie.",

            "content": "I love all things epic and/or fantastical. Sometimes, they can be a little too childish IE Willow of Narnia, but In The Name Of The King is just pure escapist fantasy. The cast is just incredible Ron Perlman and Leelee Sobieski being particular highlights, but Matt Lillard's spoilt prince is flawlessly performed, and Jason Statham is quickly becoming one of the best action stars out there.Sure it's campy, sure it has a lovable B-movie chic about it, sure the script is clich\u00e9 laden, this isn't and never set out to be a cinematic masterpiece like Gladiator, this is a breathless, 100 mile an hour romp where good takes on evil and triumphs.The film is WAY ahead of it's time in terms of it's dealing with issues such as race and gender. I mean what other film has black men in it, who are just men who happen to have black skin? Not ONE reference is made to their skin colour, and neither do they reference it. White, black, they are just MEN. No lame \"white men can't jump\" \"humour\" on which the Wayans seem to be basing their careers on after exhausting their limited repertoire of self-contradictory humour, no anti-racism \"Ah ain't fightin' alongsahd no negros\" subplot where a racist suddenly accepts his black brethren before the climactic battle, just MEN being MEN. Finally.For the pennies they had to make this, it's a damn well-made film, I can remember straight to video movies used to be \"those films where the helicopter doesn't crash\", but now, whoa, thousands of men chopping each other to bits in a forest, impressive though never intrusive CGI, great costumes, the cinematography is beautiful, I could go on all night.To those who have attacked the villain henchmen of the film, the \"Krug\", they are great! Sure, the masks are set pieces that I'm sure if they were featured in close-ups would look as fake as they are, but Boll knows his craft, and shows them only fleetingly and with enough distance to make them believable.While definitely fantasy, I am glad this film sits more towards the realistic side of things, almost to the point where it could be considered historical fiction, were it not for the modest amount of magic that kept the film within the boundaries of fantasy. Also, much kudos for not including Elves or Dwarfs, whose presence I usually find irritating. \"Oh, so this race is tall, noble, and lives indefinitely, and this race are 3 foot tall, dour and very good at digging? Good good, so only the human race has a variety of professions it is capable of and greatly variable personalities?\" Elves are stuck up, aloof snobs impossible to relate to, and dwarfs are just patronising caricatures of the Scottish.Back to my main point, ITNOTK is awesome, one which shall be watched again and again, and sits with my DVDs with pride.",

I found this film to be enjoyable, OK not Oscar material but this film was entertaining none the less. The characters were good, and completely in line with the Game. The whole film felt like Dungeon Siege. I have played the game and completed it, and I can say that Uwe has captured that feel in the movie. The cinematography is very good, especially where Merricks daughter is riding away from the Duke. This film also has a kicking soundtrack, some great actors, and its a lot of fun to watch. The only bad thing about the film is Matthew Lillard, he hammed up his role the way only he can, he should be shot! If you want an entertaining film that will delight the family this is it, if your after a multiple Oscar winning film (The voting was rigged!) then watch LOTR.

Strangely some well known and quite decent actors (notably John Rhys-Davies and Jason Statham) was lured into this project - and their performances are pretty much all the quality this film has to offer.Scripting and directing is, at best - on par with an episode of Xena The Warrior Princess. The editing is even worse, with strangely cut pauses in dialog and music breaks that clearly does not fit in. Special effects are clear-as-day CGI, but that is to be expected from a low budget flick. Also on the technical side I couldn't help to notice that some scene were notably blurry, with poor colors and also strange blurry panning - almost as the direct view recording (or whatever it's called) was used instead of the main camera at some points.To sum things up, if you decide to watch this despite all the warnings - make sure to have a couple of drinks handy.

            "review_title": "Pretty bad on almost every level",
            "content": "I am basing this review on the theatrical cut of In the Name of the King, not the Director's Cut which i have not seen. As a reference I am using Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy as firstly, I believe all three films to be fantastic and secondly as Boll is clearly trying to copy Jackson's success and fails miserably.So let's begin:Acting/Casting: The casting of his films is probably the one thing Uwe Boll can be praised for as he often has very well known and talented actors on screen. This is also the case here, however most of the cast (Ron Perlman, Jason Stratham, John Rys-Davis) are clearly not very interested in their roles. To be fair, there are good performances: Claire Forlani is the sole highlight of the film (the scene in which she learns her son has died is actually very well done) and does well despite her character being pretty one-dimensional. Ray Liotta and Matthew Lillard are both so ridiculously over-the-top its impossible not to smile when they're on screen. Yes these characters are stupid, underdeveloped and uninteresting but this is not the actors fault and they do their best with the awful screenplay. In their scenes it is almost as if Boll is making a parody of fantasy films yet in the next scene we realize we are meant to be taking this seriously.Effects/Costume: In the fantasy genre it is important to create a world for the audience to be immersed in, e.g. Middle Earth in LotR. In Jackson's trilogy we had a sense of the different cultures and their environments and here we get a generic world called Eb and generic monsters (Krug). The effects are standard yet clearly not as well developed as in LotR. For example we never see the Kurg up close for longer than a second and the structures (the castles of the king and of the villain) are shown briefly and again always at a distance, resulting in the audience feeling underwhelmed. I'm aware that Boll was working on a smaller budget, however it was still pretty high (60 million dollars) and i feel more could have been done here.Editing: This is one of the bigger flaws of the film and can be seen best in the opening 15 minutes. There are many scenes here: Farmer working at his farm and feeling uneasy about an approaching danger. His wife Solana at the market. Farmer fighting at his farm and then with Norrick. Solana at her brother's house.These scenes are all inter cut and Boll cannot stay with one scene for more than a few seconds and in doing so cannot build any tension. This is made worse by the fact that we have a fight scene (Farmer and Norrick) followed by a scene in which the dialog is essentially exposition. Granted, Jackson also does this (e.g. cutting from the battle of Helms Deep to Merry and Pippen in Fangorn Forest), however the characters there had already been established and in the scenes with Merry and Pippen there is more happening than just exposition.Action: In a film with a fairly large budget but a horrible script, at least the action scenes should be engaging. Sadly, this is not the case. Either the battles are shot like a modern day action movie (imagine Transporter with swords and shields) which seems out of place or are on a grander scope yet still nothing to write home about and remain less involving than the smallest battle in LotR. There is also the fundamental problem that the battles have no \"structure\" so to speak. For example: The battle of Helms Depp in TT had a beginning, a moment where all seemed lost and finally victory for the heroes. Here all we get is 10 minutes of fighting ending with victory. There is never any build up so there is no tension, there seems to be nothing at stake so we don't really care.Screenplay: It's horrible. Simply horrible. Even without some unintentionally funny lines it would still be bad. Apart from the shallow characters and plot holes, it just tries too hard to be poetic and meaningful yet ends up sounding like someone trying desperately to sound eloquent. And the ending pretty much sums it up: After Gillian's death the movie stops about 30 seconds later. What is the point? I know a lot people complained about the ending of RotK yet there was a purpose to it. Here it is so abrupt it's as if the filmmakers just stopped caring and wanted to end it as fast as possible. Another example: At one point one of the heroes loses a person very close to her and her reaction is to look blankly at his body before turning around leaving him lying on the ground. WHY? Why should we invest anything in a character who so obviously doesn't care about the people most dear to her?Originality: Now here is why i wanted to use LotR as a reference. Let's go through the story and find the similarities:Both start in the countryside with fields/crops and the music is also similar. Krug are obviously cheap Orcs. A wise wizard helping the hero on his quest. A villain in a tower/castle with the ability to see over the land (Sauron with his eye, Gillian with magic) The villain producing Krugs/Orcs in an underground \"factory\" (these scenes are so clearly ripping of LotR's Saruman it's almost pitiful) A race of creatures with a connection to nature. A small force entering the villains lair as a large army would fail. A hero starts as a loner and becomes king.Need i say more?So to finish: 2/10 for the average performance by Forlani and the entertaining performances by Liotta and Lillard.",

Lillard's simply a comedy guy... and not a very good one! Reynolds was perhaps the single best cast role in the film, was very \"Kingly\" despite some scripting problems. Finally, all I can think of when I see Pearlman anymore is.. Hellboy!That all being said. Was it a 10? Definitely not. Is it worth a rent?

I can only assume it was lack of direction, as most of the big actors in this film have turned out some stellar work. I've seen a lot worse come out of film-city recently. Stop comparing it to LOTR and enjoy it for what it is, an action movie based on a video game.5.6 out of 10 (Had to round it up on the rating system here)Casting: 4 - Simply too many actors, from too many different backgroundsActing: 5 - Could have been worse, could have been betterCinematography: 7 - Great scenery, brought down by bad direction.Plot: 5 - I give credit for not remaking another film, but it simply has an overly \"written\" script.Costume Design: 7 - The \"Krug\" were pretty bad, but everything else brings this score up a lot.",

What a waste...Anyway, the movie is objectively crap. It's like it's trying to be crappy as opposed to actually striving to be a good epic movie.Also I have to comment on the cast. Jason Statham as an epic hero? Um...I don't think that works. Stick to your gritty crime action flicks, buddy. You've been type-casted. John Rys-Davis was pretty good though. He's like the only casting guy they got right for this movie. Burt Reynolds as a king? The guy who played freaking Shaggy as an evil duke? Please make good casting choices next time... Actually no. Don't let there be a next time.Also the Krug or Kwum or Krap, whatever they're called were kind of bland... Just like this movie.Maybe Blind Guardian should have played through out the whole thing, that would have made it worth it... Also it would mask the poor dialogue...",

Some of the CGI was OK, but the costumes and makeup for the animal-warriors looked like you could get at a Halloween store. After 10 minutes of my ears hurting from the horrible script and my eyes hurting from the costumes and two cheesy fight scenes, I turned off the movie. I will be asking Blockbuster for a refund.",

He is my favorite actor, and I try to see everything he is in.Going in to this movie, I did not realize the king of horrible movies based on video games, Uwe Boll, was behind this. I guess I should have known better, but I didn't. Regardless, when I was watching the previews before the movie, and I saw the trailer for his upcoming debacle known as \"Postal\", I knew I was doomed.Uwe Boll is a horrible, horrible person. Why he intentionally punishes the movie-going audience with garbage like this is beyond me.I recall reading in \"X-Box Magazine\" a quote from an interview he did. Boll basically went on about how he was angering everyone in the video game community, and how he would continue to make horrible movies just to show people that their opinions don't matter to him, including a 3-picture deal that included \"Postal\".Why? Why would you intentionally want to aggravate so many people, especially when it costs money to make these horrible films, and you end up losing money when so few people see them? Even with these movies for sale on DVD, I can guarantee they're not selling. I have seen copies of \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"House of the Dead\" in $5.00 dump bins at Wal-Mart, and even then, they don't sell.People are calling Uwe Boll the \"Modern Day Ed Wood\", and while that is fitting, I'd almost say it's actually an insult to Ed Wood. Yes, Wood made horrible films, but I don't think he was such an arrogant jerk about it.I mean, making movies just to tick people off. What kind of issues can a guy have to do that?",

Everything was simply predictable and so much didn't fit here or there. Let's start from the beginning, shall we? In the first few minutes of the movie, it wasn't that bad. Despite the lack of motivation from the actors/actresses to actually act, I was somewhat surprised by the \"fun\" feeling I get from bad movies. However, that soon changed when the first battle with the LOTR orc-lookalikes attacked and started to raise hell. It was like watching an episode right out of Hercules: The Legendary Journey, except there was no Kevin Sorbo. Everything from that point on was below average and just dull. The acting, the fighting, the music was way out of place and overused at some times, and the editing was TERRIBLE. I tried watching it as much as I could, but about half-way through began speeding it up every few minutes to see what happen next. In the end, it was just another bad movie.Now, moving away from the cons about this movie, there are some pros I did like about it. Some of the special effects were actually pretty cool and some of the fighting wasn't that bad with Jason doing his usual kick-kick-strike-kick-kick-strike combo like in Transporter. These are the only reasons I'm not giving it a 1 because Jason is an awesome guy who simply got screwed into making this movie. Not just him either, but every actor/actress in this movie was at some point somebody I loved, yet was TERRIBLY miscast. I sympathize with their situation and hope this doesn't hurt their careers in the long run, besides the has-beens.Overall, this is just another bad Boll movie. It doesn't even come close to being average and looks like a LOTR rip-off rather than some video game adaptation. I no longer have the slightest hope that Uwe will actually do something good in his future. STOP GIVING HIM LICENSES TO MAKE THESE MOVIES!",

I love watching Jason do his martial arts, I'm a big Jason & martial arts fan. But even I got fed up with the badly shot and directed scenes. Not even a bloke like Jason can salvage the level of crap.Why the heck they chose to take this amateur-style route is beyond me. They could've pulled it off, I mean, look at LoTR and The Hobbit, and the story itself is viable. This genre can be insanely popular, but then it has to be done right.All in all... even if you're a Jason Statham and martial arts fan like me, forego this one.

After seeing how bad it was, I was relieved to find out it was one of his.I should stipulate that I'm not a fan of Jason Statham movies. Guy Ritchie kicked off his career with two fantastic films; Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch. After that, someone made the mistake of letting him decide his own fate, and he's pumped out a trash load of crappy action films that are meant to stroke his balding ego.That said, I was bored on a weekday, and this film came on, so I went ahead and watched it. And, as most Uwe Boll films do, it did not disappoint to disappoint. It's flat out horrid. It's so bad, you think it could finally bury the devastatingly bad acting career of Statham. Unfortunately, that's not the case, as he's managed to churn out some of his worst films since; Death Race and Transporter 3.The point is, if you're look for the Bizarro world version of a Kubrick/Scorsese-esquire directing career, Uwe Boll is your man. He has made multiple video game-based movies, for f'ing sake! Only a director bent on a career of the most disappointing movies man has ever seen could use as his visionary light a 1990's video game. Bravo, sir, I could drunkenly drool out a better premise.Uwe Boll, if you're reading this, please do something else with your life. Like postal work. Or landscaping.

            "content": "I must be a glutton for punishment, but I decided to see this movie because with the trailer, it looked like it might have some potential. I have seen only two previous Uwe Bowe films and they were horrible.... I didn't have any high expectations, but I was just hoping this one would be different. Never again.If I were to repeat what a previous reviewer mentioned ... how does he get such fantastic actors to do his movies? Don't these actors know that his movies are terrible? This definitely proves the fact that a good director is ESSENTIAL to a good movie. And that even great actors cannot shine when there is a horrible direction ...I see a lot of posts where people just say that a movie was awful and that Bowe is an horrible director, but don't explain why....I'm not a professional director or anything, but I just want to know if Bowe understands that shooting a scene requires perhaps ... a point, and like, maybe something to be accomplished. This can't be done when the each scene is about 30 seconds long. And just ENDS abruptly - like with a question that doesn't get answered. Slow things down a bit\u0085. And maybe EXPLAIN some things.Even with the completely ridiculous dialogue in this movie, character development is very important in a plot - and when an audience is just taken on a whirlwind of different shots that don't linger long enough to fulfill any depth, then we are left with a very confusing and flat storyline. Seriously, is this a movie \u0085 or a music video??? There are more cuts in this movie than an international hair show. Obviously Bowe is very sloppy, lazy and doesn't spend the time to make any storyboards\u0085 I'm sure if he did Greenpeace would be on his ass, cause that'd be a waste of a LOT of paper ....Scenes are also cut in between each other quite frequently. At which it makes things utterly bewildering and a complete mess. Especially when you are inter-cutting a quiet dinner scene with a fight scene. Some really good directors can do it \u0096 but there has to be a connection between the scenes. Otherwise it is just idiotic. Remember the scene in ***Spoiler for LOTR: Return of the King*** when Pippin is singing to Denethor and they cut between his song and the battle. That is the sign of a good director. It was done with a reason and is incredibly powerful to the film. I know it ludicrous to compare the two, but just to make my point that there must be some purpose for inter-cutting scenes.In addition, EVERYTHING is scored. Music adds a lot to film, but it is not necessary at every possible second in the movie. A good director is able to incorporate the score and with it, add emotion to a scene without the audience even noticing it. The score in this movie was so overdrawn that it was annoying... in fact it helped to incorporate an deadly element of cheesy melodrama....It's quite obvious that Bowe is attempting to shadow the Lord of the Rings trilogy as he quite blatantly steals many components of the films. However, comparing him to Peter Jackson... well ...I can't even write both their names in the same sentence.This movie had tremendous potential. But adding Bowe into it is like dropping some fish sauce into your Lemon Meringue Pie.Don't waste money on this movie. I couldn't even finish it. It's terrible.

            "content": "Okay, first off, I wanted to say that I just registered for this site mainly for the sake of leaving a comment for this movie. I wanted to watch this movie without much expectations, except to see Jason Statham kick some serious ass like most of his other films. I asked a friend of mine, who have seen the movie first, if the movie was any good and his reply was that it is \"watchable,\" which deterred me not to jump and go watch it right away. I did not know about any of the negative reviews that it received nor that it was directed by Uwe Boll 'til after the film. If his name was shown in the opening scene, I, unfortunately, must've missed it (would've save me all the confusion of why is this movie so bad).When watching the movie, I was amazed that there were so many great actors in this, even though some are out right mis-casted. As it went on, it made me wonder why are the dialogs so cheesy and predictable (seriously, I was saying the lines before the actors did). The story did not keep me in-tune with the movie at all. There were just too many scenes where you're supposed to sympathize with the character, but instead it made you flinch with laughter at how badly it was executed, like when the mother finds out that her parents and son were killed. You simply don't connect with the characters at all. I figured that the action and special effects will redeem the bad writing and bad editing. But I was wrong. The camera shots were horrible, it made all the fight scenes feel so mundane and clich\u00e9 that it made me bored. If these same fight scenes were done with better camera shots, it would've made a bigger difference. All the costumes were terrible; the Krogs reminded me of monsters that I've seen in those Power Ranger shows, they're not menacing at all; the knights' armors that are meant to be metal, looked like hard plastic; Ray Liotta's mage (or whatever he is supposed to be) costume made him look like he is not from that era, it didn't fit the movie. Its as if he was busy making another movie and they pulled him in to make this one and just let him wear that same outfit. There was a scene where one of his outfits looked like something that Sigfried and Roy would have in their closet. The sound effects didn't do the sword fighting any justice either, it was like they used the same sword clashes and tweaked it a little here and there, plainly awful. I think that they made this movie with a very small budget. Or maybe they spent a good chunk of the budget in signing on the actors. I didn't even realize that this movie was based off a video game which might have explained the bad plot. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big gamer and I like movies, but games to movies adaptations have let me down many times. I would have to say though, the only good thing that this movie had were some of the special effects. Though they were cool, but it's nothing that we all haven't seen before. Oh, and the other cool thing was a prop, the boomerang. I can't remember the last time, I've seen a boomerang in a movie that made using it look cool.My verdict: the movie had a lot of potentials, but very weak executions.I kind of feel sorry for the director, Uwe Boll, (that's why I gave this movie a 4 and not a 3) after all, he is generally a nice guy who is misunderstood, but so many people out there hate him and all his movies (I'm still one of them), But for some reason I keep watching his movies I keep giving it a chance, hoping that this one will be THE movie that will change his reputation, but then again I rather not gamble on it and waste my time and money. And what I truly don't get is where does he get the money to make all of these movies? Is it from the videogames studios, if so, don't they know that he WILL kill the series with his movies?",

It's a one thing lead to another, with a variety of characters, and a medieval setting.There are a lot of emotions that are visualized, that I really liked. The interaction, the banter inbetween the characters. The acting is very good. The story is simple, a one thing lead to another structure, built set by set, and such progresses throughout. It's a lot like a theatre play, but without it's limitations.The fighting scenes are also pretty good, there is plenty of action. The actors are doing a very good job, they are obviously veterans. The characters and their interactions are done well. The settings and decorations are very good, rougher, more like how old movies used to be.Overall, I really liked the movie.",

A somewhat unoriginal script perhaps but that's not the problem with this movie. The problem is that the script has awful lines and dumb twists. Combine that with Uwe Bolls non-existent ability to direct and you got yourself a new Lord Of The Rings for morons.I can't understand how actors like Burt Reynolds, Jason Statham, Claire Forlani and Ray Liotta could accept to be in this piece of crap.

Hardly old English verbiage with an American accent.One of the worst films i've ever seen. BTW: During the same fight seen, you see the star actor, a fierce fighter, sprint at full steam into a horse (face first) and fall down.

The krugs looked a bit much like cheap orcs, but there you go. I guess the director didn't have the budget Peter Jackson had for LOTR. Favourite bit was the fight in the woods. Dungeon Siege succeeds in action and characters, plus variety of the very good looking sets. Just don't expect shakespearan dialogues.I'm a major Jason Statham fan and while Chaos and Revolver pretty much sucked lately, this fantasy piece is him in best form again.

Did they really skimp on the budget that much?During the battle scenes there are moments where the music just... stops... while action is still going on in real time behind two characters saying lines that seem to further the story no more and certainly add nothing to the dramatic tension. It's like the movie just drops to the floor and shatters any momentum that might have been building up. This is just poor judgment on the part of the director in my opinion.Burt ReynoldsCirque de Sole in the trees Rubber suit monsters straight out of Power Rangers. I remember being especially amazed that a group of these monster bad guys standing around a catapult seem to be just waving their arms arbitrarily. Why? There were no enemies in sight. I mean, these bad guys are implied to have enough intelligence to operate a catapult but some how just can't keep their own limbs from wandering through the air without purpose. Inversely, how are monsters stupid enough to light themselves on fire and climb into a catapult to be launched at the enemy even able to operate a machine like a catapult? This movie is retarded.",

This makes it a bad movie, but not a BAD movie on the scale of Boll's previous disasters (Bloodrayne, Alone in the Dark) and therefore much less entertaining. Maybe he's learning? My point is: for people seeking another \"so bad it's good\" classic, I recommend you look elsewhere.The problem with Dungeon Siege is that the story and the acting are both fine(ish); it's the directing and editing that kill the movie. This makes it more irritating than funny, and aside from a few spots of ludicrous dialog (I dare you to make sense of Reynold's final speech!) it's more hum-drum than fun.Others have enumerated the films worst points already (Liotta!), so I won't repeat them. However I have to say: the hate for Matthew Lillard confuses me. He single-handedly made all of his scenes watchable. If every actor had been as entertaining as he was, this would have been a much, much better movie.Long story short: not bad enough to be funny, not good enough to be good, so don't bother.",

Director Uwe Boll threw in everything from numerous bloodless be- headings, Jason Statham's character, \"Farmer\", running across the shoulders of a dozen orc-like adversaries called Krugs, whom also voluntarily set themselves ablaze to be catapulted against The King, Burt Reynold's soldiers. The movie starts off just fine with brief scenes of the leading players in their respective scenarios: Liotta romancing Leelee with some sort of magical special effects going on; John Rhys-Davies (as a Magi and adviser to the King) sagely crying out \"No!\" as if it meant something; Statham, as a family man farming a field with his son when Perlman shows up as a friendly neighbor; Reynolds as the King and Matthew Lillard (doing his best to bring the 20th Century to the \"middle ages time out of place\" that is the setting for the film) as his cowardly / jealous of the throne Nephew. TWO THUMBS UP GO TO THE INTENSE BATTLE SCENES!! My favorite sequences consists of Krugs and fiery catapults, horses rearing up to crush opponents while being ridden by Wraiths controlled by Liotta's magic, gliding magical forest women riding vines like it's Xena meets Tarzan, only hotter chicks, and also the final duel between Statham and Liotta just ABSOLUTELY ROCKS!

The story was decent, although rushed! The actors did a decent job with very little time to develop character depth. I do admit I am glad I didn't go to the theaters to see ItNofK, but it is a good rent. After playing the game, which I enjoy, I was disappointed that there wasn't more to it than what we got. Considering the other VG movies that have been made this is definitely a few steps up, but still along ways from the standard that it could have been with the story and history that the game already has. While I wasn't disappointed and did enjoy the movie I wasn't greatly impressed. Better than some of his other movies, but some nice improvements would be character development and a plot that doesn't move at light speed.",

Talk about being all over the place:There is a Viking funeral, Ninja warriors, Merlinesque English magicians, a touch of Saturday Night Fever and Goodfellas with Ray Liotta,(absolutely hilarious casting here),a Lord of the Rings quest, a borrowed plot line from The 13th Warrior (men dressed up as Orcs),another hilarious idea to cast Burt Reynolds as an ancient king,(I was waiting to see Sally Field as the Queen and it would have been perfect), forest choreography similar to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and a bad imitation of Dennis Hopper by some second-rate actor.Other than that, the film was completely believable.The action sequences and production values were quite good; and fine for a video game.

            "content": "It has been a good long time since I saw a movie as massively, unintentionally cheesy as In the Name of the King. Lured into purchasing it on Blu-Ray as part of a batch offer, I already had my doubts about a film being marketed just on the basis of the lead having been in The Expendables. But seeing Jason Statham's hunky face on the cover made me walk into the trap regardless: I'm just superficial that way. After the purchase, I took better look at the director and saw the name Uwe Boll, in very tiny print. It was then that I knew for sure I'd been had.Uwe Boll is known for his ability to make bad movie adaptations of game franchises, such as Bloodrayne, Alone in the Dark and Far Cry. They are said to be generic and uninteresting at best, hilariously bad at worst. He once famously challenged his unflagging critics to take him on in the ring and settle their score man-to-man, apparently believing he could prove the quality of his work by punching a critic in the face. To be fair, based on his reputation I had always avoided his movies like the plague and had never given him a fair shake. But going by this movie, I should just have taken other people's word for it and spared myself two hours of low-budget mediocrity. The whole project is po-faced, misjudged and wobbly in all aspects from acting and script to special effects. Even the passionless soundtrack conspires to makes things drag.In the Name of the King \u2013 a Dungeon Siege Tale is based on a Role- Playing game I know nothing about and stars Jason Statham as Farmer, whose day-job is evident from his name. He has a son and a wife, but not for long, as soon they are both taken from him by the 'Krug', who look suspiciously like Trolls and were probably renamed to sound less generic. The Krug have a silly semi-gorilla walk with corresponding sounds, unconvincing bodysuits and never let you forget that there must be an actor inside, feeling very bad for himself. There is a magical mastermind pulling the Krug's strings (the ever-evil Ray Liotta) and his plan is to take over the land by getting rid of the king (a strangely tightfaced and overly made up Burt Reynolds), with help from the king's weakling nephew (Matthew Lillard, better known as Shaggy from the Scooby Doo movies). Not to spoil anything, but Farmer stops him. The end.I have left out some other characters like a magus/magician (the elsewhere admirable John Rhys-Davies) and Farmer's daddy substitute (the elsewhere fantastic Ron Perlman), but then none of them is especially memorable and they remain firmly 2D, if not 1D. One or two of the minor characters even risk travelling into negative space. It is the script's fault that people don't really say the things that would make the most sense in any given circumstance and that what does come out of their mouth sounds stilted, but since Boll is the producer and director, blame still lands on his plate. Watching the movie, I kept being tempted to reach into my television, yank out the script and do a quick rewrite. I also wanted to rewrite the beginning and get rid of a 'twist' that was probably intended as gritty and shocking, but really is just severely emotionally misjudged. It sets the wrong tone and shows that the makers are in denial about making a goofy fantasy action movie.Even though In the Name of the King is very long and feels like it, somehow it doesn't get around to putting in all the information you need to comprehend what is going on. For instance: there is a baffling group of semi-ninja warriors that just appear in the middle of a battle \u2013 on two occasions \u2013 without set-up or explanation afterwards. If only Boll had tightened up the story, got rid of some unnecessary characters and scenes, cut out about 30-45 minutes and used the extra budget to invest in a dialogue polish and better special effects\u0085 This might have enabled them to make the fight scenes look like more than just a live roleplaying session in the woods. On the other hand, this would probably have meant we would have had to do without the awesomely silly tree-people who swing around on vines and are able to use them to attack people by way of unconvincing computer graphics.It's a mystery how Uwe Boll keeps getting the chance to make more movies. There always seem to be people willing to invest some money in his projects \u2013 as a tax write-off, perhaps \u2013 and some actors willing to spend time hamming it up and chewing the low-budget scenery. I don't understand why all of the at least somewhat known actors I mentioned didn't take one look at the script and at Boll's reputation and ran in the opposite direction. The sounds of agents getting fired must have been everywhere during and after the filming. Beefcake Statham fulfills the stoic hero part as best as he can, given the circumstances, but is a lot more fun in movies where he has a sense of humor than in flicks like this and The Transporter, where he is typecast as a frowning, one-note action man.To end on a positive note\u0085 uhmm\u0085 well, I guess some of the computer- generated vistas are actually quite nice and the Blu-Ray picture quality is crisp and clean. That's pretty much all I can come up with.Despite this movie being a massive commercial flop, a sequel starring Dolph Lundgren is in the works, once again directed by Uwe Boll. God(s) help us all.",

Ray Liotta was very disappointing in this movie. i mean the others seemed to at least try. John Rhys-Davies was good as always, and surprisingly so was Ron Perlman. i mean he was great in beauty and the beast (the TV series), but I've never much liked him in anything else. here he seemed to have found a role he could play with, and i liked him in it. Matthew Lillard was excellent as always though he has become so typecast, and now appearing in a Uwe Boll film, its not a good move in my opinion for his careerbut basically, unless like me, you're a die hard Jason Statham fan, don't bother, i saw it for free, and i want my money back. it was that bad.rock on Uwe, your record for truly being a horrid storyteller stands strong :)",

Dialogues are at moments stupid and at others somewhat acceptable. Fight scenes are really bad, they are constantly cut and completely boring. Some other details about costumes and the world might be bad, but they were acceptable. But then, on the second half there are some things that you say... WTF. On the final battle there were NINJAS. No one knows where they come from, just appeared there and started to do some flic flacs and killing people. The tarzan girls from the trees jumping everywhere throwing tree's vines. The krugs seemed like the breed from an orc and a monkey. And Gallian really fails at being the evil mage of the movie. There are many fails about this movie, some makes you laugh, others makes you cry. Either way, if you have nothing to do, and just wanna see a movie to pass time by, it is acceptable.

That actor, who only played one character all of his films, even on his parodies and he just do one thing: Look intimidating, clearly it is good one a poster or a silly action movie... but not here. Not in any demanding movie.Let's see plot, which is clich\u00e9d, with the expectation of one clich\u00e9, the inn, we can see all, return to plot: Krugs attacked kingdom, sacking the entire village of Farmer (Jason Statham in movie) and kill his son, taken his wife away. Farmer Daimon (I not remembered this, so I seek to his name) and few of his friends go away to release Farmer's wife.LOGICAL FAILS: Krugs have an army, right? They surely had their own guardians, why would think, that a small group able to enter their territory. The magi (in modern clothes) sent the Krug against King Konreid. The daughter of this king in a weird lover of this magi, in a small sketch we can see their relationship, which ended in fault. The King's army attacked the Krug in a forest, aided by the nymphs and some assassin like warriors... (both?) I do not know, exactly. The King died later, naming his lost son (omg clich\u00e9) as his heir. Two magi clashes as a low-budget version of Gandalf vs Saruman, and the king's adviser magi fallen. Farmer enters the castle, deal with the evil magi with his followers. Here we knew, that his wife pregnant with his second child, an heir to Farmer.Total eye spit to the original Dungeon Siege 1 - I missed Lady Montbarron as central character - I missed the Utgards - I missed the plot of Legends of Aranna - Clearly they mentioned Ebh, but this Ehb is very cheap compared to the game's Ehb. - I missed the Empire of Stars, the Giants... etc. - Where is the Seck? - Where is undeads, goblins?Thanks for nothing, Uwe Boll.",

I saw the terrible acting and decent action of House of the Dead, the lackluster plot(but progress) of Alone in the Dark, and finally the underrated and horribly businesses handled BloodRayne. So now here is In The Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale... and what do I think? Uwe Boll seems to be only baby steps away from becoming a solid \"B\" rate movie director, writer, producer, etc and this movie shows it. First off, the visuals through out show that Uwe Boll actually can control and emphasis his points on what he wants to do with the camera. The same plague seems to haunt Boll though. Poor conversations between the actors and terrible editing. The writing for this has gotten better, I still think BloodRayne was the best out of the 4, but the editing, especially in the beginning, is choppy. Now how about the acting? All over the place would be easiest way to say. Burt Reynolds as the King is off but I think everyone was cast well it's just that I don't think Uwe gets it or has yet to emphasis that vision as he has improved basically everything else. The music fits the mood, but how about the action you wonder? Solid through out just like his previous efforts. The ending is a bit weak and a little rushed it seems, but if there is two things I can't complain it is the visual work and the action scenes.Overall Boll created a film that killed my 2hrs and was worth admission. I can easily name a lot worse films that have released probably just in December.I think he is making the proper steps and I expect he will use a lot of what he learned to make Tunnel Rats a solid film.",

There is really only two good actors in the entire movie, the cgi is half decent but in the wide-shots it's easy to tell. Props are basic but still well done.

If you watch it expecting a Lord of the Rings epic tale, you are going to be very disappointed - but then again there aren't many movies of that quality. Watch this movie and take it at face value. Don't try to look any deeper then what you see, because there really isn't anything more. Enjoy it for what it is. A nice little fantasy tale where the good prevails over evil.Btw if you were curious, I would say that you could watch this as a family or let your kids watch it, assuming they are not to young of course. There is nothing that is all to scary and the fighting sequences are gore free, you see maybe three people impaled on swords and a few lit on fire and a few others shot with arrows.

The land gets attacked by monsters and it is up to one guy to save it, and there is also some subplot about a king and his son and a bunch of other sh*t I can't remember, but I didn't care because none of it was at all interesting. The characters are just bland cardboard cut outs with very little personality and are just there to fill in their roles. The acting is bad even from the otherwise good actors mostly because they have nothing good to work with and they were clearly just here for the money. Now you may be saying \"well yeah it's a sword and sorcery flick. what did you expect?\" I love this sub genre even the cheesiest of entries, but the problem is this movie is boring. The whole thing is played straight and there are no laughs, and the main characters doesn't have the charisma to carry this film because all he does is brood and fight. The action is awful for a couple of reasons the editing moves too fast making everyone disoriented, the creature effects look horrible, and the fighting is totally one-sided so there is no suspense involved. This movie isn't even so bad it's good, and after watching it you just feel like you wasted your time.",

Making movies adapted from video games is a good idea but everyone knows that a game or film made by the counterpart always, and I repeat, always bad. They ruin the franchise. When the film started, I thought it was okay until it got to the first battle scene in Stonebridge, #1 I don't see a bridge and #2 there was only a house or 2 that was actually in stone. How awful. The bit where Statham's character slashes and 'kills' a krug, wheres the blood? How was he able to lift that ugly goblin thing? We know these characters have blood as we see Solana with some on her head, Gallain when stopping a sword smash onto his head, Duke stabs some general and wow, there's blood on the dagger but no, slashing in that universe means no blood for either the krug or the humans. Another question that popped up in my head, why where the krugs taking the humans, to be slaves? all i ever saw was them tied in chains sitting on the floor.'In The Name Of The King'. Okay what does that mean? 90% of the film was about Statham's character, we only learnt about him being the king right before his battle with Gallain.it's truly awful, I watched it because I thought it was interesting, hence the title name but nope, I will never again watch a movie by this awful director, WHY IS HE STILL DIRECTING?????????????????????????????????",

There are so many odd plot holes I don't even know where to begin. And, as another comment said, for some reason the movie seems to 'race' from one very LOTR-like fight to the other, often without a good reason to do so.The only scene I really liked was the Wizard battle. It's filmed and held in such an original way that it actually made me say that it is something that's actually worth the title of 'Wizard battle'.In the end, I suppose I can say the special effects were nice and not overdone.

Everybody makes fun of Boll for being a bad director and mostly I agree with them. What I like about him though is the spirit with which he makes movies. When you look beyond the terrible acting and cheap special effects, the unconvincing script and the -most of the times- unfitting music you will see some glimmers of ideas so fresh and original that could be found only in some independend films. Dungeon Siege has those in tons. A magi duel that puts the Saruman-Gandalf one to shame. Some of the best battle moves we've seen lately. Gritty and realistic environments. And of course a spectacular end battle between the hero and the villain. I don't mind that DS was based on a video game, having played the game I found almost no connection and that's a good thing since usually game scripts are thin and transparent. Well, the movie script is thin and transparent too but at least it makes an effort to add some spice. Even the elves are different from the cookie cutter archetype, and they finally are portrayed like the brats that they are. All in all, I really enjoyed DS, it gave me some belly laughs and some great action scenes. Oh, and it has Ron Pearlman in it so add 2 more score points for it.",

It's like they pulled all the fantasy scripts floating around Hollywood, picked one, then rewrote it with some \"Dungeon Siege\" names, then slapped the game's name on it, hoping to pull in some dough from fans or something (and just to be clear, I watched it because I like Jason Statham, not Dungeon Siege). For some rather big (has-been and B-list) names, I expected better. The script is just pathetic (whoever wrote it failed miserably with the dialog), the action is okay (Lord of the Rings, Braveheart, etc. were much better for army vs. army fights), and the special effects could have been done on my computer at home, probably.I'd recommend renting Red Sonja or Conan instead of this.

Although I agree with a lot that has been sad about the acting and the bad script, I actually enjoyed watching this movie even tho the script/dialog was often pretty bad. The pace was quite alright. There was some completely out-of-line unrealistic stuff going on as well, but I didn't mind it that much because it was a fantasy movie anyway. The special effects were pretty acceptable as well. One thing I really got annoyed with was the music. Not that the music was particularly bad, it was in abundance. Far too much movie under far too many scenes.The action was pretty cool at times I must say. But just what was going on with these ninja's... Jason Statham stood his man. The actors did what they could with the script. I wouldn't say I enjoyed the acting a lot, because most of it was a bit heartless and more forced to the maximum achievable with the bad directing and script. The story itself wasn't that bad, it was average to my taste.I found John Rhys-Davies one of the best actors right next to Ray Liotta. Jason Statham was the good old himself and Ron Perlman did what he could. Leelee Sobieski wasn't bad either.One thing I can't get my mind around is how Uwe keeps getting enough funds to make another movie. You would say someone would learn from the critics, but Uwe clearly doesn't. He needs to leave the directing to someone else, because he clearly lacks giving the movie a soul, a heart and subtle nuances.All in all I gave it a 5.

Might as well put in \"I'll be back\" somewhere in there.It got worst when they horsebacked to the village to a full scale battle. Badly choreographed battles, slow and telegraphed moves while enemy just waiting there to get killed, no blood, to swords or spears piercing through. Only slashing just like a low budget B movie. And again with the yellow filter.Comes Ray Liotta's character to finish me: dressed and groomed like a pimp from the dark ages. His telepathic control from a distance while in a cylindre of smoke was really, really kitch at best. Why does he always have the same hair cut in all movies? He looked like Henry Hill from Goodfellas in a bathrobe.The whole 24 min had a Power Ranger, original Star Trek, Excalibur feel to it.Now, Power Rangers was low budget and they played with it with full knowledge. Star Trek was in the 70's-80's and a pionneer in its kind and Excalibur was a great movie.... in 1981.40 years later, a star studded cast and I can't watch more than 24min eventhough I was expexting a \"turn off you head\" type of movie.Quite pathetic.",

Wow. In the blink of an eye, you go from dying to camera on another actor and then back to a dead Reynolds/Perlman. No dramatic speech, no final breath.

I would definitely say it was an \"Okay\" film.I can't stand Uwe Bowle. He is a joke when it comes to movies based on Games. However, a game like Dungeon Siege is perfect for him. He has a basic premise, and a very open plot to work with. You can't screw that up. Honestly, he didn't. This movie is FAR better than some of the drudge that Sci Fi channel has put out over the recent years. This is also leaps ahead in quality to previous Bowle film's.Yes, the acting was not gripping, and the action was a little \"eh\", but again, it was better than some low budget fantasy movies.Look at it this way, there was a solid beginning, a meaty middle, and an actual finish to this film. Bowle referenced towns and locales from the game from time to time, he maintained a basic drive and purpose for the enemies, and kept the heroes on track with their purpose. This movie did indeed hit on Fantasy Movie clich\u00e9's, but they managed to work well enough.Now, I know some will say a \"5\" is to gratuitous, but if this was NOT a Bowle film, would people actually have rated it higher?

The first point of note is the choice in editing. Simultaneous action scenes spliced together are common in this genre. The quiet scenes occasionally also spliced in do not fit and would be better placed afterwords, or before, by themselves. The restraint of emotion in certain scenes is in poor decorum for the material covered, typically with our heroic members. Contrastingly, Liotta and Lillard are jarringly insane, to the level of Shakespearean madness, without the decent dialog to back it up.The number of characters makes the development far too sharp (I already just used \"jarring\"). Honestly this would have probably been better as a mini-series.The point that I must make though is this: this film is decent enough as entertainment to receive detailed criticism. It is only a few solid points off of being good. It is far short of the epic that a $60Mill budget would demand, but still acceptable.Filmamker is showing improvement.",

The movie was a huge waste of time, it seemed to rip off (poorly) many characteristics of the lord of the rings. The real sad part about this movie is how many big names there are in this movie, but it was just not enough to save it. If you are thinking about seeing this movie do yourself a favor, read a book.

The movie takes you back to a time we have all dreamed of a time of knights and kings, great courage and noble deeds, wizardry and black magic. based on the popular video game Dungeon Siege the remake of the game is astounding. A must see really!! It is a movie for the whole family to watch but you have to see it on the Big screen the CGI is fantastic but not overdone, it really is the action that just never stops. Complete with amazing performances from the legends of film, the likes of Burt Reynolds, Ray Liotta, Jason Stratham, Mathew Lillard, Ron Perlman, Will Sanderson and the super HOTT Kristanna Loken!!",

            "content": "Where to start. I am very much aware of Uwe Bolls work when I unfortunately found myself watching House of the Dead a few years ago. I found myself thinking, \"how did this film get funding?\" I of course found out eventually how the swine does get his funding but, as they say, is a separate issue. Despite the fact that I had reservations before even seeing the film I decided that the guy deserved at least one more chance. So I watched it.Now first off, if this film had been presented to me in a different capacity, say for example, a made for TV film for sci-fi or something some of things wrong with it could probably be forgiven. However, given that this film had a cinematic release one must seriously question the quality of the film.The main premise of the film is dire. A clunky script laden with horrendous clich\u00e9s didn't much help either. The acting (considering that the calibre of the leads) was surprisingly bad. Burt Reynolds, Jason Statham, Ron Perlman, John Rhys-Davies, Claire Forlani, Ray Liotta, Matthew Lillard, Leelee Sobieski. I mean, just look at that list. Between them they have starred in some amazing films over the years. How a director can make all of them act so badly is an achievement in itself. I can't think of a single reason to justify why any of them decided to make this film unless a) they all have very bad agents, b) the original script wasn't that bad AND they'd never heard of Uwe Boll or c) money. Sadly I think it might be C.The \"make up effects\" (if you can call it that) of the monsters was almost laughable and very much like what you would see on something like Hecules or Xena back in the late 90's. They looked dated and poorly designed.To be fair on the plus side, some of the cinematography was pretty good, the action sequences (minus the dodgy monster thingys) were also pretty good. All in all the whole thing felt like a bit of a pantomime, something tongue in cheek. At the same time however, it felt like the film wasn't intended to be funny and that it just ended up that way.So, all in all, a generally poor film overall. However I would say, if this were a TV movie, a lot of what is wrong with the film could be forgiven. But it isn't a TV movie and you won't forgive it.Sorry Uwe, better luck next time. And in all fairness, this could be seen as progress.",

Leelee Sobieski was decent, John Rhys Davies and Ron Perlman all did pretty well with their roles. On the other hand, Burt Reynolds, Matt Lillard, and Ray Liotta were so terrible, it almost made me weep.OK, so apart from the horrendous acting, there are many other terrible things about this movie. The costumes and sets were pretty bad. The costumes of the enemy, the \"Krug,\" (this is the noise people make while vomiting during this movie) could have passed off for the Putty Patrol from the original Power Rangers. I actually flinched every time I saw someone walking on the sets, unsure if they could hold the actors weight. They looked like a middle school, shop class project. The musical scores for this movie actually upset my stomach. They are mostly done by a string orchestra, and sound almost the same throughout the entire movie. It's not so much music as it is noise, and the noise is close to the sound of nails on a chalkboard. There were so many things that were stolen from The Lord of the Rings movies (ehem, Gimli) that Peter Jackson is probably going to be whining and postponing his next movie because he isn't getting royalties from this one.I can't and won't recommend this movie to anyone unless Brightlight Pictures pays me to.

The Krugs or whatever they are called are a miserable attempt to look like Orcs. Gallian's domain also tries to look like its Mordor but also fails miserably.

Only the most un-American terrorist-lover would set a movie in New Zealand when we have the beautiful Pacific Northwest right in our backyard. One highlight was Jason Statham's beautiful escape from being hung by twirling around while hanging from the noose and killing the guy and cutting the rope with one swing of the bad guy's sword (though the ladies in the audience will undoubtedly argue he never really escaped from being hung). This movie also puts books firmly back in their rightful place as the weapons of villains, which was a move that was long coming. I can only wait and hope that the next two movies are picked up to top off the trilogy.",

This is beyond that level of terrible into a whole new category worse than the absolute worst of Syfy original movies. Spare your eyes and watch something else.

This is not some low budget movie as you maybe would except it from Uwe Boll.

It is apparent that the actors and crew on this film really did work hard and try to deliver a product of entertainment. The film was fine for TV but I would have expected more for one in the theater. The only character that was really bad was Duke Fallow who was extremely annoying but didn't ruin the whole film. I agree that it is not a great film but no where near as bad as many commenters have depicted it to be although I suspect it would have been that bad if not for the great cast.

After all it is a sincere movie with deep plots- classic plots like good versus evil, man- wife, father-son relationship, father-daughter relationship, David versus Goliath etc. With so many great actors it must have been awful to cut each one down to 2 hours of play time. What really shines is the camera, not a strength of Uwe in the past. A lot of Close Ups that put maximum attention on the stars ability to act. This was reminiscent to how films were made in the first half of the last century- more Ben Hur than LOTR to sum it up. Also a plus Battlefield scenes that look much more realistic than most battle scenes in LOTR. Full Force Jason Statham fights like never seen before. CGI was always great and some scenes were totally new. Uwe answered some questions even referring to a second installment if this movie does well with the box office results. Really liked his down to earth approach, he is a real film maniac who cares a lot about his audience. Wonder if Tarantino shows so much affection towards his clients...",

Otherwise, wait for a price drop The acting, even from the big names is a bit bland, and the story has nothing new or surprising.However, for Mr. Boll, average is quite good. He's getting there, he may peak now, or he may actually get somewhere with his movies. But don't throw this one out just because it has his name on it.Essentially, this is what I thought of the movie itself: it was entertaining. And isn't entertainment the point of seeing a movie in the first place? It was full of clich\u00e9s, such as the acceptance of a new king from out of nowhere with no question, but this (and others) is a general problem in the genre, not just this movie. As I said before,the acting isn't top-notch,even if the cast is. The special effects are, however, quite nice.

How does Uwe Bolls keep getting these actors in his movies. While Christian Slater, Ben Kingsley and Michael Madsen have featured in his previous movies, ITNOTK has the following cast:Jason Statham as the London bloke trapped in a fantasy world, Burt Reynolds as the US Sean Connery clone as in The First Knight, Ron 'Hellboy' Perlman... well, doing his cool Ron Perlman thing, Ray Liotta in a ... Ray-Las-Vegas-Liotta-magician kinda role, with corresponding haircut, Matt 'Shaggy' Lillard as the kings retarded nephew, and hottie Claire Forlani as the MILFSo that's the lineup... impressive huh? So what about the movie?Well, the monsters were a bit crappy, the backgrounds and environments looked pretty good, 3d effects were decent, but nothing we haven't seen before. Too bad you can't say the same about the screenplay... what a mess.The story is very choppy, too many scenes in the movie were completely useless. Over-dramatic acting with the wrong actors make it very unbalanced and unbelievable. The correct timing could have make this movie a lot better.The action scenes are terrible: it's clear that every scene is built up of 40 shots pasted together. It's like they're not even trying to fit the shots seamlessly. off course Jason Statham and Ron Perlman can kick some serious ass, but the mix of martial arts and swordplay make it too modern.The thing that bugged me the most were the mix of American English and UK English and ... the Ninjas.Did you just say Ninjas? Yes, Ninjas my friend... What has Uwe been smoking when he thought of that?All together, the movie was fun to watch but could have been a lot better.

After this one, I've officially concluded that Jason Statham just accepts any movie script you throw at him, cause he should have seen how bad this would be from the start. Uwe Boll is obviously well known for directing some of the worst movies around, which had I known that in the first case I would never have watched it. All the acting in the movie is HORRIBLE, which is surprising since some of the actors have actually been in tons of other movies and done a decent job. Ray Liota's character is dumb. Jason Statham's character name being 'Farmer', doesn't help anything since his acting is very sub par in this as well. Matthew Lillard become my least favorite actor for at least a year after his devastating performance in this movie as Duke Fallow. To go along with the bad acting, this movie couldn't have possibly took much to make since the bad guys known as the \"Grug\" I believe look like the initial Power Rangers villains from the early nineties.

Never mind the fact that Ray Liotta is better than this! And certainly Burt Reynolds (whom you youngsters may not know was an Oscar nominee in his day) is better than this! And talented actors they all are, so this is definitely not their fault. With good material and good direction these actors can handle anything.Which brings us back to the point I'm trying to make. The direction is not just wooden, it's lame - and I'm guessing Boll's \"vision\" for the film was phoned in - long distance - even during the final edit. Though I can't see how even a great editor could have saved this mess from becoming schlock. He just wouldn't have any competently directed scenes on film to work with!Maybe Uwe Boll's films make money in non-English speaking countries where no one can tell that the dialog is trite and the acting is stilted. No, not stilted, smothered - by the kind of mis-direction that wouldn't be acceptable in an undergraduate film class. But that's still no excuse.

There were not.This sinkhole of a movie was like 5% Lord of the Rings and 95% Power Rangers. The fights were ridiculous and the bad guys were in rubber suits. I just do not know how this movie actually made it to the screen. You think at some point someone would have screened it and realized that this much suck in the same movie just needs to be put out of its misery. This is the first review I have written on IMDb and am only writing it in the hopes that you can avoid this movie.",

Ray Liotta gives the performance of his career which by itself is worth the rental money but there's more to the film than just that, as long as you don't take thing too seriuosly and you like action films with a limited story then this film is great, I wouldn't change a thing about it, apart from maybe on the DVD release they could've condensed all the Ray Liotta bits into one segment and have it as an option to just watch that, \"you've won nothing but time\".",

Someone recommended this for people with children 8-13, I don't know what you let your kids watch, I am 25 and have no kids of my own, but I don't think this film is appropriate for anyone under 13.

I looked up some info and this crap actually won a few awards! it won a Leo Award for Best Costume Design in a Feature Length Drama and Best Production Design in a Feature Length Drama. Which is not bad but there had to have been something better nominated! And why oh why was it nominated for Best Picture Editing in a Feature Length Drama. This is the worst edited movie ever! It made no sense! Go figure the Leo Awards are Canadian. In Germany it one an award for sound. Maybe its just the DVD I am watching but the music is so loud I came barley hear the dialoge Actually that may be may be a blessing! There is too much action and not enough story. The scenes that advance the storyline are so few and far between and chopped up I forget what's going on. The only reason I give it 2 stars is for the performances of Rhys-Davies, Perlman, Lillard and Sobieski. I find now that I enjoy watching them in anything and I mean anything.

So we thought, game's great so maybe the film won't be bad... 2. We both love films with Jason Statham, always loaded with action. So why would this one be bad? 3. The price was great and we could get it for a tenner, which seemed to be great value. After watching the film, we said the same thing: 5th category cinematography. It didn't even resemble the original story of the game, apart from a couple of names. Krugs looked somewhat cheap...

The music was sometimes way over the top for what happened on screen and it also was a complete LOTR rip-off at times (When farmer is first introduced for example).Dialogs are poorly acted and battles tend to be repetitive and the scenes are way too long.The only reason why I don't mark it a 1 vote is that the visual effects are pretty nice at times but it doesn't make up for this garbage.A waste of my evening.",

This is hard to do for a movie like Inception or Toy Story 3, but for In the Name of the King, the only things I knew were that Jason Statham was in the \"lead\" role, and there were going to be some swords involved. I like swords. And I have liked just about every movie I've seen with Statham (except Ghosts of Mars, but I'll forgive you, Jason). Maybe this will be okay...Statham is more of just an exhibit in the film instead of an integral part. He's like \"the bearded lady\" at a carnival...just something that sells tickets. He has few scenes, fewer lines and generally spends most of his time on screen performing glorified tumbling. Sadface. In a hilarious nod to the video game on which the movie is based, Statham's character is called just 'Farmer'.The movie isn't short on high caliber actors, though. Burt Reynolds is here, although he plays his king character as if he can't wait for his inevitable death scene so he can hit up the local bar. Claire Forlani, with her hypnotic eyes, stops by for a few minutes to portray a beleaguered mother. Ray Liotta is horribly misused as an egotistical wizard of sorts. And a haggard Matthew Lillard is annoying as usual. Even John Rhys-Davies seems devoid of life.But wait! There are bright spots! Leelee Sobieski is at least passable as misguided princess Muriella. And Ron Perlman steals any scene in which he has a part. He has somehow crafted a way to be believable(!) So many of the other actors seem to be here only for the paycheck. A-ha! There is a reason these actors don't seem invested. \"Directed By: Uwe Boll\" If I continued to fail at my career the way Boll has at his, I would be driven to the outskirts of town, shot in the back of the head and left for the vultures to pick me clean. Why did so many quality actors take these roles? A quick run-down of Boll's accomplishments in this film:*made every fight scene incredibly tedious & boring *dialogue written for/by third graders *made me hate John Rhys-Davies for about two hours (you bastard!) *special effects on par with the television show Charmed *costumes flat-out laughable *I also swear I saw Forlani yawn at one point!So we'll forgive the actors here. We've all heard a good craftsmen never blames his tools, but that's when the tools he is given aren't rusted & broken. DO NOT see this movie if you are expecting anything remotely original. DO NOT see this movie if you are expecting to see a quality Statham action flick. DO NOT see this movie if you think it might be interesting to see Burt Reynolds in the role of a medieval-ly king. Just don't see it period.",

I would have given it more stars if it didn't seem like at times it tried to kind-of-act-like it took itself seriously.

This is a camp fantasy flick with a hilarious cast. Which actually impresses me because I think it's the first time I've really ever seen a campy fantasy movie that wasn't trying not to be a campy fantasy movie.If you don't like the idea of jason statham knocking out 5 orcs by throwing a boomerang, tree climbing archer ninjas, cirque de sole killing people, and six foot boulders being pushed like they weigh 50 lbs. You won't like this movie. The big fight scenes are the best part of this movie, they are absolutely filled with tons of \"wtf did that really just happen?\" \"yeah they totally just did that\" moments, that make it so much fun to watch.As for me, I loved it and I'm putting it in the category of \"a good time\" as far as movies go.

A lot of his films are over the top action, but i find that very entertaining. He will never win an Oscar, but most of his films are great fun. I wondered why I had not seen this advertise at the cinema, but within the first 10 minutes it was completely obvious that this film skipped the cinema and went straight to DVD and didn't waste any time going to 'free view with your package' on love film.Where to start, this is clearly inspired by the Lord of The Rings films, which i loved. But the first problem with this film is the director Uwe Boll. I'm surprised this guy has been given the responsibility as director. This really is not his true talent. I feel sorry for anyone who was duped into being involved in the film thinking it would be an epic fantasy film that would end up a classic. The cast is good enough for an action film. Statham is Statham and it feels like you are watching The Transporter, but in the woods. He is convincing as a tough guy, but doesn't fit with this type of film. Burt Reynolds looked the part, but looked like he was filling a space in his schedule as he is so wooden and makes no effort. John Rhys-Davies is his usual over the top self. He almost provides some creditability, but almost becomes laughable.Rather than compare this film to LOTR's i think it would be best to compare it to Xena Warrior Princess. It has that cheap family feel to it especially when they add in the pointless pieces of comic relief.This film is a massive waste of time. I'm glad i watched it on my own on a weed night and didn't watch it with friends on a Saturday night as if it was my choice then no one would allow me to pick another film ever again. I would recommend that if you see this to rent/buy or watch online that you do not hesitate and just move to whatever is next.Bad directing, bad script, bad acting, bad special effects, but reasonable fight scenes, but it was very noticeable that they only had about 100 extras just doubling up. When they have the army lined up they are quick to move to another angle before they run out of people to fill the shot. The creatures are really poorly designed and are not scary or creepy what so ever.If you are a fan of Xena then you still may be disappointed in this 156 minute movie. Shocking film.",

Burt Reynolds added a touch of comic relief, and Ray Liotta should stick to \"Wise Guy\" roles. Who decided to dress him as an Elvis Presley impersonator. Anyways... I have seen worse movies.

I even find the casting quite good, and to be honest I loved to see good old Burt Reynolds as King. In my opinion Ray Liotta is also perfect as the evil mage.

And knowing how you can wring more profit (in this case food) from your constituents was of grave importance to kings and their advisers (who made sure to tell them).I loved this movie, my husband loved this movie and we bought it as soon as we could. I must have seen a different movie than everyone else, because I see no LOTR or Matrix references. I was able to see this movie and enjoy it for what it was: a B movie, but a good movie none-the-less.",

Don't get me wrong I think that Uwe Boll should be banned from making movies (maybe the UN could enforce this...) and be forbidden from writing scripts. While the script for this movie was mediocre its far better than anything Mr. Boll writes. I was glad to see that he just directed and didn't write it. The only thing that this movie has going for it is the fact that it has so many high end actors and a superb supporting cast. I do realize that this movie has some bad acting but even that has its merits (it makes the excellent performance of John Rhys-Davis seem so much cooler).When you compare this film to the other \"films\" done by Uwe Boll this movie is Lawrence of Arabia in comparison (not that this movie is that good, his other films are THAT BAD). However like Mr. Bolls other movies, you watch this film and can't stop watching even though you hate yourself for watching it. Its the kind of film that you are too embarrassed to tell your friends that you watched it.",

Some of the lines are cringe worthy. The costumes are hit and miss - some of the krug are good, but some, are terrible. The camera angles and special effects look rushed in some scenes (not sure what was happening there). I'm not completely sure how they convinced so many actors to star in this, or how they got the money to make it. I don't wish to blame any particular person for it, but someone somewhere had to have known how horribly wrong this was going.Overall, I'd give it a miss. Unless you're playing drinking games.

You could tell the kings army was fighting people in costumes. I also thought it was weird how the krugs on horses would point their arms like they were directing traffic in slow motion.

There are some(SOME)good camera moments and the costumes are great too. Maybe the make-up job is bad in some parts of the movie.The special effects are OK, maybe the two final fights, between the two magi and between Gallian(another weak point) and the Farmer, are the two best examples of this. Another thing to note, and this is a matter of personal taste, is the battle \"art\", the elves(?) use the lianas like if they were in a circus, and the fight are very ninja-like, contrasting with the general environment of the movie.At the end is a movie with good actors and a good idea, but the Director messed up.

Featuring mostly wooden performances, laughable dialogue, and shoddy production values, In the Name of the King fulfills all expectations of a Uwe Boll film.

            "content": "This is a film about an apparently simple farmer's fight for justice and revenge when a horde of Lord of the rings left over troll extras invade his land and kidnap/kill his family. So, having watched this film I went online out of curiosity to check out some facts. It became quickly apparent that the film's director- Uwe Boll- has a pretty bad reputation for making howlers based on video-games. I disagree with this reputation as I enjoyed In the name of the King- for all its hammyness, its lack of polish and bizarreness. Uwe is also only able to make his films thanks to some strange laws they have in Germany where if a film fails to make money investors don't stand to lose much.Turnips, turnips, turnips. It begins with Jason Stractham, the film's hero, in a field pulling turnips out of the ground with his young son. The situation feels surreal- and not just because it's a fantasy film. You have this butch guy talking in a gruff, and slightly overdone, London hardman accent whilst his 'son' talks with a strong American accent. I just thought 'weird' immediately. It also becomes quickly evident that they like their sayings and idioms wherever their field of turnips is as farmer (Jason's character name) seems to use every opportunity to get a few wise words in. Having trouble pulling up the big turnips son? That's because the 'good things in life don't come easy' etc, etc\u0085 So poorly scripted at times.There is a general feeling of lack of cohesion between scenes at times, with some scenes even leaving you wondering why they were there. I felt the whole thing needed to be polished more as it feels rough around the edges.The whole story and even look of the film is so Lord of the rings like it is amazing how some of the big name actors could do it. The evil wizard with a very non- descript army of trolls working underground. Hmm.. Then there are the boring and characterless and just plain odd forest women who don't like to get involved in human affairs but, as you already know from the moment you see them, will eventually help the good guys by the end of the film\u0085 Apart from that, I found the action scenes to be pretty good at times- even though at the beginning- it really reminded me of the power rangers when they fight faceless goons in a generic way. There are some decent set pieces and a huge battle later with the realm's king (Burt Reynolds) involved. The two magi (wizards) fight is well-done- and quite different to Gandalf and the evil wizard fight in the first lord of the rings apart from them being in a little room and controlling things with magic.I found the film diverting enough though. I enjoyed watching Farmer with his 'my way or the highway' approach battle through the film. And it is bad enough to somehow keep you interested. I would give it 6 out of ten as I like this type of film so much it is hard for me not to enjoy it. If you don't enjoy this type of magical heros and fantasy film then its 2 out 10.",

The only thing that seemed out of the medieval picture were those ninja's ... man that was weird. It was weird to see Asian guys dressed in tight leather dual-wielding swords. That's it, other than that, the amazons with the vines make perfect sense, because its a land and a time of magic, where things like this can and should exist. Also Statham has his charisma as an action hero, the fight scenes were very entertaining, the camera works was good, and I personally enjoyed all of the cast except for Muriella.

Of course, not as well written and financed. The actors make a decent work in the genre, and really make the movie a better experience like say, Conan the Destroyer or Red Sonja. Not to mention that any movie where Jason Statham mutilates, beats up and utterly mangles his enemies is a huge plus.

The Sets and the costumes are almost great. ok, the plot stinks and is predictable to the bone, but that was clear form the beginning. Over all i would call it Bolls best work till now ( waiting for Far cry... xD )... You can even call it a real movie ^^ He would have done himself a favour not to go with the Dungon siege licence though...

Of course, comparing it with Lord of the Rings it sucks, but you know its a Uwe Boll movie so making that comparison is like comparing a pro soccer player to a guy with one leg. I've sat through way worse fantasy movies, speaking of LotR the Hobbit comes to mind, which i enjoyed way less than this (both movies in the directors cut editions).
