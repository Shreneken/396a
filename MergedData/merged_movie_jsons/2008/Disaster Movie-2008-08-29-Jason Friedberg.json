I wouldn't be caught dead giving my hard earned money to these idiots.Well, to explain the depth of this 'film', I could write my shortest review, ever. Don't see this movie. It is by far the stupidest, lamest, most lazy, and unbelievably UNFUNNY movie I have ever seen. It is a total disaster. But since my hatred for this movie, and the others like it, extends far beyond one viewing, I think I'll go on for a bit.I don't know any of the people in the movie besides Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, and Kim Kardashian, but it doesn't matter. They're all horrible, though I think that was the point. The editing is flat out horrible, and possibly blatant continuity errors make this crapfast even crappier than I thought it would be. Now I know that these films are not supposed to be serious at all, but come on, it's film-making 101 that if someone gets a minor facial cut, it should be there in the next shot. AND, if someone gets cut by a sword, there should be blood and at least a cut (though since the Narnia films \"get away with it\", I'll give Disaster Movie a pass here).The 'jokes' are thoughtless and mindless physical gags that obviously take after some of the most popular movies of the last year (there's some from late 2007 as well, including 2 of our 5 Best Picture nominees).You know what the saddest thing about these stupid movies are? I don't care how much money they make, or how many cameos they have, these sorry ass excuses for films are taking away jobs from actors, writers, and directors that truly deserve the attention. Lionsgate, I thought you had better taste than this. You should be ashamed of yourselves for making this kind of crap. And as for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? Burn in hell. You guys are contributing to the decline of western civilization. Correction...you are the CAUSE of the downfall of western civilization.",

            "content": "Disaster Movie gets my vote as the \"new\" worst movie ever made, and there have been abominations like Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat and NeverEnding Story 3, but none of them are as terrible as this, and that is saying something. I thought Disaster Movie crude, lazy and looming towards offensive, (what they said about Amy Winehouse was bang out of order) and some of the repeated gags wore well thin before the first attempt was finished. The script was laughable, the writers display no comedic talent and there is a complete lack of laughs, and I am sorry I found the characters very annoying, Giselle especially. The acting was terrible, in all my life, I have never seen such terrible acting, and believe me, I have seen a lot of films with terrible acting. Matt Lanter and Vanessa Minillo were not only given next to nothing to work with, likewise with Tony Cox, but their performances went nowhere. Everyone else was bad too, especially Carmen Electra, whose career I am surprised isn't over yet, in every film she's in, she shows a complete lack of acting ability. The film looked as though it had been shot on a cheap studio set, and even the soundtrack was awful. Plus the title was completely irrelevant, very rarely did it spoof a disaster movie, all it did was try and be funny and failed miserably. Not even the characters spoofed here like Batman, the Chipmumks(a gross ditortion in character and more disturbing than cute and funny) and Hellboy could save this contemptible piece of excrement(I am trying to refrain from swearing, honestly I was seriously considering turning the DVD player off 20 minutes into the movie). My dad and brother told me it was very stupid, but unlike them, I am 17 by the way, I didn't find it entertaining in the least bit. If you want a good spoof try the silly but otherwise hilarious Loaded Weapon 1! Avoid this thing at all costs! I rest my case, 0/10. Bethany Cox",

These sort of movies (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans) haven't been funny for some time now but \"Disaster Movie\" has reached a new low. There wasn't one real laugh anywhere in the film, and most of the alleged \"jokes\" were actually painful. (There was a considerable amount of childish, mean-spirited stuff in the form of racist, sexist, and especially homophobic, garbage present, along with ample helpings of juvenile gross-outs.) None of the actors were even bothering to put up any pretense of acting. There is nothing hip, clever, or even mildly intelligent going on here. The entire film is from beginning to end crass, vulgar, irrational, and utterly humorless in any human sense. I know that in the past these sort of trash has made enough money to keep Seltzer et al., grinding them out but \"Disaster Movie\" may just be the downfall of the franchise. The utter contempt that Seltzer and his collaborators have for their audience is finally beginning to show through clearly. If this one fails (and from what I saw in the almost empty theater there is a good chance of it), Seltzer will have to go back to the drawing board, stop making these lazy catastrophes, and finally develop a real sense of humor. This movie is an unfunny piece of puke - stay away from it.",

I was never a fan of Miss Winehouse, but dear god - How could anyone find this parody of her even remotely funny?It seems that the Directors have now reached a pinnacle since the first ideas they ever had...

I am damn glad I never saw it at the Cinema or wasted my money buying the DVD...There is an ART to doing PARODY... Being Crude is Great but only if you can do so with Intellect...These people need to take a step back and look at the works of the Wonderful Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder and many more... They may be old and their humour may not match the new generation, but they had a class that made it work and made it funny!Face it Fellas... You have no class... And trying to be crude when you have no class means you are just plain crude... And that means you FAIL!How would I rate this Movie? Sadly, We cannot do Minus ratings...

            "content": "This film begins in 100001 BC and we see a caveman fall into a pile of Wooly Mammoth crap. Then, he's attacked by a guy who looks like he's from \"American Gladiators\" and then an Amy Winehouse look-a-like with fangs. Then he awakens and a Flavor Flav lookalike is in bed with him and his girlfriend in the present. Shortly after this, a dwarf exits the bed and gives the leading man the finger. While parody is supposed to be silly, these images are so random you wonder if the film was written or they just took darts and threw them at story ideas--all very, very fast and all which fell completely flat--and many of which were just very, very crude to hide that it wasn't funny. And this, in a nutshell, is what follows for the next 90 or so minutes--one supposed parody after another after another--none of which made me laugh.Here are my suggestions should they want to make another \"Disaster Movie\" or something like it:1. Less jokes and slow down so you have time to work out the parodies. Quantity is NOT better than quality. Yet, at other times, unfunny skits go on and on and on and on and they had neither quantity nor quality. The Hannah Montana and \"Enchanted\" bits were beaten like dead horses.2. Hire professional writers, not squirrels. I know they work cheap, but humor is NOT their forte.3. Jokes about performing abortions with coat hangers aren't funny. The film DID this and I am sure the entire theater when deadly silent. Like cancer and 9-11, this is NOT a good topic for comedy.4. Jokes involving dwarfs can work, but generally not. Unless you can get Mini-Me, don't bother.5. Find talented actors and people who really can do parodies. It would also help if they vaguely look like the subject of the parody. Some did, many did not (like Hannah Montana).6. \"I just s#%$ myself\" is not a particularly funny line. Avoid it.7. Same goes for \"suck on my placenta\". Not funny.8. Keep the \"Enchanted\" stuff--it's not great but compared to the rest of the film, it's gold. Just shorten it A LOT--this skit went on way too long and became 100% stupid. In fact, it was only funny for about 30 seconds.9. If you're gonna use a lot of actors from \"Mad TV\", try to get the more talented ones.10. No poop jokes. Poop is not comedy gold. Poop is just poop.11. No \"Kunk Fu Panda\". No.12. Get rid of Alvin and the Chipmunks unless you are willing to spend more than $13 for the puppets.13. Keep Beowulf--one of the only funny characters in the film who stayed funny throughout. He came late in the movie, though, and by then I am sure most of the patrons left the theater or killed themselves and never saw him.14. And, speaking of kill--kill the director, producers, writers and all the actors. I'm not sure if this is legal, but I assume most judges and juries would allow this if they saw the film.",

Title fails because it doesn't actually spoof disaster movies. It seems to reference Cloverfield but it really plugged so many references to recent films that the whole film feels like a half assed attempt to gain a quick buck. Directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer managed to hit lower than Epic Movie. They seem to believe that just referencing other films and making fun of them is all is needed but they are way off. Whatever happened to writing a screenplay that contains a plot? There are parody films that have done it as Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker proved on more than one occasion. But alas, this film seems content on being low level vulgar with the intelligence of a complete jackass. The special effects look about as fetching as a nasty bout of diarrhea. On top of that are the terrible acting performances led by Matt Lanter, Vanessa Minnillo, Gary \"G Thang\" Johnson, and Nicole Parker. Tony Cox was wonderful in Bad Santa, but now he is the guy they call to fill in roles in this junk that nobody else wanted associated with. Since this film doesn't technically spoof disaster films, it renders it a pointless exercise. A disaster in itself and should be flushed down a toilet. Score: 0 / 10",

            "content": "I am writing this in hopes that this gets put over the previous review of this \"film\". How anyone can find this slop entertaining is completely beyond me. First of all a spoof film entitled \"Disaster Movie\", should indeed be a spoof on disaster films. Now I have seen 1 (yes count them, 1) disaster film being spoofed, that being \"Twister\". How does Juno, Iron Man, Batman, The Hulk, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Amy Winehouse, or Hancock register as Disaster films? Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot, no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another, though I shouldn't say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.There is nothing clever or witty or remotely smart about the way these two write, and I can't believe that some people still pay to see these travesties. It's an insult to the audience, though if they enjoy these films I doubt that they are smart enough to realize that.Rating: Unfortunately there is not a number low enough (yes this includes negatives) to rate this. This deserves to be in the top 5 worst films of all time, right there with Date Movie, Epic Faliure...I mean movie, and Meet the Spartans. I would rather be forced into a 24 hour \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" marathon than watch this slop.",

            "content": "The writing of this movie is truly inventive. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have figured out how to make movies with no plots, based on movies they have only seen the trailers to, and these movies have such low budgets, that they still make money. Even with the low budget, they have an all star cast, full of bad Madtv actors, Carmen Electra and even the legendary Tony Cox. The acting, writing and direction all sparkle like the latrines of a diarrhea filled bathroom. This movie might be on par with Schindler's List for the amount of laughs, or there lack of. Honestly, though, this movie is one of the most god awful things ever made. Even their last all time low Meet the Spartans was topped in terms of horrible writing and direction, and the current rating of a 1.3 shows that Mr. Friedberg, Mr. Seltzer and their other writing partner Satan can't get much worse.Disaster Movie...what a title for this, considering not one Disaster Movie is spoofed. Every movie here is one that came out within the last year, many which came out after this piece of garbage was written, and not one of them was a disaster movie. I guess they did a parody of Twister with the cow falling, but being the geniuses these two gems of writers are, they probably haven't seen Twister and just thought it would be funny to have a cow crush Iron Man. I was practically wetting my pants with some of this material. The Hulk's pants fall off, then he's hit by a cow. Duh, haha, duh, that's some good stuff. I think the target audience of this movie must be two year old mentally unstable children, and even they would find the humor a bit too dumb and immature.Onto the plot of this winner. Will (Matt Lanter) has a dream that he's in 10,001 B.C. and he fights the Wolf from American Galdiators and meets Amy Winehouse who burps for like ten minutes on him, then gives him the Crystal Skull. He wakes up to find his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo) is leaving him for Flava Flave and little man Jojo. He throws a super duper sweet sixteen, despite that he is 25, and then a High School Musical number goes on, and then Calvin (played by the wonderful G. Thang) tries to curve a bullet, then Carmen Electra gets in a battle with other beauty Kimberly Kardashian, then Junie sings, and then later Javier Bardem, Prince Caspian, Hellboy, Batman, Beowulf and a police officer are all played by Ike Barinholtz, and thousands of sub-plots and movie spoofs of every recent movie comes in.I must admit, I laughed more here than in Meet the Spartans. Meet the Spartans produced about .5 chuckles, where this in total produced maybe 1 chuckle out of stupidity. The laughs were obviously infrequent, considering there was only 1 in this 75 minute collage of badly reproduced movies. The acting is actually not too bad in comparison to Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie, but the overall enjoyment level of none was reduced to less than none. It's sad movies like this could be made (let alone be called movies). This was the most awful putrid flick to ever appear on the big screen, and as long as it makes money, each year we will be treated to even worse movies from these swell writers and directors.Overall, this was not the best movie around, in fact, it was the worst. Avoid this at all costs. If it was a choice between this movie and death, it would be a tough choice.My rating: BOMB out of ****. 75 mins. PG-13 for stupid humor and poopoo mouth.",

Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are like the kids in high school who just cruised by, just failing every class possible, being happy with the C's and D's, then they somehow get into Princeton because their parents had money or something, it's the exact same thing with movies. The way that I just happen to look at these movies is that they are like a MAD TV spoof, just mindless entertainment. I hated Date Movie, didn't mind Epic Movie, liked Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie is a notch lower than Meet the Spartans. We have recycled jokes from the guy's previous movies, jokes that drag on and on to the point where you'll tear your hair out, and is of course, made badly.Will has had a dream that he feels like the end of the world is coming. All of a sudden the city is attacked Cloverfield style, he and his friends run around trying to find shelter and figure out what is going on while bumping into one celebrity after another. But even Batman, Iron Man, The Hulk, and Hancock can not save this world. Will and his friends realize that they have to save the world on their own and fight evil chipmunks, aliens, and flying cows.Disaster Movie, actually does have a couple laughs, I will admit that, I nearly died laughing during the Alvin and the Chipmunks parody, it was so badly funny, I just couldn't help but laugh. There are just some fun moments, I think it's ridicules that some people can not admit that. That's the reason for my title is because I saw a lot of comments from users that didn't even involve them seeing the movie, they were just complaining... this isn't the IMDb that I know, it's silly that people are just putting on comments that have nothing to do with their opinion on why they hate the movie before they even see it. Back onto the movie, my main thing that I'm upset with, this movie didn't need a script, it seems as if Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer just made it up as they went along. For some reason we have movies that were literally just released last month like Wanted and Hancock, not to mention The Dark Knight. I think they just coursed their way through this, while the movie has some funny moments, my HONEST opinion, if you want to see this I suggest the rental, this is straight to DVD quality.1/10",

I hate when people defend them by saying they are satirizing films, they aren't satirizing films THEY ARE REFERENCING films, they are not a mockery of crappy Hollywood excess, they are an EXAMPLE of it. It's like if Michael Bay said his movies were meant to be a satire of excessive CGI and explosions. To do a parody or satire, you must PROVIDE or Impersonate examples of your topic and MOCK them over specific flaws and contradictions, you don't COPY them and change things by adding hip-hop dance sequences or having characters die randomly. It's clear they haven't even watched the films that are 'parodied' here, in fact, several of the films referenced were still being shot and in some cases only starting shooting, thus making effective parodies of those films impossible, and imagine for a moment if 'Hancock' or 'The Dark Knight' were never made and they still included references to those films, would you still consider that 'hip' and 'relevant'?.And even IF, pray tell, these films were funny, they are still off-topic. 99% of all the 'jokes' have nothing to do with Disaster Movies and those that do are so minor they are negligible. FACT: You cannot parody something effectively if you don't even mention it. Cut out the off-topic scenes from 'Disaster Movie' for example, and you'll only be left with 3, maybe 5 at the most, minutes of film, mostly credits. I don't care if it's the funniest film in the world, if it doesn't in some way deliver what it promises, I'm still not even gonna give it one star. If the titles were meant to be symbolic or something(like how 'Dancing with Wolves' isn't literally about dancing with wolves and Chris Ware's 'Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth' comic is about an adult with autism), it wouldn't matter, but in this case, they specifically say what they are going to do, and then disappoint. And sure a lot of comedies have off-topic jokes, but NOT ONES THAT TAKE UP 98.9% OF THE WHOLE FILM! At least 'Bio-Dome' actually took place in a Bio-Dome!So I apologize if you get off on being disappointed, sorry, but I'm not. I prefer to laugh when watching a comedy, or at least, have fun. And even worse, when they DO make actual parodies of something, they only do lame, obvious, predictable jokes even a small child could do just as effectively, if not more so. Oh, so Hannah Montanna's a merchandising whore, WOW I didn't know that!!! It's like some kid who tries to seem smart at the dinner table when his parent's are discussing politics by making political jokes, but who knows nothing about how politics work, so he just say's 'I'm a politician' and makes fart noises with his mouth. Is that cutting-edge and insightful satire? NO. But these idiots seem to think it is, because it's basically what they do, only with 'actors' doing it for them. My review for 'Caltiki' is a better example of satire. And don't call me a snob, because I'm a guy who loves stupid comedy, 'Jingle all the Way' and 'The Stupids' are some of my favorite guilty pleasures, hell, I started a thread about my favorite bad films a few months ago before some troll derailed it because I dared question the audacity of 'Mystery Science Theatre 3000' and was recently involved in a flame war with some loser who thinks 'South Park' is a sign of the coming Apocalypse.So don't blame other people's films, these are crap all on their own.And if they intend their films to be that way, that just makes it even worse, so they intend to make off-topic, unfunny, parody-devoid, boring, unpleasant films? That just confirms and justifies anything people say and do to them. Even assassination attempts. And if they really do consider their films to be real parodies, then they are one-trick ponies, and since plenty of comedians get grilled for doing a revolving door of the same few tricks,(like the Angry Video Game Nerd swearing too much and beating up guest stars, or Dane Cook being juvenile and unoriginal, although yeah, he is) then these two are the one trick-iest one trick ponies who ever lived, and their only trick is being off-topic.These films aren't even entertaining in a so bad it's good way, in fact, they are the antithesis of entertainment. I usually never listen to people who say they fell asleep watching a film, as I used to think that that was impossible and although I've done so, it was usually for a number of reasons such as being tired, drunk or forcibly on my own free will to escape a bad film. Well, it's true, these film are so boring they actually will put you to sleep like a lazy student in a cartoon. In fact, if someone could have filmed me 'watching' this garbage, I'm sure there would have been Z's floating over my head.Ditch this crap, please.Oh, and for all of you out there who are going to castigate me for paying to see this, I'll let you know I didn't pay a single cent to watch this festering canker sore of a film. ~ The previous review will suffice for your Freidberg-Seltzer film of choice~",

JUST DON'T.Since I don't live in USA, there is absolutely no possibility for me to run across Friedberg or Seltzer. Because if I ever did, I will throw them whatever heavy object I have at my grasp right to their faces.Believe me when I say this. There is no way this piece of garbage (sorry for the comparison, garbage) can have any shred of wit, creativity or thought.Do not honor it with your attendance at a theater where it is actually shown (even if you get a free admission).Why, do you ask? What does this \"movie\" have that can be so bad? Well, it has everything and nothing at the same time. It has all the references (not parodies) of every single movie you have paid good money to see lately. Not just that, they try to make fun of \"Juno\", a movie whose script by Diablo Cody is light years ahead of Selter and Friedberg's, and \"The Dark Knight\", a movie that redeems the famed franchise. Schumacher made a genius portrayal of the Dark Cruzader compared to what said idiots have done. \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" was better than this. The whole \"nuke the fridge\" scene was smarter than any scene in \"Disaster Movie\".It doesn't have any real craftsmanship whatsoever. The only likeliness this thing had to film-making or production was the basic presence of a camera and people in front of it (not necessarily actors). The jokes? That's the joke: There are no jokes. More and more references to celebrities and big movies. And the main thing \"Disaster Movie\" is missing in the \"plot\" is... you guessed it! A disaster! I personally thought \"Meet the Spartans\" was going to be the end of this \"Spoof Movie\" era. But they made \"Superhero Movie\", and now, Seltzer and Friedberg are back! Ahhh! The humanity! An advice to producers outside the \"Spoof Movie\" circle. If you want your movie to become a success, mention that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer had nothing to do with it. You'll make millions (the only ones who won't see it are pre-teens that have never seen any real movie, and paid to see \"Date\", \"Epic\", \"Spartans\" and \"Disaster\"). I wouldn't say you should avoid it like the plague, because the plague is funnier, more enjoyable and has a better thought script than \"Disaster Movie\". It doesn't even deserve to be voted upon.",

Kim Kardashian and Carmen ELectra's acting is so atrocious i actually kind of felt sick while watching it.

First off, these movies are NOT fueled by dumb teenagers foolish enough to watch them. I'm 15 and even I know this is the biggest garbage ever. I don't watch these movies since Date Movie, because I learned right there that these movies suck. I went to a it with a friend and basically went to see how much it would suck. It sucked major ass. I walked out after a half-hour and hassled for my money back. When was the last time there even WAS a disaster movie? Juno, 10,000 B.C., Don't Mess With the Zohan, Indiana Jones, these are completely irrelevant, as are the hundreds of unfunny jokes ripped off the comedies they spoof (which is stupid as it is to spoof a comedy) and made them even less funny.Because of this movie, I will probably never watch MadTV again because it ruined my opinion of many of them. They give pathetic, poorly performed excuses for \"acting\", and showed how horrendously unfunny they can be. (It's worse than when Tina Fey left SNL).If you want comedy, don't watch this, spoofing is an art, a talent few posses, and these two jack-weeds don't posses it AT ALL. If you want to see good comedy, go to the store and buy Kentucky Fried Movie, Airplane!, Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, Scary Movie 3, and Superhero movie, because those movies are actually hilarious. Some less than others, but SM3 and SHM are far better than 10 Disaster Movies.So anyone who says that dumb adolescent teens fuel this garbage, think again because this stuff is garbage and I don't watch garbage. (this was an exception because people like my friend fuel this garbage :P.) This films will give you AIDS, makes you lose your hair, make you go blind, become flacid, makes you get a purple sock, this movie will destroy you and your sense of humor. Excuse the graphic descriptions, that's what it does to you, on the inside. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. IF YOU DON'T WATCH THIS, THOSE DUMBASSES WON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND THIS GARBAGE. THINK OF YOUR FUTURES! WHAT IF 80 MORE OF THESE FILMS ARE MADE WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE AROUND.

A movie can have a plot you don't like, or it can have a plot that's a bit contrived, but pretty much every movie has a plot. This brings us to \"Disaster Movie\". This movie has no plot! I mean, there sorta kinda are four main characters, but they're basically just mannequins who stand there while unfunny things happen around them. The order of the scenes honestly doesn't matter at all, this is almost like a sketch movie but without the punchlines. I'm not a big fan of writing classes (read my reviews for further proof), but what ever happened to the classic story structure where protagonists have to reach some kind of goal while fighting some kind of adversity? Have I just gotten too old-fashioned for the movies, is this the kind of experimental filmmaking that will become a standard for further generations? Well, as of this writing this movie's got a whopping 1.9 rating, so I think I'm safe. Got to admit though, I did laugh once during the otherwise terrible \"Sex and The City\"-spoof.

Ladies and gentlemen, Disaster Movie is different.The film is so funny and spot on with the spoofs that I almost died from laughter. All the actors turn in near perfect parodies of their characters. I actually thought I was watching Juno and her baby fight Sarah Jessica Parker from Sex And The City. The guy who played Hancock could be a twin for Will Smith, that is how good he is. He channel the Hancock character so well that I thought I was watching the Hancock sequel.The film is so witty and on the spot with it's comedy, it feels natural. So natural that there probably was no script. With a film like this, the joke write themselves. Throw whatever story you want in because it's the comedy here that works. On second thought, the story works too. It's leap and bounds over films that have been Oscar nominated. The story centre's around these people and a crystal skull and some disaster that happens. Everything about it works.The fight scenes are phenomenal. G. Thang plays a character called Calvin, he has a fight scene with a real life panda. Or at least I thought it was a real life panda, the animatronics and special effects in this film will rival Avatar, and it came out a year before it!!! Take that James Cameron. The fight between the two is so well choreographed that it makes Jackie Chan and his stunts look like child's play.The film has so many unexpected events. Who knew that a meteorite would come crashing down on Kim Kardashian. I sure didn't. Speaking of Kim, she is more than just another pretty face. She was channeling something else here, I think she must have been in character for months before and after this film, because it is just too phenomenal. Daniel Day Lewis should be offering her his Oscar, that's how good she is.Ike Barinholtz, of MADtv fame, pulls an Eddie Murphy and a Mike Myers, by playing multiple roles. His range is out of this world. Who else could be able to pull off Hellboy, Batman, Beowulf, a police officer and Javier Bardem look a like, and Prince Caspian. I can only think of one man...and that is Ike Barniholtz.I can't stop recommending this film. It's what the movies and film and cinema is all about.

It makes Spartans look like Raiders of the Lost Ark in comparison. You will seriously feel ill afterwards and more than likely have a strong urge to gouge your eyes out.May Contain Spoilers....if you care: First off, as it appeared in the trailer, this movie does not spoof, or really even reference disaster movies at all. The set shakes a few times, there are some plastic asteroids, and a bad cgi tornado, all of which that do nothing to add anything to the movie, but other than this there's nothing even relating this to said style of film. Instead we get references (not to be confused with actual spoofs) to such films as High School Musical, Step Up, this summer's crop of comic based films, Enchanted, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Kung Fu Panda, and Sex and the City. I can't wait to hear Seltzer and Friedberg praise their own genius and describe this movie as being modeled around Cloverfield...they clearly tried to do this, but other than the outline of the small group of people running through the city trying to find the injured girlfriend, there's nothing relating this piece of crap to the monster movie.I can honestly say I did not laugh once at this movie. All of the \"jokes\" were forced, and many of them were dragged on for several minutes at a time...the two writers clearly thinking they were onto some kind of comedy gold here. Probably the most insulting thing about this movie is, like all their other gems: Epic, Date, Spartans, they consider the audience to be mentally challenged...having to tell us point blank what movie it is they are referencing (again...not spoofing) Such lines like: \"It's an inconvenient truth, it's global warming,\" \"Come here you kung fu panda,\" \"what is this enchanted place,\" \"How do you know all this? I know because I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\" \"Let me get my Get Smart phone (proceeds to talk on his shoe),\" and \"whats with the marching band? I thought I'd cheer you up with a high school musical\" all exist to make sure we're in on their super intelligent antics.Please, save your money for anything else. Show Hollywood that they need to stop these two guys from making any more movies. I can't even imagine a 5 year old finding this stuff funny.

But at least the razzie people now know who to give the award to. So bad it almost makes the other ones seem good.PROS:I have nothing good to say about this film. Absolutely nothing. CONS: my favorite part of this comment. The cons. OK first of all Aaron and Jason need to look up the definition of spoof in the dictionary, the definition might vary from a dictionary to another, but I am pretty sure no dictionary will give the following definition, a piece of work in which various objects fall on pop culture icons and random stuff with no synchronized manner happens. If a dictionary gives that definition to the word spoof then i stand corrected. For me parody movies are taking a little amount of a pop culture reference and expanding upon it and making original jokes such as airplane and scary movie and all those other movies which Aaron and Jason should have learned from. In this film, however, the genre diverts from a parody to wackness.99% of the jokes in this movie are prolonged and at some point you feel like you are being tortured. And then the unbearable redundancy. As if the audience like the jokes they already made in the film, they make other ones in the same manner. Where one of three things happens, something falling on someone, or somebody being hit brutally and somehow make it through, or somebody starting a random dance-off. The scene I hated the most, not that I liked any, is the scene where the chipmunks from Alvin and the chipmunks show up, and for some reason start chewing on Juno's character(named Juney). The scene was somewhat disturbing and rubbish. everything in this film is a rip off. 95% of the characters are ripped off. the jokes are all rip-offs and it almost looked like an unscripted reality show, you know, where people do random stuff cause it's not scripted.FINAL THOUGHTS: The saddest part is that these guys are making a living like this, I mean come on, there are talented actors and directors out there who are dying for roles and these guys are making a living by writing a script that looked like it took two hours or less to complete? unbelievable.Another thing, What is wrong with us human beings these days? I mean some people were actually laughing hysterically during the film, and I thought of the film Idiocracy, where people find this kind of stuff funny.

I have no idea who any of these actors are (I refuse to acknowledge Kim Kardashian as an actress after all the awful things SHE'S put out) but pretty much any hope they've ever had of a career was more or less destroyed by this movie. I'm still baffled that Tim Curry managed to survive Scary Movie 2.The plot... There is no plot. There is no story. There is no CONFLICT. It's just a group of stupid kids going around ripping off every single movie made in recent years (at the time of its release) while tornadoes and other disasters strike the area.I wish a tornado had struck this movie during production...And remember how previous Seltzer and Friedberg movies had \"parodied\" genre films (if you're using the definition of someone who doesn't know what parody is)that they were named after? Of course not, seeing as like me you've tried to pretend these movies never existed up to this point, but humor me on this. The title itself is a complete lie, holding no ties to the genre from which it takes its name other than being a complete disaster in and of itself.Consider this my review for ALL Seltzer and Friedberg movies: they're all a huge pile of cinematic fodder that should be cremated, buried and forgotten and their creators kicked out of Planet Earth.",

Matt later wakes up to celebrate his super-sweet sixteenth birthday (despite him being in his twenties) in a scene where we get one unfunny joke and celebrity impersonation after another. Then disaster strikes (it seems kinda redundant though since this movie already is one), hurricanes, earthquakes, meteorites and other classic disaster movie ingredients hit planet earth one after another. Will, followed by his friends: Juney (Crista Flanagan), Calvin (Gary \"G Thang\" Johnson), and Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go out into the city and tries to find his girlfriend and a safe place and later realizes that he has to find the crystal skull to set things right.The problem with this movie is, just like other movies by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, that it doesn't stay on the theme but goes all over the place and try to spoof almost every popular movie that was made that year. And I use the term \"spoof\" lightly. Once again \"Seltzerberger\" show that they only grasp the most superficial concept of what humor is and never really bother to dig deeper and see what it is that makes things funny. Sometimes doing things outside the theme can work but not if it takes up a majority of the movie. And (for me) this movie is worse than Epic Movie. Yes you read right, Worse than Epic Movie. That movie at least had a story. Sure it was borrowed and \"crapified\" but at least it was a story. In this movie, everything that happens during the second act, when they try to find a safe place/figure out where they should go, just feels like a filler where the gang stumble into one reference after another. \"Seltzerberger's\" over-reliance on potty humor, movie/TV references, random musical numbers, deliberately obvious stunt-doubles and crappy special effects does not save them this time.Seltzer and Friedberg, your movie sucks horribly. If I may paraphrase a line from \"Billy Madison\" I'd like to say: I award you only one star, and may God have mercy on your souls.Once again, if you want to see a GOOD movie made in the style that this train wreck was trying (and failing) to emulate, watch \"Hotshots\" \"Airplane!\", \"The naked gun\" movies, \"Top Secret\" instead.",

            "content": "Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be ashamed of themselves. Completely and utterly.I'm an extremely easy guy to please, especially when it comes to movies. I'm the one guy in the room who will admit to having enjoyed \"Pluto Nash\" and \"The Mummy 3.\" I'm the guy who will try to find something in every film to like. I enjoy movies, and am very rarely disappointed in them.Except for films like this, which are complete and utter idiotic failures by every stretch of the imagination. The team of Friedberg and Seltzer, whom are responsible for this abomination, should be ashamed. They have fundamentally failed understanding or displaying even the most basic ideas of filmmaking and comedy. They have failed with this film in a way which I have never before witnessed. This movie has literally made me angry in the few times I tried to sit through it, it was so insulting.How can they release such complete and utter trash like this? I actually cannot comprehend how they could have so little respect for the audience that this filth would be released.OK, fine, I'll write an actual review. But this film ain't pretty.This film has no plot. Literally no plot. It revolves around a group of people fleeing various disasters, while encountering a random array of pop-culture figures (including Batman, Amy Whinehouse, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, Princess Giselle from \"Enchanted\", Iron Man, Hellboy, Flava Flav, Juno from \"Juno\", etc.) who show up without any hint of irony or humor, introduce themselves to the camera, then awkwardly leave after a failed attempt or two at humor. Eventually they encounter a dwarf that is supposed to be Indiana Jones (played by Tony Cox) who tells them that in order to stop the disasters, they have to return a Crystal Skull to an altar. That's it. That's the plot.The acting is atrocious all around. The main actors are completely unlikable and their characters are made into incredible jerks. (We're supposed to root for our hero to get back his girlfriend even though she's some sort of serial cheater, and the main character is the single most bland, undeveloped person you could ever encounter.) The celebrity look alikes don't resemble the celebrities they are \"parodying\" in the least and make no attempt to sound or act like them. (Nicole Parker is the only one to come vaguely close as the parody of Princess Giselle from \"Enchanted\", but it still fails and is ruined by a random joke that destroys the character completely) You may notice I put \"parodying\" in quotes above. This is because, by definition, this film fails to serve as parody even though it's meant to be. Parody is by definition meant to comment upon or mock established original works through humor and satire. This film doesn't do that, the characters merely show up without making any sort of comment on the original works, and are too unfunny to mock them, hence, this fails at becoming parody, hence, it isn't parody, and Seltzer/Friedberg failed at making what they set out to.The production is among the worst I've seen. The direction is stale and uninspired to the point of frustration for the viewer. The special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen. I've seen YouTube clips made by 12-year-olds with high production values than this. Costume and set design is painfully bad. The editing is abysmal and destroys a lot of the jokes, the animatronics are just crap. This is one of the worst productions I've ever seen.And the humor makes no sense. Every joke in this movie falls flat as a pancake. Jokes have no set-up, no humor, no irony and no payoff. It's just random quips and nonsensical pop-culture references that date the film horribly.I really just an thrown a loop as to how Seltzer/Friendberg can live with themselves knowing they make films like this. This is by far their worst film, but all of their other films are nearly this bad as well. It's honestly upsetting. They have no respect for audiences, no respect for their actors, and no creativity.This is without a doubt the worst film of 2008. It's without a doubt the worst film of the 2000-20009 decade. And it is possibly the worst film since the birth of cinema. This makes films like \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" and \"Space Mutiny\" look like high art. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, you should be ashamed. 1 out of 10.",

This movie should be watched only by people who love bad movies, and even for them, probably only once.I have seen almost all of these dreaded movies. In terms of writing I thought that \"Meet The Spartans\" was the worst. However, there are two scenes in this movie that really set it apart. This movie has two extensive musical numbers , three if you count the scene with the Chipmunks, and they are awful. One near the beginning of the movie is a true test of a person's ability to endure bad cinema.I'm not one of those guys who think that humor should always be G-rated, especially because good clean jokes are hard to find. However, some of the jokes in this movie were just gross. The first one that comes to mind is the \"sourdough\" joke that the princess tells, which you will encounter if you watch this wretched thing.

Truly it's one of the the most terrible, unfunny pictures ever made.Disaster Movie tries to be funny by being a parody of a lot of popular films. But every single time it tries, it fails miserably. Because the film is a parody of everything, it doesn't have a plot. It's just random scenes that ridicule everything that was made in the last couple of years. The so-called jokes are light-years away of being funny, and are told by complete idiots.The acting in Disaster Movie is so bad, that someone like Carmen Electra gives one of the best performances. There are some really idiotic people in this film, but the worst one by far is the piece of human excrement that plays the Enchanted Princess. She has to be the worst living thing ever captured on film. Her character is terribly unfunny and a complete psychopath. I felt sickened by everything she did, and I have rarely hated a character so much. Unfortunately, she also plays Amy Winehouse and Jessica Simpson, who are equally unfunny and disgusting.The film does deserve some credit in terms of how bad it is. If you give a random person 50 years to come up with a terrible film that's not the least bit funny, it's a guarantee that it will be better than this rubbish. It would probably be funnier to make a film in which everyone who worked on this gets disemboweled with a wooden spoon and buried alive. But we're stuck with this, so just try to avoid it.

I consider myself a lover of cinema, with an appreciation for the art of film. I love many genres, including comedy, action, and of course, zombie movies. All of this aside, I watched \"Disaster Movie\" this afternoon, and it elicited one emotion from me: Anger.I have never been so irritated in all of my adult life by a movie. I have watched these cretins put out all of this filth that masquerades as \"entertainment\", and have held my tongue until now. I will say this right now: anyone who finds these movies entertaining should be ashamed of themselves. I generally believe that people can have whatever opinion they want, but people that actually like these movies are contributing to the downfall of the art form of cinema. By encouraging LionsGate to continue making these horrendous movies, all we are doing is perpetrating a cultural crime that we may never be able to fix. I grow weary of the multitudes who flock to theaters to see this garbage, and I weep for the future of our nation if this is what passes for entertainment these days.None of the jokes are funny. The parodies of films like \"Juno\" and \"10,000 BC\" fail to amuse, and even the lampooning of unexplainable culture phenomena like Hannah Montana and Amy Winehouse is an exercise in futility. No one has ever tried to do more with fecal matter and farm animals than this movie did, and it failed miserably.I beg all of you, as a lover of movies, not to see this film.

A sabre-toothed Amy Winehouse might have made me giggle burping a lot in the lead guy's face, but the rest of the film just drags along, and to be honest, I was just pleading it would be over soon. It looks cheap (apart from maybe some tiny special effects and doubles doing street dancing), and just like Meet the Spartans (also from the guys who made Scary Movie), it just can't be found funny in any way, even if they try.

I'll tell you the truth, if you want to watch it as a brainless person (ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers, which I am not) then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it, even a little, the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.Remember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art, and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash, then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists (most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan). But these two guys just...well I've been writing so big words, let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck, they are not artists, but instead money craving whores. And their latest movie proves this even more so.The movie fails so easily its mind blowing. I mean nothing was funny in the trailer, and people usually put the best stuff in them (like idiots sometimes).I knew it was going to be bad, but I made a bet with my \"friends\" and that wasn't a good idea at all. I have to write movie reviews in a paper and tell everyone whats good and whats bad, same for my friends. We flipped on who has to review it...Why me? Well I'm warning you at least. It shouldn't even be called a movie, nothing about it is artistic or original. The jokes..I'm sorry, the references are made throughout at pretty much random, like the Hannah Montana or the Juno gig (they were actually close to spoofing it, but failed by referencing instead of joking and twisting it).Oh and please, the random wrestling scene? I don't know about you other guys, but I have high respect for women, and I have a high respect for film-making. What I do know is you shouldn't have something in a movie that doesn't add up to the story or anything. Nudity is not really needed (Titanic was the closest exception, but still you would've gotten the idea if you only saw her bare legs.) Now I hate it when a girl says all guys are the same, perverts and brainless (and if you disagree with what I said about the nudity in a film, you might be one of them unless you actually believe it has a point), and sadly this film just makes that stereotype a little bigger. Thats if anyone watches it, which hahahaha!!! By the way, when I said movies should have scenes and only scenes that add up to the main plot, that was the ticket right there to say that this movie fails. Yup, just like that. Perhaps I'm grading too hard for these guys. I mean its a brainless movie...Nope, they deserve it. Besides thats the best part about reviewing a bad movie, you get to rip it inside out. Thats if you know how to grade a movie correctly.But lastly (well I've got about 4 scores worth of bad movies I need to write about, but whatever) the main idea about spoofing was brand new when Airplane! came out. Same with Naked Gun. And whenever something random came into play, the story was still progressing. For example, the arrow in Airplane! shooting out of nowhere: random, yes, but the story was still movie and no one was distracted except the audience. Perfect. Naked Gun, not only was it spoofing cop films and others, but it also had its own jokes. Same with Airplane! Anyways this movie was made for money, not to tell people a story. Simple as that, and never flip a dang coin to determine something that could be life threatening.I give it a 1 out of a 10.

            "content": "\"Disaster Movie\" lives up to its title. The latest lowbrow movie lampoon from the writing and directing duo of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer qualifies as their least imaginative burlesque of blockbuster movies. Friedberg and Seltzer contributed jokes for the last two \"Scary Movies.\" Afterward, they ventured out on their own and their first and third spoofs \"Date Movie\" (2006) and \"Meet the Spartans\" (2008) fared better than their lamentable sophomore effort \"Epic Movie\"(2007). The theatrical movie poster shows a tidal wave swamping the Statue of Liberty. Nothing as large-scale as a tidal wave engulfs \"Disaster Movie.\" When the earthquake strikes, Friedberg and Seltzer do little more than wobble their cameras to simulate cataclysmic events.The best Friedberg & Seltzer parodies single out a specific movie and flesh out the fun with gags from other movies that have nothing to do with the narrative. \"Date Movie,\" for example, ribbed the romantic Will Smith comedy \"Hitch,\" while \"Meet the Spartans\" skewered the homoerotic spear & sandal saga \"300.\" Ostensibly, \"Disaster Movie\" appropriates the \"Cloverfield\" plot, but omits everything else plot that distinguished \"Cloverfield.\" \"Disaster Movie\" doesn't consist of first-person video footage recovered from a camcorder. Friedberg & Seltzer have no Godzilla-type monster trampling the city. The humor consists of diametrically opposite characters colliding with each other as mobs of panic-stricken people swarm the streets amid chaos. Sexual and scatological jokes brimming with PG-13 profanity and partial male nudity seem rather tame because after four movies bowel noises lack hilarity.\"Disaster Movie\" opens with a dream. The protagonist, Will (Matt Lanter of \"Heroes\"), dreams that the year is 10,001 B.C. This is a clear reference to the prehistoric potboiler \"10,000 B.C.\" Will imagines that he is a caveman with dreadlocks and a rampaging dinosaur is chasing him. Our hero dodges a gigantic dinosaur foot as it pulverizes the ground nearby. Instead, he plunges headlong into a pile of dino poop. Afterward, he encounters a saber-toothed, alcoholic Amy Winehouse (Nicole Porter of \"Mad TV\") with her bizarre beehive hairdo. Winehouse conjures up a Mac laptop from her beehive. She forecasts the end of the world on August 29, 2008. An alarmed Matt awakens from his nightmare. He discovers two more guys--a tattooed midget and Public Enemy rapper Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) in the raw--in his bed between him and his cute girlfriend Amy. Amy (Vanessa Minnillo of \"The Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer\") walks out on Will with the midget because he refuses to commit to her. Actually, Will's obsession with the end of the world prevents him from committing to Amy.Later, at the sweet sixteen party he never had, twenty-five year old Will and his friends are shaken by earthquake tremors originating near the loft where they are partying. Amy leaves the party to check on the National Museum where she works. Will and his \"Fat Albert\" best friend Calvin (newcomer Gary 'G-Thang' Johnson) rush into the streets to witness widespread panic. A pregnant teenager, Juney (Crista Flanagan of \"Mad Men\"), the spitting image of Ellen Page in \"Juno,\" a movie about a wisecracking, knocked-up teenager, joins them. Flanagan gets some of the best lines in \"Disaster Movie.\" The closest thing to a catastrophe in \"Disaster Movie\" are the smoking vapor trails that huge green meteors make as they streak across the sky. One meteor pins Hannah Montana (Crista Flanagan again) to the ground, but she continues to sing and advertise her wares.Meanwhile, an \"Enchanted\" princess (Nicole Parker) emerges from a street man-hole and accompanies our heroes across town to the Natural Museum where an Egyptian statue has Amy pinned to the floor. Like the \"Clovenfield\" heroes, our heroes find shelter in an abandoned building. First, they encounter a look-alike \"Sex and the City\" quartet. Juney and a transvestite version of Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie (Jason Boegh of \"First Kiss\") tangle like vicious cats. Juney kicks Carrie not only with her own feet but also with the feet of her unborn baby. Second, our heroes encounter pugnacious animatronic, sweatshirt-clad chipmunks like those from \"Alvin and the Chipmunks. Predictably, one chipmunk turns rabid and takes a chunk out of Will's crotch. Eventually, Will, Calvin, the Princess, and Juney reach the museum and release Amy. Amy produces the crystal skull from \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\" In the second best joke, we see Indiana's fedora on the floor and the shadow of the famous adventurer scooping it up. This time little man Tony Cox, the midget who played singles' counselor Hitch in \"Date Movie,\" fills in for Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.Unfortunately, Friedberg & Seltzer's fourth movie amounts to little more than amateur high school skits. They love humiliating celebrities. The impersonations of Amy Winehouse, Dr. Phil, Justin Timberlake, Hannah Montana, and Michael Jackson are appallingly inept. You may grin at the bawdy song lyrics, but there is nothing worth laughing-out-loud at in this potboiler. \"Disaster Movie\" pokes fun at \"Cloverfield,\" \"High School Musical,\" \"Superbad,\" \"Juno,\" \"Iron Man,\" \"Enchanted,\" \"The Dark Knight,\" \"The Love Guru,\" \"Night at the Museum,\" \"Twister,\" \"Wanted,\" \"Kung Fu Panda,\" \"No Country for Old Men,\" \"Beowulf,\" \"Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\" \"Speed Racer,\" and \"Sex and the City.\" Good spoof movies imitate what they mock, but \"Disaster Movie\" does a execrable job of merely imitating. Crista Flanagan's letter perfect imitation of Ellen Page is the sole exception. Indeed, \"Disaster Movie\" contains more perspiration than inspiration. Sexy Carmen Electra, who has been in every Friedberg & Seltzer movie, plays the Angelina Jolie character from \"Wanted,\" but her role is more of a cameo. Incredibly, the filmmakers haven't included any Brittany Spears scenes but Michael Jackson takes a beating twice. He is hiding in the trunk of Speed Racer's jalopy between the monkey and Speed's young brother. Altogether, \"Disaster Movie\" is a disastrous line-up of lame skits thrown together without a clue.",

I was going to walk out of the cinema but I thought that it might get better - it didn't. If anything this movie got worse throughout it. I only watched it because I found the Scary Movie series to be good. I didn't laugh once at the \"jokes\" in this movie. I can't believe someone could make a movie as bad as this. This is the #2 worst movie on the IMDb Bottom 100 charts. I would NOT like to see what came #1! The title \"Disaster Movie\" is ironic in the fact that this movie was indeed a total disaster. I wasted 2 hours of my life - which i will NEVER get back. I know one person who didn't mind the film so this movie does have a few people who like it but I can fairly confidently say that this is one of the least popular films in the history of movies.The scary movie series, which is written by the same people (at least some of them), is a FUNNY movie. I liked it. I'm not saying you will but I wouldn't not watch the Scary Movie series because of this. To sum it up: the jokes aren't funny, there is no storyline what so ever, there is nothing interesting in the whole film, the trailer is 1 000 000 better than the actual filmand finally: -DON'T WATCH IT!",

It's not funny at all, nothing has a point and at no moment does anything come close to making sense. It's like watching the thoughts of the stars of MADTv under marijuana overdose. There are no jokes, not a decent impression and one scene is dragged on one after another. It's basically twenty to fifty characters running into each other in search of a plot. Nicole Parker acts as if she's on acid, Crista Flanagan looks wasted and the rest of the cast look embarrassed they agreed to do this. It's almost as if they're looking at each other wondering \"Was this in the script you read?\" or \"When do we start the movie?\" or \"I hope this isn't used in the final draft.\" Bottom line: Seltzer and Friedling need to be stopped from doing these movies.

I came in with no expectations at all due to being tired of these spoof movies since Meet the Spartans, but I had to go in since I couldn't see Death Race. So when I was viewing this movie I really thought nothing could make me laugh. There were no character developments, there were no disaster movies spoofs(the only disaster things happening in the movie were meteors falling which were only 2 by the way). To tell you all the truth, I only chuckled once or twice(at the Juno parts). The rest of the jokes were either dumb, immature, or just recycled garbage from past movies.So to tell you all right now I have to say one thing about this movie: Don't see it, it's no improvement from previous spoof mistakes.Rating: 1 out of 10",

            "content": "Once while walking in the street I accidentally walked head first into a post. That was more fun than watching Disaster Movie. Clearly not satisfied with Epic Movie and Meet The Spartans, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (Alarm bells) take us even further down the cinematic hell hole with Disaster Movie: A vile, putrid, excruciatingly unfunny, painfully awful comedy catastrophe which is a contender for one of the very worst movies ever created. In the film a bunch of repulsive 20 somethings try to save someone trapped at a museum going through a laughably un-tense apocalypse. Normally in reviews I talk about positives but there are absolutely none. It's racist, sexist, homophobic and utterly disgusting with some of the most putrid jokes I've ever seen. Watching the film is like having your head shoved down a stinking toilet for 90 minutes. This is the kind of film which will enrage both film fans and aspiring directors or screenwriters. Why are Friedberg and Seltzer allowed to make movies when they clearly can't direct or write their way out of a tissue packet? The acting is atrocious; all of the actors are terrible with Kim Kardashian who can't breathe convincingly being the worst. The direction... there isn't any. The film has less visual appeal than a puddle of sick and there is no art in it whatsoever. The script is one of the worst ever written. One entire set piece consists of cows crushing the Marvel superheroes... that's it while another is the coin toss scene from No Country For Old Men being replayed word for word. The fact like films like NCFOM or Indiana Jones or Enchanted, all good films, could actually be referenced in a film like this is absolutely appalling. Disaster Movie is a perfect example of how low cinema can go, and deserves to be regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. It doesn't have any merit whatsoever and is simply Friedberg and Seltzer, who are now my least favourite directors even though I've seen just 2 of their movies, forcing their juvenile, lazy, ugly and pathetic humour down our throats in the most boring, lame and unbearable way imaginable. File this under use for your cat's litter tray. Then maybe it'll finally have a purpose.0/10",

If you took a bunch of 6th graders together and told them to put together a skit in about 5 minutes, it would probably look something like Disaster Movie. The only moment we laughed was the chipmunk scene. Seeing them head-banging just seemed hilarious at the time, maybe because everything else leading up to it had been so mind-numbingly terrible. It's not worth the price of admission. The was one good thing about the movie though. The night felt so anti-climactic after that film, that we decided to go to Atlantic City and had a blast.",

The story is non existent, even to the extent of parody, and the parody itself is done abysmaly with virtually no reference to the source material at all. In fact, this film is almost entirely made up of 'parody' versions of clips from other films that were only taken from the trailers from said movies- the vast majority of which aren't disaster movies in the first place. How this is supposed to pass for a comedy film when it has no plot, virtually no parody and fewer jokes than the most dirgeful funeral I have attended is beyond me. Perhaps that is the joke? If so, it's not funny.Whilst the rest of the genre made by (some of) the same production team such as Date Movie and Superhero Movie at least made parodical reference and jokes based upon films from the genre the relevant film was named after, Disaster Movie instead is just a description of what the end product turned out to be. We can but hope that this film puts nails in the coffin of the directors careers so they can go and be more productive in the film industry sweeping floors or emptying bins- footage of which would be more entertaining than this drivel.Mark my words- no matter how bored you are, how cheap this becomes on disk or how free it may be on the internet- do not waste your time watching it. You will only regret the loss of those precious minutes of your life, which could have been spent more satisfyingly and less painfully by watching paint dry whilst being beaten about the head with a mallet.Forced watching of this film should be added to the bans under the Geneva Convention as torture.

But most of all: got nothing to do with movies!According to them, writing and directing are very easy job to do. I think these guys just hang out together, drink together, make up jokes about recent movies, TV shows, ads, and celebrities THEN turn them, as they are, into what we so leniently call: movies!Their work, at best, is just gag after gag after gag. That could have been good. But the result is always dreadful. Why is that?There is no plot. So why should I care? This time, why they didn't make the whole thing as a journey into fantasy world, a hallucination (it's in a way!), or anything that may win the audience's concern or respect. This guys-are-meeting-jokes condition mirrors a sense of belittlement and negligence. Ask yourself why (Kimberly Kardashian) had to die? Well, I know. They hired her for limited number of scenes, and she must have had other things to do. But assuming that that was for a surprise, or even a laugh? FORGET IT, PAL! Hence, I won't bring up axioms like \"the character must end up as else what it began with\".. as here this is off the menu (and I mean the character, along with what's axiom!). While comedy is a kind of drama, the hardest kind, it's apparent that this new dual didn't hear of both; drama and comedy!Aside from the incapacity of building a sketch or even a situation, the sense of humor was mostly shoddy, if not nasty and sickening; (Batman) saying, out of the blue, \"Do you want to see me play with myself?\", (G. Thang) is wiping a feces off his face, the leads are riding the car of (Speed Racer), or fighting (Kung Fu Panda). Question: Can any of the above pass as droll??I remember reading once that \"Comedy is Timing\". That can be useful to criticize a big crime here; which's the \"elongation\". Considerable part of the gag is in its being as swift. Simply, (Friedberg) and (Seltzer) know nothing about that. Look at the wrestling match, the dance duel, or the monotone - supposedly sarcastic - performance of Juno-look alike--to see that clearly and badly! Otherwise, they love to do that to fill in their movie to be A MOVIE. Because without these tricks, it would be like 50 minutes thing; which could be more merciful, returning this work to its rightful original: TV sneering or internet's take on.This is real heavy: \"Many of the films spoofed here hadn't been released when the script was written\" OH MY GOD! How they got the nerve?? And does seeing - literally - (Irion Man) got hit, (The Hulk) naked, (Hellboy) annoyed, (Hancock) beaten, and (Indiana Jones) as a midget count as respectable true \"spoofing\"??!! Ohhh, these are just 2 seconds jokes that fit a trailer. They promise with more, while sorrowfully there is no \"more\". Hence, many of them turned the movie into a long boring trailer. That's why the movie can be watched, way better, through its trailer!There are no stars. It doesn't affect negatively on the popularity of it only, it does affect negatively on its credibility as well. Since sometimes the presence of the stars to spoof themselves assures something truthful in the mix, making the laughs louder and more memorable.The image goofs; which's another sign of laziness, or knowing nothing about the tools of the medium. For instance, we didn't watch any blood out of the sward that was IN the girlfriend's shoulder. Thus with the low level of everything else, it's stupid!Being comic is a mark of smartness. So making a parody needs a smart dealing; like - basically - knowing what's to be spoofed in movies and why. As putting an irony to make a laugh (the Chipmunks singing hard rock) or a sharp critique (Juno's language). These guys are a bit humorous; they fulfilled my dream of giving (High School Musical) what it deserves. Almost what it deserves! But surely they lack the talent of writing real script, producing real comedy, and making a real movie. And you know what? They don't, just totally don't, learn from their mistakes!(Disaster Movie) is another mistake. It doesn't have Disaster but itself, being far from making a joke about any disaster movie. I knew lately that it was in fact a (Superhero Movie). But it got a last minute change. So it's not enough that the poor viewers had to suffer a weak work that disappointed them as a movie and a parody, but they had to suffer more from the bluff of it, and its propaganda, as a thing about certain something, while it isn't.Still the deepest pain this movie causes is basically its character as a \"movie\" while it's many bad gags, related only by the beer that their makers drank one unfortunate night! Though, what I can't figure out to date is how they got Hollywood high executives involved in their uncreative drinking and joking?!!Since it's not a parody \"movie\", is it merely a parody? I believe the rule is being whether an original thing, or an original parody of it. And this movie is the original *bad* both! The good thing about it is providing a fine example to study one of the wrong ways of making a movie or parody. It's supposed to puck fun out of the worst points in other movies, but ended up as a series of the worst points collected in one!Finally, with Date, Epic, Meet, then Disaster, \"The Hollywood Parody Movie\"..

So do yourself a favor and never ever watch this shitty film.I don't think it is possible to make a film worse than this.Even 1 seemed too high for this \"movie\" if you would like to call it that.In short do not even watch this movie for 1 second....you are gonna REGRET watching it.I would rather erase this \"movie\" from my memory because this movie is a pathetic waste of money and time and is just the worst attempt at making a film.",

It references many unrelated blockbusters that each movie appear for only a few seconds. Hence it lacks a coherent theme to stick the spoofs together.In addition, the jokes are very unfunny. They are so overdone, over the top and annoying. For example, the scene where a princess murders someone is so overdone. It might be remotely funny if she shoots once or twice, but not when she shoots for fifteen seconds.Spoof movies can be funny and entertaining, but \"Disaster Movie\" is a complete disaster that bores me to hell.

Well, it's more of a reference point for pop culture of 2007/2008.The (laughing uncontrollably) \"story\" focuses on a group of worthless, one dimensional heroes who band together to save the world from a mysterious apocalypse that has something to do with Batman, Indiana Jones, The Hulk, Sex and the City, Speed Racer and Alvin & the Chipmunks. We also get a whole LOT of tasteless jokes concerning boobs, near-naked people, sh**, and blood. What does ANY OF THIS HAVE TO DO WITH DISASTER MOVIES????!!!!!!!!!!!!! On top of all that, I find the humor directed towards women to be highly offensive and tasteless. What's funny about constantly referring to women as bitches? The cast is really hit and miss. Carmen Electra (the poor man's Leslie Nielsen) is very beautiful, but she has demonstrated a complete lack of acting talent. Nicole Parker is mildly amusing as Enchanted Princess but a little of it goes a long, looong, way. The rest of this miserable bunch is more or less the same.So, is it all bad? Hell yes! But Tony Cox is amusing in a parody of Indiana Jones and the film is entertaining in a camp sort of way but other than that, this film is quite simply bad.

What happened is Friedberg and Seltzer. When they wrote Spy Hard and Scary Movie, they were great. Nothing idiotic, or pop-culture referenced.However, there is a major problem. They make parody films as spinoffs of Scary Movie. The first three were Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, and they were only cash cows to fit the benefit of parody films. Unfortunately, they suck! This is when Julia Jones got in rehab, Lucy, Edward, Susan, and Peter get their part-time job at McDonald's, and the homosexual Spartans were selling cocaine for the price of one.But, I digress. They were terrible, but their next project... was MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH worse! Hence is the name, Disaster Movie was born. Born to kill comedies.Seriously, why would it be successful? At least the name is correct. I mean, these films were critically panned, so why make this movie? Basically, it makes Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen look like Gone with the Wind, Epic Movie look like 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the ever-so-decent Space Chimps look like Star Wars.Well, this movie barely parodies Disaster movies, it parodies pop-culture references, pre-tween Family Guy-like jokes, and movies in other genres that don't have to do with Disaster-related films. I mean, in my school, the classmates are entertained on this film. Not me! The movie opens with a shot spoofing the one in Armageddon. In the year 10,001 B.C., a caveman runs away from a mammoth before getting in a fight with Wolf. He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse, who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008, revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull. The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will has a \"Sweet Sixteen\" party at his house, despite the fact that he's 25. Will has a dream where he is a Jumper and accidentally impales.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she's trapped under a statue, they run into Batman, who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it's closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills Speed Racer so they can hijack his car in the trunk and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will's dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive, including Kung Fu Panda, who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing \"his\" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into Beowulf, who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will's father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by The Guru Shitka, who tries to get Amy to \"tickle his pickle\". Then all the characters come sing a song about \"dating\" each other which sets of a chain (\"Disaster Movie Sex Song\"), ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.Generic plot-line for a parody film, hell, the jokes aren't even funny! I can't believe they would make this! Good news is, on Labor Day weekend, it bombed, making it 8th place at the box-office. Thank you, Tropic Thunder! You saved the day.I don't wanna know of what they're making next. Wait, Queen Kong??? Nooooooooooo! I don't wanna watch Disaster Movie again. I wanna watch WALL-E again. But, it may not be as bad as... *shudder* Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen or *EVEN MORE SHUDDER (with a facepalm)* Air Buddies franchise.FINAL VERDICT: 0/10!!!!!!!!",

I first saw the unbelievably hot Vanessa Minnillo in the TV show \"True Beauty\" and thought that she was pretty good in that. It is hard to believe that she went from the host of a TV reality show giving a good performance and then blew her credibility out the window by actually agreeing to participate in this garbage.

All of them were horrendous, but moderately successful in the box office. For the Labor Day weekend, they released their latest gem, Disaster Movie, in which they whipped up in a month. Please note that this was a spoof film that went through the entire production, without ever seeing the movie, only the trailers.The plot is very simple. Over the course of one evening, a group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events. A large problem with this is that there is no time for character development, and the viewer wouldn't care anyway due to the lack of stars in the movie. These events could be tornadoes, rabid chipmunks or just a random fistfight.I found it very difficult to believe that this movie was actually a true spoof on disaster movies and it is most likely to be spoofing movies from this summer. This movie doesn't even work as the traditional spoof movie does where it uses only one film, this movie much less interesting spoofs of movies that will be forgotten about in a few years, making this movie no longer relevant. They makers think they can get away with having some unoriginal character come on and off thirty seconds later. These include what if Batman was an idiot, or if Iron Man was crushed by a cow, or if the Hulk gets crushed by a cow. The material clearly isn't funny but it's trying to be which is the most important factor for this movie to fail miserably. Why have the same two actors play all of the parts, they're not fooling anyone.This movie is truly awful and unwatchable, which is not something I can often say about the movies I see. There should be no excuse for a comedy to have more hip hop dance (4) sequences than laughs.

It also had lame scenes with Batman, Iron Man, the Hulk, Prince Caspian, Kung Fu Panda, etc. It even has unflattering references to specific celebrities like Amy Winehouse, Miley Cyrus, Jessica Simpson, Sarah Jessica Parker and an unfortunate scene with Michael Jackson.

But as you might have noticed, I am quite a glutton for punishment that would even watch the most wretched movies of all time, and it was reason enough few months ago for finally watching it. Now I can go to the review.The movie begins with a scene parodying 10,000 AC where a caveman is squashed by a mammoth and then dragged on a pile of Mammoth fecal matter. Then he is attacked by a guy from AMERICAN GLADIATORS and an Amy Winehouse clone with fangs. Then he awakens and he has strange encounters with a dwarf and various celebrity clones. And basically, this is the rest of the movie. Countless parodys after another after another after another... and none of them made me even snicker!Most of the scenes were so random that you might wonder if the director gave directions or they just signed on a piece of paper some ideas and they used them in the way they wanted. Many of the jokes fell flat, and it was obvious that nobody wasn't even trying. Not even the various characters parodied in it (like Batman, Iron Man, Hellboy, Po the panda) couldn't save this disaster of a movie (at least the title is right). I have personally seen many movies with bad acting, and I can say that the acting here was too much to stomach even for me! I really can't think at this moment of a comedy that didn't make me laugh through the beginning to the end (apart from CAT IN THE HAT and BABY GENIUSES) but I have to put this at the top of the list.I really agree with 99% of the reviews here that this is only an esecrable excuse for making cheap laughs. It's crass, revolting, dumb (and I felt a bit stupider after it was finally over!), unfunny, horribly acted, horribly written, horribly directed and badly made that it looked like it was recut and pasted various times.

            "content": "Something rather peculiar happened today whilst watching the third (yes, count 'em, third) lethargic spoof movie of this year alone; something bizarre and surreal, and quite unlike anything that I have experienced before: I didn't laugh. Yes, that's right, no once, not a guffaw, not a smirk, smile or one instantaneous moment of amusement; nothing but agonising pain soared through my bones when watching this production line slice of spoof comedy regurgitated on screen from the liquefied brains of hack writers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Spearheaded with tired, overdone writing; predictably crass, shallow characters; a meaningless, lobotomised plot; mundane dialogue; dull, lazy, downright childish humour; lacklustre performances and the production value of a shoestring, Disaster Movie did eventually manage to provoke one moment of joy; when it was all over and I realised I could go home, far far away from the evil torture that had just unfolded in front of me.Like it's inept predecessors, this latest offering from dud-duo Friedberg and Seltzer has the writers rummaging through all of this year's biggest movies in search of something, no, anything to poke fun at in a demeaning manner as if these two actually know what they're talking about. From Iron Man to Sex and the City, Juno to 10,000BC, Disaster Movie takes time to incorporate a lot of titles into its murky waters to try and get a laugh from someone, no, anyone, and it's this transparent, kitschy appeal that eventually leaves the movie feeling lacking any value or substance. The saddest thing about the feature however lies in scenes where the writers go out of their way to directly and overtly mock several movies, yet in doing so end up making more of a mocking statement about themselves than of their targets.This misstep most firmly resonates during the many instances where Diablo Cody's Juno script is called into question by the writers, spoofing its quirky, culturally referential dialogue and trying to pass it on as pretentious and overwritten of all things. Of course, instead of achieving what any decent spoof does in managing to make you laugh at a movie even if you enjoyed it, Disaster Movie instead only achieves in demeaning itself to point of embarrassment. Throughout the feature I couldn't help but feel that maybe if Jason and Aaron spent as much time on their script as Diablo obviously did, then maybe, just maybe they'd manage to make people laugh rather than ask for their money back. The writers try to create laugh out loud parody, and they seem to think they're pretty good at it too, but, much like a bloated star, Disaster Movie ends up collapsing into itself under its own gravitational pull of overindulgent, sophomoronic, throwaway crap, resulting in a black hole void of any light, or signs of life.Of all the forms of comedy, the spoof is probably the easiest way in which to deliver a joke; its stand-up comedy on the big screen, joke after joke with little reliance on substantial narrative. So it goes without saying that even with such misgivings for any sort of coherent, well thought-out plot, and lacking any compelling, memorable characters whatsoever, as far as dumb spoof movies go, it should still be able to make you laugh regardless. Yet even here the movie goes in the completely wrong direction. Friedberg and Seltzer's earlier effort this year was similar; it was stupid and inept at telling any sort of meaningful tale, but it at least delivered some moments of laughter. Here however we have references slapped in lazily, all of which feel suspiciously like they've be written up after having seen the trailer, and not the full movie; there are no moments of relevancy and the writing constantly feels lazy and unremarkably indistinct from everything else. Often jokes will be dragged on and on incessantly and infuriatingly to the point where the initial disappointment of another bum-note turns into a cacophony of middling annoyance. Take for example an early jab at Hannah Montana (I wonder if anyone who goes to see this will have even seen her movie), as it is presented once, repeated again, and again and again; it isn't funny the first time and it certainly doesn't get any better from there on in. Then there's the same formula used with slapstick violence, and a caricature Amy Winehouse burping over and over like it's meant to be hilarious. No, it really isn't.Often I will find it hard to adequately review a comedy movie simply due to the fact that humour is one of the most subjective forms of entertainment there is. Yet leaving Disaster Movie and overhearing comments of how it was \"alright\" followed by the brave conclusions of \"but, it wasn't very funny\", I knew I wasn't alone. Indeed I would be surprised to find even the most immature, brain-dead of audiences enjoying this; I laughed at Superhero Movie, I laughed at Meet the Spartans\u0085 hell, I think I even cracked a smile during Epic Movie, but I didn't do anything during Disaster Movie. There's something to be said about a comedy that doesn't even raise one moment of laughter, never mind a spoof movie such as this which puts all of its chips on the line just to deliver the jokes. A perfect example of the market having a greater say over substance, Disaster Movie is a disaster, and the biggest catastrophe of the year.Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",

Unlike the same old hideous gags, the film makers got one thing right about this movie. It had the perfect title! Disaster Movie. Yes, it is a disaster. It's a disaster in so many various ways. In fact such a disaster that within the first 5 minutes of this film...I just couldn't take it anymore. It was just torture. I then switched to a different channel, relieving myself from the sheer disturbance I let my eyes and ears go through.Overall, if you're looking for a short definition of this trash - look no further than it's 2-worded title! It just simply says it all! And sorry for my rating, I couldn't rate it below 1 star. I would rather have gone for -10000!",

            "content": "\"Disaster Movie\" doesn't really have much of a plot but the film circles around the idea of the world coming to an end. It all starts off with the main character Will (Matt Lanter) who has a dream that he has traveled back to 10,001 B.C. and gets told by Amy Winehouse (yes I am serious) that the world is in fact going to end. Hilarity supposedly ensues\u0085 Every time I have seen a preview for a spoof movie over the past few years, I just cringed. The reason I cringe is because the movies are normally made by two of the 6 writers of Scary Movie. These two guys are known to the world as Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Some say that these two guys are children of Satan put on this earth to torture people with bad spoof movies and after seeing \"Disaster Movie\" I am almost ready to agree.The biggest problem with \"Disaster Movie\" is that it tries to parody too many movies in one film. The reason Friedberg and Seltzer suck as directors is because they don't understand what it takes to make a good spoof movie. If you look back on spoof movies, most of the classics have a core story line with a beginning, middle and an end, as well a primary genre they spoof. Look at \"Airplane!\", \"Naked Gun\", \"Blazing Saddles\", \"Young Frankenstein\", \"Hot Shots\", and \"Austin Powers\" for perfect examples.\"Disaster Movie\" along with all the other films Friedberg and Seltzer have directed does not use this simple formula. They spoof everything and anything from any genre in the hope that someone will chuckle. Think I am joking? \"Disaster Movie\" spoofs \"10,000 B.C.\", \"Juno\". Sex and the City\", \"Step Up 1 & 2\", \"Enchanted\", \"Wanted\", \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\", \"Kung Fu Panda\", \"The Happening\", \"Superbad\", \"Indiana Jones\", \"Batman\", \"Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\", \"Hellboy\", \"Iron Man\", \"Get Smart\", \"The Love Guru\", \"No Country for Old Men\", \"High School Musical\", \"American Gladiators\", \"Beowulf\", \"Jumper\" and \"Hancock\" all in less than 85 minutes. This is why this film doesn't work plus they try to spoof pop culture references like Amy Winehouse and Jessica Simpson to name a few.One would think that because they spoof so many things you would get a whole bunch of laughs even with no storyline. The sad truth behind this is that I laughed twice and I smiled twice in the whole 85 minutes. Most of the jokes fall so flat or are so \"out there\" that anyone who watches this is dumbfounded by 98% of all the jokes in the film. I think if Friedberg and Seltzer were writers on SNL, they would be great at making short little spoof skits however when it comes to making a feature length film these guys have no right at all to be sitting in a directors chair.In Conclusion, avoid this film at all costs. While it isn't as god awful as \"Date Movie\" or \"Meet the Spartans\" it is still a disaster in every aspect of the word. The storyline is moronic, 98% of the jokes fall flat, and the acting is less than average. Hopefully considering this film has officially flopped at the box office, Hollywood will take the hint and realize that people today are sick and tired of seeing crap like this. I have said this before and I will say it again, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be tied to a chair and beaten while being video taped. This is the only way at this point for them to apologize for all 4 feature films they have released. They have no business whatsoever directing or writing a film. I appreciate the fact they love movies but please leave movie making to those who have some talent.MovieManMenzel's final rating for \"Disaster Movie\" is a 2/10.",

            "content": "I guess the title already tells you everything you need to know about the movie. It is without a doubt a total disaster. I still find it quite amazing that writer directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer still managed to get funds to have their films made, after equally disastrous unfunny comedies such as Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans (OK, I shall unabashedly say that I enjoyed Date Movie), because while it's spoof after spoof, it certainly isn't cheap trying to replicate certain stuff, even if done laced with loads of cheese, or swede-d.Should there be a story linking everything little crazy thing together, then it would be Cloverfield, where a group of friends Will (Matt Lanter, whose left year I found strangely out of alignment with his right?), Calvin (G. Thang), Juney (Crista Flanagan), Lisa (Kimberly Kardashian) and the Enchanted Princess (Nicole Parker) journey to save Amy (Vanessa Minnillo) before getting themselves out of the city to escape some unknown and best forgotten natural calamity, where the threat of mankind is raining cows.The only merit I would give the filmmakers is how they went ballistic and stretched their imagination to milk every possible opportunity to script in some other movie, be it borrowing characters or premise. You'd probably lose count at the something-new-at-every-minute strategy, and frankly speaking, they're at best some skits which for the life of me, are totally unfunny. Nada, zilch, nothing to laugh about. I guess even kids will find the juvenile humour here a total turn off.Which is not strange, considering that even jokes were borrowed, and relied too heavily on the usual toilet humour, which is already so tired. While there are comedies which can be original, the pedigree of Friedberg and Seltzer, coming as scriptwriters for Scary Movie(s), would by now reinforce that they make poor stories and jokes from their lack of innovation. Being able to string together countless of movies is one thing, but making a genuine and workable comedy is another. Not having an established cast to star in your movie might stem from a modest budget to work with, but I'm likely to think that everyone approached, save for the relative no-names here, would not want to touch this even with a ten foot pole, just in case it really stinks and stain their filmography.I think it's even time for me to put a foot down and say No to Friedberg and Seltzer. The powers that be should really dry up the credit line that fuel their productions, and given some belt-tightening in the economy, hopefully this should be soon.",

As you watch you will go from sheer amazement that this was even made to complete disgust and boredom as you realize how truly unfunny these so called \"jokes\" are.Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have truly done something amazing. They have created a whole new breed of disgustingly mindless and low-brow entertainment unlike anything ever seen before. It's not a bad movie, because bad movies have stupid plots, bad characters, and bad acting; their movies have none of that. No plot, characterization, or acting exist in these black holes of all things mind-numbing.Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie, and this their crowning achievement of stupidity consist of nothing but stream-of-consciousness lowest-common-denominator jokes strung together in random order. Nothing is spoofed or lampooned; just mentioned and just in case you don't know what their referencing, the characters will shout out the name of whoever is being referenced that second (\"Hey, Iron Man!\").Within this disgusting framework Seltzer and Friedberg manage to top themselves in Disaster Movie with the all new \"trailer spoof.\" Characters are included from movies that came out just months or even weeks before the release of Disaster Movie; meaning they couldn't have seen these movies before including them, and you can tell. They won't even mention anything from the movies these characters appeared in, they will just have them appear for one second and then get sucked away by a tornado or something.The fact that these so called Spoof Movies continue to be made is an abomination. Either Seltzer and Friedberg have a ton of money to waste or there are enough people seeing these in the theater to keep them going. Both are frightening prospects, especially considering another of their collaborations is coming out soon. Hopefully movies like this will go the way of the dinosaur because it appears that the bar for mainstream entertainment is getting lower and lower.",

            "content": "\"Disaster Movie\" is the 4th movie that has been made by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Like \"Date Movie\", \"Epic Movie\", and \"Meet the Spartans\", this spoofs many blockbuster movies and pop culture figures of recent years. This time, the focus is on the \"disaster\" theme similar to \"The Day After Tomorrow\".Since 2006, Jason and Aaron, who first met while working on \"Scary Movie\", usually release one movie every year. This is actually the second movie they released this year.This is actually the second movie they released this year. At the beginning of this year in January, they did \"Meet the Spartans\", which opened at #1 and spoofed the entire script of \"300\". I saw that film and thought that it was going to be the worst movie of the year.After seeing this one, I can say \"Disaster Movie\" is quite possibly the worst movie ever. I mean, it really is the worst movie ever made and released. You can put it straight to DVD or Blu-ray, and it still wouldn't be funny. You can air it as a made-for-TV movie, and it still wouldn't be funny. You can make it into a TV show pilot, and it still wouldn't get picked up. You can even get \"MAD TV\" canceled by including this as one of their skits.What throws the whole movie is that the jokes are continuous every 4 seconds and never have any humor. Every time you think they will forget something, they end up spoofing it. They actually try to spoof every movie made this year. And they even try to include every TV character and celebrity in their jokes. It just doesn't amuse, and it just doesn't quit. They really have no idea of when to quit.But the real reason why the jokes aren't funny is that it's inaccurate, overused, and butchered poorly. They spoof \"High School Musical\" with the main characters, and they poorly spoof Gabriella as a cheerleader, which she never was. They spoof \"Kung Fu Panda\", an animated movie, using a robot panda that looks like a panda in the real world. The performance they did with \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" will give you so many nightmares, you would rather the 2007 version over this movie. The idea to use a male actor to play Carrie Bradshaw in the \"Sex & The City\" spoof is too desperate, too obvious, and worst of all, so wrong. And the other jokes used have been used already in their other movies, used already in other spoof movies, and are too old to even try and would have been used at the appropriate time.This movie doesn't even spoof disaster films in general, unless if you can find any real \"Cloverfield\" spoofs. Some of the spoofs aren't actually in the movie and rather used as promotional ads. All they try to do is give many films and A-list Hollywood stars the roasting they \"deserve\". In reality, they destroy the \"parody film\" genre again and with more damage that a lot of people would rather stop making fun of them in movies like this. Normally, you can actually expect a film parody to be declared the worst movie ever by many people. But I guarantee that there is not and will not ever be a movie as worse as this one.",

These were the movies that not only made us laugh but made us want to watch the films they lampooned over again. But these types of film can't always guarantee to entertain us. Put in the hands of the wrong people you end up with forgettable disasters like \"Silence of the Hams\" and \"Chicken Park\" but in recent years Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have completely destroyed the genre for everyone with their tired, overused jokes, immature gross out \"humour\", homophobic/racist/sexist stereotypes and their obsession with belittling celebrities and capitalizing on every major film of the year.But Disater Movie is Friedburg's and Seltzer's worst film yet (I say \"yet\" because, sadly they have more \"ideas\" for future parody films). Now, I confess, I have only seen the first half hour of this film, which I consider an achievement because even the opening scene caused me to be severe pain. I had low hopes for this film in the first place so I waited for it to air on TV to avoid paying to see this garbage. However, as low as my expectations were I found that they were still too far high.The opening scene in a pathetic 10,000 BC parody that targets Amy Winehouse. Now, I'm no fan of Winehouse but even I get angry when I see stuff like this making light of her drug and alcohol problem. Yes it easier to laugh at someone like this than it is to actually help them but this whole \"joke\" goes too far. But then Friedburg and Seltzer take a break from insulting Winehouse to insulting the viewer but having Winehouse letting out a long 30 second or so burp followed by a series of shorter burps which is supposed to make us say \"Oh that is so clever. Every time I thought she was finished burping she let out another one. Oh Friedburg and Seltzer, you are truly comic geniuses\" but instead we end up screaming out \"OK, she burps. We get it already! ENOUGH!!!\" Next we are treated to a party scene that lampoons \"No Country for Old Men\", \"Wanted\" \"High School Musical\" \"Juno\" and \"Superbad\" (How these films could be considered disaster movies is beyond me), during which we see Carmen Electra playing the same character she has played in every other \"Movie\" film, a random wrestling scene that was supposed to be \"sexy\", a few more attacks on celebrities, seemingly endless homophobic/racist/sexist jokes, gross out \"humour\" a musical number that makes the songs from \"Grease 2\" worthy of a Grammy in comparison and then, after a half hour of pointless, mindless drivel do we start to see the parodies of disaster films, which includes bikini-clad women for some reason, Hancock hitting his head on a lamppost, a cow landing on Ironman (characters hitting their head on or being crushed by something is used in every other Friedburg and Seltzer movie, and it wasn't funny the first time either) and then Hannah Montana being crushed by a meteorite, in which we see a repeat on the Amy Winehouse burp scene only this time Hannah Montana dies, comes back to life to say something, dies, comes back to life to say something else, dies again and it just goes on like that...and that is when I stopped watching.After sitting through just half an hour of this rubbish I was left asking once more how Friedburg and Seltzer are able to continue making more of these films? Yes, they maybe wildly popular with immature teenagers but surely they must be losing the studio money? These movies offer nothing new, there is no real story structure, no character development, awful acting, jokes you can see coming a mile off which are dragged out and outstay their welcome (if they were welcomed in the first place) and 6 months down the track you can expect to see the DVD copy for 50 cents in a cheap shop or sold along with a more popular movie. Hell, if I was even offered this movie for free I'd consider that offer a rip off.So in closing the only thing I can say to Friedburg and Seltzer is \"OK, WE GET IT!!! ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!",

I get the feeling that the makers got high on something and just threw whatever came to mind into the script, figuring the audience would be too dumb to understand. These people should be banned from ever making another film and kept away from all movie cameras. I managed to sit through a total of 15 minutes and felt like I should wash my eyes and brain out with bleach to get rid of the memory. Terrible doesn't begin to describe it.",

The gags then, which by the way are really just a series of pop culture references, are long winded (like I said, they take several minutes), disgusting (bodily fluids and whatnot), outdated (the movie feels very old just five years after release), and plain unfunny.

The script is very badly written, and the film very badly directed. If it was directed that is, because it just seems that a load of scenes have been thrown together to create a clumsy, incoherent mess.

To make a film satirizing whatever pop-culture is current, it isn't enough just to string together a bunch of skits imitating those pop-culture icons. Each parody must not only imitate, but caricature the icon, whether it be a person, a particular movie, a hot toy, or whatever. It must be able to point out the absurdity of popularism while still being, in and of itself, funny as well. I can go around with a giant clock on a chain around my neck and use Blackjack gum to make myself look as if I have bad teeth, but if I don't also have something both original AND funny to say about Flava Flav, then I am merely an imitator, not a satirist.These filmmakers may have hit it big with prior efforts, but this one was clearly phoned in. What is sad is that the bulk of the movie is so sadly, embarrassingly bad, that when the one or two genuinely funny moments occur (one character \"bends\" a bullet a little too much and it hooks around 360 degrees, hitting the person he was trying to avoid anyway) the audience is so stunned they forget to laugh, as if asking themselves if they really did see something genuinely funny or was so much of their intelligence already sucked away by this toilet of a movie that they are imagining humor where it doesn't really exist? It is wicked hard to get a genuinely original and entertaining film made in Hollywood these days, bad form by these filmmakers to take money that could well have gone into a much better project and squandering it on this four reels of rubbish!",

I wanted to hurt the projectionist for even so much as showing the film, because by screening it that day, he made everybody in that theatre dumber and angrier. There is no plot in the film so to speak, and the jokes are stretched out for painfully long periods of time in order to compensate for the fact that without them, the film would be no more than a glorified television ad. It basically is a glorified television ad in its final form, but nothing more. The fact that people actually gave these untalented hacks money to make something that they probably knew wouldn't be any good is proof that the world is going downhill.

They were good up until the extraordinarily unfunny Date Movie came out and they've been dreadful ever since. The first two Scary Movies were great and hilarious but recent spoofs such as Meet The Spartans and Superhero Movie are quite simply awful. And now here's Disaster Movie from Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the writers/directors of Meet The Spartans. They obviously realise that their films aren't exactly critically acclaimed but they seem to have some strange thought that we, the public, enjoy their films. I wonder if they'd still think that if they saw that on IMDb, 85.3% of 12,687 voters rated this film 1/10. Hm....maybe we hate their films and don't want them to be made! Despite my little rant there, I'm going to admit that I did laugh a few times throughout Disaster Movie. Most of the jokes are terrible and made me want to stop watching but some are genuinely funny. In the scene where the chipmunks from Alvin And The Chipmunks appear, I cringed and thought the film couldn't get worse but when they started head banging and singing a rock song I couldn't help but laugh.Some scenes in Disaster Movie do tend to drone on. For example, the High School Musical spoof sequence during the party is unnecessarily long and tedious. Also, the part where Hannah Montana is stuck under an asteroid is funny at first but the joke wares on and on to the point where I was thinking \"GET ON WITH THE FILM!\" One thing that I noticed about the film is that the writers seem to be desperate to cram in as much movie spoofs as possible in the hope that they can gain a laugh. However, the amount spoofed is strangely annoying and frustrating. And the very loose plot pretty much disappears and is pushed aside for more film references.It may be funny at some points but Disaster Movie lives up to its title. I give it 2/10.",

My expertise on movies derives from the sole fact that I've seen so many, and usually keep up on most current flicks. I also don't write reviews like this often.However, sometimes I see a movie that is so incredibly awful, that I can no longer hold my tongue. This is a perfect example of such a creation. There are so many negatives to focus on, there's no way I'll get through them all before I suffer a massive brain aneurysm, as I nearly did watching this pathetic excuse of a motion picture.If you see Carmen Electra in ANY movie these days, you can bet it's going to be total crap (I wasn't even a fan of the Scary Movie series, so my opinion may be biased to some of you). She had a part in \"Meet the Spartans\" as well, which is easily tied with this monstrosity as \"Worst Movie of 2008\", possibly even the decade. Kim Cardashian is in this movie! Enough said. Vanessa Minnillo? Yeah, she's pretty. Just continue with that. The abundance of tight female abs, bras, boobs and overall sex appeal wasn't at all, in any way shape or form enough to make this movie even a small fraction more tolerable.The cameos were lame. The impersonations were half-assed and done by actors/actresses that don't at all resemble the person they were hired to imitate.This movie also seems to revolve around characters getting squashed by random objects falling from the sky. That's not funny in most scenarios anyway. Imagine that same occurrence being thrown at you several times throughout a movie. Each time, prefaced and followed by some lackluster line delivered by a poor actor/actress.There's ONE positive I can think of, and that's the Juno character, whose name is Juney, played by Crista Flanagan. I found that character to be funny AT TIMES, but that's because I'm highly sarcastic myself and find such humor amusing.The general spoofs throughout are uninspired, clich\u00e9, and poorly executed.There were several musical parts in the movie as well. I don't enjoy such things in movies most would consider good. To add them to a movie as atrocious as this, and make them as pathetic as the rest of the movie, is flat out torture for all viewers.I'm nearing the fabled aneurysm I spoke of earlier, so I'll stop, as I did with this movie one hour into it. No, I didn't finish it, and if any of you have an ounce of dignity, you'll do the same, or not watch it at all.I don't feel I need to provide you with any other evidence to contribute to your decision to not watch this.

Does anyone over-see the writing process and say \"Hey, how about a story with more of a disaster movie premise driving everything?\" Or \"How about something actually funny?\"Context: Yes, I have seen every prerequisite movie or TV item being referenced, so it's not like I don't get it. Some of those items were themselves a waste of time and attention, and it's not like these filmmakers have much to say about them anyway. They have nothing to say about disasters, about movies nor about disaster movies.I saw this movie on-line for free and I still feel owed something for the time it cost me. If it gets a 1 out of ten the single nugget of goodness might be the marketing. The posters did a great job in promising something that might be the last word on the Disaster Movie genre. The Irwin Allen era was pretty much covered by Airplane! Funny thing that. . .even young viewers who haven't seen Airport '77 let alone Zero Hour GET Airplane! and laugh with it. So it's not even a generational thing. This movie could have explored the late 90's preoccupation with the end. I have wanted to do something about competing asteroids reminiscent of Deep Impact and Armegeddon, certainly there is room for Titanic, Poseidon and various versions possibly clashing. One thing you EXPECT from that kind of premise is built-in tension. But Disaster Movie has none, mainly because it doesn't bother laying out any story really. It reminds me of kids with their first video camera running around and being this and being that - one pop culture reference after another - except without the charm. This is not a Mad TV or SNL skit fest either. Disaster Movie is the worst thing this team has come out with. It is bad in a why bother sort of way. They start with a spoof about 10, 000 B.C. merely because that is a current movie. It's not a hook or inciting incident or insight into the lead character. A prehistoric man of sorts gets stopped by someone referencing a Gladiator TV show, so they fight and \"Amy Winehouse\" pops up and burps for awhile. It's like each scene has the feeling that someone said \"Okay, pad the running time.\" Imagine the most inept and uninformed improv group taking suggestions from an audience full of ten year-olds. Then imagine someone filmed that and got it into thousands of theaters. Disaster Movie does not play as a movie at all except in two scenes - or maybe I should call them beats: Out of nowhere, someone poorly imitating a fad pop singer is apparently killed and someone says, \"She was a national treasure.\" Or a Manhatten loft modeled after the party scene of Cloverfield is full of young preppy types listening to radio or TV (which provides most of the movie's claim to disaster theme relevance) and a reporter says something like, \"The ghetto has just been destroyed. But we're okay about that.\" That's the extent of the movie's edge. The movie insults Juno and Sex and the City without having anything valid to say about them. Diablo Cody's dialog sounds even better now after hearing some hack(s) attempt it. I mean, spoofing a comedy is uninspired enough. But someone (Is David Zucker still credited as having something to do with them? Tell me no) should tell them that having a character simply show up isn't a comment, a satire, a spoof, nor much of a reference to that character. Whichever actors IMDb lists as playing many walk-ons in different costumes haven't given the estate of Peter Sellers anything to worry about. In fact, they haven't given Leslie Neilsen and Charlie Sheen anything to worry about. Except that certain suits may decide spoofs are \"bad box office\" now, and for a few years, without looking at how this unnecessary marketing project came to be and why it fails. Now seriously before watching this be sure to watch No Country for Old Men, Juno, Cloverfield, Iron Man, Indiana Jones, Batman, High School Musical, Sex and the City, Armageddon, and even lesser movies like Jumper and LOTS of disposable TV not as preparation to understand this movie but so you won't be able to spare the 80 minutes or whatever it is that I sadly lost watching it.I don't mind having to take more time to compose this blurb if it will spare one other human being this example of splintered fingernails on the chalkboard of cinema.",

I wanted to leave almost 5 times during the movies. The actors were horrible. I could play better roles handicapped and blind.This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I recommend you don't watch this movie at all. You'd be happier in the dark corner of your room by yourself while depressing music plays in the background.",

            "content": "Curse my curiosity of all things cinematic. I really was not expecting this to be a good film, and there was no way I was going to go and actually pay money for this after enduring the mind numbing snooze-fests that were Meet The Spartans and Epic Movie, so I just watched a pirated copy of this film on the internet to simply see how bad these films can possibly get.The answer is pretty god damn bad indeed. Even in films I don't really enjoy I still try to look for positives, especially when reviewing, to attempt to give a balanced and fair account. Keeping this in mind, you will have to excuse me if this review comes out a bit rant-like but there are no good points to speak of and the rest of this post will consist of me slating this film in as many ways as I can think of at the minute. Honest to god I cannot think of one thing about this film I thought was well done or enjoyed.First off the plot. I even hesitate to call it a plot as I feel it would be an affront to all other plots in every other film that exists. Apparently some guy called Will has a dream that the world is going to end because of a crystal skull for some reason, then his girlfriend leaves him, the world begins to end but of course he is still in love with her so he goes to rescue her and stop the world from being destroyed. I will pause here and just leave a line before I continue for you to all grimace in disgust at this awful clich\u00e9d concept for a story.Done? Good, I shall go on. None of the massive gaping plot holes are explained such as why things come to life in a museum, why the world is ending because a skull is not on a table or why I sat through the entirety of this disjointed mess of a film. In a lot of comedy films though, the story is not meant to be incredibly absorbing, and merely serves as a mechanism to move the audience from one contextual joke to another. Disaster Movie seems to attempt this, but because none of the jokes are funny, it falls flat on its face with a nice loud crunch.I am frankly insulted to be the target demographic of this film, being a teenage white male, as the humour is...well it just isn't humour. Throughout the whole hour and half of this I smirked (not even laughed) a massive total of once. It is the same tired, drawn out old jokes from the last few outings of the Dumb and Dumber of the directing world, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. As far as I can tell there are essentially two jokes in this film. Somebody gets hit a lot but is OK for some reason, and the princess character is a whore. That's it. The fact that these two retarded hacks seem to think this is actually funny defies all plausible logic. Either that or they both have the mental age of 3 and wet themselves with excitement whenever they play peekaboo with their carers.The idea behind this film is supposed to be that it parodies recent films, making fun of them. Disaster Movie mustn't have a very good sense of balance because even in this simple task, where the characters and potential material is pretty much laid out for them by the original film makers, it yet again falls onto its already battered and bloodied face.Lets get this straight, there is a very distinct difference between parodying something and merely making mention of it or having a celebrity or character walk on the screen for no apparent reason to deliver a pointless flat and totally unrelated \"joke\". Guess which one Disaster Movie does predominantly? If you guessed parodying you are seriously not getting the tone of this review are you? Yep I think good ol' Jason and Aaron may have had a bet or wager of some kind with a person who worked on the previous film that was something along the lines of \"Lololol I bet we cans get moar celebrity peoples into this film than Meat The Spartons!\". This lead to the barrage of completely unnecessary and unfunny pop culture references that plagued my monitor for 90 minutes. None of them made sense! Alvin and the chipmunks appeared in a building singing deth metal and then proceeded to kill Juno. And that was one of the more coherent scenes of this film.I could go on ranting about the acting that is so wooden you could make a coffee table out of it or the shockingly awful and cheap looking special effects but I don't think I have enough venom left to spit at this turd sandwich of a movie to do justice to just how bad they are. If you didn't know anything about this film I took a bullet for you guys on this one, you owe me! This film is terrible avoid it like the bubonic plague.Oh and please for the love of God do not go to see it! Stop giving these jack offs money and they might get the idea that everybody hates them and their films.",

Here, they aim at modern 'disaster' movies such as Cloverfield, and other none disaster related films like Juno, The Chronicles of Narnia, No Country for Old Men and superhero films (which was already done earlier in the year!) like Iron Man, Hellboy 2 and The Dark Knight. While it doesn't do a particularly better job of it than that film, at least the send ups here of these films are a bit more recent and relevant and not just on Spiderman all the time. Some care seems to have gone into the Hellboy and IM costumes, so it's weird how sloppy and awful the Batman costume is. Likewise, a lot of the actors playing the roles look nothing like who they're supposed to be playing, so it's hard to crack a smile at their material. The makers, in all fairness, have been very thorough and have been sure to send everything they can think up, so it's even more of a big blow that hardly any of it is funny at all, least of all an unpleasant scene involving chewing glass. I was tempted to walk out at least once, but I did chuckle once or twice so maybe you will too. **",

            "review_title": "Why Disaster Movie is Bad",
            "content": "As a small time movie producer adviser, most movies that was made were made in a hurry. That means the story was written on the fly. Xanadu was one disaster where the writing occurred only after the movie was produced. Then there is political war where the head of the production team or director calls all the shots and the argument about production deadlines. Sure there are deadlines, if you got a good script. Things kind of get out of hand when it becomes a dictatorship during movie production. The only way to prevent this is they have to first get a good title, which they did. Second a good premise to the movie (a believable one). Third a good plot outline, which they did to an extent. Next step is the storyboard which they skipped. Then there's the most important make or break editing, which they skipped almost entirely. A lot of scenes of the movie which is roughly 1 hour and 28 minutes if we just eliminated those scenes that didn't relate to the story line a lot goes down the trash. Therefore why you won't like the movie has a lot to do with the fact that almost the entire movie had nothing to do with the disaster. The disaster only took less then 5 minutes of the entire movie's one hour and a half. Scenes relating to disaster or near that took about 20 minutes. The rest of the bulk are scenes you wouldn't want to watch anyway. These are the scenes that should have been removed because it had nothing to do with the movie: 1,000,000 B.C. scene, Woman vampire singing with the caveman, Chipmunks singing Christmas Music, Pregnant Teenager scenes can be eliminated entirely, the guru in a marriage ceremony completely remove, a long 15 minute teen party can be removed completely - had absolutely nothing to do with disasters, Hannah Montana scene, Woman Wrestlers, Tennis Shoe Telepone, Enchanted princess. Now what's missing is the Disaster movie Genre that has not even been shown: Day After Tomorrow, Al Gore (Global Warming), 2012, Nostradamus, Merlin the Magician, Mother Shipton, History Channel, Poseidon, War of the Worlds, Armageddon, Sinking of Japan, for example were not parodied at all. The basic theme of the movie is the core that keeps the entire genre in one piece isn't even in there or can't be seen, which should follow more closely, for example Day After Tomorrow, and from there we throw in Twisters, Tsunamis, and other genre together. and perhaps the movie's ending should be something akin to there's no end of the world, so the schedule is move up to another date,as in Jehovah's witness. Basically the production house has forgotten a few principles, one major one is unavoidable: the movie before any production should be limited to a small play before a live audiences, as in High school or other appropriate place to get people's response before going any further. It won't cost much. So why has Disney made so many home runs? Simple: it required them a year to write a good story before production even starts. The one major mistake is that they simply allow scenes totally unrelated to the title of the movie. The second mistake is they fail to parody disasters. Sure they may have parody some movie characters, but it was unrelated to the disaster movie genre. So before making a movie, they simply need to compile the list of DISASTER MOVIES that needed to be parodied. But the main focus of a success is actually the organization. If the story process is not democratically decide, it's going to fail because the market is basically decided democratically. The more the people like the better the box office. Schedules of writing should not be part of the production process, otherwise the deadlines simply kill the story. And there's plenty of writers we can find over the net to make a good story anyway. So why put writing team as part of the production schedule? You don't need to. Just get a small competition and then use those materials.",

We were victimized into watching this abomination by my fianc\u00e9's 11 year old son and his buddy. If any good came out of it, it was that they were so p*ssed off at how stupid this movie was that perhaps they will listen the next time they insist on seeing such a useless piece of garbage.Besides the fact that the \"parodies\" were not funny, they were sloppily piece-mealed together. It was painfully obvious that the idiots who hatched this idea had a checklist of people or movies they thought were good targets, so they just randomly tossed together an endless series of unfunny, unrelated cultural references. As I said, it was so bad it was almost surreal.I am hesitant to say this or any other movie is the worst movie ever made - but to put it in perspective, think of the worst porn movie you have ever seen - without the naked people - that is the caliber of writing and acting you have here.

People will watch this anyway because they think it's some kind of train-wreck. Guess what - it's not even that.This massive waste of time and money is just an array of unfunny jokes, without a consistent plot or charismatic protagonists. I can promise you right now that you won't laugh even once about any of the missing punchlines. Even worse, those wannabe-jokes are drawn out much too long. What is not funny in twenty seconds doesn't get funnier if it's stretched to three minutes. The best example is probably the Chipmunk scene. They sing a happy Chipmunk Christmas song. Then they sing another happy Chipmunk song. And then their eyes become bloodshot and they turn into monster versions of the Chipmunks (ruining the movie for that handful of three-year-olds that actually laughed at the feces jokes) and they growl some sort of satanic death metal trash. For what feels like five minutes. Without any additional jokes thrown in. And that's supposed to be the punchline.Hollywood once was able to make wonderful parody movies. Airplane! Spaceballs. Hot Shots 2. Those directors really made an effort and actually delivered one good joke after another, some of them based on a popular movie, others just funny because of their sheer absurdity. But I guess some producers realized that you don't need quality. Just pump 18 millions out of the 20 million budget into the promotion of your massive waste of celluloid, and you won't get awards or good reviews, but by the time this hits the video stores, at least you'll make a profit.Oh, and one word of advice for those that expect a superhero parody based on the trailer: Hulk, Iron Man, Batman and Hellboy have a combined screen time of under one minute.",

And that was pretty much it.You know a movie is bad when Vanessa Minillo and Kim Kardashian should actually be ashamed of being in it. Kim K. has been in porn with more depth than this. The pictures of Vanessa Minillo and Lindsay Lohan holding knives to each other's throats is infinitely more interesting than this stupid movie. Maybe it would have helped if I were a teenager, but sadly enough I still got almost every reference they were going for. And none of it was funny. At least we can all rest easy that these two directors currently have no projects listed as being in production. This film appeared to have lost money while their others actually turned a profit. Perhaps they can fool the general public no longer. Here's a thought.... next time something like this comes out that you folks know will be bad, DO NOT PAY TO GO SEE IT!

You know, things that make people laugh. Even one would be good.This film references an awful lot of films. Practically none of them are disaster movies. This film has more or less no budget at all, so the \"disasters\" in question comprise shaking the camera and flinging a few polystyrene boulders around. There is an interminable musical number at the end during which a number of people pretend to be other people they don't look anything like.This is one to avoid.",

What I do liked were the songs being sang when they were laughing with High School Musical. And face it, Carmen Electra and Kim Kardashian are only in it for their body in which they do the best way they can, cleavage!After all, his can only be watched after necking some brewskies or at a party with a lot of friends but to take it seriously therefore it's a disaster.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 1/5 Comedy 1/5",

            "content": "I'm going to start off my review saying that I don't normally give movies 1 star. I'm not one of those people that goes around giving a 1 to any movie that I even sort of disliked. Nay, to get a 1 on my scale, a movie has to be truly awful. And this... this is.Sitting through the movie is literally painful. Each cheap scatological joke and celebrity reference is like a stab to the chest, and by 10 minutes in, that's about 82,000 stabs to the chest. The movie eats away at you, until you're actually considering killing yourself to stop the pain that you're in. Every minute, it just gets worse and worse, until you're ready to smash your head through the TV you're watching it on.But, I was saved. After what felt like eight hours of mind-bogglingly bad \"jokes\", my DVD player shut down, saying it was \"unable to read disc\". Now, normally, I would be angry, restart the DVD player, and watch from the scene it shut down on. But, this... this had to be a sign. The DVD player had to be saving me the agony of the last few minutes of this awful thing that they pass off as a film. After a few minutes of thanking my DVD player, I decided it was my mission to get on any site I could and warn people to get as far as possible away from any copy of \"Disaster Movie\" you see.Seriously. In the hour or so I sat through, there was not one joke. No, there were only cheap knockoffs of celebrities and movie characters, agonizingly long dance scenes and burp jokes, and \"kicked in the nuts\" scenes.And it's not just the \"humor\" that's bad about this movie. Every aspect of the movie is so despicably awful, I would expect better film-making from an amnesiac turtle that had climbed on top of a video camera and accidentally turned it on. I don't expect Oscar-winning performances in these things, but oh my god. I've sat through movies like \"Suburban Sasquatch\" (watch some clips) and even the acting in that seems better in comparison. The actors being passed off as characters and celebrities are god-awful and do not share a remote resemblance to the people they're pretending to be. Seriously, I would have no idea who they were if the directors didn't point it out to me at least three times during the joke. \"Hey look, it's Wolf from American Gladiators\". Alright, it's Wolf. \"Yes, that's right, I'm Wolf from American Gladiators\". Alright... we get it. But, then they repeat the fact that it's Wolf from American Gladiators over and over and over until you're just about ready to scream at the screen, \"WE GET IT, GET ON WITH IT!\" I could go on and on about how bad this movie was. I could go on and on about how many times they shove the same joke down your throat time and time again (saying Juno talks strange every time she says a sentence is NOT funny). I could complain about the special effects. Or the costumes. Or the fact that they still think Michael Jackson jokes are funny. Or the fact that they actually take jokes word-for-word from other movies and pass them off as their own. Or I could complain about the sad state of comedy, and how angry it makes me that hordes of high teenagers think this is funny. But I won't.Because I figure they put so little work into this piece of trash, I should put even less work into writing my review. I BEG of you, do not buy, rent or come near \"Disaster Movie\". Because if it makes more money, they'll make more of them. And soon, after \"Twilight Movie\" and \"Movie Movie\", BAM our society will look like it did in \"Idiocracy\". Do you want to cause the end of civilization as we know it? No? Well, then don't give Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg a cent of your hard-earned money. DON'T SEE DISASTER MOVIE.And to people that say \"well, you didn't see the whole movie, you can't review it\", you obviously haven't seen it. They were \"parodying\" movies that HAD NOT EVEN COME OUT YET. So, if they can watch trailers of upcoming movies, retread the jokes and call it a movie, I can watch most of the movie, rant about it, and call it a review. I'm done. This movie makes me mad.",

A movie so funny it makes The Shining look like Some Like it Hot. Not good. Many times I had to hide my face in my sweater cause it was so embarrassing to watch. All scenes with \"Juno\" (A very good movie by the way), the fight involving Carmen Electra, the High School Musical-scene, Hannah Montana, the main character couple and the chipmunks made me scream \"make it stop!\" inside. In fact, the only thing bearable to watch was some of the scenes with the enchanted princess. Nicole Parker was the least awful in the cast. Speaking of Nicole Parker, the Mad-TV cast should be able to get better roles than this (heck, ANYONE should get better roles than this!). I've seen spoofs in their show where they are absolutely hilarious! People who can be absolutely hilarious shouldn't be in Disaster Movie.

            "content": "Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans and Superhero Movie, three movies with two things in common. They were all made by somebody with something or other to do with Scary Movie, you know those reasonably amusing spoofs that were good fun before they exhausted the franchised long ago. And the fact that all three of them are steaming piles of garbage with out a giggle, a smirk or even a roll of the eye obviously funny between them. To be fair Superhero Movie wasn't horrendous, it was just bland and uninspired, however Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans are the two worst movies I have ever seen. Spartans particularly being so bad that I really did almost walk out. The first trailers for Disaster Movie looked worse than Spartans, in fact when I first saw the trailer I was horrified. Then it got released, destroyed by the critics and I assumed I would never have to watch it. Alas my friends forced me to see it, and now I sit before you about to say something I never thought I would say. Disaster Movie is not the worst movie ever made! In fact in terms of quality its at least three times as good as Spartans. A shame to say a lump of dog poop is three times better than Spartans, so we aren't exactly talking quality. Disaster Movie is better than Spartans because its spoofs at times can be reasonably smirksome, nothing will make you laugh, but there are a few clever quotes here and there. Still it really is a bad movie, the jokes most of them time are just obvious references, most introductions of a spoof begin with the line \"look its (insert celebrity name here)\", and then we get to watch that celebrity either get hit, fall over or get poo wiped on there face, in some circumstances all three at once. The jokes are hardly inspired either, the Sex and the City joke just being a disaster (no pun intended), and why bother doing the exact same foot scene from Zohan when it was a lot funnier in Zohan? Thankfully the Alvin sequence sort of redeems it a bit, and a bit spoofing Jumper and Prince Caspian ending in a great line, \"it's the guy who ruined Star Wars.\" So onto the acting. Spartans was a horrible movie to watch, and one of the major reasons for this was that not a single damned actor deserves to live after that movie. When Carmen Elektra comes out as the best actress in the movie you realise there is something horribly wrong. Disaster Movie to be fare works a tiny bit better because the actors don't make you want to slit your wrists repeatedly. They're by no means good, most of the main cast seemingly having wandered off the streets just to do random spoof lines. Matt Lanter, as I suppose the lead, is vaguely charismatic, although I unfortunately spent half the movie trying to figure out where I had seen him in before, he's in Heroes for those who care. He seems like he could deliver a pun if given the right material anyway. Crista Flanagan is probably the best, doing a half decent Juno impression and featuring the best scene in the movie where she gets to say overly smart things for random sake. Carman Elektra makes her rudimentary appearance, yes she still looks nice, no she still can't act, and no her brief Wanted spoof is not funny. The rest of the cast don't really matter. The woman playing the princess from Enchanted works occasionally, and then doesn't at other times.So what is funny about the movie? Well you can count what is funny on one hand. The Alvin sketch is funny for a brief time, its way too overdone and very annoying come the end. The Juno talking bit is relatively funny. The line about Star Wars made me smirk a bit too smugly for my own good. The final song, god only knows why, was relatively smirksome, and to be honest that's really it. So what really isn't funny at all? The Michael Jackson sketch, god only knows why we're still doing Michael Jackson sketches now, any scene with a random pop celebrity, whether it be Amy Winehouse or Hannah Montana, any scene with a superhero getting hit, any scene with anybody getting hit, any scene featuring poo, any scene featuring high school musical dances. So in general the rest of the movie. Thankfully the movie is better made than the others. The score at times not being half bad, and the sets being half decent.Anyway now to stop justifying the movies existence. Its rubbish, for the love of god do not go and watch it. I'm just being polite because its better than I expected. But do something more fun with your time, like poking yourself in the eye repeatedly.",

From then on it was into pure profit. \"Disaster Movie\" will certainly make even more money overseas. On those terms alone \"Disaster Movie\" alone is a successful movie.I paid money to see this dreck. (Well, kind of. I have a pass that, for a monthly fee, allows me to see unlimited movies at a particular cinema chain.) You may have paid money to see \"Disaster Movie\" as well, and so you should. No pirate DVD's here, thank you very much. We are responsible for potentially more rubbish like \"Disaster Movie\" being inflicted on the world. I apologize deeply and humbly. I hope you do to.\"Disaster Movie\" is almost totally awful. (Almost totally awful? OK. I admit that for a microsecond a slight smile played across my lips at one of the \"Juno\" jokes, but that could just have easily been a small belch.) \"Disaster Movie\" is a terrible movie. A piece of cinematic poo. A textbook case of how not to make a comedy in the Noughties.Magnificently unfunny. Obvious, witless, stupid, crass, vile and so very, very bad. Not bad in a good way.

I saw a man who looked like he had eaten his own tongue in horror at what he had just seen. When I got home after seeing \"Disaster Movie\", I rushed into the shower to wash off the smell. My Girlfriend noticed it. She said to me, \"Have you just seen 'Disaster Movie'?\"Amazingly \"Disaster Movie\" is worse than \"Meet The Spartans\" and worse than \"Superhero Movie\". At least the latter had Pamela Anderson in a Fantastic Four outfit.I would say that sometimes it is worthwhile seeing a real stinker of a movie, because that can help you appreciate the gems even more.

The movie is only 1 hour and 15 minutes long, which is kind of strange for a modern movie, its very short, why do you think it was so short? because they couldn't think of anymore jokes to fill in time. Seltzberg had ran out of jokes and couldn't even pad time out with actual plot or character development(the main characters are introduced by just appearing on screen in a fully formed stereotype) which would have made the movie a little(not much) better. no they just padded it out by dragging the joke out till they couldn't keep it up any longer and dragging the musical interludes out to the fullest, there is no actual tangible plot to base the skits around, the plot is just a backdrop, to show the different skits and celebs with different background scenery so the audience don't get bored. the acting is terrible, the script is terrible, the characters had no depth or real like-ability unless you are fond of stereotyped clich\u00e9d characters and ar'nt developed in any way, the directing is terrible. that's why its still stuck at the bottom in the IMDb list, because its probably the worst modern movie ever made.",

Don't come near me if you actually LIKED the film, I might snatch your eyes out and forbid you from watching movies ever again.\"Disaster Movie\" gives us a birds eye view of what's happening to Hollywood these days - harebrained sluts and ho-bags are taking over the movie industry, producing these cheap, recycled, swallowed-and-then-vomited movies which insults the intelligence of 45% of the human race.What I'm trying to say here is, if you actually find the movie well-written and downright hilarious, there must be something wrong with you. \"Disaster Movie\" doesn't have a plot, no comprehensible characters, no tangible conclusion... it's as shapeless as gas. It doesn't have a destination, it loiters on triviality, and the so-called \"Disaster\" goes nowhere.Comedy Value There's only ONE scene which actually made me crack a smile. The Carrie Bradshaw and Juno MacGuff encounter. What bothers me the most is the screenplay writers/directors Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg violently raping Diablo Cody's award-winning screenplay, copying every catchphrase that it has, like committing an act of plagiarism, thereby giving another reason as to why should the two of them be expelled from Hollywood.The movie is chock-full of clich\u00e9s. Who'd laugh at Iron Man, Hellboy and the Incredible Hulk getting crushed by a falling cow? Who'd laugh at Hancock hitting his head on a lightpost? Who'd laugh at that stupid Women of Wrestling (WoW) skit near the beginning? (Well for those who actually found these scenes funny and risible, you better check if your brain is still functioning.)Story \"Disaster Movie\" doesn't have a story. Seems like all the two blockheads have done is to collect as much movie characters as they can and alter their image by transforming them into obscene, cussing retards. Then, they line them up, and one by one, they get a share of their screen time. There's your story.DISASTER MOVIE IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST STUPID MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Do not watch this film, for the sake of humanity. This film will ruin your day by feeding you huge doses of sheer stupidity. It's like every time you laugh while watching this film, your IQ is reduced by 2. Every applause that you'd give to this film persuades more stupid parodies to come and make men lose their sense of humor. If you actually enjoyed this, you're as air-headed as the two screenwriters.PLEASE, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM AT ALL. YOU WILL TOTALLY REGRET IT.

Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events.Yes, yet again, the famous duo who has wrecked a whole genre between the pair of them return for their latest movie, Disaster Movie. There is literally nothing here to review. The story doesn't exist, there is literally no story at all, it's nowhere to be seen. The characters were yet again stupid for humour and yet again they failed to make anyone laugh. The writers have written nothing but an unfunny sketch show that lasts for a dire hour and a half. The jokes and 'funny' scenes weren't anywhere near funny. The acting was awful and the characters were just pop and movie references and wasn't shy about it either. The only character that almost got a smile from me was Juno or \"Juney\" as she is called in this atrocious movie. Basically, I'm just repeating what I've said for the other three movies they've made.Disaster Movie is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. I felt like I was having my eyes poked repetitively while being set on fire and that was only in the first five minutes. Friedburg and Seltzer have no clue how to write anything or how to make any kind of movie. I think they have a contest between themselves to see whether they can make a movie crappier than the last, I think this time they've really done it because it officially can't get any worse.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",

But they are not fully to blame, the directing of the movie, along with the manuscript makes it a nearly impossible task for any actor to preform well.

The references are lazy, insulting, stupid and tiresome, the production value looks like it has a fungus growing on it, the visuals look incredibly cheap, the acting is beyond terrible, and the 'writing' is abysmal.

This was way worse than Epic Movie, that's hard to say. This movie is by far the worst out of all their spoof movies. Every time they parody something, it's just so unfunny that I was actually cringing. Here's probably the worst part of the movie. All of their other spoof movies seemed like they had a main parody. Epic Movie had the Chronicles of Narnia, Meet the Spartans had 300, this movie has nothing. That's probably the best definition of this movie, it's nothing, absolutely nothing. Out of all the movies that came out from 2007-2008, they really couldn't think of one disaster movie to have the movie be a main parody of? I Am Legend and Cloverfield came out during the same time these other movies parodied came out. It would've some sort of sense if they made fun of either of those movies. But no, they just parody movies that were either extremely popular (The Dark Knight, Iron Man, Indiana Jones 4), well-known movies (Superbad, Juno, No Country for Old Men), or movies they believed would be big hits (10,000 BC, Prince Caspian, Speed Racer). Not a single disaster movie is parodied in a movie ironically called Disaster movie. The acting, forget about it. The writing, forget about it. Originally there were a few things that were actually cool in the movie the first time I saw them. They were the cat fight between Kim Kardashian and Carmen Electra, and the song towards the end of the movie. Now that I think of that, they sucked just as much as this movie. I'm done with any spoof movie that comes out at this point. Go watch classic spoofs like Airplane. I'd even say watch the Scary Movie movies if you want to watch a spoof movie.

Carmen and Kim have a random wrestling match and there is a twenty minute long dance scene parodying High school musical. Then the camera shakes and everybody panics for some reason. Juno, Kim, black guy and will hide in a building where they fight the sex in the city girls. They then encounter a dying Hannah Montana, who you will want to strangle by the end of the scene. Kim randomly dies for no reason, Hancock 'hilariously' flies into a pole (proving the comic genius of the writers) after being shouted at by some irritating kid. The girl from enchanted then climbs out of a sewer and gets run over. She falls in love with the black guy and then randomly reveals that she is a me th addicted prostitute who is pimped by the prince and lives in the sewers. We then encounter iron man, hell boy and the worst made hulk ever (yes even worse than the 2003 one) who are all crushed by cows for some reason. They then try and save wills GDP from the museum, return the crystal skull to the altar and save the day. Kung-fu panda then appears and after a stupidly long sequence, kills the black guy and the transvestite enchanted. The main character then marries his girlfriend and I was relieved the movie had ended. We then had to endure a fifteen minute song and dance that was completely pg 13 appropriate in which all of the characters declare that they are having sex with other people of the same sex. The worst scene of all though is the twenty minute long segment in which Alcon and the chipmunks appear, sing two crappy songs, turn rabid and eat Juno. Whichever three year old who laughed at the rest of this drivel will have been disturbed by. If you want a decent parody watch airplane or the naked gun, and avoid this at all costs",

There is no plot, just chunks of movies being spoofed chuck into a one and a half hour movie. Anyone could do that. Taking parts of movies out with no sense. Disaster Movie is just a random movie which does not make sense as the directors just find any movie to spoof. I don't really see any effort made by the directors, they just want money since their previous movies made quick money. So they thought, 'Why not make another stupid movie and earn some more money fast.' The story: There are disasters coming to destroy the city. Four young and wacky people want to save the city from being destroyed. From there, the most random things come about like Iron man, Hellboy and etc. Basically, if you had seen Epic Movie or Meet the spartan, you would have already seen this movie. This is like the previous movies, Epic Movie and Meet the spartan. The only good thing about the movie is set, the costumes. I am surprised that the directors could find people that look alike of the movies characters. Overall: If you totally hate spoof movies, this will not please you. Those who watch Epic Movie and Meet the spartan, this will probably bore you. Those who miss recent spoof movies, catch this. Why is there no other recent movies that is at least like Superhero movie. I am waiting.",

The writers tried to include as many films as possible to make fun of. I thought the whole high school musical scene with that ridiculous song was funny. Alvin and the Chipmonks skit was very silly, but I have to admit it made me laugh. The Calvin Klein underwear model was funny, as well as the short bit about Hancock. I also like Juney, that was spot on.FINAL VERDICT: This movie is not supposed to be award worthy. It is what it is, and I think you should get a few laughs from it. It's short and I recommend it.",

Then came the outright \"spoof\" films: Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Superhero Movie, Epic Movie, etc. They started making fun of films far more popular and far more creative then they could ever hope to be. The movie is full of Mad TV rejects and dropouts that the writers/directors have given sub-par jokes/gags to. The bottom line is this movie is an insult to your intelligence, and an insult to the movies they \"spoof\". I think that Failburg and Seltzerwater (I personally like their name change, thanks to another writer on here) need to go back and watch some real spoof movies like Space Balls, or Monty Python: Search for the Holy Grail, even Robin Hood: Men In Tights or Naked Gun. I will tell you this, I walked out of the movie after about 30 minutes. I got tired of seeing movies that were clearly better than any of the movies by these two jokers will ever be get dragged through the dirt with stupid, ill-written, badly performed, mindless comedy. It's clear that the writers and directors of this movie have severe ADD and have an IQ of about 30, which is what you'll need to actually enjoy this movie. Please avoid this movie at all cost, it only perpetuates the myth that Failburg and Seltzerwater are actually funny.",

I wouldn't be surprised to find out people killed themselves after seeing this movie in the theater and knowing they paid for it. 3.

The Characters were stupid. The parodies were stupid. The entire film was just plain retarded.This movie makes me wish that IMDb let you ranked movies from 0 to 10 instead of just 1 to 10, because this movie would end up with around a 0.2 overall rating.... and that would only be because Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer logged on and gave it a 10. Some comedies are rather Hit & Miss-ish. Some comedies Have complex jokes that the viewer would have to know a lot about to understand, making the joke only funny to the person who wrote it. This movie is not a Hit and miss. It's a Miss and Miss and miss some more. There are no complex Jokes that require intelligent thought. My guess is if you show this to a baby, the baby will start crying, throw things at the TV and yell until you make the painful movie go away.In Conclusion: Disaster Movie is: a complete and total... disaster.i give it a Negative 1 out of 10. according to the votes here, 1,273 people voted this movie a 10.

The script is biting - crisp and fresh - full of ideas executed to perfection by the stellar cast.Another point to be noted and hailed, is the use of props and costume. Never before have such realistic caricatures been so well created - a mix of great costume design and wonderful acting.In making Disaster Movie, Friedberg and Seltzer have redefined the boundaries of hilarious comedy, setting the bar so high, that no comedy produced in the next ten years could possibly match it. This wonder of cinema is a masterpiece, and guarantees a feature length thrill ride of jaw-dropping action, masterful pathos and bathos, and possibly the most iconic comedy script of the last fifty years....or it's the worst thing ever made, including the H-bomb, and you must never see this yawning dog turd ever.",

Because of the fact that my friend watched like thousands of films, I was a little afraid to watch this movie. Unfortunately, My curiosity won my worries. After I decided to watch this movie, my friend told me about a hundred times not to watch this movie. But I was to curios. Then last Sunday while my friend was watching the Simpson, I watched this film. Before I start this review, let's go over some types of movies. The first one is a movie that's so good, you can hardly say anything after you watched it. Second: great, but not as good as the first one. Third: just good, forth: harmless, fifth: bad, sixth: very bad, seventh: a trash, and the last type: a movie that is used for torturing. This movie is used for the worst torture the humans has ever made.I should have listen to my friend. This movie was a total disaster. I should have known that when I saw the title. This movie starts with some not-funny slapstick and a Cristal skull.(Yeah I know it sounds familiar but let's just go through it). It's something about 'if you don't place the Cristal skull back in it's place then the world will come to an end'. Yeah really great plot. Let's give a medal for it. So anyway, this person name Will breaks up with his girlfriend and celebrates his sixteen year-old party....... even though he's not. Here, High School Musical comes out of nowhere and it's worst than the original. Think about it, worst version of high school musical. Than the story suddenly turns into save Will's girlfriend and Will meet's all kinds of characters. Here comes some great shocks like BATMAN IS FLEEING, CARRYING A SUITCASE. I am dead serious batman is fleeing, carrying a suitcase. Not satisfied? How about this? Ironman and Hulk gets defeated by a cow and so does Hellboy. Juno gets killed by Elvin and the chipmunks who are really monsters, Kung Fu Panda is a man wearing a mask, Hancok is some guy drinking, Giselle is eating glass bottles, and Indiana Jones is an old man who is really really short. There are some other characters but I don't want to talk about them right now. No don't cry yet, because there is one last thing: a song on the last scene. Which is a song that I like to call f**k song. I'm not giving this name because the song is bad. I'm giving this name because THE SONG IS ABOUT F**KING. I'm not lying. There is a song like this. This song is.........terribly horribly, horridly, disastrously, painfully, sickly, awful. I'll tell you this. Batman is playing the guitar. Okay? I repeat, Batman is playing the guitar.Maybe there is a bad movie that you should watch or maybe there is a movie that's so bad that it's funny. But this film is not one of those films it cannot be one of those films. My friend caught a cold right after he saw this movie and so have I. This movie is just.........awful. No, awful isn't the right word. There is not word in this whole universe that can describe this movie. Don't watch this it's bad for your brain, your eyes, your ears, your mind, and yourself.",

For a Parody Movie it doesn't really parody anything as such, and for a comedy film, it didn't even raise a smile from me. It was a bunch of scenes from other movies strung together, miserably failing to inject any humour to the point where I couldn't wait for each 'scene' to be over in anticipation that the next one might be remotely entertaining.I guess the burping joke at the beginning should have prepared me for what was to come, but it didn't. I really can't think of one redeeming feature in this film, and although I've said this not too long ago with The Collector, Disaster Movie is now the worst film I have ever seen (I'm hunting for a region 2 copy of Manos, the Hands of Fate if one exists).It's also difficult to talk about individual faults with Disaster Movie because everything is so wrong with this film. I never expected anything from the acting nor any particular plot, in both cases it met these (lack of) expectations, but I don't think it's too much to ask a comedy to be funny, and a film on the whole, to be entertaining.The only positive that came from Disaster Movie was it finished twenty minutes earlier than the TV Guide advertised.I now finally believe there is a film in existence that deserves a 0/10, unfortunately IMDb doesn't agree with me.",

The film has NO narrative, NO visual style and NO plot, save that of trying to cram as many playground 'jokes' and pop-culture references as possible, often so cheap and poorly done they have to be signposted.

However this time watched the unrated version (having not realized it was the unrated version prior to watching). The slight changes are simply F-bombs added (notably the end song). Forgotten how many musical acts were in this, almost like it's part musical. The film remains unfunny and all the gags and references fall flat.

Each secretary is more attractive and a worse typist than the last, and Oscar (a notorious womanizer) keeps leaning in more and more. Then it cuts to a homely woman typing really fast and Oscar leaning as far away as possible. So he hires all of them. That is funny.If you had to list a movie on par with Disaster Movie in terms of laughs per movie, I would compare it to Salo: or The 120 Days of Sodom.

Nothing but gross gross outs and unnecessary parody after parody. Then came along Disaster Movie and...and...OH GOD!!! The only good thing about this movie is the title. It's very ironically written considering this is indeed a disaster. It's mortifying from beginning to end and I'm actually shuddering as I am writing this review. No joke.The movie begins with a parody of 10,000 b.c. and the caveman comes across Amy Winehouse. Then she has I think a four minute long burping scene which is supposed to make fun of her drugs and alcoholism. We then learn it's just a dream. Then the protagonist played by Matt Lanter is throwing a sweet sixteen at the age of 25 and they learn after wards the world will end on August 29, 2008 (the movie's release haha). During the party we see parodies of No Country, Superbad, Dr. Phil, High School Musical and list goes on and on.Outside meteors are coming down, everyone's running for their life, the two protagonists are who we follow, they come across a Juno and Enchanted parody, they try to seek shelter where they meet the Sex and the City girls, *inhales* and here's the plot. They learn they have to return the skull from Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull and the disaster will stop.As one can tell, these constant parodies are a dead horse of a concept being beaten over and over and over again.The humor is absolutely abysmal. Constant jokes are put in to try and gross us out with laughter but in the end, they want to make us hurl. This is where my summary comes in. I got a major headache and urge to purge in my empty drink. These jokes are pretty much as revolting as Freddy got Fingered such as the scene when Juno's water breaks and on the two men with her, a thick white fluid explodes on their faces.Then we come across guess what, even more parodies. Iron Man, Hulk, Batman, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Night at the Museum, an awful Kung Fu Panda suit, and Beowulf in the nude with nothing but gay jokes about him. Eventually they return the skull with an Indiana Jones parody played by Tony Cox and all hell is restrained.Then just like Meet the Spartans, we get a terrible \"musical\" ending with all the cast singing a terrible song I don't remember.This story-less, headache inducing excuse for entertainment made me want to leave the theater and I wish I had. Never in my life have I seen a movie so tasteless and talentless that I wanted to go on a tantrum after realizing I lost ninety minutes of my life. ZERO STARS out of ten.

Because 1) there was no way in hell that I was paying \u00a37.50 on this (pardon the pun) disaster and 2) because I didn't want, nay, couldn't let my friend face this alone.

I wish I could give it a vote less than 1. How bad was it? Okay, my spouse and I watch a lot of movies; at least five a week borrowed from the library. (If we had rented this one, I'd be screaming my head off for a refund!) We watch on big screen in a double recliner. To watch \"Disaster Movie\" on a chilly evening, we were snuggled up under a woolen throw, and our cat was on my lap. She has never before offered comment on a movie, except to maybe get up an leave during particularly noisy ones. During \"Disaster Movie,\" about halfway through, she sat up and upchucked in my lap. Nuff said. My spouse and I thoroughly agree.",

Disaster Movie was a waste of time... almost as bad as Meet the Spartans... except for two members of the Mad TV cast (they played multiple parts for some reason), everything else about the movie sucked BIG time... it seemed like almost half the movie was musical numbers... the lyrics to the songs were funny, but who cares about a High School Musical parody? what am I, twelve? and the only \"disaster\" movie I could see them making fun of was Cloverfield, but they didn't do enough with it...let's see... good things about the movie... the Alvin and the Chipmunks scene was funny at first, but it went on way too long... Nicole Parker from Mad TV playing the crazy princess from Enchanted was the only good role in the movie... she was hilarious, but the writing for her made no sense...the girls and the gays will like the Beowulf parody scene... naked guy butt for a few minutes... mildly humorous... pull it up on YouTube...again, it had SO much potential, esp. if they would have concentrated their efforts on spoofing Cloverfield and action movies like it... but, they screwed it up by plugging in too many short popular movie references, but not following through with them...

It especially doesn't work with \"Superbad\". 3) As I was watching this a genuinely felt angry. I love films and I watch a wide variety of them, from \"Schindler's List\" to \"Airplane!\". One tries more to inform and provoke emotion another just simply wants to entertain and make you laugh! This was made for one reason and one alone, to make money. It's embarrassing and degrading to all film lovers. I apologise if this was a bit extreme and I apologise again if this offends any genuine fans of the film.

I agree this movie has no good things to show or teach, but it made me laugh many times. \"Bottoms up\", \"I'm just a demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers\", Juno's sarcasm, \"Well so was I\", Amy's burps, Hannah Montana's publicity, all these parts made me laugh. And I don't consider myself as an easy laugher. The foppish High School Musical, mainly Zac's character was the most real and the funniest part of the movie. Everyone above 16 is able to notice that HSM characters may not be straight at all, and it's strange how movie reviewers don't give a damn about the deed of those characters.

It really amazed me at how little effort was put into this mess.Instead of actually parodying actual disaster movies, writers/directors Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer made the insipid decision to instead make references (not jokes) to nearly every movie that was released that summer. It's easy to see that \"Disaster Movie\" was a rushed production, because most of the movies they supposedly riff on weren't even released when they were shooting! This means that F&S just saw the trailers to \"Juno\", \"Alvin & The Chipmunks\", \"Kung Fu Panda\", \"High School Musical\", \"Hancock\", \"Love Guru\", \"Speed Racer\", \"Wanted\", \"You Don't Mess With the Zohan\", \"Indiana Jones\", \"Superbad\", \"Narnia\", \"Dark Knight\", \"The Incredible Hulk\", \"Iron Man\", and \"Sex & The City\", then decided to craft gags around them. Smart, isn't it? It's from this tactic that shows how much F&S care about the moviegoer's intelligence. This is insulting. The only movie they use that's actually a disaster movie is \"Twister\" (complete with a horrible CGI created tornado).I didn't have high expectations for \"Disaster Movie\", thankfully. I do enjoy spoofs, and I am a proud fan of offbeat/slapstick comedy. That being said, the movie failed to even do slapstick right. The only scenes that made me laugh was the Chipmunks segment and when the Jumper landed on Caspian's sword. Also, Nicole Parker as Giselle got some chuckles from me. And...that's it. A few moments out of 70 minutes. Now, correct me if I'm wrong: isn't a spoof, and a comedy in general, supposed to have a medium-to-high level of funny scenes and jokes? I plan on becoming a filmmaker soon, creating my own comedies. For me and any other person who wants to make comedies, this movie is the perfect example of how NOT to make a spoof or a comedy. The fact that LionsGate thought this was fit for theatrical release boggles the mind. Even a baby would think it's terrible.\"Disaster Movie\" is an unfunny, desperate, lame excuse to cash in on the parody scene. Friedberg and Seltzer should be ashamed of themselves. The script is terrible, and the directing and editing has no sense of timing. I feel bad for the cast; they might not get better work because of this on their resumes.For those who are curious to see this movie, don't. Just... no. In fact, see Airplane!, a spoof that makes fun of ACTUAL DISASTER MOVIES and knows what it's doing.This is quite possibly the worst comedy I've seen. Unspeakably bad.",

Add in very bad special effects, and a few actors pulled from Hollywood's unemployment line, and you got a truckload of suck. The only way it could be any worse is if it starred Paris Hilton, Sisqo, and Richard Simmons.But what really got me was the HORRIBLE Juno parody. As a fan of Ellen Page who just adored the film Juno (which is my favorite film, thank you), I was flat out offended by how they dump all over that great film. A film as great and original as Juno deserves better than a strung out 30 year old in a pregnancy suit doing a bad Juno MacGuff impersonation while kicking a drag queen with a baby leg that magically pops out of her stomach. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME! The people who made this should be permanently barred from making movies. If you are heading to theaters to see a comedy, please see Tropic Thunder instead. In fact, the makers of this film need to be tied up and forced to watch Tropic Thunder to learn how to properly work spoofs and pop culture parodies/references into a movie, and make a genuinely funny spoof film.So please spend your money on a Tropic Thunder ticket instead.

That disappointed me, because if he had enjoyed himself then at least I could say I watched it for a good reason.The worst part about your IMDb reviews is that they are probably entertaining Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, who I'm sure are sitting back reading these articles and laughing at us all\u0085which is more than they deserve from us, because they have never made any of us laugh even once.If the filmmakers ARE reading this, then I urge you to watch Airplane and Naked Gun again. Learn from your masters, Zucker and Abraham. Learn from the Farrelly Brothers. Learn from Mike Judge. Bow to them and admit that you are their inferior bitches. They will spit on you in return, and you're barely worth that.",

            "content": "Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are the new writing duo on the scene and probably one of the more famous writing teams but for all of the wrong reasons. They are known for writing and directing some of the worst films I have ever seen. Who could forget the soon to be Academy Award Winning classics Epic Movie or Date Movie and of course Meet The Spartans. All of them terribly Unfunny. Then comes Disaster movie, 1 of 3 films written by the duo to come out in the year 2008. The first being the awful Meet The Spartans, the second being Superhero Movie which believe it or not is actually really funny, and the third being this. This makes me ponder the question: Why on earth do people find this funny. It may say from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie but look, there were 6 writers for Scary Movie. How do these two untalented unfunny writers keep getting work? Just because they wrote Scary Movie doesn't mean they can transfer their work into movies like this.25-year-old Will played by Matt Lanter is getting ready for his Sweet 16 birthday party because he never had one. His girlfriend Amy played by Vanessa Lachey is having a rocky relationship with Will but gives him one more chance. Wills friend Calvin played by Gary Johnson along with his girlfriend Lisa played by Kim Kardashian throw Will a great party filled with a High School Musical song and dance number. However the party is cut short by meteors falling down to earth. Will, Amy, Calvin, Lisa and Juno played by Crista Flannigan Try to find Shelter until the shower is finished. They come across colorful characters along the way like the crew form Sex And The City, Batman and the princess from Enchanted.Now the movie actually, believe it or not, has a few funny moments in it. The Dr. Phil and Hancock Impersonators are pretty funny and Tony Cox has a really funny cameo as Indiana Jones and has the best written dialouge in the film. Now the rest of the film is not funny at all. What Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer find funny is the useless contrived potty humor and of course the ever funny gay jokes. This movie can't go five minutes without cracking a gay joke. There is a scene in the film where the character of Will is tackled by a naked Beowoulf. Ha-Ha.There are two songs in the film. The first song which is the High School Musical song. Listen to these soon-to-be-classic lyrics: \"We'll All be friends forever, Unless a random Disaster Destroys the city\". Ha Ha. Also we have the song I'm F****** Matt Damon, Again HA-HA. Half of the stuff in this film made me say What was the joke? For example, when Hannah Montana Gets crushed by a boulder but she keeps dying and coming back to life. Whats The Joke? Maybe I don't understand it but apparently other people did because this movie made money. Why, I don't know. Now I love stupid humor, one of my favorite films of all time is Napoleon Dynamite but wow this movie is bad. I am going to use a term from the online film critic duo Schmoes Know, This movie Stoinks!Wow! This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. This movie is not funny. It is poor and unfunny it is tedious to watch. I Hated Hated Hated Hated Hated This Movie. It has insulted the Intelligence of not only me and the intelligence of cinema but it has insulted the intelligence of the American people.

They pick and choose which movies to parody thoroughly, and which are simply two-second cameos (an example would be \"Iron Man\", the title character of which is flattened into a tin can---literally---only a few seconds after his arrival). Their care and caution certainly pays off in a mostly hilarious film that satisfies those tired of the same summer blockbuster garbage or overrated indie art-house junk. Perhaps people do not like the Selter-Friedburg movies because they eschew subtlety altogether and \"tell\" rather than \"show\" why they are parodying a particular movie or celebrity. Still, it was fun to see art-house darling \"Juno\" literally torn to shreds (I did not see \"Juno\", but Seltzer/Friedburg let me know what the character of the original was like by mocking her dialogue) by demonic Muppet chipmunks. Finally, Seltzer and Friedburg do good by killing off the sadistic villain from that overrated indie gore-fest \"No Country For Old Men\". And what's not to like about a gratuitous girl fight between two very beautiful women, Kim Kardashian and Carmen Electra? In short: the directors were judicious in what they chose to parody, the actors (especially the versatile Nicole Parker) did very well (Kim Kardashian was not too terrible to watch as a first-timer), and the carnivorous, devilish, cheap-looking chipmunk puppets kept me gasping for air with laughter. It's far from the worst movie ever, and those courageous enough to brave the critics' venom will find quite a treat.",

(We also know that spoofing is not the same as satirizing, but that's a discussion for another day.) Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, who write and direct these films as a duo, do not know this. In their minds, all it takes to spoof \"The Incredible Hulk\" is for the character to show up and then be crushed by a falling cow.Get it?! It's a character you recognize from a different movie, but here he is in THIS movie! And then he gets hurt! The title notwithstanding, disaster movies are not the object of \"Disaster Movie's\" satire (such as it is). You're thinking \"The Towering Inferno,\" \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" or \"The Day After Tomorrow\"; they're thinking \"Sex and the City,\" \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan,\" and \"Juno\" -- any movie that came out within the last year, in other words. The film's basic structure parallels \"Cloverfield\" (which sort of qualifies), and there's a reference to \"Twister\" -- from 12 years ago -- and the only joke is that a tornado keeps throwing cows around.

That's really not that funny!The movie is more or less a character starts walking around, notices something happening and then another character comes in and and notices what's happening says one line and you never see them in the movie again. Then another character comes in and sees another character and says \"Whoa, Oh My God blah blah blah blah!\" and then another character says a line and doesn't appear in the movie.

The actors don't even try, the jokes are the worst I have ever heard, the effects are painful to watch, the parodies are horrible, everything fails. The jokes are extremely unfunny, random at times, often don't feel like they have punch lines, and they go forever. In a film that is less than an hour and a half the jokes should not all be a minute long. When a joke is told the film feels like you just hit pause. The film stops, tells the very long and terrible joke, and when it is over and the film moves on it just stops again for another bad joke just seconds later. The parodies are unfunny, random at times, and make me feel horrible. All the jokes in the film are either physical (unfunny) or parody (very unfunny). A parody is meant to make someone laugh about something they've seen. This makes parodies the wrong way. Instead of making fun and at the same time honoring the thing being parodied Disaster Movie does neither of those two things. It doesn't honor anything. It doesn't make fun of much. The parodies are just there. The parodies most of the time are just the character from another movie saying that they are that character and then the character gets hurt. This is due to the parodies being made from trailers of the movies. Friedberg and Seltzer give a bad name to parodies when there is a lot of good parodies. Now to due this and other films under the same two directors the parody genre should retire. In the end Disaster Movie is a true disaster.0 stars out of 4Also an MJ molesting joke in 2008.

            "content": "OK, let's get it out of the way early: this movie is truly bad. Granted, I didn't think it was as bad as 'Epic Movie,' but that may just be because I had not seen the equal of 'Epic Movie' in a long time ('Chairman of the Board' springs to mind). But don't think I am praising it: 'Epic Movie' was a pile of dog excrement. 'Disaster Movie' is tinsel in the dog excrement: shinier, a little more attractive, but in the end, pretty much just as disgusting.For those who don't know, the plot of this tripe is, essentially, several fairly attractive young people try to make it through a Friedberg/Seltzer movie with their careers intact. Unfortunately, no one's does, which is a bit of a shame: Carmen Electra, for her crazy past, certainly deserves a lot better, and the only real bright spot of the film, the deadpan work by Ike Barinholtz of Mad TV fame (who had the only semi-decent line in 'Meet the Spartans') is underpinned by a boatload of utter nonsense. Attempts to further the plot are foiled by an endless stream of pop culture references that are not only unfunny, but have nothing to do with anything that happens on screen. And just in case you aren't laughing at a joke (believe me, it will be through no fault of your own), the filmmakers make absolutely certain you know exactly what they are referencing and why you should find it funny.But all is not lost. Thankfully, even the worst movies can teach us a thing or two about what works and what doesn't. Since this movie has shown that some people clearly haven't learned them (and budding filmmakers, take note), let's print a few here: 1. IN COMEDY, TIMING IS EVERYTHING. Somehow, cosmically, every joke has its one point where it switches from 'ho-hum' to 'gutbuster.' Some jokes take longer, some shorter. But playing a 1 second joke for 5 minutes does not work. For reference, see much of this movie.2. EDITING IS CRUCIAL. Similar to #1 in idea, but different in execution. One of the questions the movie asks is, 'Why not use five gags to make one joke?' The reason: four of the gags are not funny, and by the time the fifth rolls around, the joke falls flat on its face. I really think some of the gags in the movie could work if some editing was done. Unfortunately, this would most likely reduce the running time considerably...say, to about 27 minutes or so.3. DON'T INSULT THE AUDIENCE. Toilet humor is perfectly fine for a movie, especially a parody film. I can laugh at pretty much anything. But as I mentioned above, I don't laugh when I'm told by the movie why this scene is supposed to be funny, and that I should laugh specifically because it told me I should. I liked 'Superhero Movie,' because as incredibly stupid and silly as it was, it never once told me to laugh at something; it let me decide. 'Disaster Movie' never gives you the option. Every joke is carefully (and sometimes, quite thoroughly) explained, to the point where I wanted to shout out, \"All right! I get it, but I don't like it!\" 4. SEQUELS AND SPIN-OFFS ARE WRITTEN THROUGH DOLLARS. Any dollar spent at the local theater, rental store, or on-line distributor is a vote for that film. If you don't like something, for Pete's sake, don't spend your hard-earned money on it. And tell your friends not to see it. It would appear after 'Disaster,' the audience is finally starting to speak where it counts the most.No movie is completely without fans. If you liked 'Disaster Movie,' then you liked it. But please, keep it to yourself. I've painfully sat through the last three Seltzer/Friedberg movies so others wouldn't have to. Do not make my sacrifice in vain.",

The more people who boycott such films will send a clear message to the studios that we'd rather spend our money on going to see a film that's worth paying for. Hit them in their wallets and they'll soon get the message.",

It's that bad, it's an insult to filmmaking.When you first see the title, you would think that it's a spoof of disaster movies, like Twister, The day after tomorrow, Titanic, the towering inferno, and others. WRONG. The only things that have anything to do with disasters in the whole movie are a couple of obviously fake plastic asteroids, a lousy GGI tornado and a random freeze(Where did that come from?!). The rest of the movie is spent on unfunny references(not spoofs) of movies like The dark knight, sex and the city, Juno, High school musical, Alvin and the chipmunks, Batman, Don't mess with the zohan, Kung-fu Panda, Beowulf, The love guru, and celebrities like Hannah Montana, Michael Jackson, Matt Damon, Jessica Simpson, Amy winehouse, and many others.The humour is amazingly stupid and so immature that I doubt even a five year old would find it even remotely funny. When the movie makers does attempt to actually make a joke about something, they repeat the joke a trillion times, and, worst of all, they actually EXPLAIN the jokes and why they are supposed to be funny. Horrible.The acting is so bad that it does'nt deserve to be called acting. The directing seems nonexistent and the script is a total mess with nothing even mildly intelligent in it.

They should do everyone in Hollywood a favor by taking Seltzer and Friedberg and ban them from movies completely. After watching that movie I thought i must have tripped something really bad, but wondered what happened to my time that was wasted on this movie. I couldn't even laugh it was so bad. I have seen some really bad movies but they will get me to laugh but this one was far worse. I think i rather watch Crossroads and Kazaam back to back with no breaks then to watch this movie again. They sing in this movie which is fine but end the joke and song, not keep it together for almost 6 minutes. And the song at the end of the movie, whats the point, just roll your credits and walk with your head down in shame. I will have to recommend everyone NOT to watch this movie, unless you want to lose 90 minutes of your life.

It seems that these \"film makers\" haven't learned their lesson after the first \"movie\". This \"film\", once again, has a lazy pointless story, terrible acting, cheesy special effects, dull sets/locations, and finally a cliched generic boring soundtrack to tie this diarrhea stain together. The story, or lack thereof, is just a cliched plethora of subplots with a cliched boring narrative and cliched snore fest that goes absolutely nowhere, again. Now, I do like the parody genre when it's executed properly. But, this \"film\" is anything but well executed! This \"movie\" has some of the worst direction that I have ever seen. Keep in mind, this \"movie\" has two directors. Yet, they still somehow screwed it up, again! How is that possible?! \"Cannonball Run\" franchise, eat your heart out! When I was putting my list of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen, I was debating whether to go with this one, or \"Epic Movie\". By a slight margin, this one was a little better. That's not saying much! The only moment I enjoyed was the Chipmunks getting crushed at the end. I hate \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\"! As far as the acting goes, it is just as dreadful, as the first \"film\"! Most of the so-called \"performances\" are so bad, that it leads you to question: \"what were you thinking?!\" Or another question, \"what kind of direction were the actors and actresses given?\" As for the special effects, the majority of them look cheesy and generic. Therefore, the special effects have not aged well. The sets/locations look dull and boring, and most of the interior scenes were obviously filmed in a studio. Finally, the musical score is boring, predictable and forced. No part of the score is memorable at all. \"Disaster Movie\" (which it is), certainly lives up to it's title. It is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it actually was a contender for my top 10 worst movies list, but didn't quite reach the mark. Still, there is nothing positive I can salvage from this waste of film making. I'm giving this \"film\" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating, my true rating is 0 stars. The only positive thing I can gather from watching this \"movie\", like most other bad movies I've seen, is that I'll never have to watch it again.

They were popular for a reason; and were, for he most part 1000 times better than this lazy, half-finished old horse tripe.The fundamental flaw of Disaster Movie is that it's just not funny. Having Princess Gizelle from 'Enchanted' eating glass for example is not only disgusting but also cynical and in the worst possible taste, and then there's the film's attempts to be topical, by having Amy Winehouse spring up from out of a bush drinking Whisky and talking of 'having gasoline' which 'was good' - surely the potentially fatal drink and drug problems of such a famous person is not something to flippantly joke about, and more to the point - unashamedly cash in on; as Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have.There is no plot to this film - people run around on the 29th August - as I said, not a plot, and because of this Disaster, ahem Movie (can it really be called a movie?) feels like one and a half hours of ear-bleedingly, eye-wateringly unfunny outtakes, which by the end makes one wish that like Iron Man, The Hulk and Hellboy, a cow would fall from the sky, and crush one to death.Give the \u00a35.20 ticket price for this film to charity instead.0/10 (If only IMDb let you score that)",

For me I left my baggage at the door and went for the ride. I left the theatre feeling lighter than when I went it so for me, it did do what it was set out to do.",

            "content": "This review is not going to tell you anything you care too much about. By now, most people know the formula that has gone from Date Movie to Epic Movie to Meet the Spartans, and now Disaster Movie. But unlike Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie actually doesn't COMPLETELY suck.Okay, so I will definitely admit that the first ten minutes of this film completely turned me off. There really isn't much grounds for spoofing 10,000 B.C., and the direction they went was just completely ridiculous. But as the movie goes on and scene after scene is some sort of witty reference, it gets considerably better, especially when all the side characters start coming in. There was actually quite a few sequences that had me laughing out loud, namely one spoofing the 'Head On' commercial and another which mocks the lyrics of a song in Juno.There's nothing new to be found in Disaster Movie, but maybe that's why I saw it. I was just looking to be entertained, and while the first fifteen minutes or so were quite atrocious, it got better toward the middle, and let up to a somewhat satisfying conclusion. Some of the jokes fall flat, certainly, and a lot of them even drag on for too long, but I cannot bring myself to say that I didn't enjoy this movie.I'm really not sure of the reason why I enjoyed it so much, but I think it was mostly due to the fact that I went in with an open mind and I found myself laughing a lot, along with the group of friends I went with. Not everyone will love the movie, but there is plenty to laugh at. There are a few shining moments, and they pretty much more than make up for the really crappy ones. Juno, Enchanted, and Sex and the City probably got the cleverest spoofs, and I really liked the mockery of the quippy Juno dialogue. Matt Lanter was a great lead, and Kim Kardashian was pretty funny in her role. Overall, not a terrible movie, and really quite entertaining, especially all the musical scenes.",

The main storyline/spoof is based on Cloverfield. Other movies thrown into spoof mode are Indiana Jones, Iron Man, Batman, Juno, Alvin and the Chipmunks, and Hannah Montana. Almost none of these films are disaster movies, just to let you know.There are some strong points and weak, disastrous points. The 10,000 BC and Amy Winehouse jokes sucked. The Alvin and the Chipmunks and Indiana Jones scenes are funny. I also agree with most people that the Hannah Montana scenes were annoying.There are some great actors in here. I liked Matt Lanter and the queen of spoof movies, Carmen Electra.There was a good effort by the makers of this film. There is not enough to warrant many laughs.

This movie is called that way, because the movie itself is a disaster. From the moment the movie begins, everything the main cast is doing is one long concatenation of silly, overdone parodies on a wide selection of movies. A couple of parodies are okay, but they just keep on coming and even if you think that a parodie is going to stop, so they could continue with 'the story' of the movie...think again. Some parodies are hugely overdone and way too much. And that's not all. What bothers me, is that a lot of the parodies and spoofs are from quite new movies, which are hard to get and left you wondering what the movie was called again that they are spoofing. To spoof instant classics like Star Wars and Indiana Jones is okay, because everyone gets that...but to spoof Zohan and Jimmy Kimmel show (just to name two)...that's just not done. And the list continues....there are about 60 spoofs and connections with other movies...which are just 50 too many. (I think I could stand 10 spoofs, but not more!). Verdict: This 'disaster-on-screen' is not worth watching and especially not worth your money if you want to rent it. 2 out of 10. Yes, I gave it a 2 because of the cool metal/hardrock song that's in the movie. Don't watch the movie for that part, it should be on YouTube somewhere. Saves you about an hour of your life.",

You CANNOT treat it as such, have intense expectations, get disappointed, come online and badmouth the film. As I said before, this film is loaded with satire. It's also loaded with slapstick.There were two instances of the film that I felt kind of dragged on: a)the musical scene where the high school group was singing during the Cloverfield knock off and b)the whole Hannah Montana being crushed under the meteor.The best part was, in my opinion, when Carmen Electra wrestled Lisa. Just to watch them wrestle was well worth going out to the movies. And I really liked the Enchanced bit where the girl jumps out of the sewer and lands on the black dude's balls (yep, he sings about it).I found myself constantly laughing and laughing during this film. It's slapstick and satire: the movie plot really doesn't have to make sense. As long as you understand the gist of where each scene is coming from, what message the writers are trying to convey and then watch how they're presenting it, you'll laugh.One last thing, the chipmunk bit was so wicked!

What does Juno have to do with disaster movies?

So that's about the comedy aspect of \"Disaster Movie\" (this is where it got it's 0.5 mark out of 10). now to the positive thing i mentioned in the headline - this movie can be used as a reference guide to the top hit movies of this year and those that can be put on to-watch list. It's more like an hour long ad, than a movie. And some parody scenes are quite good example/interpretations of pop-life based events for the last-and-past years. And this is where it gets another mark - i even give one whole point out of 10 (now totaling 1,5/10).Thrully disastrous movie, but it's what you asked for if you wanted to watch it ;)PS. where did it get the last 0.5points? for the ending song which is a rather good parody for the default pop songs that engulf the charts.",

Even movies that didn't live up to the hype, I found something enjoyable in them. But, In watching this latest movie that these two came out with, I had to think, \"Do they even care?\" why would you two try and at least write a funny joke? Parodies are hard to do. But, when done right, Like Scary Movie, Airplane, Top gun, (add your favorite here) you can not only laugh yourself into a coma, you can also see the hard work that went into them. Hard work that Jason and Arron know nothing about. They think, as long as young people go see them, Then they'll keep making them. So, here is what I would like to say to you Jason and Arron -- If you really did have anything to do with scary movie like you make everyone think you did, then you would step up and accept this challenge. If by some insane chance, that any studio would ever allow you to make another movie, Do what others have done with \"Scary Movie\" go out and get good writers who will bust their asses to make a movie that you can be proud of. Take all the money you've made off of these Unfunny things that you call movies and pay good writers to help you.I challenge you to do this. I know you love movies. You have to. So, try and make a good one.Thanks for the garbage.",

So I was dreading DISASTER MOVIE but am surprised to admit that it actually had some solid laughs. The film is essentially a free form blender of pop culture references in scene after scene with a threadbare plot to connect them. However, the interesting thing about the satire here is how dark and cynical it is. The film rightly points out the cynicism and hypocrisy of teen entertainment (ex. the shallow consumerism and robotic nature of HANNAH MONTANA, the mindless songs and false chasteness of HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, the overwritten, annoying banter of JUNO, et al.). Even family films are deservedly skewered (the heroine of ENCHANTED turned into a drugged out, homeless hooker, KUNG FU PANDA literally a guy in a costume brawling it out and best of all, the savage ALVIN & THE CHIPMUNKS sequence that turns them into CRITTERS style, metal loving evil puppets). And how true it is that the summer blockbusters consist of one comic book film after another being churned into the marketplace for our consumption (the film correctly portrays the \"superheroes\" in this fashion, with a cow splattering each of them one by one). Add to that a musical number that ties all of these references together in a seamless fashion. Friedberg and Seltzer still have an amateurish quality to their film-making and several sequences are allowed to drag on a bit to kill time. But overall this is definitely worth a look and maybe you'll be surprised.",

Granted, those movies have an old, tired formula, and they're all very similar, so I really don't know why people who don't like these kind of movies insist on watching them.Silly jokes, vulgarity, impersonations - that's what this movie is about. It's a mindless comedy that tries to cram up as much pop-culture as they can make fun of. The plot can probably be summarized in one line. You don't really have to pay attention to this movie, and as such, I was entertained.There were several laugh-out-loud moments here, but unfortunately this movie (like all others in this vein) suffers from over-repetition of jokes, some go on for too long and some that are not really funny.While \"Disaster Movie\" isn't a comedic masterpiece, it's not nearly as bad a film as people make it out to be. I'd say it's okay. So if you don't like silliness, stay away. I had some fun, and that's what I was expecting.",

What I loved about this movie was that it included the characters from many classic cartoons in the most bizarre ways possible! Seeing Alvin and the chipmunks going mad, Kung Fu Panda coming out of no where to fight, Batman being humiliated, and the whole nonsense of this movie made me enjoy my time and go to bed with a smile on my face. I've also seen Superhero Movie, Epic movie, and a few others in this gender, though this was the first one I saw, and the most I enjoyed. I give it a 10, but only for THIS gender.

I generally love this sort of movie, even though the jokes can sometimes be immature, but the jokes in this movie were so childish that even a three-year old would scoff at the minor chuckles of his two and one year old counterparts. That said, this movie shows that the standards in spoof movies have sunken so low, that we probably won't see another major theater release of one for years to come.",

These 87 minutes were completely squandered as the film manages to continuously sap the viewer's will to live, degrading them to a shivering wreck by the time it drags itself to the much anticipated final credits. This movie plunges so deep down in to the ranks of awful films that it is unwatchable even to for the seasoned ironic moviegoer. I cannot even recommend this to anyone or anything as this blight on the human race degrades the fabric of the viewer's very being, making it unsuitable for children, animals and most vegetation.

It is not.As many people have pointed out it does not actually spoof disaster movies. I mean think of the possibilities of spoofing the towering inferno, Earthquake, Armageddon and all those 70's films.This merely tries to parody this years crop of movies and celebrities.The Amy whinehouse impersonation was frankly embarrassing. The Hannah Montana bit . It wasn't funny the first time. They then repeat the 'gag' (so called because I felt like gagging at the poor quality film) 4 times again. I watched the first 20 minutes with my wife, then we forwarded a bit looking for a joke, then again , then basically we just turned it off.All the comments are spot on. They have to announce the jokes repeatedly.I feel violated as I both paid \u00a33.50 for this film ,and wasted some 30 minutes of my life on this rubbish.PLease don't watch it, don't watch any film ever made by the people involved in this film again.NOTE ONE JOKE WAS INVOLVED IN THE WHOLE FILM!!!!",

It is more painful then having a door wrapped in barbwire shoved up your butt sideways.

Watch something good, like Vertigo, Casablanca, The Godfather, Citizen Kane, or if you would prefer a comedy movie, then you should watch something like 'Some Like It Hot', 'Arsenic and Old Lace', or Doctor Strangelove: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'.

Not one. It takes a group of writers a lot of work to NOT be able to make her situation funny.The rest of the spoofs are terrible at best with the exception to Juno the FIRST time they make it.

But for me I absolutely love these stupid spoof movies.The \"story\", and I use this word very lightly, gives us Will, who is right in the middle of his Super Duper Sweeet Sixteen (even though he is actually 25) when the world starts coming under attack, from mostly meteorites, and tornado's, and earthquakes. Loosley following the \"Cloverfeild\" plot, Will must reach his girlfriend who is trapped in the Museum where she works.But does he have to do this alone? Of course not, there are plenty of stupid characters and even stupider obstacles that he must overcome.By far the best spoof on a character here is Juno, played by Crista Flannigan, who has done this before on Mad TV I think, she had me rolling on the floor more than anyone. Second to her is Nicole Parker, who is hilarious as Amy Winehouse, Jessica Simpson, but most of all the princess from Enchanted. Who is not actually a princess but a drugged out homeless chick, F-ing hilarious.Of course no movie is safe, everything from the past year gets made fun off, from Indiana Jones, all the way to Step Up. Most are funny some are really stupid.The one bad thing that I have to say, is that some of the Spoofs lasted way longer than they needed to, it should be spoof, spoof, spoof, story advance. Only it is Spooooooooof, Spoooooof, story advance. And how many characters does Ike Barenholts need to play, seriously its like they didn't have the budget for more actors. But he was pretty funny.All in all this was really good, definitely better than last years \"Meet the Spartans\" not as good as \"Scary Movie\" so I would rank it up there with \"Epic Movie\" which I thought was also great. If you like stupid, and you are not old enough to see \"College\" then you should really check this out.",

There is incoherent storytelling, bad acting, unfunny and tasteless jokes galore and enough confusing stuff to make your head spin. And yet, this is not the worst movie there is and the reason is Nicole Parker. Even when she first appears as the gasoline gulping Amie Winehouse lookalike the scene becomes enjoyable in a weird way. And when she later reenters the scene as the enchanted princess - although her lines are as crappy or even crappier than those of the rest of the cast - she is neither embarrassed nor pompous, but she seems to be fully aware and she seems to enjoy playing this crap as much as a bad movie lover enjoys watching it.Don't get me wrong, the movie is still a confusing mess filled with tasteless jokes but because of this exceptional performance it is not nearly the worst film I have seen.",

For the good of funny movies stop this director from producing any more movies. I have to say scary movie 123 and 4 are funny but he didn't direct them he wrote the story... epic movie, disaster movie,Meet the Spartans, and date movie, are just plain retarded.

Nothing more, nothing less.If you can open up your mind to the above principals of comedy films, you can truly see this film as I saw it.This film was absolutely hilarious. Sure, the gags were often dirty, sure they were politically incorrect, sure certain people would be offended by it. But honestly, it's just a cheap comedy meant to cause people to laugh until they have heart attacks. It's what the directors intended, and in my opinion they succeeded in it very well.So, if you can possibly lower your IQ by a few points for an hour and half, I'm sure you'll find this movie very enjoyable.",

Walking out of the movie my entire body felt sore from laughing so hard and for so long. I enjoy all the pop culture references and how accurate they were to what they were portraying. The part with Dr. Phil was excellent, and I enjoyed it especially when he got shot. It's hilarious; I cannot emphasize that enough. Take your friends, your family, and even your dog to see this movie. It will provide great memories for many generations to come.

Although some scenes are very random and some of the characters do not apply to the \"disaster\" theme, the film is lighthearted and should not be taken on too strongly.

Also, the characters of other movies, and the pop stars who appeared, are so awful, so awful that I wanted to suicide. Amy Winehouse was ugly, but she had a merit: she can warn us the disaster of this movie.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

One good thing about it was Nicole Parker, I feel that she made the movie watchable. The whole story (If there was one) Was confusing and stupid. They would go on to, lets say, Juno's water braking, then, she is OK again. I know it's not meant to be taken to heart and all but it was was still not much of a movie, most of the characters got annoying and you wish they would just go off screen already! They copy movies that weren't really on DVD yet (when filming some of the movies weren't out yet). Another annoying part was when some of the characters kept repeating the line, Mcloving or whatever he says got old really fast.On a plus side, I did like this better than the last two mistakes they did, Epic Movie was unbearable and I feel that should be lower than this. Juno and The princess are really the only ones that I liked.Go see this if you really have nothing better to do and just want to switch off and watch a pointless movie.(out of 10)Acting ***** Story ** Funny rating **** Overall *****I give it extra for the fact that I liked it better than Epic and Meet, but I won't be buying this anytime soon.",

But no! They had the guts to make matters worse and make another movie (they're currently making a \"Twilight\" spoof as well).At least the creators got the title right, for this was a disaster! And no, I'm not saying this is a disaster as in a lot of disastrous scenes happening (such as the apocalypse), I'm saying \"disaster\" as in this is a horrible film! I've seen better parody movies than this such as \"Spaceballs\", \"Airplane\", and hell, even the \"Scary Movie\" movies.\"Disaster Movie\" is a parody of the remake of \"Cloverfield\". Four friends struggle to survive a series of unfortunate events along with characters from movies that were popular during the time the film was being made (ex. Enchanted, Juno, Indiana Jones, The Incredible Hulk, etc.) The jokes were corny and too YouTube Poop-related. In fact, the only scene that made me laugh is where Hannah Montana gets crushed by an asteroid (considering I'm a heavy hater of that show), but even that can't save this \"disaster\". But this movie gets even worse once you get to the end, where all of the characters sing a song of having sex with characters of the same sex orientation. That is considered PG-13 material?! This is almost as ridiculous as those sex references from \"Transformers 2\", another PG-13 movie.This movie is the worst thing since soap operas.

Rest of the movie: medium good: Hannah Montana dying was medium and the Sex and the City fight was good and funny, Chipmunks and Enchanted princess was funny and the museum sequence was somewhat boring and Dance off was funny, now F**K Song was funny and the movie ended good.",

            "content": "There are two enigmatic writers of these kinds of movies: Jason Friedburg and Aaron Seltzer. They've written all of the spoof movies that have released in the recent years sans Superhero Movie. Each of them has received an overwhelmingly negative response from moviegoers, but this could be getting the worst rep.The fact of the matter is that this movie caters to a specific audience. If you enjoyed, let's say, No Country for Old Men because of it's plot and acting ability, you will not like this film. If you enjoy movies for comedy value, you may enjoy the movie. However, this movie is mostly stupid comedy, such as a cow coming out of a tornado to land on Iron Man trying to stop it. If you only laugh at witty, pertinent comedy you will not find this movie enjoyable at all. If you think, for example, that the princess from Enchanted getting hit by a car not knowing what kind of \"creature\" it is, is \"lazy\" then you won't enjoy the movie because you're too busy criticizing the movie to try to enjoy it. There are several jokes that aren't as shallow. For instance, Wolf's monologue in the beginning of the movie is hardly as slapstick. And after Matt Lanter's character, spoofing Jumper, accidentally lands on Prince Caspian's (played by Ike Barinholtz) sword, he calls Will \"the man who ruined Star Wars\" which could either be a reference to Hayden Christiansen who was the lead in \"Jumper\" or it could be a reference to the fact that Matt Lanter played the animated Anakin in Star Wars: the Clone Wars.Many people's first beefs with this movie is that not all of the movies spoofed are disaster-based movies. The \"disaster\" in the title refers to the movie written by Friedburg and Seltzer, not the movies that they spoof. High School Musical is far from a disaster movie, no? The point I want to make with this movie is that this movie is far from the worst ever made. You can't honestly say that you would rather boil your eyes than watch this movie. That's just weird.",

So if they could ever edit out the crap and replace it with some better stuff down the road then this movie could someday be redeemed.It is a shame really, since this movie could have been a LOT better if it was properly edited by the director. I think the directors of the MadTV show should have been able to do a lot better then this.I don't understand why a review must contain so many lines, but I will do my best to add them if IMDb really wants to wast the space.",

I didn't care for the script writing in terms of the way she exits the movie (no spoiler here). Likewise, the writers could have given her more to work with in her Hannah Montana bit.Ike Barinholtz as Beowolf is not to be missed. I never new this guy had such talent until seeing him play about a dozen side-splitting characters in this film.Vanessa Mannillo and Matt Lanter are such great eye candy for you and your girlfriend to watch during any lulls in the movie that you can't give this less than 8 stars out of 10.

It is a husk of a film with no creativity or thought put into it, just mindless references that pad out the painful runtime. The premise of this movie is a group of young adults run around whilst the world is ending and the protagonist tries to win his girlfriend back, although very little of the runtime is actually dedicated to progressing this storyline. Instead, we are treated to embarrassing dance sequences and a series of skits featuring characters from other IPs - without being hyperbolic I would estimate that maybe 80% of the film is just filler. My main issue with the film is how clever it thinks it is; poking fun at various franchises and showing off with constant nudity and perverted humour. There I really cannot convey through words just how difficult it is to endure this film.This film isn't worth devoting my energy to; it's lame, it's offensive and I understand that it's a spoof but that doesn't exempt it from being rightfully criticized. Without a doubt one of the worst films I have seen, yet an excellent showcase of what not to do in film. 1/10.",

Pretty much everyone intelligent enough to have an IMDb account knows why they're bad if they've ever seen any of the trailers. DISATSER MOVIE is, like all of them, useless. I didn't laugh. But it's still noticeably better than MEET THE SPARTANS. Despite the horrible costumes and puppets, it's not as horribly cheap looking and flimsy. It does have an embarrassingly empty \"comic dance off sequence\", but at least unlike SPARTANS it doesn't take up about 25% of the screen time. The JUNO spoof has a little bite to it, and Crista Flanagan's impression is pretty good. Nicole Parker brings some energy to the ENCHANTED spoof. It's not quite as jaw-dropping in its condescension to the audience as SPARTANS, which had the genuinely unbelievable moment where Friedberg and Seltzer thought they needed a narrator to explain that a scene where Carmen Electra wore a SPIDER-MAN suit was a SPIDER-MAN parody. Where SPARTANS had several gross-out gags that were too nauseating to be even vaguely amusing, DISASTER MOVIE has only one.Is it really worth noting that DISASTER MOVIE is an improvement when it's still painfully unfunny? Well if you had a student who failed all his classes and was also excessively disruptive, and he went to merely failing his classes, you'd have to say one or two nice things on parent's night.The best thing you can say about DISASTER MOVIE is that it's exhaustive check-list \"parodying\" of almost every major summer 2008 release might make it a somewhat effective nostalgia trip in another decade or so.",

I was mildly entertained.No, this movie isn't great, it was never going to be, but there are some very entertaining and hilarious moments in it, which kept me in my seat wanting more. The actors weren't great; we'll its pretty much the cast of MadTV but actress Nicole Parker pulled off her role well and stole the show for me as the Enchanted Princess.For me this movie wasn't great but it was okay \u0096 I guess it all really depends on what mood you're in \u0096 If it's silly and careless, then you will have a giggle \u0096 If it is serious and apathetic, you will hate it.

Cause no one is making you watch it.I'd just like to say...if this was fun to make and writers and directors had fun filmin g it, then keep it up!",

I loved her role there and she was the very reason why I was entertained. She is so funny and talented. Given the wonderful voice, acting, and looks, I bet she will do greater comedy movies and shows just like on mad TV! Weeeh! Can't wait for another movie like this! ^^ Anyways, for those who hated this movie, please just don't be so rude because there are actually people with different tastes, and who knows they will loved just the way I did?! In my opinion, this is better than meet the spartans & epic movie. I hope to see more Nicole comedy movies! ^^",

NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE A CERTAIN TYPE OF HUMOR TO WATCH THIS.What I mean is the gags and funny scenes are idiotic, simple, rude... but it's a parody. It just takes movies and makes a comedic stew out of them, there is nothing here to inspire you. It's a bit like some cartoon shows. Dumb comedy that does not need for the watcher to take notes or learn something from it. SImple as that. If you do not have the type of humor it takes to watch a parody, don't review it. I recommend the movie if it's a rainy day and you just wanna chill and laugh your a** off to mindless jokes, puns, and gags.",

The movie is FUN...it's STUPID COMEDY...just because every movie isn't Ben Hur or The Godfather doesn't make it total junk. If someone is going to read the reviews of this movie, then odds are they know what this movie is about. And they don't need to hear what a bunch of square eggs say about it, either. It would be tantamount to asking a bunch of 18-year-olds writing a review on the silent film \"The Birth of a Nation\". In my opinion, any review giving a movie less than 5 stars must've been written by someone not appreciating what the movie is all about (and should be discarded). In other words, people who shouldn't have watched the movie in the first place. Maybe every movie theater should ALWAYS have Driving Miss Daisy available to these people just in case they may be \"forced\" to watch something different. That being said, I loved Date Movie, Superhero Movie, and a whole list of other stupid comedy movies and I don't think this movie was that bad...though not that great, either. If you liked Meet the Spartans, you'll like this one. It is pretty fast-paced and there are some funny parts you'll remember. I really would give this movie a 6 or 7, but I'm upping it to an 8 because I don't think a 1.3 rating is fair AT ALL.Hope this helps someone.",

They put recognizable situations of other movies, and making them funny. The Juno chick is a good example combined with the Zohan. Or how they make fun of Sarah Jessica parker (everbody thinks it but nobody says it). In comparison with date movie, meet the spartan this is overall a better movie.Also sometimes it's to fake to watch, but that's part of the style. You could categorize it under exploitation movies for the 70's. They try to make money out of other 'good' movies. This movie is not meant to have exceptional style of camera/framing/shots, so do not criticize it. We all agree that it's not there best point to say the least.Ps. if your uptight and have a serious look on life do not watch this movie or give it any attention. You are not the focus group.",

Probably the first one being Don't Be a Menace... which was solid. Scary Movie 1 and 2, I thought were funny and enjoyable. Scary Movie 3 was horrid. Scary Movie 4 was a disaster. Epic movie, I'm not even kidding here worst movie ever made. I skipped Date Movie and Meet the Spartans just because I could tell by the previews they would be on the Epic movie level of worst movies. But out of sheer boredom I decide to watch Disaster Movie. It starts off rough, I hate 10000 BC and Amy Winehouse. They spoof pretty much everything from Juno to Alvin and the Chipmunks to Iron Man to Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda. There are certainly some questionable scenes that are flat out not funny or just horribly done but whatever I wasn't expecting much going in. But I give it a 10 because everyone else gives it a 1. If you watch Epic Movie and this back to back you will see this deserves a much higher rating, it's also better than the ones I listed up there after Scary Movie 2. I like the singing portions with the kids from high school also because it's funny. It's definitely better than the crap they have been pumping out the last 3-4 years.",

The best thing about it was the memes, with users poking fun at the whole thing, This film was dreadful, but I liked it because it was so much like so many of the other films in my genre.\n\nIt was probably not even bad, it's just so close to the ones I love.",

The comedy in this film couldn't appeal to the lowest common dominator. the acting, what's the point of talking about the acting, it was like the actors just came on the set, didn't give a rats arse, just read there lines and then drunk their sorrows. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are scum of cinema, they honestly don't care about their craft and the audience and it shows with this atrocity of a film, it uses cheap humour, like Amy Winehouse being a drunk vampire. but the worse thing about this film is the ending, honestly I cant write into words how cheap the ending was. The thing that pisses me off the most is that the film mocks film which are 100 times better than this film, for example no country for old men which is a fantastic film by the Coen Brothers with unbelievable cinematography by the legend which is Roger Deakins. This is the worse film of all time, no film can be as bas as this, even if you tried you couldn't. This film gets 0/10.",

Yep, it's one of those movies. The first time I saw disaster movie I actually didn't think it was bad, but that was because I was roughly ten. Then I watched it again, and realized it was terrible. And with all the movies I've been reviewing, nothing has gone below a five, so I thought I'd just break a little history by reviewing my worst movie yet. That being said Disaster movie has tiny, tiny moments. It'll make you chuckle, but cringe from the stupidity shortly after. And I don't care if the second half was pure comedic gold, nothing can redeem the first thirty minutes of this movie. I don't know why these parody movies continue to only paradise good films, but it's even worse when the scale between those movies and this is so far. Every film in this movie, even the Love Guru and fucking High School Musical are better than this. And at least movies like Epic movie or the scary movies are mediocre to surprisingly good films, but this is just crap, and probably the worst parody movie I've ever seen. It's not just movies, which is another huge flaw. It's parodying dozens of celebrities, movies, to just stupid things in general. None of these things make you laugh like they should. It's not making points that the movies we like are bad under a certain light that is comedical, it's mostly poor shock value, and alongside painfully bad jokes. If you do laugh it'll be over something stupid and forgettable. Seeing a random Batman talk about how he spend the whole day on Amazon or Beowulf talking how he's not gay because he's business partners with his friend Paul in an antique shop. As far as the acting goes, I can't really say. It's like trying to examine a picture while it's covered in shit. The writing is so bad nobody could do it well, so how could I possibly critique what couldn't be done right? Yeah, it's bad, but the script I honestly believe could have been written better by a third grader. And another thing, this movie goes to random. By the second half your used to really immature style, and by then the movie is dead, but at least your used to it. But you could be watching a normal scene, then a character from a movie you may or may not have seen (there's so many movies, if your not a avid movie devotee, you won't understand a least a fifth of the dialogue) will pop up, say something stupid, will make you cringe, will then die by shock value, and as it fails the scene will move back. I imagine this movie probably was rushed, or something really bad happened, but seriously, this is inexcusable. With parody movies, they make fun of themselves, the movie, and in the end just take a serious scene and twist it into something to chuckle at. Some characters are meant to be exaggerated versions of the other characters, and some remain somewhat serious. With this, everyone is bat shit crazy, there's seemingly never ending poop jokes and people dying randomly and violently, and your just reminded of what better movies you could be watching. Not to mention main characters come and go at any moment, like they wanted more shock value deaths and stupidity added into it. If I had to say there was one good moment, it was the princess from enchanted. She actually parodied her character, and although did stupid shit, didn't annoy me, and made me chuckle at her voice and some lines that probably weren't even in the script. The most ironic thing is the title, it describes the whole movie. And I hate to use the word \"stupid,\" in an argument, as it generally makes whoever said it look unintelligent themselves. But this movie is just blain stupid, no other way around it. The only people I could see liking it are kids, (hence the reason I liked it the first watch, but children shouldn't grow up with shitty movies like this, so don't let them watch this,) and the unintelligent. Not saying someone out there couldn't completely turn their brain off, let a bunch of dumb jokes go, and still find the movie kind of okay, but I don't think anyone can argue when taking the movie seriously that it is bad. Next to Vampires Suck, this is the worst of the worst. Parody movies I feel can be done well, if executed correctly. I could easily sit back and chuckle at some dumb lines from the scary movie series, or even Epic movie. If I reviewed those I'm sure they wouldn't rank up that bad, but those I feel had actual intelligence behind it, while also giving something for the immature kids who'll see the movie. This, nothing. Sure, you'll laugh at some parts, but cringe soon after. Laugh at the stupid stunt double being shown (cause that's not been done by every other parody movie) just know you'll probably be sighing in stupidity moments later. This is the logic of the movie. The guy wakes up with Flavor Flav who just banged his wife, he leaves, you find out she's stingy because apparently they broke up, then she asks him if he wants to take it to the next level. What? That's not funny, it wasn't even a joke, it's just there to be stupid! There I said the word stupid again, but this movie will make an entire audience idiots by just sucking you into this bullshit movie where a bunch of half naked chicks run on screen, one claims she shit herself, then run off screen. Anyway, huge thumbs down for this movie.",

This movie is NOT supposed to be stupid, ridiculous and silly. This movie is a parody movie, meaning that it's supposed to be funny, and words can't describe how unfunny it is. I saw some reviews that say, \"If you saw this movie in the theater, expecting something other than something ridiculous, than you're going to hate it.\" Well, guess what? If I was expecting to see a stupid movie in the theaters, you know what I would do? NOT WASTE MY TIME WATCHING THE MOVIE. Everyone who saw this movie in the theaters expected something funny were disappointed by it, simply because it fails miserably at being funny and watchable because it's directed by the two worst directors in film history.

            "content": "Disaster Movie is, as they say on the internet, exactly what it says on the tin. The film is a massive collage of movies put together to try to create something funny; putting recognizable characters on screen and saying, \"Look, there's [this character]. He/She has had a recent film which is relevant to today's youth and pop culture.\" The result fails.\r\n \r\nDisaster Movie begins with the dream of the main character, Will, played by Matt \"The Clone Wars\" Lanter. In his dream, it is told that the world will end on August 29th, 2008 (ironically, the film's release date). \r\n\r\nDuring Will's Sweet Sixteen party, a bulletin comes out that it is indeed the end of the world. Now Will and his friend's Calvin, Juney (Juno), Lisa (played by Razzie nominated Kim Kardashian) and the Enchanted Princess (from Enchanted) have to fight their way through reference after reference to save Will's cheating ex-girlfriend Amy and possible save the world. Why he still cares for her is beyond me. \r\n\r\nThe characters are way beyond dull, there are absolutely unmemorable. I can barely remember their names. The one characters who stands out would be the Enchanted Princess, who alternates between quirky, annoying, sometimes funny, badass and just plain weird. \r\n\r\nThe script doesn't seem to care about the films its referencing. Not parodying, referencing. The storyline is only made in order to show these second-hand copies of popular movie characters. In fact, some of the films mentioned in the movie themselves aren't good or memorable. How can this film stand the test of time when it makes references that are outdated even six years later? The answer is it doesn't. \r\n\r\nThe film also takes an almost mean-spirited ribbing of the movies and even celebrities. In other parody films, for example Young Frankenstein, the work being looked at and parodied is given the utmost respect upon the transfer to the screen. In films like this and even Airplane!, the comedy is almost all original and comes from witty dialog, background jokes and outlandish scenes. This film does none of that. Instead, it says, \"Here's Batman. He's not acting like Batman. He has a pratfall. Laugh.\"\r\n\r\nWith all that said, this unfunny mess of the movie mash-up gets my vote for one of the worst movies of all time. All I can say is that the film makers of this film, who also released other films such as Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans and Vampires Suck, need to take a lesson out of the book of Mel Brooks. \r\n\r\nAnd for those out there who have just watched this, go watch Spaceballs. Not the greatest but you'll enjoy it a whole lot better. \r\n\r\n1/2 out of ****\r\n\r\n(I should also note that the Princess does have the best line of the movie; \"You know, they say that the first kill is supposed to be difficult. But I find it easy. In fact, rather fun.\" This line, to me, may be the only worth watching thing in the movie.)",

There's no excuse for the greedy, self indulging, laziness that the filmmakers here have compiled. Let me take a few moments to name them.\r\n\r\nIf I ever find Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer, the 'directors' of this so called film, I will kill them. So many good filmmakers are struggling to get on their feet and make their movies, and Friedberg and Seltzer are making trash and have no problem. They are also the writers of the so called 'movie' and are indeed members of the WGA. They should have their membership revoked for tainting the spirit and dignity of writers everywhere.\r\n\r\nOf course, they also produced the film, and here's a list of other producers that I wag my finger at: Jerry P. Jacobs, Peter Safran, and Kenny Yates. Shame on you for going out and actually doing business with people in order to get the film made, edited, and distributed. Shame on you.\r\n\r\n'Original' music by Christopher Lennertz, Cinematography by Shawn Maurer, Editing by Peck Prior, Casting by Tara Duncil, the list goes on and on and on, right to the payroll accountant.\r\n\r\nBut worst of all, the people who actually gave their money to these filmmakers, who do not actually have a credit in the film (I'm supposing they didn't want their name to be associated with it), whoever invested and executive produced this film, you are the lowest of scum. You are the epitome of bad taste, and indignity. I hope, for your sake, that I never meet you.\r\n\r\nTo the readers: Don't see this movie. Do NOT support this movie in any way, shape, or form. Do NOT give money to this movie. After all, they keep making more because people keep seeing them. On flixser, the percent of people who claimed they would not see the movie was 70%, the people who claimed they would see the movie was 30%. That 30% is too high. Please, stop bad filmmaking.
