            "content": "I honestly don't see what the big fuss over College Road Trip is. It wasn't a bad movie, in my opinion. It was actually really lovable, and even though it was certainly mediocre most of the time, and I felt as if at some parts they tried too hard to please the audience with mediocre jokes, it was still very entertaining, and contained a pretty good amount of laughable, and that's laughable in the humorous way, material.It was also nice seeing Raven Symone in this movie, because I am always used to seeing her in what she's famous for, That's So Raven, and it was enlightening to know she played a role, because I love her in that show. Also, even though Martin Lawrence isn't one of the best actors, and definitely isn't one of my favorites, he's not a terrible one, and if you ask me everyone in this movie could act well for their roles, to some extent. There were scenes where I felt as if the antics were outdated and some lines were just not pulled off to the best of the casts' abilities, but when it was over I ended up having fun with it, and that's what it was meant to be in the first place.It was of course no masterpiece, and it could have been handled a lot more professionally than it was, but doesn't a ton of movies fall under those categories, and yet, many people enjoy them. Overall, it was a good little movie, that isn't as horrible as the rating and negative comments let on to be, so if you're any bit interested in seeing this movie, go ahead, because it wasn't bad or disappointing at all.",

There is no swearing, there is no violence, etc. It's the way family movies should be. The storyline isn't the best nor is the musical score or acting however, it is not as bad as others deem it to be. I think too many people expect to be entertained by movies as if it was the first time being on a roller coaster. Those types of movies are jewels and should be praised as such however, these types of movies (college road trip) should not be condemned by seemingly heartless people who think they are experts in how movies should be. I often wonder if these people actually sit through and watch movies or just make bad comments because they don't like a particular actor. Oh well. I liked this movie.",

With \"Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins\",\"Wild Hogs\" and now \"College Road Trip\" under Lawrence's belt, i don't know how much more he can take. This movie is pretty standard \"Cheaper by the Dozen\" film. With all the sight gags and kiddy jokes about pigs and dancing, and, of course the soft spot for tolerance. Donny Osmond was straight forward in this film and Lawrence was really exaggerated as a goofy dad. Raven Symone played a OK part, but not a real big leap forward for the young actress. Of course, this doesn't mean the film is all bad. The movie, in its quirky way is funny. With its zany comedy style, like animal humor and kiss jokes...this film reaches to little kids. If you have young ones, this wont be bad for them, but for you...its okay.",

            "content": "Okay some of you may think of Raven Symone has someone who is not funny, and is over the top for the most part, like she is on Disney's That's So Raven(2003-2007), I'm amazed she still has a career after that. But her performance was memorable and not over the top. She plays Melaine Porter, a graduate from High School, who wants to go George Town college, but her overprotective dad police chief James Porter(the very funny Martin Lawerence) wants her to go to Northwestern, in hopes she'll be closer to home. He decides to on a College Road Trip with her, and that is all you need to hear. Raven Symone is not a truly great actress, but still manages to be entertaining, and avoids being called the worst actress ever. She and Martin Lawerence are funny together, they play off each other so well. It is also the funniest road comedy since Are We There Yet(2005).",

            "content": "College Road Trip was a pretty funny movie. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be but it was funny enough. It was well made. In the beginning I thought it was going to be bad the way the first half started but then it got really good. There were also a ton of great messages in this movie. Im not a big fan of Raven Symone but she actually did a pretty good job for her first big movie hit. I find her very annoying and it seems like she never knows when to shut up. I thought that this was a very different movie for Martin Lawrence. Although it was a different type of movie for him he nailed the part. A bad thing about this movie was that it seemed like it copied of of a couple movies in several scenes. One of the movies were Penelope. The direction in this movie was fairly good. The message was about being able to let your kids grow up and having trust in them. This movie does show that life does go by really fast. That fact is true about life going by way to fast. So in that case you should spend more time with your kids and live life to the fullest. I didn't like Martin Lawrences wife in the movie that much. I thought that she did a good job despite me not liking her. They also found a mother that looked a little bit like Raven Symone which was smart. One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when the father and daughter went sky diving. It goes to show you that a father can get along with his daughter and have deep conversations. The person I saw this movie with teared a little bit at the end. So I guess it was like a little bit of a tear jerker to some people and maybe you to. This is a perfect movie for you to see to if you are going to college soon. It was more of a little kids type of movie but also the whole family can enjoy it to. It really gives you a good outlook of what college is going to be like. The story was also very cute. Overall this movie was pretty good and a very cute family movie.",

Donny Osmond's character was so funny and I was glad my kids got a chance to see him since I was a big fan of him back in the '70's. The kids are big fans of Lucus Gabriel and Raven and I thought they gave great performances. Raven is such a talented person. I liked how her character in the movie was ambitious and determined to excel academically and still have friends and be pretty. We also enjoyed the scenes in the sorority with the stern Sorority supervisor. Nice to see all those college girls being supervised! And Grandma with her friends were big fun. The pig added a lot to the movie's fun and it was so cute. Although he did a fine job with the material, Martin Lawrence was a bit wasted in this movie. The kids didn't notice cause they don't know how incredibly funny he can be. The overall best thing about this movie was the music. The music had us dancing in our theater seats; we can't wait to get the sound track of this movie.",

I love Raven in this, she was the perfect pick! I can't imagine anyone else playing her character. Also Martin Lawrence's character isn't exactly how some dads are. But still, he did a great job betraying an over protected, police dad. And this is his first G-rated film! Can you believe it? So anyways, I loved this movie. Donny Osmand's character and his daughter are so annoying but that makes it even funnier! I loved it when at the end the daughter of Donny goes to the same college as Raven and they're neighbors! So funny. Loved the movie and the plot line wasn't the best. I know this won't be Golden Globe or Oscar worthy, but it'll definitely be nominated the the Teen Choice awards and/or at the MTV movies awards. If it doesn't get those nominations, I'll be kind of surprised. Anyways, if you want some good family fun, go see this movie! It's worth it!",

Well, I was traveling to another state so in the tour bus the driver played this movie. I prepared a playlist for my Sony Mini Disc filled of rock and more. Heck, I was traveling in order to attend a Faith No More concert.BUT FOR SOME REASON, I couldn't stop watching the movie. The reason? Martin Lawrence. I mean, come on, the guy makes the funniest faces on earth! Everything I looked up to the t.v. The man made extremely funny faces and it was justified by the cheesy but entertaining plot.The plot should equal plenty of craziness involving sex, booze, vulgarity but as it's a Disney movie, it needs to be family oriented, creative, having watered down jokes, and featuring silly comedy situations.I really enjoyed most of the clich\u00e9s and I don't feel guilty.I really laughed when the Asian guy made a funny face before singing, or when the sorority house mother used the taser gun against Martin Lawrence, the face he made cracked me up!Ahhh, I'm a goofhead and I admit it, I don't feel guilty about it, and I'm proud to say that I enjoyed this family oriented movie.Give it a chance, it has some family oriented humor but it's original and funny.",

            "content": "OK, this isn't the movie I would select if just my husband and I were going out for the evening. But WE aren't the audience for this- Disney made this for kids and tweens and YES even teens. I have 3 daughters 13, 11, 7, and this movie hit the notes right for THEM. The interplay between Raven's character Melanie and her friends was right on. There is a scene where Melanie's Dad (Lawrence) and she are in the car, and she is on her cell phone forever with their friends- it is so true to life and you would only know that if you've experienced this.In terms of appropriateness for kids, I can't think of anything in this movie that would offend. There is silly slapstick comedy that had adults and kids alike laughing. Kids who watched Raven on her Disney channel show loved watching her act in this movie. The Donny Osmond character was over the top and, according to my 7 year old, totally hilarious.Would I select this movie just for me? NO. But folks, if you are looking for a movie for the family to see, or something I could show a mixed age group, this is great. I could pick apart little things about the movie, but those parts of the movie I found to be silly or ridiculous were irrelevant to the kids. This movie both has a heart and is sweet in spirit. I wish more people would CONSIDER the AUDIENCE for whom the movie is intended when writing a review.",

Most of them focus on chasing boys. She is the positive role model parents pray for.My girlfriends and I love Martin Lawrence. The faces he pulls never get old. He's got charisma and as soon as he's on screen everyone is smiling. He's the kind of guy that lightens the mood and I know many many people who love seeing him on screen. How can you not like a guy that brings giggles with a gesture or funny face?If you have daughters take them to see this movie. It's a great kids movie.",

But my boyfriend wanted to see College Road Trip so badly, so it was his pick. We saw it tonite, I have to say that actually with several exceptions, this wasn't such a bad family film. As for me and my boyfriend alone to see it? No, uh uh, but I'm judging this as what it is meant to be, a family film. I know that these Disney family films get a little old, the story is played over a million times, but I realized something, the story is safe, so naturally they'll play on it. So honestly, it's not that big of a deal, as for some of the jokes? Some were not that bad, some were cute, but some were just, oh, god, Donny Osmond.Melanie is what you would call the perfect daughter, perfect grades, good morals, great friends, and has just got an interview with Georgetown University for acceptance. The problem? Her over protective and controlling father, James doesn't want to let go of her, so he tells her that they'll go on a college road trip and in the mean time he'll try to convince her to go to a school closer to home. But along the way he learns that maybe it's time to think of what she wants and to trust her.College Road Trip isn't a horrific film, I wouldn't put this into the bottom 100 on IMDb, believe me, you could do so much worse when it comes to a Disney family film. I know a lot of people are giving this film a bad rep, but honestly, it's worth it for the kids. It's cute enough for the family, has a good message, and isn't all so bad. Honestly, if it were not for Donny Osmond coming into the film and scaring 10 years off my life, I would give it a higher rating, but I think my rating is generous enough. For the family, I recommend, for an adult, you might wanna avoid. I'll be having nightmares for a few days of Donny and his daughter singing.4/10",

            "content": "I have never seen a Martin Lawrence movie before, and this movie did make me into a new fan. I have seen his material here and there, but his material never has grabbed me. But today, I went with my mother and my eight-year-old niece to see \"College Road Trip.\" I fully expected to be disappointed, but it turned out to be okay for me. Not the best and not the worst, but entertaining here and there.The story goes that Raven Symone is Melanie, who aspires to become a lawyer at Northwestern University in her hometown suburban Chicago, but gets a letter of acceptance to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Her three girlfriends are going, and she wants to go to. But her father James (Lawrence) fears losing his little girl, and wants to accompany her on the trip. Tagging along is her little brother Trey and their pet pig Albert, who hide in the trunk the first quarter of the journey. That leaves behind Mom Michelle (Kym Whitley).On the way, they stop at Northwestern University, and who do they run into - Donny Osmond as Doug Greenhut and Molly Ephraim as his daughter Wendy. Both have the same exact aspirations - She wants to go to Georgetown and he tags along with her. And when James and Melanie make pitstops, Doug and Wendy end up at those same stops. Doug and Wendy's annoyingly overperky behavior and singing and dancing are the highlights of this movie. They are so loud they make James and Melanie cringe, but they always pop up at the same stops. And when James' car breaks down, they get into Doug and Wendy's truck. But my real favorite part is when they lose Doug and Wendy along the way, get on a bus, and get all the Asian tourists to sing and dance to Frankie Smith's 1981 hit, \"Double Dutch Bus.\" As James and Melanie get closer, they visit James' mother in Pittsburgh, and James gets to come to terms with his long lost mother about letting go of children. Finally, they sky dive all the way to Georgetown, where, who else, Wendy becomes Melanie's roommate and then the two would head to Japan.Donny Osmond and the pig do take away from Martin Lawrence's and Raven Symone's performances. The pig is funny, especially when Lawrence disguises him as a baby in a quaint hotel where no pets are allowed and then makes a big mess at a wedding taking place at that hotel. Osmond's preppy, squeaky clean, teen idol image is played to great exaggeration, his character's wife and daughter add to the perkiness. But Martin Lawrence and his family are sadly undermined by Donny Osmond and the pig, which is the film's major weakness. For 83 minutes, it is not super slow, it does go fast, but there are bumps and curves along, and then there is forced sentiment, when Melanie finally gets to say goodbye to her parents, amid the manic craziness. Martin Lawrence, like many comedians of his generation who turn to movies, is more of a comedian and less of an actor whose performances often resort to overacted slapstick.",

            "content": "Martin Lawrence is hardly the height of great cinematic performers, during the 90's the success of comics such as Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler prevented him from getting to many high profile movies, against the likes of Carrey who is actually funny, Lawrence just didn't represent that much of a Box-Office threat. Now that a lot of those dudes are attempting more serious films, Lawrence has recently had two films released in close quarters the passable Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins and this abomination. Basically the film sees Lawrence ferry his daughter around the country in order to help her find the perfect college with several other family members and assorted characters lagging behind. All are suitably \"crazy\" in that stupid Hollywood way, and Lawrence clearly sees himself as the star of this woeful effort, gurning and overacting his way through as many scenes as possible. Bottom line....the man ain't funny!!! A film similar to this was made not that long ago with Cedric The Entertainer called Jonson Family Vacation. It wasn't great but at least it had a few chuckle worthy moments, I don't think I was amused successfully once during College Road Trip, bar by the sheer poverty of imagination displayed by it's clearly juvenile screenwriters. The director is Roger Kumble who made the excellent Cruel Intentions just short of 10 years ago, and since has been gradually heading down hack road, he may have made a half credible film with Just Friends but 2002's The Sweetest Thing was simply not acceptable. However this is a new nadir for the man I once thought was at least semi-talented, here he directs with a bland eye and is clearly not enthusiastic about the product. Basically he wanted a bit of cash and this was the best way to get it. Comically inept and at times completely unwatchable College Road Trip is as weak a comic effort as I expect 2008 theatres will have to show, and should pop up quickly on DVD. It's an early but strong candidate for the years bottom 10, and may even be the ever irritating Lawrence's worst production to date. Sadly however one is almost certain it will enter the weekends top 5, and might even grab the coveted no.1 spot. Still when the reviews start flying it will drop fast like the dead weight it is.

I need an answer because quite frankly Martin Lawrence IS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE!!! Why does he just except the fact that he's a has-been, or better yet, go on The Surreal Life for crying out loud. This movie is a farce. The jokes and \"acting\" are stale as a slice of bread on top of the 'fridge and there's no real chemistry (or whatever YOU may call it) between Mr. unfunny-washed-up-comedian and Raven Simone who plays his daughter in a role so clich\u00e9d that it makes Paris Hilton look like an Academy Award actress. To add more insult to injury, they even parodied The Bucket List in an attempt to make it funny yet the only thing it does is make the film fall even more harder on its a** than it deserves.I've never in my life, since up to this point in my years of seeing movies, had such deep and profound hatred for Mr. Lawrence searing throughout my mind after seeing this film. This film, or should I say The Martin Lawrence Vanity Project\" should be burned in a fire along with the imbeciles who had the gall to force this crap-fest. Don't see this movie if you value your sanity as well as your date. You will regret it. Trust me.",

My friends talked me into seeing this (instead of a good movie), promising to each pay me the cost of admission if it turned out to be as awful as we had been warned. \"Oh, the critics are never right,\" they said. Yes, the critics are right about this film, and at least I won the bet, but it was a painful way to earn 50 bucks. Lawrence just makes a fool out of himself. The premise is worthless to begin with: frantic dad sticks his nose in his daughter's business as she begins her college career. There is no humor in that. Somehow, it gets worse. The writing is abysmal; of note are the endless babbling speeches by Lawrence, pre-school intelligence level gags, stereotypical characterizations that went out with the dinosaurs, and horribly executed slapstick scenes. The direction is zero: it just poses Lawrence in your face like he's doing a stand-up routine, while other nameless characters do a lousy job of trying to pretend they think he's funny. The amateurish cast's irritating over-acting makes this cinematic flop even more torturous. The audience, like the daughter character in the film, will want to escape from Lawrence's manic ramblings as quickly as possible. Expect this one to have a very short general-release lifetime before it gets shelved in the 99 cent video grocery store bin, and mercifully forgotten.",

You knew during the opening credits that there was going to be comedic bumps in the proverbial road, with the two main characters fighting all the way until they bond again at the end of the film.I wasn't too impressed with the humor. Again, due to the predictability of the movie. I probably laughed six times the entire movie. Most of the jokes you've seen in other movies, and are done better in those movies. The gags were not set up well if you ask me, and you knew the punchline was coming just as the comedic scenes were starting.I also did not like the performances of Donny Osmond and his on-screen daughter played by Molly Ephraim. There is such a thing as being too over-the-top, and they were. Personally, I don't think either were happy with their roles, as, to me, they seemed to have forced their performances a bit too much.On the other hand, Martin and Raven-Symone were pretty good together, and did a fairly good job at being a comedy team -- with her being the \"straight man\" to Martin as the comic. I've flipped passed Raven-Symone's TV series when they are in the middle of a comedic moment. In the show, she seems to be forcing herself at the comedy. Here, she was more comfortable.The supporting cast was completely under used. It seemed to me that characters showed up when needed in the script. There was very little character development in these characters beyond of being told who they were, and how they related to the main characters. Mostly, the supporting cast were either used in comedic scenes, or to set up plot twists.As for the soundtrack, it's mostly well-known tunes heard for decades, sometimes in other movies and television shows. There isn't any of the major names from Disney like the Jonas Brothers or Miley Cyrus on the soundtrack. It's the original artists you hear like the Jackson 5. You also only get one original song in the movie, sung on-screen by Raven-Symone in a funny moment on a tour bus filled with karaoke-singing Japanese tourists. The song itself was upbeat, and is easy to dance to, but you won't be singing it for weeks after.I couldn't really get into this movie, thanks to it being so predictable. However, there are a few good laughs and pretty good performances from Raven-Symone and Martin which barely carry the movie. I would have to say save this one for a rainy day when there is nothing else on.",

But when her overbearing police chief father insists on escorting her instead, she soon finds her dream trip has turned into a nightmare adventure full of comical misfortune and turmoil.Let's face it: I liked the movie a lot. I expected to have a good time while watching this movie and the film exceeded my expectations. To be honest, this is the first movie in quite awhile that has never made me laugh so much! Not even \"Superbad\" was funny to laugh out loud as much as I did here!And I'm speaking of the truth. I really enjoyed the film. It was hilarious and probably because things aren't meant to be taken seriously nor literally. Almost every character in here goes over the top. Each character tries so hard to make people laughed that it, at least, worked for me!I was won over by most of the characters in here, especially the pig. Raven-Symon\u00e9 and Martin Lawrence both have a great time here, as well as many cameos. The jokes are childish but who cares. It's a movie for the family. What did you expect?! With all the laughs, there are also a few sweet moments in here that would make you choke. Overall, if you're expecting something thought provoking or comedic genius, this movie is not for you. For others who want to have a fun time with their family for a mere 80 minutes, this movie sure will entertain the HELL out of you and I'm not being sarcastic.

Despite his good-intentions, James' interference and over-protective nature turns this road trip into something of a nightmare.There have been many road trip films over the years (all of varying quality), but none that I've seen so far have managed to be quite as annoying as College Road Trip...The underlying base of the story isn't actually too bad; an over-protective father struggling to let his child fly the nest and being unable to bear her being too far away from him. Deep, deep down there is quite a sweet story here, but unfortunately it's suffocated by a bunch of loud and annoying characters (Donny Osmond and his daughter were the worst examples and are two of the most irritating characters that I've ever witnessed on film). It's almost as though the filmmakers genuinely believe that by putting a bunch of unbearably happy people on the screen that this will somehow make its audience happy, but the truth is that a lot of these characters had the opposite effect on me; none of them felt believable and the relentless cheeriness and stupid dialogue that many of the characters were given never felt believable and a lot of the time it made me feel as though I was watching caricatures rather than real people. The film does seem to have all the clich\u00e9s in the book; over-protective father, weird kid, rebellious teen who has awkward relationship with dad, but whom inevitably bonds with dad et al. The problem with this film isn't necessarily its clich\u00e9d approach, but more to do with the fact that the filmmakers don't make any of the characters or the dialogue funny. Character development is also a bit hit-and-miss; for example the weird kid is just weird and given no real development and isn't funny.The performances (if you can call them that) aren't up to much I'm afraid - but that's mainly because many of the actors are either shouting or screaming at one another. When watching this film it often felt like it was trying too hard to be funny and the more it tried the worse it got.There are one or two nice moments between Lawrence and Symone which prevent it from getting the minimum score, but other than that this is an unbearable, unfunny, loud and annoying film that would have greatly benefited from a less is more approach being employed.",

I thought the chemistry amongst the cast was excellent and helped a lot too. So many times you watch these films and the family is so poorly cast but I thought all the actors they got for the roles were a perfect match (even the actress that played Martin Lawrence's mother). When I saw in the previews that the family had a crazy pet pig I thought it was ridiculous and silly, but once you watch the film you quickly fall in love with the cute piggy. I don't think there is anything awful about this film, it's a harmless good time. In my opinion, it also had a very good message about parenting, being a teenager these days and understanding each other. So few films have valuable family messages to take away from them. And from time to time you might actually find yourself tearing up at the sentimental parts unless you're cold-hearted. Frankly, after watching this I don't get the hate other reviewers and critics have towards the film. I can't remember the last time I've seen a really good teen movie - they make so few that are actually worth viewing. It's also one of the few recent Martin Lawrence films I've enjoyed from beginning to end. And Donny Osmond was TOO funny! This should be must-see for parents whose kids will be leaving and going away to college and are finding it hard to let go. Watch this Disney movie with the whole family and have a good laugh.

            "content": "I admit that I was really looking forward to this film. I love Disney Flicks, Freaky Friday, Parent Trap, The Princess Diaries, some of my all time favorites and the previews on this one just looked fun. In some ways I suppose it was fun...I laughed despite myself but I think it had more to do with the fact that it was simple and dumb. I should have known Disney would be using the film to flaunt around their Disney girl (Raven-Symon\u00e9) and not her flaunt her well. I think the casting in this film was probably 85% of the problem with it...they were entirely wrong. Technically all the pieces were in place for a slapstick, funny adventure across the country in true Disney style. Add in some wacky characters and a cute and sweet moral and how can you go wrong? I don't know but it does...it goes very wrong. The whole film just reeks of being stupid. It has funny moments and maybe really young kids will get a bigger kick out of it but Disney has this talent for making films that ANYONE can enjoy in a family not just one demographic. The pig was the most comic relief in the film and probably one the best actors on top of that.I've hardly seen Raven-Symon\u00e9 in much outside of her young years on The Cosby Show but she was downright awful in this movie. Her over exaggerated facial expressions and terrible acting just about ruined the entire film. She was just not good in the role in any way. Her performance is a big fat ZERO out of ten. She doesn't even have the portion of talent that other Disney girls have had including Lindsay Lohan, or Hilary Duff. Martin Lawrence has a certain brand of comedic talent and sometimes it really does work but it does not work in a Disney film. It felt like he was holding back and just really was kind of overbearing and didn't really fit in. I will say however that Symon\u00e9 and Lawrence did have some decent father daughter chemistry but neither one of them did much for the film. Eshaya Draper is cute as brainy kid with big ideas and Lawrence's son. He does a better job than Symon\u00e9 so that is saying something. I did however like the casting of Kym Whitley as Michelle Porter (Lawrence's wife and Symon\u00e9's mother.) She does a decent in a small role but I especially liked that she is a tiny little size six 20 year old like most aging, unattractive men in movies get as wives. I mean she is still beautiful but she is real, and a bigger actress so bravo for casting a real woman in the role. Donny Osmond was actually one of my favorite character as the over the top loud obnoxiously happy fellow college father Doug Greenhut. I mean his performance is ridiculously over the top but you know that and you understand that and it's funny.I can't say they handpicked the director very well either. I think in director Roger Kumble's very short big screen career he had one big hit with Cruel Intentions and has stumbled ever since. He just doesn't seem to handle chaos well or his cast very well. The comedy is slapstick in nature but without any real backing to it so it makes you laugh but laugh and then shake your head right after. The moral is in tact and it is kind of sweet and has a tear jerking moment in the end but mostly you just want it to end. Really little kids might enjoy this one but you'll groan from beginning to end. The film is sugary sweet and about as G as it can get which is awesome so let your kids see it but sit this one out, it's a Disney stinker. 5.5/10",

There are no dirty jokes and the depiction of the characters is somewhat goofy and G-Rated, but this is an entertaining film. If you are looking to something to watch while hanging out in the frat house, this is probably not your choice, but a good pick for families with children. IMDb ratings have been rather unkind, my rating 6 of 10 stars.",

            "content": "I caught a sneak preview of College Road Trip last night and I must admit, there were a lot of belly laughs at some of Martin Lawrence's overprotective antics. He really played the over-protective father role to a T. The theater was packed with kids and parents, who both seemed to enjoy the movie on different levels. I saw a bunch of father's in the theater sitting with their daughters and really relating to Martin Lawrence's grief on-screen. You could tell they really empathized with the instinct to protect their children and the idea of them growing up too fast. The little boy and pig were really cute and a great addition to the story. I have loved Raven from her days as Olivia on The Cosby Show, so it was great seeing her no the big screen. Overall, I really enjoyed this film for the light-hearted jokes and real father-daughter moments.",

The score is amazing, the timing is just right and it'll surely make up for the dull movie. Without that sequence, I probably would've rated it a 3/10. I know they try to make it appealing to kids, but if it the movie was more serious then I say we could've had a great movie. If you're looking for a good Disney film, then I say skip it.

He plays an overly-protective father who wants his daughter (Raven Simone) to stay close by as she decides what college to attend, and when she gets an interview at Georgetown - 700 miles from home - he tries to sabotage her chances of getting there.Sure, he's playing the role as a father who doesn't want his child to suffer the injustices of life, and that's very admirable, but the dirty stunts he pulls on his daughter is just downright disrespectful to her. If he raised her right, he wouldn't have anything to worry about. But this comes from a single guy who doesn't have a daughter to send to college, so maybe some parents ARE this over-protective...mine weren't, but maybe there's others that are.Basically it would've been a lot better WITHOUT Martin Lawrence. Raven Simone did an exceptional job, and the pig in the film is just funny...I like pigs.Basically I'm saying it's a great family film, but not one you'd want to watch with your buddies. But then again, a film like this wasn't created for that kind of audience anyway.",

It's a waste of time to watch, and a waste of time to review.I love Martin Lawrence, Donny Osmond, Disney, and good G rated films, but this is just a bad movie.I knew it was bad from the very start, when the mock-trial featured high school students with clown like wolf and pig noses rubber banded to their faces. It got worse from there.I would have walked out after the first twenty minutes, but I forced myself to watch the whole movie so that I could see all of Donny's appearances. His performance is OK, more of the nerdy white guy shtick. There is about one funny joke in the entire movie, and Donny gets that at the very end. But nothing could be worth that wait. It's such a shame to see Donny's immense talent and charm absent from the screen for 30 years, only to surface in this wasteland. I'm glad to see him on the screen and his name in the credits, but I can't see how this is a good career move for him. Also, I wish he would be proud of his white style and awesome 1970s accomplishments, rather than trying to show that he's hip enough to recognize that he's nerdy. Trying to prove you're cool by showing that you recognize how uncool you are seems to be silly.Why does Disney schlock out these supremely lame live action movies? With such masterful dramatic treatment of stories like Alice in Wonderland and The Little Mermaid, they have shown they know how to make a great story. It's sad.As others have said, the pig is a complete waste. The Einstein little brother is a complete waste. The wife is a complete waste. The crazy grandma is a complete waste. Basically I'm just compulsively typing to say that almost nothing works in this movie on any level.Raven gives us one good performance of \"The Double Dutch Bus,\" and Donny gets one funny joke. Other than that, this film is horrible. For the last half hour I was fidgeting and internally screaming \"I can't take it anymore!\" Boy was I glad when it was over.",

Title seems to suggest patience, which viewers will need upon watching this road wreck. Martin Lawrence plays a police officer who plans a road trip with his college bound daughter. Rushed premise followed by road movie clich\u00e9s with an obvious ending. Director Roger Kumble does his best despite cheap production values. Among his best work are Cruel Intentions and the underrated Just Friends, which are opposite scale to this trash. Lawrence is basically the target of a bunch of unfunny pratfalls that come off as forced. Raven-Symone is the target of her father's constant screw ups. We can sense the union coming from the opening credits but they must get on one another's nerves for two hours first. Annoying supporting roles by Donny Osmond, Eshaya Draper and Will Sasso as if their contribution could add one ounce of worth. This film is bad on so many levels, and easily Kumble's worst film since The Sweetest Thing, so if it's an improvement on that travesty then it's not much of a stretch. As oppose to stating the need for parents to accept the independence of their children, it becomes your standard road comedy road kill. Score: 2 / 10",

            "content": "Police Chief James Porter (Martin Lawrence) is a dedicated family man who has long hoped that his daughter Melanie (Raven-Symone) would attend Northwestern University so she'll stay close to home. Upon Melanie's graduation however, she receives a letter from Georgetown University saying they are interviewing waitlisted candidates and give Melanie three days to arrive in Washington D. C. for an interview. While Melanie is ecstatic, James does not want have Melanie that far away and decides to take Melanie on a road trip looking at other colleges in the hopes of dissuading Melanie from Georgetown which causes friction between the two in addition to various road trip mishaps.College Road Trip is a live-action comedy from Walt Disney Pictures and produced byy Andrew Gunn who had previously produced other teen skewing Disney films such as the 2003 remake of Freaky Friday and superhero comedy Sky High. Written by Carrie Evans and Emi Mochizuki during their tenure at the Disney Writers Program, the final draft was credited to Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio whose prior credits include Bubble Boy, The Santa Clause 2, and the 2008 adaptation of Horton Hears a Who before setting up shop at Illumination and writing a number of their films including the Despicable Me series. It's not unthinkable that something like this from Disney could've worked (as seen in either of previous attempts such as the two Goofy Movies, Freaky Friday or Sky High) but clearly something has gone very wrong in the final product.The movie sets a very confused tone from the opening where we're introduced to Melanie's character performing a mock trial for a case based on The Three Little Pigs with her serving as the defense attorney for \"the Wolf\". The movie is littered with strange little jokes like this such Eshaya Draper's younger brother character Trey who borders on being a mad scientist despite being about 10 or so, exaggerated shenanigans involving James having his deputies pose as injured college students to dissuade Melanie from Georgetown, or a running gag involving a pig who's used for hackneyed slapstick shenanigans with some pretty sloppy CGI integration to boot. Being a road movie the plot is by its nature pretty thin so it needs to either make up for its inherently anemic nature with either character or gags and it doesn't do either very well. Martin Lawrence's James Porter is massively unlikable as a funhouse mirror exaggeration of a helicopter parent and while the movie tries to pluck the audience's heart strings there's only so much showing old home movies will excuse invasions of privacy, breaking and entering, or putting \"plants\" in her path so she'll be nudged towards a decision. But Martin Lawrence isn't the only bad performance here as Donny Osmund has a prominent supporting role as Doug Greenhut who's portrayed as a deliberately annoying borderline Stepfordian caricature who is not only just barely more annoying than James, but shows that Osmund's comic aptitude hasn't improved much from Goin' Coconuts almost 30 years prior. I will say that Raven Symone is okay as Melanie and her cover of Double Dutch Bus that's sung on a Japanese tour bus (don't ask) is filled with energy and gives her something besides the underwritten part she's stuck with. What laughs I got from this movie mostly came from supporting cast such as Draper's delivery as Trey or Will Sasso's brief role as Deputy O'Mally.College Road Trip didn't aspire to be much, but when you compare it to similar movies that Disney themselves have made covering the same type of material College Road Trip has no right to be as bad as it is. The movie goes through the well-trodden road comedy cliches in short order and doesn't create relatable or likable characters so we end up stuck with very annoying \"noise\" masquerading as entertainment.",

Every Thursday night, America tuned in to a sitcom about affluent black people. Raven Symone was on that show. She was Olivia. \"College Road Trip\", in its own quiet way, pays homage to the Huxtables, since Melanie(Symone) wants to study law(Clair Huxtable(Phylicia Rashad) was an attorney). Melanie chooses between Northwestern and Georgetown. Most, if not all, movies about young black people with a dream, dream about being a basketball star, a singer, or a step-dancer. Black people go to college. But not in the movies. That's why Melanie's choice of lofty schools may take you aback. This is virgin territory. And how does \"College Road Trip\" handle its story about a matriculating black teen? Not very well. One word. Pig. They needed the pig because the filmmaker realized that dad's obsession with his daughter was starting to get creepy(e.g. Tony Danza in \"She's Out of Control\"). The pig doesn't save \"College Road Trip\". But Donny Osmond does. He's Neil Patrick Harris in \"Harold and Kumar go to White Castle\"-funny. For most of its running time, \"College Road Trip\" is either innocuous or schmaltzy. When Osmond and Molly Ephraim grace the screen, they hijack the film, as a tight-knit father and daughter unit from hell. By no stretch of the imagination is this witless road film any good. But you shouldn't dismiss \"College Road Trip\" so easily. When Chief James Porter(Martin Lawrence) and his wife give a couple, a white couple, advice about raising a child. That's something new. The film is colorblind. But we're not. If you watch a lot of movies, you'll understand that this role-reversal is quietly revelatory.",
