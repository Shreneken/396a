Ricky Riker (Drake Bell) is a typical teenager, except that his luck is worse then most. Basically, he's a loser. He's been in love with beautiful Jill (Sara Paxton) for years, but is sure she doesn't know he exists. Even his best friend, Trey (Kevin Hart), is willing to throw him over for another clique. But Rick's life changes dramatically when a genetically enhanced dragonfly bites him during a school field trip. In a flash, he becomes the Dragonfly. He can scale buildings, and has immense strength--though he's still a klutz. Rick isn't sure he has what it takes to be a superhero, but it's up to him to save the city from the villainous Hourglass (Christopher McDonald), who literally sucks the life out of people, and threatens to harm those dearest to Rick. Mazin, The main spoof is spider man they also spoof Batman, the Fantastic Four, and the X-Men.I love this movie , well the last spoof movie I Saw was Disaster movie, that was oh my god, that movie was SO bad ) (That is one the reason why i like this more then I Should)The superhero movie is one of the better spoof to come out last year, I am not saying it the best spoof.I enjoyed it!",

It's a million times better than the likes of Epic Movie, Disaster Movie and many other pathetic attempts to parody other films. Unlike most films that spoof others this one gets the job done without overdoing it and at times it even felt like an actual Superhero film as well as talented cast members that fit their roles perfectly and the villain \"The Hourglass\" was good considering it was a parody film. It also has various comedy elements of its own such as Lucille's funeral and many more moments that I would mention but I don't want to spoil the film. At the funeral The priest says \"We are gathered here today to say goodbye to Lucille\" then all the people at the funeral shout \"Goodbye!\".If you plan to watch this film do not judge it on the low rating. It's a pity most parody films weren't as good as this.",

From the start to the end it is just full of outrageously funny gags that will have you laughing out loud but only if you like spoof films! A masterstroke was to bring in the king of spoofs Steve Martin as the grandfather. This has everything in it from straight spoof humour to the now usual toilet gags and the one in this film where Rick Riker is on the ceiling of the bathroom in his Grandmother's flat on Thanksgiven Day in his costume is as funny as it is excruciating! Just before that scene you see his grandmother stuffing the turkey that is absolutely ginormous and clearly far too big big for the oven but it still ends up being cooked and carved) with a whole manor of things including a live cat! This is a MUST-SEE film for lovers of spoofs everywhere!",

Yeah this movie is not for everyone, and of course this movie has alot of these stupid unfunny poop, puke, fart jokes but because of the fast-paced nature of the film you won't get bored, Oh you didn't like this joke, Here's another one, Oh you didn't like that joke, Oh take this one then.I had such a good time with this one, Great jokes with a lighthearted tone and an amazing cast, Seriously, I didn't expect Leslie Nielsen to be in this movie this much, Like I thought he would be in it for like ten minutes but no, He's actually one of the main characters, That was a pleasant surprise, May he rest in peace..And the villain is unironically great, Like seriously, Christopher McDonald didn't have to go this hard acting that character, He was seriously great, Like I could see him and his plan in a real superhero movie!I highly recommend this one, Don't wanna repeat myself too much but yeah, This movie is just dumb fun and that's all I want from a superhero spoof movie, Mostly great jokes with a great cast and not-very-bad special effects, Get some friends, Get some popcorn and enjoy this ridiculous hilarious underrated movie.",

To be perfectly honest, I saw this film because my best friend rented it, so I hadn't had a chance of reading any of the reviews online. If it had been the other way around, I probably wouldn't have seen it, and that would have been just a darn shame. So what if some of the situations are a little extreme? So what if it all seems a little \"Oh, come on!\" - that's what this type of comedy is all about! I had a good laugh watching this, and I strongly suggest this for a friend night...but definitely not the movie I'd see on a family night.",

It is a little hit and miss but I think that adds to the final feel to the \"dumbness\" to the film. I think that this is worth a view for the fans of Scary Movie and haters of the later \"movie\" movies. Overall this is a good and funny film good for a laugh once or twice and I give it a fair rating of 65%.",

And that happens SO rarely with comedies lately. Seriously, I laughed hard.But, it was one of those things that will entertain but never be a classic you'd bother watching again.

            "content": "If \"Superhero Movie\" gives you the same giddy, guilty-pleasure feeling as \"Airplane!\" and the \"Naked Gun\" movies, it's no accident. Some of those movies' personnel \u0096 who were also involved in two lesser \"Scary Movie\" sequels \u0096 show up here. (Those include writer-director Craig Mazin, who happily has come a long way from 1997's abysmal \"Rocketman.\")The movie's title says it all. It's a comedy that takes a well-known hit (in this case, \"Spider-Man\"), turns it inside out, and uses it as a clothesline for gags. In this parody version, nerdy Rick Riker (amiable Drake Bell of cable-TV's \"Drake and Josh\") gets bitten by a mutant dragonfly, turning him into...well, take a guess. Meanwhile, a well-meaning scientist (Chris McDonald) turns nasty when his experiment backfires and he finds he must sap others' life-blood in order to keep himself alive.As is typical of such parodies, the movie's approach is as subtle as a spitball gun. Some of the gags are terrific, and some are groaners. But they're all fired at such a rapid pace that after a while, you have no choice but to give in to the silliness. The characters are like shooting-gallery ducks waiting to have parody lobbied at them. Best of the bunch are Rick's well-meaning but dotty uncle and aunt (delightfully played by Leslie Nielsen and \"Happy Days'\" Marion Ross). The most pitiable is a take-off on disabled genius Stephen Hawking, who seems to push Mazin's bad-taste button over and over ad nauseum.This leads me to the movie's most required caveat. While the flick is mostly silly fun, it pushes its \"PG-13\" rating right up to the edge of the \"R\" cliff. The movie is larded with sexual gags and profanity abound, and what might possibly be cinema's longest-ever flatulence gag.But if you can bear up under the cringe factor, \"Superhero Movie\" is mostly high-powered fun. Nifty comedy here runs neck-and-neck with bad taste. It's a close race, but the comedy wins.\"Superhero Movie\" is rated PG-13 for countless sex and drug references, crude humor, and adult language.",

With superbly executed parody, intelligent observational humour, and the actors (barr Nielson) playing it straight; Superhero works on just about all levels. It even works as a film in its own right!With the major narrative being based on the Spiderman Movie, this film incorporates touches from other such features, but not as badly as Robin Hood Men In tights did: they are integrated with aplomb and subtlety. The added touches (reminiscent of the Naked Gun movies) with celebrity look-alikes being hurt is amusing; but the major laughs are in the SM spoofing. I will not mention individual scenes, as they work best when not telegraphed or looked for; but you will see them, recognise them, and probably wet yourself because of them. :P Very enjoyable.

Sadly however, despite the presence of David Zucker (who was involved with Airplane!, Top Secret and The Naked Gun movies) it still suffers from the fault most recent spoofs have...mainly it's more dumb than fun! The fault mainly lies with the gags. It's simply not funny enough. Some of the jokes do work, such as the nail gun scene, but other parts simply fall flat. The X-men spoof for example, or the whole farting sequence. Blazing Saddles this isn't! One of the key things about the best spoof movies, like Airplane is that although the dialog is extremely funny, the cast for the most part play is completely straight. This makes it even funnier. Even when there is simple dialog in the foreground, there may well be funny things happening behind the cast. Again funny. The other key thing is that they all have a plot of sorts, to hang the gags on.The recent trend seems to be to take scenes from various movies, THEN try and spoof them. As a result the so-called plot of these movies very rarely exist. Another flaw these movies have, is that some of the scenes were actually funny in the original versions, and in most cases even funnier than the spoof scene! The cast try to get into the spirit required, but with a lot of unfunny dialog and scenes, it's hard to get worked up about it.As recent spoof movies go, it's not as bad as Epic Movie, Date Movie, or the awful Meet The Spartans, but considering that some people involved here have made good, funny movies in the past, it's nowhere near good enough.",

Yes, Leslie Nielsen is getting old, but his deadpan is still the best. You'll see a lot of other faces you'll recognize, and they do a great job of keeping things moving and never really letting you relax until something equally outlandish occurs. I suppose there were too many fart and pee jokes, but the filmmakers know they aren't playing to a highbrow audience here. And I guarantee you this is the first - and probably only - movie you'll ever see with snail-rape! So if you enjoy well done bawdy, slapstick humor, Superhero Movie won't disappoint. I'm not sure many of the jokes will be memorable or become classics in future years, but for 85 minutes you'll forget your troubles and laugh out loud. Today that's a lot to receive from a movie!

Oddly, while writer/director Craig Mazin had a number of superhero movies to get inspiration from, for the most part his story is simply a comic look at the first \"Spider Man\" movie. Mazin does execute the movie with a good swift pace (there's seldom a lull), and with the relentless bombardment of gags, it is inevitable that at least a few are funny. While there are some genuine laughs here, for the most part I didn't laugh that much. There are too many scenes of people being hit and knocked about, which gets tiresome pretty fast. A lot of gags also feel like they were dreamed up and written down before a lot of thought was given to them - thought that would have determined that they weren't funny gags. Also, the amount of scatological gags suggests that Mazin was pretty desperate and couldn't think of more gags concerning superheroes. Not the worst spoof movie that's been made, but it is a big disappointment.",

It's like a guilty pleasure for me, like Scary Movie or Meet the Spartans, it's so stupid that it's funny, so naturally I thought Superhero Movie would have been the same. Now there's one thing that could make me absolutely hate a stupid comedy, the over-doing of fart jokes, the gross jokes. I don't mind a quick one sometimes, it's bad taste, but I can deal with 2 seconds and just let it go. But Superhero Movie has a lot of dumb jokes, seriously, within the first 20 minutes of the movie you have a vomit joke, a poop joke, and a fart joke. Not my taste and not what I would consider funny, there are a few things in here that made me laugh, but it's a big disappointment for those who are expecting Scary Movie humor that's actually funny.Rick Riker is a nerd who goes on a field trip with his class, he's in love with this girl, Jill, but isn't noticed by anyone. But on this trip, he is stung by a dragonfly and is given super powers. He learns from his uncle and a strange man, Professor Xavier how he can save the world with these powers. He'll need them to fight against the Hour Glass Man, who wants to kill thousands of innocent people.Would I recommend Superhero Movie? Not really, it's more of a rental, I'm sad to say that I spent 7 dollars on it. Was it a total waste of time, no, I wouldn't say so, but I just hate gross jokes. There are a few moments where you do laugh, like when Rick walks in and catches a flying nail, his uncle is stunned and Rick says that it's easier than it looks, and then his uncle shoots a nail at Rick's friend and stabs him with it and says \"No, it's not\". You might like me get a couple laughs, but I think you'll probably be disappointed like me, unless you're a junior high kid who still likes the fart jokes.2/10",

            "content": "This is a really stupid movie! Most of the jokes do not work, and most of the jokes that click, aren't extremely great either. The actors is what brings this material together, and it's certainly not the lead actor Drake Bell. His brand of bad Nickelodeon acting can only take him so far, and he is not good in this (However, he's more professional than any actor from Meet the Spartans). The backup actors like Leslie Nielson and Kevin Hart keep this one barely afloat, along with a few amusing jokes.Rick Riker (Drake Bell) is a high school nerd who's got his eye on popular girl Jill Johnson (Sara Paxton). When on a school trip, Rick is bitten by a mutated dragonfly, which gives him superpowers, quite similar to those of Spiderman. He must save the girl when the bad guy takes her, and get into wacky adventures that don't make the audience laugh meanwhile.This really shouldn't have been called \"Superhero Movie\". A more appropriate title would be \"Spiderman: The Spoof\". Unlike the Scary Movies, this one focused almost entirely on being a spoof of Spiderman, with a tiny bit of X-Men thrown in just to show of the comedic abilities of Tracey Morgan and Regina Hall (from all 4 Scary Movie's). Unlike a few other recent spoof films, which were so bad they will remain nameless, this had pretty good timing on it's jokes, and it didn't try to smash together too many movies. The slapstick was done pretty well, but it's all been done before, and it's been done much better. Very few of the jokes are lingered on too long, which is a big positive. Some lines were taken right out of other parody films, such as a joke with Leslie Nielson, straight out of \"The Naked Gun part 2 1/2\". There were too many jokes relating to internet sites, such as 2girls1cup, youtube and Myspace. Way too often, \"Superhero Movie\" goes for the easy joke, so it had the potential to be better...it just wasn't.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 75 mins. PG-13 for language, sexual/crude humor, drug references.",

It mainly spoof spider-man and other superheroes like Fantastic 4, X-men and many more as the background spoof. Since it mainly spoof on Spider-man, you will know what the story is. I find it quite disappointing, I expected some fight scenes which it does not really feature. The trailers look promising but it does not really live up to my expectations.Overall: It is not a bad spoof movie but it can do much better of developing the story. It is currently one of the best spoof movies recently. Those who like spoof movies including Meet the spartan, they should catch this. Those finding a comedy, probably this would perk you up and do not expect much. Those who totally hate spoof movies, they should probably rent it on DVD if they feel bored.

There were some gags that went a little over the top, not to my surprise, but there were other gags that brought back memories of those classic movies. There was not so much pop culture as the other vomit-enducing movies like Meet the Spartans and other atrocities, but of course there was, but we cant blame them, there was pop culture references back in the Airplane movies as well. It put a smile on my face when i heard a good phrase in this movie: \"Fruitcake?\" \"Oh no, i just haven't met the right woman\". You have to be honest, that definitely brings back some hope that the producers are trying to bring it back. I say give it a try, I own all the great spoofs on DVD, i know my spoof movies, and i can guarantee that this movie is not as bad as others may say it is, and it totally makes Meet the Spartans and Epic movie look the garbage they are.",

On hiatus from his Nickelodeon series Drake and Josh, Drake Bell makes an appealing superhero who just can't quite get his act together.Usually on Drake and Josh, Bell leaves the comic stuff to his stepbrother on the series, Josh Peck. In Superhero Movie, Bell shows he also has a flair for comedy that's not just confined to playing straight man for Peck.It's also the culmination of a remarkable story of recovery. A couple of years ago Bell was seriously injured in an automobile crash and for a while there, flirted with paraplegia. Seeing him in a very physical role is both heartwarming and inspiring.Bell got a nice ensemble group to support him, including Marion Ross and Leslie Nielsen as a pair of frisky senior citizens who are Bell's aunt and uncle. And there was an actor named Miles Fischer who looks like Tom Cruise's doppleganger, I swear I thought Cruise was making an unbilled cameo, Fischer did him so well.And you have to love a film where the villain is given the 'Douchebag of the Year' Award.

Rick's class is on a science trip to The Amalgamated Genetics lab and this is where we get to meet the 1st star name in the film, Brent Spiner (Data in Star Trek TNG) playing Dr Strom. Rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly which is where his powers come from.We meet our next big star names at Rick's home, his Aunt Lucille (Marion Ross of Happy Days fame) & Uncle Albert (Leslie Nielson of Airplane, Police Squad & Naked Gun fame). And we're introduced to Carlson on the Amalgamated Board of Directors (Dan Castellaneta from The Simpsons) who is then very promptly killed. We're told Rick has slept for 5 days & get some cheap, crappy sexually orientated scenes designed to get the teen male audience paying attention. The Stephen Hawking lookalike's scene is painful to watch and is really a bad idea that doesn't work and isn't remotely funny.We get another Spiderman spoof (Rick catching the girl and all the planets) but the movie should end right there as Jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball which would have broken her skull and killed her stone dead. You get to see Rick's 1st powers emerge (gripping ability & speed) then his 1st rescue which goes very wrong. We also get an incest reference which is in very poor taste indeed. We get a flashback and a Batman spoof in which we discover Rick is solely responsible for the death of his parents. Spoofing Spiderman again Ricks Uncle is shot with Jeffrey Tambor (from Hellboy) playing the Hospital Doctor. We then get an X-men spoof (done very badly as Patrick Stewart is about as white as they come), Barry Bonds is played by yet another lookalike.We meet Invisible Girl (played by Pamela Anderson looking stunning in her costume!). Ricks 1st outing in his costume (once he fixes his ability to see & breath through it) is another Batman spoof. The Tom Cruise Youtube interview clip is played by yet another lookalike (and not a very good one at that). There are lots of modern references like Youtube, Facebook & Wikipedia all showing that the movie is set in modern day. There's a very weak gay joke (never a good idea to do those either) when Jill is helping Aunt Lucille make Thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene isn't very funny, just infantile.The Aunt farting scene isn't particularly funny, just incredibly childish. Anyone finding it funny must have a mental age of about 12. She's killed and then we have a really bad necrophilia joke (is there no topic these people won't try to use to get a cheap laugh out of?) at her funeral, and the even worse cremation joke.We get the 2 worst lookalikes in the whole movie (Prince Charles & Nelson Mandela) at the awards ceremony and if you didn't already know how infantile or stupidly lowbrow this movie is Landers wins the \"Douchebag Of The Year\" award. Landers is revealed as The Hourglass (in a really bad scene where the same girl manages to run past Jill twice in the same direction).Obviously The Hourglass is foiled, Jill is rescued from certain death and the only funny scene in the whole movie is the final one.",

Plus it is a cut above anything those talentless hacks Friedberg and Seltzer ever did, Disaster Movie and Epic Movie are in my opinion two of the worst movies ever made, Meet the Spartans didn't fare that much better and Date Movie while the best of them had a lot of major problems.Starting with the good things about this film, there are some funny moments. The pheromone-crazed lab animals attacking Riker was literally impossible to resist especially, same with the nail gun scene and the Thanksgiving Dinner. Secondly, thanks to the director's easy going style, the film moves along quickly. Then we have some amusing patented schtick from good ol' Leslie Nielson, same with the talented Keith David(the \"what Empire City needs is more cops... and a hooters\" line was hilarious), and even the soundtrack wasn't tortuously awful as the ones in the Friedberg-Seltzer films.However, there are many things wrong with it as well. The story, spoofing Batman Begins, X-Men and Fantastic Four is complete and utter nonsense, thankfully it isn't irrelevant to the title like Disaster Movie and Epic Movie were, but there are parts when the plot is non-existent. Secondly, perhaps it was intentional though, but the dialogue is incredibly cheesy, and the sexual crudity and fart gags got a little too much. I was warned though the film was far from subtle, and I have seen very unsubtle movies like Garbage Pail Kids Movie and Freddy Got Fingered, both of which are worse than this movie, but the gags often verged on overkill here. All with the exception of Leslie Nielson and Keith David, a vast majority of the acting ensemble is laughably bad. Drake Bell is a bland lead, while Pamela Anderson is pretty awful as the Invisible Girl and Sara Paxton displays a limited amount of acting ability as Jill. The sets and costumes are tacky, the camera work was slapdash, and the film is too short for my liking.Overall, a film that wasn't as bad as I thought, but it could and should have been much better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

They might say its 1 hour and 20 minutes but it doesn't even get to that. The previews took up 10 minutes and then 1 hour of the movie. I really wasn't that mad that it wasn't that long because if it was it would have been worse. The only thing that really saved this movie were a couple of the characters in it. I think that one more bad thing about the movie was that they didn't show enough of the good characters in it. Sara Paxton really was the one who saved this movie. She was very pretty once again. I think that out of all the scary movies, Meet The Spartans, Epic Movie, and Date movie this was the worst yet. They all also seem to be very short for some reason. I think that they run out of things to put in the movies. In this movie thought they kept making each scene to long. In each of the funny scenes it was like wow thats funny then 20 seconds later it would still be going on, it was like just end the scene. When you go into this kind of movie though you have to expect a short and stupid movie. This was probably the most stupid movie I have ever seen. This was definitely not worth 10 dollars on going to see. If you need to go see this only spend like 7 dollars or wait for DVD.

But this movie did not have that, for the most part it had gags a bit over done, but nothing that would make you want to feel sick to your stomach. Drake Bell wasn't very funny, because he was trying way to hard to be like Tobey Maguire, and he comes across like Maguire's half brother, and he ends up being a little over the top. Now I admire Sara Paxton for not trying to be like Kirsten Dunst, she plays her part in her own way, I hope she will have a long career ahead of her.

Musician/actor Drake Bell's comedic timing is impressive, as is that of spoof legend Leslie Nielsen.The humor, a combination of slapstick, wordplay and sex/toilet humor, is hit and miss, but hits more often than one would think. The spoofs range from clever to cringe-worthy, but the story and resultant gags follow the source material (mostly 2002's Spider-Man) very well, as opposed to the \"Hey, look! It's -insert character- from -insert popular movie-!\" style other recent spoofs have adopted. The only roadblocks are the childish fart jokes (one of which spans minutes) and dated pop culture references (Tom Cruise? Barry Bonds? Really?).It's due to all of this that the movie, although flawed, can appeal to fans of any kind of spoof movie, be it twenty years old or two. It's also able to fulfill the expectations of the average moviegoer while giving some clever surprises to those who don't see them coming.

            "content": "Superhero Movie is the latest in the line of spoofs that seem to fall off a toilet assembly line. As if you didn't already realize it just yet, this movie spoofs superhero movies. The main comic book movie the film is parodying is Spider Man, but there are a few other ones thrown in just for namesake. The story follows Rick Riker (Drake Bell), an unpopular student who is in love with his neighbor Jill Johnson (Sara Paxton) and dreams of being with her. His parents died when he was young and he is raised by his Uncle Albert (Leslie Nielson) and Aunt Lucille (Marion Ross). But one day on a class trip to a science organization Rick is accidentally bitten by a dragonfly. Soon he begins to develop superpowers and really has no idea what to do with them. Meanwhile an insane scientist Lou Landers (Christopher Mcdonald) has created a DNA moleculizer, and after using it he realizes he has the power to kill people by touching them. Landers turns himself into the evil arch villain Hourglass, and begins plotting to take over (what else?) the world! After learning this Rick turns himself into the green-suited superhero Dragonfly. He begins fighting crime, and with the support of his family and new girlfriend goes after Hourglass.So the clouds are beginning to lift...Oh I'm sorry I didn't mean for this movie. No Superhero movie is as awful a spoof as they come. What I meant is that I checked the box office charts for this opening week. Superhero Movie only made $9.5 million on opening week and is sure to be gone from cinemas soon. And that may mean that finally audiences are learning that these garbage spoofs are not worth admission price. If this keeps up maybe there will be no more spoofs, and that would sure brighten up the world (and our theaters).Now for the review of Superhero Movie. Let me start off with the positive: Leslie Nielson is funny in this movie. Nielson is a pioneer in the genre with spoofs like Airplane and the Naked Gun series. He knows how to make the jokes work in a spoof, no matter how vulgar or just downright stupid they are. I would love to watch a new spoof with him as the main character, but that's just not the case for atrocious alleged parody. Other than Leslie Nielson this film is an absolute abomination. Hollywood knows that these movies make big money at the box office so they just keep financing and releasing these cheap, lazy, and unfunny spoofs just for a quick cash-grab. Superhero Movie is cheap looking with awful special effects and costumes. The acting is very bad especially from Christopher Mcdonald who literally makes a fool out of himself. The usually likable Drake Bell also gives a bad performance, but you can't really blame him because he deserved more than this trash since he, unlike the writers, has actual talent.The jokes in Superhero Movie are an all time low in flatness, and consist mostly of unfunny farts, injuries, vomiting, a few celebrity jokes, and pop culture references. This is really it with these pop culture references, I've hit rock bottom with them. It is not funny that all Apple's products start with the letter \"i\"; the cellphone commercials where you have \"your 5\" haven't been on TV in months, so it was stupid to resurrect it. This movie did not have nearly as many pop culture references as the below dreadful Meet the Spartans, but they are still really unfunny and just plain lazy in execution. Speaking of lazy Superhero Movie tries to parody Fantastic Four, Batman, and even X Men. Well the X Men parody is supposed to shift the plot, but only lasts five minutes and is so abysmally written that there's nothing to laugh at. Pamela Anderson actually shows up for literally 20 seconds as Invisible Woman. What's the real point in that? However here's where this movie now officially hits an offensive low never before discovered in the spoof genre. Superhero Movie offensively makes fun of Stephen Hawking with jokes about him wanting to commit suicide and having no self esteem. The film also makes fun of Barry Bonds' steroid use, and also cracks a racist joke on Nelson Mandela. That is not funny it's just insulting because these idiotic filmmakers obviously have no respect for any person that is smarter or more important than them. The fact that kids get to watch these jokes unfold on a pretty silver screen makes me yearn for the future.Superhero Movie is a downright terrible spoof and it should get flushed down the toilet along with movies like Meet the Spartans, Date Movie, and Epic Movie. I give Superhero Movie a 0.5 out of 4, but only because of Leslie Nielson. Hopefully these spoofs stop getting made, since this one is the first sign of weakness at the box office.",

The 2 worst comedy movies ever made! I mean, true, they did make Scary movie, that was pretty good, but they also made the sequels, which kind of sucked. (Except for #2, that was OK too) But strangely enough, Superhero Movie worked so much! I was actually hoping that they would make sequels, and I still kind of do! They have a lot of material to work with, Now with Thor, Captain America, etc, they could make a sequel and still make it a great movie! All the jokes and slapstick are hilarious and it has Drake Bell which is pretty interesting because he was a kids show actor on Nickelodeon at the time, in fact, he promoted this movie on Nickelodeon at one time. So it was pretty cool to see him in the role. I recommend this movie by a longshot, it is a must see for comedy movie fans and comic book movie fans. So check it out!",

To a certain extent, some are willing to give the benefit of a doubt, though mostly squarely on this one because such arguments often warrant it. On the other hand, you could do worse in a much recent AND similar movie like...for example \"Meet the Spartans\". The less said about that one the better (this is to those who are still reeling from the aftermath of said movie). There are tons of poke-fun-at-moments in Superhero, but they're mainly aimed at Spider-Man; obviously a \"revenge\" of sorts, especially Spider-Man 3, the only thing in this movie I can give credit for. However, this film, ultimately, is guilty of the usual suspects of its predecessors: Cookie-cutter-comedy syndrome on a conventional level of ordinary American cheese. If you can't see past the truth that is so blatantly in front of you at face value, then you either need glasses or are just out of touch with reality COMPLETELY.",

It was actually somewhat clever, and Leslie Nielsen is always a great addition to any spoof movie (reminds me of the classic \"Naked Gun\" movies).I actually suggest people should see this film for some cheap laughs, and I can't believe I actually just typed that.",

Luckily for me, I'm not one of them!This movie is a laugh riot, from start to finish. Primarily spoofing Spider-Man, as well as taking digs at various other such films, it follows the story of Rick Riker (Drake Bell), a high school student who gets bitten by a genetically engineered dragonfly, and becomes........\"Dragonfly\", a superhero destined to save the world from evil! The primary antagonist is Lou Landers, a successful entrepreneur whose experiment to genetically alter himself in order to stop aging goes wrong, and he has to kill people in order to survive. Oh, and there's also Rick's love interest Jill Johnson (Sara Paxton), who's basically the film's equivalent of Mary Jane-Watson.Most of the scenes, particularly the ones spoofing \"Spider Man\" were achingly funny and had me losing my breath due to the sheer number of times that I laughed. I love this movie, and I'll recommend it to anyone who doesn't care what the deriders of Scary Movie, Epic Movie or any spoof movie think. (American Pie included)",

Aside from some stereo-typically dumb American teenagers, spoof master Leslie Nielsen returns and does his best but the script's not up to the Naked Gun greatness he's used to here. There's a few very funny bits, but not as many as there are bits that just aren't funny.

            "content": "Scary Movie 1-4, Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Not another Teen Movie and Another Gay Movie. Making \"Superhero Movie\" the eleventh in a series that single handily ruined the parody genre. Now I'll admit it I have a soft spot for classics such as Airplane and The Naked Gun but you know you've milked a franchise so bad when you can see the gags a mile off. In fact the only thing that might really temp you into going to see this disaster is the incredibly funny but massive sell-out Leslie Neilson.You can tell he needs the money, wither that or he intends to go down with the ship like a good Capitan would. In no way is he bringing down this genre but hell he's not helping it. But if I feel sorry for anybody in this film its decent actor Drake Bell who is put through an immense amount of embarrassment. The people who are put through the largest amount of torture by far however is the audience forced to sit through 90 minutes of laughless bile no funnier than herpes.After spoofing disaster films in Airplane!, police shows in The Naked Gun, and Hollywood horrors in Scary Movie 3 and 4, producer David Zucker sets his satirical sights on the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy lampooning everything from Spider-Man to X-Men and Superman Returns.Shortly after being bitten by a genetically altered dragonfly, high-school outcast Rick Riker (Drake Bell) begins to experience a startling transformation. Now Rick's skin is as strong as steel, and he possesses the strength of ten men. Determined to use his newfound powers to fight crime, Rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of The Dragonfly -- a fearless crime fighter dedicated to keeping the streets safe for law-abiding citizens.But every superhero needs a nemesis, and after Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) is caught in the middle of an experiment gone horribly awry, he develops the power to leech the life force out of anyone he meets and becomes the villainous Hourglass. Intent on achieving immortality, the Hourglass attempts to gather as much life force as possible as the noble Dragonfly sets out to take down his archenemy and realize his destiny as a true hero. Craig Mazin writes and directs this low-flying spoof.featuring Tracy Morgan, Pamela Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Jeffrey Tambor, and Regina Hall.Hell Superhero Movie may earn some merit in the fact that it's a hell of a lot better than Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie. But with great responsibility comes one of the worst outings of 2008 to date. Laughless but a little less irritating than Meet the Spartans. And in the same sense much more forgettable than meet the Spartans. But maybe that's a good reason. There are still some of us trying to scrape away the stain that was Meet the Spartans from our memory.My final verdict? Avoid, unless you're one of thoses people who enjoy such car crash cinema. As bad as Date Movie and Scary Movie 2 but not quite as bad as Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie. Super Villain.",

Honestly, every scene is one non-sequitur after another. In other words, each new scene has no relation to the one before it. With mostly humor that aims directly between 6 and 15 year old kids. Well this new \"Movie\" has humor, cleverness, and coherence from start to finish. There is a wide range of gags from slapstick to bathroom humor. The charismatic cast from the \"scary movie\" franchise also helps. Drake Bell is funny and fit in more ways than one for the role of a superhero. While Christopher McDonald looks like he's having a ball as the super-villain.The story focuses on the plot from spider-man with other superhero movies tied in just right. Rick Ricker gets bitten by a dragonfly and has the powers of super strength, wall climbing and flight. He lives with his Aunt Lucille (Marion Ross) and his Uncle Albert (Leslie Nielson, whose hard not to laugh at) and with the help of his friend Kevin Hart, he vows to save the world and win the girl of his dreams Jill (Sarah Paxton). With the help of Producer David Zucker there are laughs and special effects to keep you smiling through its very short running time. The the only real drawback, is the shortness of other big name parts. The movie poster is clearly false advertising. Such as Pamela Anderson as the invisible girl. I myself would want to see her as DC super villainess \"Giganta\", then you could easily poke fun at the \"Lit\" music video where she eats the band. She's only there for about a minute. There's Craig Beirko from Scary movie 4 as Wolverine for only 2 seconds, and Simon Rex as Human Torch for only about a minute. Regina Hall and Tracey Morgan only stick around for about 6 minutes as Mr. and Mrs. Xavier. Would have been funnier if Regina Hall would play \"Storm\" instead, then they could have a super power fight or something. but this isn't their movie, its Drake's. So I say see it laughs and satisfaction is a guarantee.",

Nice chemistry, as each actor hits their marks and builds on it . Of course, you need a great villain to have conflict, and you have it in Lou Landers/Hourglass(Christopher McDonald) is fun as the evil doer ! This veteran actor is having a fun time, and it shows, he really helps make the film payoff. Needing victims to feed his energy level,Hourglass must replace his energy daily and takes his victims life force, and they expire. Dragonfly must overcome the guilt of the death of his Aunt(Marion Ross), he blames himself .But , there are many jokes , sight gags,physical humor, with precision timing . Craig Mazin doesn't dwell on each stunt, but moves to the next one ,and the next , very well done.Marion Ross and Leslie Nielsen have a very memorable scene with an exchange of repertoire that is Fantastic !!!

            "content": "Don't get me wrong, this movie is good to some extent, or - fairly - less bad than the recent parodies. I'm just talking about an unmistakable telltale that these movies evoke about Hollywood these days.Parody means conscience more than comedy; to observe problems in the art's history (previous movies), or mock at the art itself (the cinema). It assures, more than anything, that cinema has become a living creature in the modern culture, so why not to satirize it, with love.In the last years, the number of parodies got bigger, and the level of making them got awful. So, what's the telltale of that?! It's not about how - for instance - the writers and directors have become suddenly stupid! No. It's openly about an industry that lives a crisis; whereas the production has to be speedy and inflate. Hence, the artistic level has become something not basic, to keep up with the crazy beat of making many many movies in no time.So, being a movie-maker in Hollywood of today is really shameful. Because it has turned into a city of hastiness, bankruptcy, and endless movies in the same time. Therefore, with great deal of sequels, prequels, spin-offs, remakes, based on already worn-out old works.. etc. the parodies, which are a spoof of all the above, mirror nothing but more bankruptcy. It seems that the deal now is mostly about taking an already made material, not creating original one, doing it very quickly; so farewell to quality too, and - to make it worse and worse - producing big quantity of that every year!Accordingly, (Superhero Movie) is a miniature of a big picture. Being unoriginal, rushed and dirty; as the easiest way to write, all are marks of an ill industry. I believe that in any age, the original idea can't disappear, it's the production companies that don't search much, or have a time in the first place; especially while making 400 movies per year in the 2000s vis-\u00e0-vis 200 movies per year in the 1980s!Speaking about the 1980s, look well at the parodies of it, then compare them to the ones of today. Simply the ones of today are far more and less good. For instance, between 1998 and 2008 about 13 parody movies were released by major studios, including nasty flops like the Date, Epic, Disaster, Meet the Spartans series, and some of the Scary Movie series, which makes you long for one Naked Gun movie; at least it was fit for more than one viewing, or a viewing for that matter. It is, as a whole, a tragedy not of \"quantity more than quality\", but \"quantity beats quality\"!(Superhero Movie) is some witness about how, in the 2000s, the superhero movie has been in fashion as it has never been before. It revenged on one of their worst in my book: (Spider-Man - 2002). It's funny at parts, offensive at many, and fart's lover in between. So while being not as tormenting as its likes lately-it's tormenting anyway. However, its most important witness is the one it didn't intend; about how Super Immature the industry of Hollywood has become!The parody here is a part of the disease more than a conscience to diagnose it. Obvious disease both ways.",

            "content": "It has not been a good couple of years for the parody. First, going back a couple of years, following the successes of the early \"Scary Movie\" films. With recent entries including \"Date Movie,\" \"Epic Movie\" and \"Meet the Spartans,\" it would be easily understood if the audience tuned out on \"Superhero Movie.\" Indeed, even the title seems to follow the same trend.However it would be a shame if the audience did paint this entry with the same brush.Using \"Spiderman\" as its key story of inspiration, the film follows Rick Riker, a nerdy high school student who is madly in love with his next door neighbor. One day, while on a field trip, he is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly; from here, I'm sure you all know what happens. Spiderman becomes Dragonfly, and but for a couple of twists from the original story, the parody takes form.Now it would be misleading for me to say that every joke works: many don't, and others seem to go on too long. Such is the risk of a parody. However for the few that go on too long, there are others that seems to work very well.For instance, in a back and forth conversation with Lou Landers (Hourglass, who is a spoof of the Green Goblin): (Rick): \"I see you have a cut on your neck.\" (Lou): \"I met a girl...on Craigs list. I see you have a bruise on your neck.\" (Rick): \"Um...I met a guy...on Craigs list.\"A scene with excessive flatulence goes on too long, though in some ways it redeems itself when, while Rick is professing his love to Jill, her hair gets caught up in the 'breeze.' Its hard not to chuckle as a cheesy romantic moment is so soiled in such a deliberate way! In addition, there is a charm to the performance of Drake Bell here, in the role of Rick Riker. He is as awkward as Tobey Maguire was, but there is a humor to that innocence that works well in this parody, and helps excuse some miscasting (for instance, Leslie Nielsen) and twists (such as the X-Men twist) that don't work as well.The movie isn't without its flaws, but on the whole I found myself enjoying the film a great deal, and would recommend it to those who do like to watch parodies, and have been disappointed by the last few.",

Okay some of the jokes are tacky and a few in poor taste, but a good majority of them are real knee slappers, especially if you are in a silly mood. Yes, the story is as fresh as last year's daisies, but it moves fast and wi have you pausing to make more popcorn.The style of humor is obvious from the time you see Leslie Nielsen in the credits, playing the uncle of the nerdy hero (a charming Drake Bell) and husband to aunt Marion Ross. The bullied Bell somehow becomes impeccably strong thanks to the sudden bite of a dragon fly and having a mysterious chemical dumped on him. If it isn't animatronic animals lusting over him, it's the ability to completely destroy a scientific exhibit in his school as well as beat up the hated bully and win the love of the class sexpot (Sarah Paxton) who is actually a sweet young girl.Then there's the Green Goblin like villain played by Christopher McDonald with sinister plans which motivates Bell into becoming the super hero. Decent special effects are more funny than impressive, but the pacing of the movie had me engrossed. Cameos by famous character actors are a lot of fun too. Had I been in a bad mood, this quickly would have changed that, and in a good mood, I found myself laughing at the type of visual gags that I would have been crying over when I was a preteen.

Mostly a send-up of the Spider-Man origin story, it also takes shots at other iconic superhero characters: the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, etc. Drake Bell plays Rick Riker, a high school loser who is bitten by a genetically enhanced dragonfly while on a class trip. He of course obtains super powers, except the ability to fly. These he will HAVE to put to use when battling the mega-villain The Hourglass (veteran comedy villain Christopher McDonald, appropriately hammy), who must kill people in order to extend his own life.It is refreshing to see writer / director Craig Mazin throw caution to the wind, and refuse to kowtow to political correctness. Point in fact: real-life Dr. Stephen Hawking (played by character actor Robert Joy) comes in for a fair amount of abuse. With the assistance of experienced comedy director David Zucker (one third of that redoubtable team that made \"Airplane!\"), he actually manages to deliver a respectable amount of genuine laughs. Granted, some of the humour is stupid and obvious, but it still works. Key to \"Superhero Movie\"s' success is the fact that the actors largely play it straight, as if this was a real superhero movie. We've all known for years that movies of this type aren't nearly as good if it looks like everybody is in on the joke.Many familiar faces abound, although it would be best if this viewer did not spoil them all. Marion Ross of 'Happy Days' fame is appealing as Aunt Lucille (although it's such a shame Mazin & Company resort to a few minutes worth of fart jokes with her character), and spoof legend Leslie Nielsen is in fine form as always as the goofy Uncle Albert. (He and Bell come up with a funny spin on that classic Spider-Man line about great power.)Granted, this is NOT in the same league as \"Airplane!\" or \"Young Frankenstein\" (just to throw out two examples of classic, vintage spoofs), but it kills time agreeably enough. There's simply too much outtake and blooper footage during those closing credits, though.Six out of 10.",

Marion (Richie Cunningham's mom) Ross is particularly good fun in the Aunt May role played by Rosemary Harris in the Spider-Man movies.There are, broadly, three areas of humour covered: one, outright spoofery of super-hero movies (there is an amusing variation on the creation of Batman incident, for instance), two, simple dumb humour (ie. daft jokes) and, three, flatulence. This film contains the funniest flatulence routine since Blazing Saddles - possibly even funnier. Putting this sequence to one side, all the best gags are in the trailer (apart from a series of ongoing gags at the expense of Stephen Hawking) Conversely, if any of these three areas is likely to upset you, don't see it, because there isn't very much by way of wit, characterisation, plotting etc.Oh, and don't expect a special effects extravaganza, because there are hardly any effects (of the type we've come to expect from super-hero movies) in this movie at all - our hero gets bitten by a genetically engineered dragonfly and develops quick reflexes, some strength, and... er... well, maybe he'll learn to fly some day...",

It's apparent that some of the most recent ones are horrible (The Comebacks and Meet the Spartans). This one actually is better than those two, but that's not saying much. Imagine \"Meet the Spartans.\" Now replace all of the pop culture jokes with fart jokes, toiler humor, some slapstick comedy, and physical comedy. This is \"Superhero Movie.\"Is that a good thing? Well, sort of, considering it's not as painful if one joke falls flat, compared to some of the jokes in \"Meet the Spartans\" and \"The Comebacks.\" But the jokes in here aren't funny either. Now I know people may disagree with me on this but I actually laughed louder from the rare jokes in \"Meet the Spartans.\" However, in \"Superhero Movie,\" I tend to chuckle more. So would you rather laugh, with less jokes or chuckle, with more jokes? I don't know.Calling \"Superhero Movie\" a spoof is bad. This is not a good spoof film. However, the problem with this movie is that I would've liked the movie more if this had been another superhero comedy, rather than a spoof. Unlike \"Meet the Spartans,\" the plot is a lot better.

Well, I found Superhero Movie kind of uninspired for such rich source material. It's like a bombardment of jokes, one after the other, but with about only 1 out of 3 finding their target (ratio of hit-to-miss would depend on your personal tastes). It has a fairly strong start but it's like you get exhausted by the barrage (no, not from laughing too much in my case) and the ending in particular is not up to the rest (changed from the originally written one according to the commentary track because of studio directive). You get your fair lot of stupid and silly jokes of the Airplane/Naked Gun type which I don't mind as well as your farting, pissing and puking jokes which were somewhat funny (god, I regressed to 5-year old mental age! :-). There is some amusingly absurd dialog so the movie doesn't rely only on physical humor. The costumes and effects were surprisingly well done for such a low-budget film.It basically follows a similar plot to Spider-man 1 for most of it, with a totally different looking and motivated villain though, adding jokes here and there and contrary to what the poster might have you believe, the other superheroes besides the Dragonfly (the Spider-Man imitation) are reduced to mere cameos which are for the most part lame and unfunny (Professor X does have a little more screen time). It's to the point where the poster is almost like false advertising. The little part spoofing Batman (killing of the parents) was amusing in a dark twisted way. Practically all the jokes referring to modern consumer/internet products (iPod, Google, Youtube, Craigslist, etc) were unfunny and felt more like product placements than anything. There have been many movies in the \"..... movie\" spoof genre with most of them being considered among the worst movies of all time, certainly the worst-rated ones. Superhero movie is probably near the top of that hall of shame as it's very uneven with some funny moments, not truly downright terrible. In the right mood and with friends, it can be somewhat entertaining. Just rent it though.Rating: 4 out of 10",

It even had casts from the famous parody movies \"Scary movie\",It even has Kevin Hart in its cast However, i t kinda sucks that this movie has only 4/10 rating, i think that it deserves way more than most of people think. I feel bad that there are movies out there that people give 10/10 ratings because everyone does, and no one even rates this amazing movie, i laughed at least 30 times, more than when i watched \"Deadpool\" Highly recommended",

The cast is poor and the acting is weak, the only ones that made a barely decent job are Leslie Nielsen and Drake Bell. In conclusion, this movie already has the honor of being the worst movie of the year and I see it impossible that another movie to beat it. It is an hour and a half nightmare. Avoid it at all causes, really its not worthy.Don't waste your time and money. I don't know why the studios still gives money to people to make this crappy film, if they think they can make very good money with them they are so mistaken.",

But when they get back to the main characters the lights go out again. The spoofing material available in the superhero genre is plentiful so the fact that most of the jokes were basically a fart, makes you wonder who wrote this thing.

Their spoof movies are literally the sole reasons that I am gradually losing all faith in humanity.Granted Drake Bell was not the best cast for the leading role because of his awkward acting, bad line delivery, and countless others, but the supporting cast was excellent. Leslie Neilsen never lets down, and Christopher McDonald was great as the bad guy. If you are going into this movie expecting an Oscar worthy performance or a movie that may change your outlook on life, then you will be let down.

People who were anxious to bash the next \"(Insert Genre Here) Movie.\" (2.) People whose sphincters are about the size of a pin point and whom have had their senses of humor surgically removed at birth.Kudos to the studio for getting David Zucker in on this. That upped the quality tremendously. Double kudos for keeping Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer unemployed this time. Craig Mazin is a much more competent writer, though if they had brought in Pat Proft, this movie would've been even better. And triple kudos for Leslie Nielsen doing what must be his 150th spoof movie.As for the film itself, it really doesn't belong with \"Epic Movie\" or \"Date Movie.\" A different title would've brought different preconceptions from the movie-going public. Unlike those movies, it actually doesn't try to stuff 100 movie parodies into a 90 minute film. There aren't as many pop culture references that would make it irrelevant two months after release. And there are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments. (And yes, farts are funny. Any of you stuck-up twits who will herein claim otherwise can take a big whiff of one of mine, because you all know you giggled, even though you pretend to be grossed out.) The movie doesn't reach the nadir of comedy that is \"Airplane\" or \"Naked Gun\" (all of which contain fart jokes) but then I suppose it doesn't really try to accomplish that. It's simply a movie that can kill two hours and be enjoyable at the same time, and it's a refreshing riff on the comic book industry as a whole. I can actually see this being a successful comic book, as it reminded me quite often of \"The Tick.\" (Fans of that show will definitely see the similarities.) So all of you \"sophisticates\" out there can go blow it out your shorts. This movie was never meant for you anyway. (We all know you're not nearly as sophisticated as you'd like us to think anyway.) For the rest of you, enjoy this movie...it's the best step toward classic parody movies that we have had in years.",

Rick Riker is a likable character, his silliness is entertaining but not absurdly stupid. The jokes tend to repeat many times over throughout the film, such as having objects hitting the a person's head, or being hit at the balls. \"Superhero Movie\" is a refreshing departure from the poor goofs we get recently.

The movie follows Drake Bell from Nickelodeon's Drake & Josh, he plays Rick Riker, a idiot who falls too much. The bad part of this film is the jokes that are overused. Some jokes with Drake are beaten and overused, like the beginning sight gag when he hits the mirror on the bus. That was fine, but he then gets up, gets hit by the stop sign, and then the opening doors. I think they went too far after that. the saving grace for me was the time Leslie Nielsen was in the film, playing the Uncle Ben role. The main spoof of the whole film is Spider-Man, which can be noticed from the first few scenes. Jill Johnson is the spoof Mary-Jane Watson, her character is fine. The main villain in the film is a Green Goblin wannabe who can grab his victims and age them to death. The films sight gags are overused at times, but some of the jokes are fresher than others. This is the second spoof move this year, and this is definitely the better one. It's Superhero Movie and Meet the Spartans. Meet the Spartans sucked, it was terrible. But there is hope for this one.

            "content": "If the infamous Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer had anything to do with this spoof of superhero blockbusters from recent years, I would have avoided it like the plague, something I've learned to do with their movies! They made their debut in 1996 as writers of \"Spy Hard\", a mediocre spy spoof which I've seen twice, but it's still vague in my memory, and instead of improving as they went along, the duo got much worse! I watched \"Epic Movie\", which is probably the worst excuse for a comedy I've ever seen, then I saw \"Scary Movie\", the first in the \"(Insert Word Here) Movie\" series, which they co-wrote with four others, and I didn't find it to be much better. When I heard about \"Superhero Movie\", knowing Friedberg and Seltzer were not involved, I decided there was still no way I would be seeing it in the theatre, but I would check it out after it came into stores. So, I rented it just yesterday, and while I'm sure it would have been worse with Friedberg and Seltzer's involvement, I'm still not pleased.Rick Riker is an unpopular high school student who witnessed the death of his parents during his childhood and now lives with his Aunt Lucille and Uncle Albert Adams. However, things are about to change when he goes to a laboratory filled with genetically mutated creatures! These creatures include a genetically mutated dragonfly, which comes and bites Riker! After this, it turns out that the bite has given the teenager new superpowers, such as armored skin, super strength, and the ability to cling to walls and ceilings! Because of these new superpowers of his, Riker makes himself a costume and creates himself an alter ego, a local crime fighter known as \"Dragonfly\"! Unfortunately, things get harder for him when a supervillain named Hourglass starts showing up! He is the alter ego of a scientist named Lou Landers, who is terminally ill and has found a way to survive and become immortal by stealing life forces! As Rick Riker attempts to win the heart of Jill Johnson, the superhero must try to stop his foe before a lot of damage is done!This film is mostly based on 2002's \"Spider-Man\", and also features elements from other recent superhero movies such as \"X-Men\" and \"Batman Begins\". \"Superhero Movie\" starts out with some poor quality slapstick, with the main character getting hit with several things before getting on the bus. Much more unfunny slapstick follows, such as Professor Xavier explaining how some of his students can go through walls, showing one doing so, and how some others THINK they can go through walls, showing another student crashing into the wall. Another good example of weak slapstick is Rick Riker carrying Jill Johnson unconscious, with her head hitting different things on the table. However, I'm afraid this isn't the only thing that sinks the film! Some things I found to be below average, starting with the first Dr. Stephen Hawking scene (a parody of the real-life, world-renowned scientist and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis victim), where he does a speech, saying how he thinks about suicide every day, and explains the advantages the others in the room have over him in a juvenile manner. Also, unsurprisingly, that's right, this film features some fart jokes. There aren't too many of them, but the most significant one is where Rick Riker and Jill Johnson are sitting in a room, while Aunt Lucille is sleeping on the couch and continuously farting. I can laugh at juvenile humour, if it actually takes some talent to come up with it, but it can go too far, like it does there, same with probably most of the gazillion other times someone has farted in a recent comedy!Since I rented \"Epic Movie\" last year, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have come out with two more projects; \"Meet the Spartans\", which came earlier this year, and \"Disaster Movie\", which is in theatres now. Like I said, I've learned to avoid their work like the plague, so I haven't seen either of those movies. Of their four projects from the past couple years (\"Date Movie\", \"Epic Movie\", \"Meet the Spartans\", and \"Disaster Movie\"), I've only seen the second, but since the rest are generally considered atrocious, just like that one (which I agree with the majority on), I see no point in watching any of them. Also, it was bad enough seeing one of them on the small screen, if I went to see one in the theatre (like I could now with \"Disaster Movie\"), I'm sure it would be a lot like watching \"Epic Movie\" again, except this time, I would probably be surrounded by real-life versions of Beavis and Butt-Head! As much as I find Beavis and Butt-Head funny as cartoon characters, the thought of being in a room full of real-life versions of them is pretty scary! As for \"Superhero Movie\", a movie in the \"(Insert Word Here) Movie\" series done without the infamous duo, well, unlike \"Epic Movie\", I actually smiled or snickered here and there, but not usually, so I wouldn't exactly call this one a revolting comedy, but still not worth it. So, I think I'll pass on every future spoof movie entitled, \"(Insert Word Here) Movie\", however many more may come, and whether Friedberg and Seltzer are involved or not.",

I can see from most of the reviews that I am not alone in this sentiment. This has got to win the award for the absolutely WORST movie in entertainment history! I wish I could have walked out of it, but at today's movie prices you have to get something out of it; besides, it was too windy outside to walk with a full bucket of popcorn! This poor excuse for a film did a TERRIBLE job of movie parodies, and it was so full of nothing but crude jokes and sexual innuendo that even the teenagers in the audience were making fun of it after the first 15 minutes! All the filthiness overshadowed the plot so much that I forgot what the movie was supposed to be about! It had nothing but raunchy exhibitionism that you would expect to see on You Tube, not on the big screen!It was embarrassing to see such great actors like Marion Ross, Brent Spiner and Lesle Neilsen try to make this film amusing. If this was to be Drake Bell's debut in a lead movie role, I would suggest that he erase this one off his resume! He had so much potential, but all I can see from this experience is that he knows how to use profanity! I have more respect for Josh Peck now! I could sling a lot more hash regarding this trash, but I think I've made my point clear enough! DO NOT waste a ticket on this movie, DO NOT even rent it on video and DO NOT waste your time watching it on regular TV, unless you enjoy watching nothing but one hour and 85 minutes of CRUD!",

Of course, he secretly loves his hot neighbor and fights the evil doctor.My main two flaws with this movie was how they tried to hard to get a punchline. They tried a punchline every 30 seconds, when maybe 4/10 worked. Also, the Regina King character was so pointless and dumb to me.

Blazing Saddles did it beautifully (and was the first movie ever to have an on screen fart). Superhero movie seems to very single-minded on this aspect: old people = farts. One of the fart scenes was a little funny at first, but then goes on way too long.This movie is called Superhero Movie yet is devoid of spoofs from most of them. It only spoofs three movies: mainly Spider-man, a little X-men, and a tiny bit of Batman Begins. Sadly, here the writer fell into the same mindset of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer who have almost destroyed the spoof genre with their atrocities Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans. What made spoofs of old so good was when they spoofed a genre they didn't just look at the new hot commodities, they looked at all the films in that genre across the years. A more recent spoof who did it well was Not Another Teen Movie. It not only spoofed the new aged Freddy Prince Jr teen romance movies, but also went back to the John Hughes films of the 80's. I think this spoof would be more accessible to people outside of high school had he threw in some spoofs of the old Batman or Superman movies. Maybe even a little bit of a throwback to the Adam West Batman or Lou Ferrigno Hulk TV shows.My last gripe is about the main actor Drake Bell. He might work for little kids on Nickelodeon, but he doesn't for this movie. For the sake of brevity I'll just say that if you see this movie you'll know what I'm talking about.Those were some serious gripes, but it doesn't mean I didn't laugh. One scene in particular had me in stitches. The scene spoofed the Spider-man scene where Parker is late for dinner and is hiding from a searching Osborn on the ceiling of his room. I couldn't stop myself from laughing. I thought the scene was brilliant. Though some jokes do fall flat it is bound to happen when you spring a new joke every 15 to 30 seconds.",

As an audience we follow Rick Ryker who has been left an orphan to be raised by his aunt and uncle. On a school field trip he is bitten by a mutated dragonfly which bestows on him great powers. As you know by now, with great powers comes great yada yada blah blah. Rick becomes a superhero and tries to save the day from Lou Landers, a.k.a. Hourglass, his evil nemesis while desperately trying to win the affection of his attractive neighbour. Despite having David Zucker and Lesley Nielson attached to this film it was nowhere near the league of the \"Airplane!\" or \"Naked Gun\" movies which was a sad shame. More dumb than fun this film tries to use slapstick and witty humour throughout but falls short by a long way, in fact a lot of the film is very predictable and there for slightly boring too. There are a lot of cultural references and nods to other superhero films but not in a clever way at all so it makes the film feel like it's a desperate sibling nagging for attention just to justify it. If you haven't guessed by now I didn't really enjoy this; I can deal with the crass fart jokes and I can deal with the whiny stereotypical characters throughout. What upset me the most was the wasted opportunity. With so many superhero movies out there now this film could have been soo much more but as a satirical poke at them it falls flat on its toothless face. Sorry, I can only give this 3 out of 10 because I'd have been happy to turn it off or fall asleep instead. I can't say I'd recommend this, and I definitely won't be rushing to watch this again.",

For instance, Jack Black did a skit on the MTV Awards where he parodied the costume design scene and nipples in the rain from Spiderman, and they WERE funny. This movie did both and they weren't.Also, they take something that might be mildly amusing, and beat it to death. (The flatulence joke with Dragonfly's Aunt is a good example. Flatulence was comical in Blazing Saddles because nobody dared do it before. This was just over the top and redundant.)

One would think that would be a good thing, except that the plot is good enough to almost want them to play it straight, even though you're dying for a few big belly laughs.

Drake Bell is bitten by a dragonfly thus infecting him with strange powers. Formula storyline has him using his powers against criminals while donning a green costume. Great setup with a knockout conclusion directed by Craig Mazin. Bell is perfectly cast as a nobody who suddenly becomes a somebody and doesn't know what to make of it. Supporting roles are not so fortunate. Sara Paxton's function here is to look good. She is the standard love interest in the tradition of Mary-Jane in Spider-Man but lacking any form of character. Christopher McDonald plays a lifeless villain Hourglass whose final scene has his face in the most embarrassing place any villain could end up. Perhaps the issue is that he travels the same ground as the villain in Spider-Man but becomes a joke as oppose to exploiting them. Leslie Nielsen plays Bell's uncle who doesn't quite die. He is the one supporting role that contains any interest and he side steps every predictable moment played out by Peter Parker's uncle in Spider-Man. Kevin Hart plays the flat best friend whose one funny scene has him assaulted with a nail gun. Although far from the best movie parody the superhero jokes work well in this colourful spectacle.

There are hilarious scenes one after the other that I've found to be quite riveting. One of my favorite parodies is Sara Paxton as Jill Johnson's spot-on Kirsten Dunst impression.This movie is produced by one of the Zucker brothers and he brought some of his earlier spoof movies-styled humor with him for this film, but the movie just falls short in quality and overall entertainment compared to those earlier films.

The man is a comedy God and is automatically funny in anything he is in.Superhero Movie, while by no means the worst spoof movie ever made, is still pretty dreadful. It relies far too much on cheap slapstick humour and fart jokes which is a shame as the actual spoof part of the movie had a lot of potential to it, particularly the ending which even managed to achieve some interesting plot elements. There were even a few moments that reminded me of the comedy gold that was Airplane! and the Naked Gun series (although that could have been because the gags were lifted straight from them). In the end though I was more bored than entertained and felt the film dragged on for too long (despite the short runtime of only 70min).I was surprised to see quite a few familiar faces pop up in the movie (Jeffrey Tambor and Kurt Fuller to name a few) and they did a good job of providing some much needed laughs. The main highlight however, as mentioned above, was the comedy wonder-gem that is Mr Nielsen. Don't get me wrong, the material he's given is terrible, but his delivery is so perfect that it gave me an excuse to keep watching. In fact, I would argue that his inclusion alone makes it a film worth watching. I should also mention that Christopher McDonald also plays his part well and is actually a pretty good counter-part to Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborne character from Spiderman.In the end however you are left with a film that has a few chuckles here and there but mostly groans of despair throughout. Stay for Uncle Albert but otherwise seek your laughs elsewhere.",

            "content": "The \"movie-genre parody\" is often the option of last resort for Hollywood screenwriters who've run out of inspiration. Having already skewered such popular genres as the disaster movie, the sword-and-sandal epic, romantic comedies, horror films, spy thrillers, crime dramas etc., they now take aim at the \"superhero movie,\" with a flick ingeniously entitled - yea, you guessed it - \"Superhero Movie.\"In a time span of eighty-minutes that feels more like eight hundred, \"Superhero Movie\" lumbers from one unfunny joke and sight gag to another, barely taking time out for such apparently dispensable elements as originality or wit. However, in all fairness, one should at least note that writer/director Craig Mazin saves most of his best material - such as it is - for the last half hour.Drake Bell is the Peter Parker to Sara Paxton's Mary Jane Watson in what is essentially a flatfooted parody of the \"Spiderman\" franchise, with the nerdy high school student in this case being bitten by a genetically-engineered dragonfly, turning him into the crime-fighting figure known as - what else? - The Dragonfly. The movie also makes the occasional obligatory nod to other comic book adaptations such as \"Iron Man,\" \"X-Men\" and \"Batman Begins,\" but, since it was released before \"The Dark Knight,\" there is no reference to that landmark work - or to its iconic Joker character - in this film, a real lost opportunity.We've indeed come a long way from the glory days of \"Airplane\" (a fact further emphasized by the presence here of David Zucker as co-producer and Leslie Nielson as one of the movie's co-stars), but \"Superhero Movie\" is substandard even by \"Epic Movie/Date Movie\" standards.",

Those are examples of \"stupid-trying to be funny but-unfunny movies.\"Superhero Movie takes a jab at the comic-book-hero-to-movie genre. It basically uses the Spider-man 1 script and tosses in references from X-Men, Fantastic Four and Batman Begins. The dinner table scene, where our hero is trading injury discoveries with the villain, is a high point. Leslie Nielsen deadpans his jokes in his usual style as Uncle Albert and Tracy Morgan is a silly Professor X. There are obvious product placements throughout but they're done in a humorous way.Don't miss the outtakes during the end credits, they're every bit as funny as the movie itself.

Superhero movie is full of some of the most spontaneous and genuine humour that we've seen recently from the filmmakers, and is somewhat of a return to form. There are some laughable jokes in there and some funny humour. Though, the acting is kind of shaky and sub-par.And on that point, it's annoying that their other movies have been so awful. But having said that, the movies they send up are perfect, Spiderman, X-Men, and Fantastic Four had it coming frankly. When this film is on a roll, very few others can top it. This movie actually has a decent plot, its not just some random crap like the others. Its still not that great but its an improvement. They still include some cheesy stuff but thats not that bad I like the last scene when the hourglass pushes Jill out the window then Rick goes and saves her, then he realizes that he can fly, that was a nice ending. Jill realizes that the Dragonfly is really Rick because she sees Ricks ring.As a rewatch 10/08/22' opinions remain same if not slightly better. After having rewatched other \"movie\" spoofs (Epic movie, Disaster movie), it is very clear Superhero movie is a much better film and it does better justice as a parody. For one, it doesn't cram nonsense jokes quickly for the sake of it. The jokes are silly and juvenile but quite clever and funny. The Tom Cruise impersonator was pretty funny. Had forgotten about Tracy Morgan's professor Xavier role. That was also quite funny. Also the film doesn't drag on, it is quite short and gets straight to the point. Nothing feels too forced. Rating changes from 6 to 7. Quite an underrated film of anything.",

Rick has a crush on \"girl next door\" Jill Johnson (Sara Paxton), who unfortunately for Rick is dating his bully Lance (Ryan Hansen). Following an incident where Rick is bitten by a genetically altered dragon fly giving him the ability to stick to walls as well as reinforced skin, which allows him to become the superhero, the Dragonfly. When an evil business magnate, Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) uses an experimental formula on himself to cure a terminal illness, the treatment works and gives him the ability to drain the lifeforce of people and extending his life one day for every life taken. Lou becomes the supervillain The Hourglass and when he plans to achieve immortality only Rick can stop him.One of a number of parody films released through the 2000s and trying to capture the success of Scary Movie, Superhero Movie began life as Superhero! With Airplane! And Naked Gun director David Zucker initially slated to direct. After Superhero! Was delayed, David Zucker instead directed conservative comedy, An American Carol, and stepped back into a producing role with the reins handed to Craig Mazin who wrote Scary Movie 3 and 4. Mazin is no stranger to superhero comedies having directed the 2000 comedy, The Specials from writer James Gunn. Superhero Movie is of higher quality than most of the spoof films of its time such as Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, but make no mistake just because it's \"better\" doesn't make it \"good\".Superhero Movie came out at a strange era of the Superhero genre where superhero films had recovered from the stink of flops like Batman & Robin or Steel (Halle Berry's Catwoman film notwithstanding) but they still weren't treated with all that much respect. While films like the X-Men series or Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins tried to approach the material respectfully, it was Sam Raimi's Spider-Man being a box office juggernaut that inspired the direction of films of the era such as Daredevil, Tim Story's Fantastic Four films, or Ghost Rider where the camp was played up. Superhero Movie is primarily a parody of the first Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films with ancillary references to X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Batman Begins sprinkled throughout. While there's a lot of goofiness in the Raimi Spider-Man films that's been mocked both upon release and in hindsight, the Raimi films were usually faithful recreations of Silver Age comic book stories so they were aware of their goofiness and played it up. This is where Superhero Movie stumbles as Drake Bell's take on Rick Riker is pretty much the same as Peter Parker only with exaggerated self-awareness of the situation making the character less funny than Tobey Maguire's take on the parody target by comparison. Peter Parker was such an exaggerated geek stereotype in the Raimi films that it's not really possible to parody him so the movie just makes him aggressively dumb and accident prone similar to protagonists in the Scary Movie films.The movie also features tangents wherein Rick Riker encounters other superheros like parody's of the X-Men at the Academy for Gifted Non-Asians or Johnny Storm whose flame powers in the movie put him in unbearable pain and like the Peter Parker parody the actual X-Men films and even Chris Evans in Fantastic Four were funnier and more engaging than their parodies here. The movie also features a lot of the contemporary references these movies became infamous for with references to things like Tom Cruise's interview where he called psychology \"psuedoscience\", Britney Spears' bizarre behavior, Barry Bonds' steroid abuse allegations, and references to T-Mobile's \"Fave Five\" which I'd wager nobody remembered after about a year. South Park had already run most of these topics into the ground about 3 years before this movie was even made so it just comes off as desperate and pandering. The one element that I'd say works is Christopher McDonald as our villain Lou Landers/The Hourglass, McDonald gets the best jokes in the film (particularly a sight gag involving a portrait of himself that's very funny) and he really taps into the essence of Willem Dafoe's performance as Green Goblin in a way where McDonald wouldn't be out of place playing a straight supervillain in an actual comic book movie while still engaging in silliness that makes it funny.Superhero Movie is marginally better than the majority of parody/spoof films from the mid-2000s, but it's still not at an acceptable level. While the movie stays on target most of the time and has some funny jokes in it, it's hampered by the hackneyed style popularized by the first Scary Movie that's been regurgitated to diminishing returns over the course of a decade.",

I thought that they would tackle most of the hit films in this flick, but I was sadly let down. most of the other hero appearances serve as a cameo and they don't really give anyone a line of dialog in the whole movie. what I was really waiting to see was the big superhero team up and way over done final fight sequence like in Spiderman 3. ( a movie which is actually worse than this one ) when the movie ended I felt unsatisfied of what i saw. there is no real build in the movie even though these types of movie don't really need one there is absolutely none what-so-ever. there were a few scenes that I was really waiting to see out of this movie. mostly the superhero team up and big battle, but none the less this movie accomplishes what ever it has set out to do. the parody is there, the writing is descent, and the over plot is satisfying. your obviously thinking \"well whats wrong with the movie\" the problem with this movie is the same problem with spiderman 3. it was all there and potential existed it just didn;t play out to what it could've been. overall it was a good movie.",

No Paris or Britney in here, just nice creative jokes. One of my favorites being the Hourglass getting glass in his eye and a clever way of spoofing the \"hiding on the ceiling\" scene from Spiderman.2.Meet the Spartans was basically what would happen if you had a 5 year old rewrite 300. This movie takes things from the first Spiderman movie and creates a new plot at the same time! Dragonfly is quite the creative substitute for Spiderman, and the Hourglass is actually a cool enough villain that he should be in an actual superhero movie! It just felt good watching an original plot rather than a \"dumb downed 100 IQ points\" version of the spoofed movie. 3. While there is a spoof of BatmanBegins, a five minute scene of X-Men and a quick Fantastic Four spoof,this movie revolves around Spiderman's plot and that plot only! Not all over the place like Epic Movie or Meet the Spartans. 4. Cast is great. Well, what's a good spoof movie with Leslie Nielsen? Even in his 80s, the man will leave you in stitches. Never saw Drake Bell in anything before this movie, but I can see some bright spots in his future. And Christopher MacDonald is always good at playing a humorous bad guy,what a fitting role for him. Some awesome cameos too, such as Dan Castelleneta (voice of Homer Simpson), Tracey Morgan, and more.Such a shame this bombed and Meet the Spartans succeeded at the BO. David Zucker, don't trust those numbers. You, along with Mel Brooks, will always be the master of true spoof movies.

The spoof genre of movies has been around pretty much since then, from the sequel Airplane 2 to TV detective spoof The Naked Gun, right up to modern equivalents such as the Scary Movie series, Epic Movie and the pretty universally despised Meet The Spartans.But it was the writers Jim Abrahams and David Zucker who started it with Airplane, and now they have come to reclaim the spoof title with Superhero Movie. As the name suggests, the new target of ridicule is the superhero movie genre, exemplified by Spiderman and X-Men. The bulk of the plot is taken from Spiderman, featuring a young outcast who is bitten by a genetically enhanced dragonfly and who takes on some of the characteristics of the insect. Scenes from the original are lifted wholesale, such as the scene where the hero first discovers that he can climb walls, and the part where his uncle (played by Airplane veteran, Leslie Nielsen) is shot by an escaping burglar. Grafted onto this stolen plot are a number of jokes and ludicrous situations which, on the whole, are not very amusing.This it is an example of the laziest type of movie making. For example, as Dragonfly climbs up the wall, a cat walks past him to highlight the fact that the camera has simply been turned on its side to give the illusion of sticking to the surface. I seem to remember Kenny Everett doing that joke over 25 years ago. One scene attempts to wring over a minute's worth of laughs out of an old lady breaking wind. And whereas the Airplane movies had jokes almost every second, Superhero Movie runs out of steam very quickly and the jokes, feeble as they are, are very thinly spread. The film only lasts an hour and ten minutes, and it seems likely that this is because they simply couldn't think of anything else to say.It seems that these spoofs have not moved on since I was ten. If anything, they have gone backwards. Maybe that would mean that they are suitable for 8 year olds, but the rating on Superhero Movie specifies that it is only suitable for teenagers. It stands to reason that they would have to be very stupid teenagers.",

OK, the story isn't good enough but this is a movie parody with a lot of good humor and that's the point! The humor works! The actors with master Nielsen too! It's nice to see him again in his best form! I've had fun all the time! There are of course some hard things but I think this kind of movie is only watchable with some stuff like these.

            "content": "Okay so with David Zucker attached to this film (only as a producer), a lot of people may have heard the name and mistaken this for one of his actual films. Well be warned, this is one of those cheap nasty \"comedies\" that try and con people into the theaters and then just spew out regurgitated comedy by numbers while hardly deviating from the plot of whatever movie they have chosen to parody (or rip off may be better). This is not a touch even on the weaker Zucker films of later years and seems to be from the minds of people that have only heard of comedy but never really understood how it works. Shame on Zucker for putting his name on this rubbish.If that wasn't bad enough, this movie is a parody of the first spiderman movie. Yes the one that came out six years ago and has had two sequels since then. So it doesn't even manage to be topical. Had this come out in 2003 it may have at least scored points for being relevant (which would have still made the film disposable with no chance of anyone remembering it years later, but for the first viewing some of the direct parody may have amused people briefly). Sure they threw in the odd additional hero, but only as quick visual gags with no real depth and most of those characters were direct copies of the characters they parodied and played out the most obvious jokes. Essentially the film is a highly stripped down copy of Spiderman with a handful of jokes thrown in.Of course we should have suspected. When they were hyping this they talked about it like it was the first superhero comedy, while that is a long way from the mark. My suggestion if you want to see an actually good superhero comedy is to check out \"Mystery Men\" instead.Finally a word about Leslie Nielson. You should have figured by now that Leslie will pretty much do anything. While his skill at delivering any line or action with a straight face is second to none, that ability alone doesn't make for good comedy. He needs the right script and like many of his comedies this wasn't it. Having said that, he is still probably the funniest thing in this movie, but then he could have achieved that had he just stood in an empty room and read a bus time table to us.",

If you judge it as a spoof, it isn't passable. Its bloomin' marvellous.Superhero movie is full of some of the most spontaneous and genuine humour that we've seen recently from the filmmakers, and is somewhat of a return to form. They haven't done anything nearly this funny since Scary Movie 3, and I hope that they continue along these lines because the writers proved with Scary Movie and Scary Movie 3 that they can do it, they just don't do it enough.And on that point, it's annoying that their other movies have been so awful. But having said that, the movies they send up are perfect, Spiderman, X-Men, and Fantastic Four had it coming frankly. When this film is on a roll, very few others can top it. The sequence in the laboratory is hilarious and full of surprise, and the send up of Professor Xavier and the mutant mansion is great fun to watch. Leslie Nielsen is as sharp as ever and Chris Macdonald has some great lines, especially the hero/villain sparring with Drake Bell.

Now thanks to the two laughing joking numb nuts known as Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, spoof movies (mainly ones with \"Movie\" in the title) have been giving a bad name.

I liked it and so did he. The reason I think this worked and something like \"Meet the Spartans\" didn't is because Mazin see's the movies he's spoofing unlike Friedberg and Seltzer who only see the trailer (and I'm not joking about that). Mazin focuses on one movie this time (Spider-Man 1) and he makes jokes about certain scene's and moments (like when Spider-Man is bleeding, in this Dragonfly has to pee.) Where Friedberg and Seltzer make the same joke over and over again (kicking the celebrity's into the pit from 300). So, yeah, see this movie but don't see anything by Friedberg and Seltzer.",

Just like the film itself....Tired humour: After seeing a lot of spoof films, I believe this film sticks to the genres standard formula. Something that, if this film didn't follow it, may have done it more justice. I've thought for a while that this genre of film needs some breathing space; after releases of other terrible titles such as: Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie. The jokes have become overused and I found myself almost tutting more than laughing. Casting is TERRIBLE: I myself, don't believe that Drake Bell and Sara Paxton's acting skills stretch to outlandish and ridiculous humour of say the likes of Anna Faris from the original Scary Movie titles. Since you spend the majority of the film dealing with them, it ended up being rather disappointing. The good cast of the film make brief appearances: I don't think ANY of the characters were utilised well in the film really. The funniest of characters played, what I consider to be, minor roles. Leslie Nielson and Regina Hall in particular. In that respect, if you're a fan of previous films like Scary Movie and see from the promo posters online and on the DVD cover that Regina Hall makes an appearance, please take note that it's a 2 minute one and was probably one of the only funny moments from the film.All in all, I would say avoid this one. It will be a wasted 80 minutes and if it's laughs you're after - you'd be safer watching Scary Movie again. 3/10",

Still, the lampooning of intellectual and peacemaking figures the world over makes it clear that the film knows its audience: people who envy brainpower. \"Superhero Movie\" is particularly and consistently nasty to Stephen Hawking, introducing him as a sex-starved druggie and using his disability as a vehicle for slapstick.The plot is based on \"Spider-Man,\" with \"Batman Begins\" and \"X-Men\" thrown in just to deliver some physical comedy. Much of the movie is slapstick, but not in any invigorating or interesting way. The longest-running gag is a fart joke, and early on the scriptwriters seem to believe that having the main character get thrown in conspicuous piles of fake animal poo automatically enlivens an otherwise uninspired rehash of the spider bite scene from \"Spider-Man.\" Perhaps the only redeeming feature of this feature is the energy in it, notably absent in other recent parodies. The filmmakers act as though they're doing something new, and the audience can feel the influence in the way the actors bounce around the screen. An extremely abbreviated length (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and the zest of the presentation makes \"Superhero Movie\" tolerable rather than horrifying.",

A send up of all the comic book movie in the past 7 years, and the set-ups for re staging the scenes from them with a comic twist is damn good. Where the laughs fall flat are the guest stars (Pam Anderson- Tracy Morgan- Regina Hall) in an \"X-Men\" detour. The older actors and the unknown leads are hilarious. Better than the last 2 'Scary Movies' but not on par with the best of Z-A-Z boys on their weakest films.

At first I thought it would just be another stupid movie, but like Kung Pow I actually liked it more each time I've seen it.I loved Lesly Nelson talking about how the super heroes always get the b!tches, how Marion Ross had the farting scene, or how she says \"shave your pubes dear, no one wants to go down on a tumbleweed\". I was literally in tears laughing at some of this material.Once again, if you love stupid movies (the good ones at least) you'll like this movie.All the people who gave Kung Pow high marks because you found it way funnier the 2nd or 3rd time you watched it do yourselves a favor and watch this movie again.

I wish this movie could be the death of the genre, but I know that it isn't awful enough to put the final nail in the coffin.If Meet the Spartans is considered the bottom of the barrel as far as Hollywood movies go, than Superhero Movie is probably near the top. Unfortunately Meet the Spartans was actually miles below the barrel, and this movie just barely makes it in.Superhero Movie has a decent cast of C-list celebs. It's got Drake Bell (the kid from Disney's Drake and Josh), Leslie Nielson (Airplane!), Tracy Morgan (SNL and 30 Rock), and a few others scattered throughout. Although it has the star power to light a 40-watt bulb, the movie fails to utilize any humor.This movie is about 80 minutes long, most of which is dedicated to following the Spiderman plot, and not one single joke is funny. I didn't laugh or chuckle or smirk the entire time.Don't see this movie. Don't even think about it.

            "content": "After the horrible bottom feeders Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans many people may be turned off from another spoof in the vein of Scary Movie. But in reality New Regency's idiot duo Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the two who brought us the garbage mentioned earlier in this review, weren't even behind it. Instead it was brought from Dimension film's own Craig Mazin, the mind behind Scary Movie 3 and 4.But that's not the only reason not to or TO see it, we have the legendary Leslie Nielsen (from Airplane and Naked Gun stardom) co-starring in a role that isn't unlike the films that made him a star. We also have the charismatic Drake Bell fresh off Drake and Josh fame. The obligatory cameos by Pamela Anderson and Tracy Morgan are nothing to get excited about, they make brief, insignificant appearances that aren't what the movie's about. This film is about spoofing SUPERHERO movies, if you already didn't know! And they do a fine job. Even if the attempt is sometimes a hit and miss.I really can't lie though, even though I had preconceived notions about this flick, I was very entertained. Scene after scene (mostly spoofing the Spiderman trilogy) kept me laughing and laughing until I was actually in pain. Some jokes, most the ones involving flatulence, farting to the simpleton, fell flat and seemed unsophisticatedly forced. But the rest is actually felt fresh and new. I couldn't help but love scenes that provided comedic \"What if?\" scenarios of scenes from Spiderman and X-Men. The best in which have Drake Bell undergo the sickening transformation into \"The Dragonfly\", and even a twist of the famous wall climbing scene from Spiderman where he realizes something just isn't right.But this film likes to stay within a decent realm of pertinence, rather than choose random people in pop culture and play off them like caricatures. With Leslie Nielsen at Bell's side we get an authenticity not usually found in spoofs anymore. We do get a Tom Cruise parody that at first feels out of place, but eventually grows on you. A perfect impression by Miles Fisher is what we get, and he does such a good job of mimicking his mannerisms you could sware he was a skinny version of Frank Caliendo.Will this film rejuvinate the genre, absolutely not. Will it make lots of money? Yes! But hopefully not only from idiotic, hormonally challenged teenie boppers. Hopefully some people will give it a chance. Even if for only 50 minutes of it's 85 minute running time we get a fun and refreshingly original sleeper. One of the best spoofs in over half a decade!",

The laugh a minute formula is actually employed, unlike in the other movies where laugh a minute means either breaking out into some hip hop fueled dance routine, some lame 'parody' or just doing something completely off the wall and hoping it gets a laugh.Don't judge this movie by the 'Movie' suffix, if you're in the mood for something silly give this one a chance, you might be pleasantly surprised.",

But is entertainment enough from a spoof? The acting was good enough, nothing disappointing in that sort of department. But disappointing in the movie as a whole.If your going to compare this to all these other recent spoof movies like Epic movie, Date Movie and Meet The Spartans. You would see that Superhero movie stands out by a landslide, in many different qualities. We all agree spoof movies these day's are nothing like the one's they used to make. But let's not move into that to much, let's just say if your considering watching this movie don't expect a classic hilarious spoof like the \"Scary Movie.\" Because i could almost guarantee it won't be on that level.

The problems of its predecessors and successors are still here, an unfocused story with low substance and really bad effects. But by and large, Superhero Movie is by far the most consistent spoof in S&F's catalogue, focusing squarely on the eponymous genre at the time. Drake Bell and Leslie Nielsen provide surprisingly good performances as the hero and villain. The humor, while still overrelying on lazy pop culture references and gross comedy, does have some real good hits.But while this film is being reevaluated as a better contemporary, I personally think that this movie is still slightly below average.",

Anyone who's seen these Scary Movie spin offs where the movie is a series off topical jokes relating to a movie genre know that they have not been too good lately.

There was a lot of dumb moments that kind of spoil it but I guess it might just be for a different crowd.There are a few well written jokes, and a couple of decent acting jobs. Kevin Hart was funny as always. Leslie Nielsen was a little on the slapstick side but brought his famous personality to it. Sara Paxton almost seemed to pretty and took the movie very seriously. She almost seemed like she was playing an actual part in a hero movie.The real flaws of this movie are when it lulled with sad attempts at jokes and poorly executed goofy moments. Almost every movie in this line has those attempted goofy moments that the self assigned mature audience will dislike, but even some dumb moments made me laugh.I would recommend Superhero Movie to anyone who enjoys comedy and doesn't mind a bunch of moments where the movie lags into dumb comedy.",

She literally never makes a joke, like you might as well take a bathroom break every time she has a scene but youd spend half the movie in the bathroom if you did because she gets more screen time than interesting or funny people like kevin hart or leslie nielson.

Scary movie(1) did it well, the following sequels were then horrendous as the tried to over play the franchise, but it was redeemed by Scary Movie 4.

Movie history had a lot of parody films but they were usually decent quality and separated by years. Then between 2005-2008 there were at least 15 big parody titles and the genre pretty much became boring and repetitive.So, I didn't see this movie till the time I wrote this review (2023). I don't think it's any worse than other spoof titles of this era - a plot line that makes fun of all major superhero movies made till that point (mind you this was before Marvel so they really didn't have a lot of source material - only Spider-Man, Batman and X-men). The punchlines aren't always clever and the acting isn't always perfect but this exactly was why other spoof titles of the time were successful.Overall, I thought this was an entertaining movie. We laughed out loud a few times (particularly Leslie Nielsen's lines and performance).I think this is worth watching if you're in the mood for a totally stupid parody comedy.",

There are some obvious sexual references and innuendos but those are what make the movie funny and gives it its PG-13 rating. The swearing is miminal. I have heard way worse.

In this spoof you can actually tell what movies they are doing a spoof of and even though the scenes are stupid they aren't as stupid as most spoof movies that you can get annoyed at them.

I couldn't imagine taking a teenager, preteen, or (especially) a child to this movie. It was crude and offensive. I was totally misled by its PG-13 rating and the previews that I had seen for it. I had originally seen previews for it on Nickelodeon, and I thought that it looked pretty cute (maybe I just don't remember the preview correctly) . Plus, Drake Bell (the movie's main character) stars on a Nickelodeon television show that targets preteens and young teenagers. I really didn't think that the movie's content would be as risky as it was. I should have done more research about it before I went. However, I'm hoping that parents will read up on this movie before they take their kids to see it just because it has Drake Bell in it.Seriously, do NOT take your kids or teenagers to see this movie. The rating should have been R. There are tons of sexual references, drug references, and disturbing events throughout the movie. Examples: Drake Bell gets attacked by sexually charged animals, several scenes that involve men grabbing women's breasts, lots of profanity, Drake Bell uses a bong to smoke vanilla frosting (or something like that), people get stabbed, hit, and hurt in the movie, and an elderly lady and her dog get shredded. There are tons of other offensive and disgusting scenes throughout the movie. It was really demeaning to women in general. The movie is by the people that made the Scary Movie series, so that should tell you something right there. Please remember that seeing movies like this can give kids and teenagers all kinds of wrong ideas about sex, drugs, and violence. Most children and teenagers can't decipher between spoofs or comedy and reality.I do have a sense of humor. I also know that the humor that was in this film is typical of its genre. But I find the possibility of children and teenagers going to see this movie HORRIFYING.As for the overall quality of the movie, I didn't think it was that original or funny. It dragged in parts and some of the humor was just forced and painful. The acting wasn't TOO bad, considering how bad the script was. If you're an adult or older teen looking for a funny movie, skip this one or rent it.",

They all come so thick and fast you might miss them. But for the most part they are genuinely funny, always being delightfully silly and making the movie a guilty pleasure. You'll never see Stephen Hawking or Tom Cruise in the same way again.I am so glad they decided to drop Friedberg and Seltzer with this one.

But, like with most forms of humour, there is a point where sick humour stops being funny and becomes just plain sick. Superhero Movie crosses this line within the first ten minutes. Animal sex jokes are not funny. People getting killed isn't either. Like remember in Batman Begins, when Bruce's parents are murdered? That scene brings me dangerously close to tears sometimes. And making fun of it, in a blatantly obvious parody (they might as well shout, 'We're making fun of Batman Begins!') is really pathetic, I think.Which, of course, brings me to the fact that I do enjoy superhero films; The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, Iron Man, etc. And I can laugh at a few jokes about them (the spoofs on YouTube, for instance), but not when they're ridiculously sick and blindingly obvious.

It uses Spiderman/2 for plot outline, and throws in some gags from other superhero movies as well.So is this a revival of the genre? Well, it has brought up the level from Friedberg/Seltzer, but it doesn't have enough originality and spunk to save the genre. Another thing I thought was great was how they had the decency to bring back the movie theater style poster. All in all, if you're just looking for crude tasteless fun, check it out, but don't go expecting anything too great.",

Really funny movie as i said but bad actors, the only one who was good in this movie was Drake Bell, who had the leadcharacther in this movie. He was hilarious, but the rest of the cast wasn't so funny. This movie is an excellent parody movie, it's so unserious that it actually gets funny. You should see the movie, you will think it's a bad movie, but a great parody movie. Like Epic Movie and Scary Movie as i said before, it has great jokes in right moments but you can't take it serious when it gets serious, it's confusing i know but that's the truth.See this and enjoy Drake Bells funniest movie ever.",

Here the filmmakers are basically making fun of the first 'Spider-Man' having the main character named Rick Riker bitten by a dragonfly instead of a spider He develops super powers like strength, invulnerability, crawling to walls but he can't fly As expected he's in love with his next door neighbor Jill but doesn't have the courage to do anything Meanwhile the head CEO of Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals creates a way to stop death but he has to absorb other people's life energy to stay alive Hoping to make it permanent he plans to steal a rare mineral to absorb Empire City and Dragonfly is the only one who can stop him So many of these jokes and gags jab at 'X-Men', 'Fantastic Four' and 'Spider-Man' but also trying to maintain the heart of the story That's still notoriously difficult to do these days and humor isn't easy to balance Still this is one of the rare spoofs that manages to get some decent laughs It's not gonna work for everyone and one of the worst things in the movie involves the obligatory flatulence stuff, one scene in particular goes on for 5 minutes The pop culture references are expected too like Facebook and YouTube I definitely got the best bits from Nielsen and Hall Plus Drake Bell is a hoot to watch as a clumsy nerd becoming a hero next to Sara Paxton who's cute but still has a tremendous heart There's lots of instances where you can clearly see this was on a budget and some of the jokes haven't aged well but again this isn't high art we are looking for A decent enough comedy that'll kill an hour and a half making us appreciate real superhero movies",

I think that's shorter than the minimum, which is why i'm guessing they added a bunch of deleted scenes during the credits. that was not a mistake. i don't mean gag reels, i mean deleted scenes that were removed from various parts of the movie. i've never seen anything like it.

It is not remarkable by any means, but it is kind of fun. The spoofing is very mainly targeted at the Spiderman series. They borrow from other sources as well, but these parts feel a little forced; so perhaps it is for the best that they kept it simple. There is not an effective train full of gags that a great spoof requires but at least there are not painful draughts of laugher. Drake Bell knows what he is doing, he knows it is ridiculous and he has fun with it. His high energy help prevent this movie from tanking. Also he gets great support from Christopher McDonald, Kevin Hart, and Leslie Nielsen, the king of spoofs. I only wish these secondary cast members were utilized even more, because they help immensely. Unfortunately the movie loses its discipline and prematurely wraps things up in a very haphazard manner.

This film despite using possibly too many fart jokes for one to bear, made me laugh from beginning to beyond the credits, and quite frankly was far funnier than a lot of movies that try to hard to be unique or clever in some regard.

They just don't make movies like Spaceballs or Airplane anymore. Now we are stuck with \"Movie movies\", lazy, zeitgeisty, pop culture reference bloated \"films\" that are more focused on making the movie look funny than actually being funny. It's like watching a collection of manatee jokes from Family Guy for two hours; the only difference is that this is live action, barely. Granted Superhero Movie is not a cinematic atrocity like Epic Movie, but that doesn't mean it's any good.\n\nThis movie mainly parodies Spider-Man, with scenes with X-Men, Batman Begins, and so on. Unlike Epic Movie, this actually stays true to the title throughout. Only superhero movies are spoofed here. The number of movies being satirized is smaller than Epic Movie, but that just makes it more focused and more structured. For the majority of the gags, they actually feel like gags. Not good gags, but gags. In the aforementioned Epic Movie, the \"jokes\" feel more like references than jokes. \n\nDrake Bell of Drake & Josh fame stars in Epic Movie, and he is one of the two actors in this movie who actually aren't that bad. He plays a riff on the Tobey Maguire Peter Parker, and his comedic timing is often the only thing that works about the gags. He is throughout most of the movie the only straight faced actor on camera. Almost everybody else is winking at the camera and just being obnoxious. The one other decent performance is Leslie Nielsen, in one of his last ever movie roles. He plays the Uncle Ben/Alfred Pennyworth character. He tries the best he can to make the jokes enjoyable, and he occasionally succeeds,  but the script sucks so hard that not even Leslie \"Don't Call Me Shirley\" Nielsen can't be enjoyable.\n\nSo in the end, Superhero Movie isn't as awful as the Seltzerburg films, mainly due to decent performances from Bell and Nielsen, but even they don't make this worth watching. Somebody out there has to make another good spoof movie, the world needs it.",

He witnesses a flashback in one scene where his parents are killed like in Batman Begins, giving the reason why he lives with his aunt and uncle played y Marion Ross and the late Leslie Nielsen. In order to control his powers, Xavier played by Tracy Morgan introduces him to his gifted school of superheroes like in X-Men where he meets Wolverine, Storm and Invisible Girl (parody of Invisible Woman from Fantastic Four) played by Pamela Anderson. When Dragonfly's nemesis, Lou Landers played by Christopher McDonald becomes the life-sucking Hourglass, it is up to Dragonfly to save Jill before Hourglass takes over the world. The film's main parody is Spider-Man. Other parodies that can be caught are Batman Begins, X-Men and Fantastic Four. I thought this was a good movie, it had a good story, made me laugh and did not center around too many movies to be called a parody. This is a good parody movie.

It has serviceable comedy performances from Drake Bell, Christopher McDonald and Leslie Nielsen and has an amusing minor role for Jeffrey Tambor, and the whole cast make the very best they can of writer/director Craig Mazin's mostly uninspiring script. The film is far weaker when the story veers off on tangents and tries to spoof films other than Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films in obvious and embarrassingly unfunny ways, particularly criminal is the offensively bad X-Men parody featuring Tracy Morgan. Since it does make you laugh now and again (mostly from ZAZ-influenced jokes that likely resulted from David Zucker serving as one of the film's producers), Superhero Movie is definitely on the better side of bad films, and is far superior to the woeful Epic Movie and Disaster Movie. It's just a shame that it's not more consistently funny, as there is little left to hide Craig Mazin's pretty sloppy filmmaking technique when you're not laughing. At the end of the day, being \"the best of the Scary Movie spin-offs\" isn't really much of an accolade.",
