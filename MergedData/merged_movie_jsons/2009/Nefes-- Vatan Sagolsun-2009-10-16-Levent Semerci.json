            "content": "I was browsing the reviews of \"Nefes\", and since there was only a handful of reviews by non-Turkish IMDb users - since it hasn't been screened much outside Turkey - I felt that I had to give my effort to it. Having said that, I feel that it's been badly misunderstood by many people. Many reviewers judged it as \"propaganda\" or \"morally corrupted\" etc. I couldn't disagree more.To me it wasn't even political, even less morally corrupted - disturbing and even revolting - yes. Corrupted - not even remotely. I might even call it pacifistic. The story is a deep and humane view in to the persona of a soldier. I don't say Turkish soldier, because the moral issues of it are so universal - basically the story could be placed in any war throughout the modern history.**Minor spoiler* Most of the critic on IMDb were about the parts were the Turkish special forces (the main characters) were shown doing unjustified violence to their unarmed prisoner. That's the \"morally corrupted propaganda\" part I guess. The way I see it, it's as anti-propaganda as it gets. It puts the main characters to same line as their enemies. It doesn't try to glorify or justify either sides part on the situation. How's that propaganda? **In a nutshell: Nefes is a visually sublime look in to the social and emotional aspects that drive young men to sacrifice their lives and futures for something as dreadful as war. It's about the brutal effects of violence to ones psyche. And mainly - It's about the endless amounts of everyday tragedies that drive so many of these emotionally fragile young men to see the war as their only option in life.",

            "review_title": "The movie that finally forced me to write my first comment in IMDb... Must see!",
            "content": "This movie is based on a an event of incursion of the small military stationery located at the top of the Mountains in Semdinli (Southeastern border of Turkey) by a PKK terrorist group in 1993. Despite of being a Azeri Turk, I tried to watch and discuss this movie objectively. Why this movie deserves to be watched? Because: This is a unique Turkish movie that incorporated humor, grief, reality, originality, art and most of all simplicity in performance. The acting was pure and simple much like as an original Turkish soldier. A bunch of soldiers from different regions of Turkey connected in a quest. None of them actors were celebrities in real life. Made an impression that I would see and do the same things and have the same conversations if I were in military in some other place. I think nothing is exaggerated in the story and it has an objective opinion on the terrorism but explains it from the Turkish side of view. I've never seen such a pure and simple acting that made me feel in their shoes. The 'calling home' part of the movie is one of the greatest parts. In those couple of minutes I realized that it could be me, my friend (who is a doctor and made his military duty at the same region) or my relative. Don't know how other people would feel but every single Turk watching this movie will see a part of themselves in those soldiers' life. The director is very very successful in transmitting the atmosphere and he deserves a special mention for mastery in simplifying that movie which seems to be actually complicated in it's nature. The artistic scenery especially from a photographic view is another thing that made me feel proud and happy as a photographer. The music at the background successfully synchronized with the events and moods during the entire movie. Finally, the movie is named as 'Nefes' which stands for 'the breath' and is explained in such a conversation that touched me deeply: 'In the fight what matters is breath: whether you 'take' it or 'give' at the end!'...I'd advise anyone to watch this movie... You'll definitely like the cinematography, directing, acting and most of all this is one of the best achievements in Turkish cinema in my opinion...Watch it!",

When I discovered that it was based upon a true story, it only kicked me that much harder.I've actually had people make comments to me about how they would love to be American after seeing a film like Air Force One. I never understood their desire until I saw this film... It made me wish I could be a Turkish soldier! I'm biased - what can I say? I have the utmost respect for the Turkish Asker. So much that I would lay down my own life to protect Turkey and each and every brother that defends her.That said - this picture is powerful and moving. Forget the attitudes experienced in main stream cinema. This movie pulls out the feelings and the pride from within, no matter what your nationality may be.It hurts to face reality of war. But imagine how the soldiers felt.",

Through the eyes of a small brigade of soldiers stationed at the border, the film examines the armed conflict that has been going on for more than 30 years in south-eastern Turkey.Filmed on the high mountains of southern Turkey, the landscape provides a stunning and poetic backdrop. The seclusion, hardship and the tragedy these people had to endure is central to the story.The film has its minor flaws but nevertheless it is effective in putting the audience in the shoes of these soldiers. And it is specifically significant to the Turkish citizens; for they will have a chance to truly empathize with those who rendered services in the region.",

            "content": "This is a must-see movie if you are somehow interested in PKK terror throughout the 90s. It is of further interest for those interested in how a successful movie can be produced with professional directing despite an almost-all amateur cast.It is apparent that a good part of the scenario is based on real events: From personal experience, I recall reading about of the occasions and situations in the movie from the local media. The battle scenes are quite graphic and accurate. The characters feel quite real. They are not necessarily deep, but depth of character is not really necessary for the storyline, as this movie is about the lives of soldiers in an obscure, remote military post.The camera use in the movie is excellent. In the opening scenes, the audience experiences the vastness of the landscape. The feeling of loneliness and being deserted is strongly conveyed. Further into the movie, the camera is used professionally to convey a feeling of urgency in the battle scenes, of which there are only a few. It is equally professional in conveying tranquility, and if you watch the movie, you will see one climax where this contrast is made very apparent.In various connecting scenes, the passage of time and the feeling of timelessness is communicated through fast moving clouds, reminiscent of Donnie Darko.On a further note, most of the actors are either amateurs or had very short acting careers. However, the director manages to offset this setback by using different camera angles where the audience does not have to see the faces of the actors to understand their feelings or mood. This movie is an excellent example of low budget casting can be more successful than many professional actors when good directorship is used.Those being said, there are some unnecessarily long scenes in the second part of the movie, where the captain explains in head-aching detail his philosophy and thoughts as he becomes more and more suicidal. However, I do not take any points off my score for this setback, because long live the Turkish warriors. 10/10",

A drill instructor berates a group of young soldiers; telling them that they will all die; especially if they sleep. He says that their mothers will cry when their bodies are sent home for burial. He asks one of the boys if he has a girlfriend. When he answers yes, the commander says, not anymore, and while you are fighting for your country, she will find a new boyfriend.The platoon is sent to a dangerous mountain region at the Iraqi border to stop the radical Kurdistan Workers Party. The Turkish soldiers learn quickly that they are canon fodder for their government; a fairly universal theme everywhere. The battle scenes are well made and as military films go, The Breath is one of the better ones that I've seen. Director Levent Semerci make you really care what happens to the brave young men.",

            "content": "It was only last night that I found a chance to see this film which I was wondering how it is, for almost a year. Hats off to the director Levent Semerci, Soner Caner (the art director) and Hakan Evrensel, the author of the book.I read some of the reviews here and they were bashing the movie. It has been criticised by some for its lack of objective perspective, questionable realism, being non-factual, etc. These are all discussable. But in my humble opinion, the ones who mark this movie as a \"Turkish propaganda\" know zilch about the real events happening in Turkey or they have some other priorities. I suggest you to see Nefes for yourselves and be the judge. Do not believe the hype.The plot is taken from facts. I did my military service in Eastern Turkey and the things that you see in this film is very close to the reality, I can assure you that. For most of the movie I relived things that I witnessed during my service and I was a member of my squad again, looking for somewhere to fire, to shelter, to prey, and to breath. It was a depressing 2 hours for me, but these are the facts of a soldier's life in Eastern Anatolia, know this. Soldiers who are in active duty face these everyday, not only in Turkey but anywhere in the world where there is trouble. And this movie tells the whole situation in a very realistic manner. For me, Nefes is not only a \"piece of art\" but it is also a good down-to-earth documentary. I do not expect movie critics to understand this, and I do not blame them; but as a Turkish citizen and once a soldier, I directly experienced almost all of the events you will see in this movie, including random radio interventions from terrorists; some useless and pathetic attempts to demoralise Turkish commanders and soldiers.Last scenes with jerky camera shot, lightnings, visual effects and the snappy editing placed me in the action, again, that is for sure. This is exactly what happens if you caught in the middle of a gun fight and Semerci successfully nails it from every aspect.",

            "content": "I know very little about the PKK or the Turkish military, however I have met kurds who fought in various organizations fighting mainly against former dictator Saddam Hussein in Iraq during the 80's.Watching this film that almost only depicts this conflict from the Turkish side, makes it very bias but offers also a rare glimpse into the Turkish feelings about terrorism, and the armed struggle against the kurds.We get to follow a military unit in the Turkish mountains fighting against a mysterious terrorist(and his terrorist cell) who kills mostly of his enemies with a Dragunov sniper rifle.Via a hijacked telephoneline he taunts the military units commander and also spreads his propaganda. The day to day harassments by this man and his terrorist cell is too much for the military commander and soon things will happen.It is not heroic or waterdown version we get here, sure there are scenes when the Turkish military comes across as very noble but there is also fear, anxiety and quite simply the question of why are they here? Being deployed this far up in the mountains fighting a neverending conflict, for very little money, praise etc, is it really worth it?There also scenes that contain very beautiful visuals, the cloudbursting, closeups on ice, etc and singing and poetry recitation by the young soldiers. For a western audience this may feel odd, and there are many passages that don't have any dialogues at all.There is also some critique against the Turkish military, and this came as surprise for me, since Turkey has had a long history of military control and military coups.It is very poetic war drama with some very graphic scenes of violence, anxiety, definitely not suited for kids. Some scenes reminds me of Terrence Malicks excellent war drama The Thin Red Line (1998), Coppolas Apocalypse Now (1979)etc.So for viewers who has no problems with a slowpaced, poetic war drama should check this one out.",

            "content": "After watching Nefes/Breath I concluded that all other war movies I have seen so far were shot for entertainment purposes, not comedy of course but dramatic entertainment. Nefes is unlike them, I was fully captivated, experienced 'shock and awe' during the film and did not know that to do when it finished. The TV, DVD was on and in my bed I was lying perplexed, almost shellshocked, just lying still and thinking nothing for more than 10 minutes.No, it is not a gory film, just that it is real, this is as real as it gets. I can not compare it with any war film or realistic video games such as CoD/MF2. How can it be so 'real' ? I don't know, probably because it was not shot for entertainment or box-office success purposes. The filmmaker had something to tell and he certainly did. My being Turkish may certainly have some influence, not for political reasons but because I fully understood the powerful dialogues.Now, as I write this review I feel pressure on my chest and experience a rush of emotions. Six months is not enough time to recover from what I've experienced so I shall take another six.10/10 Note : In Turkey copy dvds were common when the film was released, less common now as DVD prices were slashed. Yet no one copied Nefes. The 'copycat industry' refused to copy a DVD probably for the first time in their history !",

Whole movie long you see forty 18-19 year old boys who feel proud and strong waiting for the invisible enemy to appear. Not very clear maybe but i believe there is some criticism for the organization of the Turkish Military Forces as non of these soldiers are actually soldiers in their real life. They are just barbers or workers. Some are boys who just graduated the high school. Very nice movie. I hope people outside Turkey also have a chance to watch it. I also liked it because unlike many of the previous movies on the same subject the director never tried to be populist. He is never on any side.",

            "content": "Nefes: Vatan sagolsun (Breathe: Country live forever -- ??)Again and again I feel compelled to explain so many things to foreigners to make it a little bit easy to understand.First of first, there is 30 years of ongoing conflict in Turkey between separatist Kurdish guerrillas and Turkish Army. It's estimated that 15% of population of Turkey is Kurdish originated people mainly living in southeastern parts of the country. So, about 30 years ago a separatist terrorist group (PKK) launched terrorist attacks to Turkish military as well as civil people demanding separation and claiming Kurds were discriminated and were taken their human rights. There's been casualties at both sides reaching to thousands over the years. The interesting point is, nowadays there is a political movement to end this conflict, stop terrorism (much like IRA conflict) and this is the main subject of all the news and the political agenda. So this movie somehow hits the theaters on time as the story takes place in a remote frontier force in 1993 when the terrorist attacks took place everyday.Unfortunately I'm not amazed watching it albeit my expectations were high. Hovewer I think it's part \"Full Metal Jacket\", part \"Good Morning Vietnam\", definitely a new \"breath\" to Turkish cinema (pun intended).If you ask me a little bit about the plot, here it comes. It's a small Turkish frontier force base located on some crazy cold/lonely/frightening mountain peak. Only handful of soldier sent there to stop any intrusion of terrorists, in fact those soldiers are open target themselves. Before going any further, it's good to know that in Turkey, the military service is obligatory and at the age of 20 any healthy man required to join the army and serve up to 18 months. If you're lucky, your service could be in a huge military base peeling potatoes or sweeping the holes. But you may also end up that mountain waiting for death. So many soldiers lost their lives in this fashion over the years. So in this base most of the men are basically doing their 15 months service after only 3 months of training as soldier. They all left their families behind, their moms, fianc\u00e9s, children waiting them with tears in the eye and fear at their hearts.Captain Mete and his platoon send to this mountain base as reinforcement due to expected terrorist attack. They're also informed that there is a terrorist in that region who were once a medical student, later left the university and became a terrorist and he's called \"doctor\".Captain Mete arrives to the base in the darkness of the night, but everybody is at sleep including the watchmen. Moreover we learn that the Captain's platoon were attacked on their way and Captain Mete lost one of his beloved colleague (killed by \"doctor\"). So with all these agony, he gives his famous speech to soldiers at attention while it's snowing and extremely cold (giving shivers to the audience too). This is actually the opening scene and the most powerful scene of the movie. I believe this scene is even stronger than raid/battle scenes at the end.So, throughout the movie we see the life at this little remote base, soldiers' touching talks with their families and radio talks between Captain and the terrorist \"doctor\". This parts of the movie actually little bit stall. Weak character development and very shallow story base puts the audience out. If I'm not mistaken, this is the first cinema movie of the director. He's previously done advertisements shots and video-clips. He blatantly uses the same techniques in the movie. We watch moving clouds, changing filter colors, reflections on window glass etc. But again these all very forgivable for an average audience as the movie is about very much disputed issue. But I also appreciate the director and all the crew achieving this production with such a low budget (about 2 m$). We also see that the director keeps a balanced approach to the political issue as showing both sides' (military and terrorists) weakness. In many scenes we see the Captain questioning the war, talking about his untold love to his wife, talking to soldiers who're richer than him in their civil life (banking people, doctors etc) and questioning putting his life on such a danger as away of living. But we also see Captain Mete's determination to protect the country and fulfill his duty sacrificing everything he owns, including his life. While portraying Turkish army's determined captain, the movie also gives the message that we're on the same boat all Turks and Kurds and this fight is not the right way to go. I think most of the Turks and Kurds share the same thought now.All the men in Turkey raised with military stories and one day we all do the service. This movie very successfully transfers the unforgettable days of men at service to the silver screen. One strong point of the movie, and this actually caught by audience at first sight, is characters (captain and soldiers) are portrayed very closely to reality. Since almost all the men do the military service, watching the movie reminds us our memories (bitter and sweet :) about the army. Although cast is mostly amateur players, their dedication and performance is noteworthy. We don't struggle to believe their characters but unfortunately the scenario is not so fluent. We need to connect the tips of the story instead being told in a nice cinematographic manner. The movie might also be criticized for being too didactic.All in all, it was a nice experience to watch this issue on the big screen. It's probably going to be the blockbuster of this year. I believe we'll have more movies about this topic because there are many real stories waiting to be told like this one.Thanks for reading...",

The terrain is extremely rough and the soldiers manning the hilltop post are isolated from other units. The land is treacherous but the Kurdish terrorists crossing the border from Iraq are more so.Military service in Turkey is compulsory much like a draft in the US, so the soldiers are mostly young people right out of college or high school, with a variety of professions and interests. Their duty is to protect their country against a sinister enemy. In their isolation they miss their wives, girlfriends and moms.The local terrorist leader hiding in the mountains frequently interrupts the outpost commander's conversation over the wireless network and threatens to attack the base. The commander has a vendetta against the terrorist who has killed his friend, a fellow soldier. The fact that the soldiers have to guard the base at all times while the terrorists can attack at their choosing creates a tense drama.This movie is a must-see for anyone looking for human drama in war and incredibly realistic gunfight scenes. But the movie's main legacy is accurate portrayal of the determination of the Turkish army and the Turkish people to protect Turkey founded by Ataturk.",

It has a slight feel of patriotism, but not as much as an average war movie.You can't take the plot in the movie and interpret like it has an international message, like you do in private Ryan. Because you and even most of the Turkish people DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE about what is really going on in the eastern Turkey.I've been there as a soldier, in a troop very near to the place chosen for this film. With the things i saw and observed while I was there, with the conclusions I draw after coming back and thinking about what I experienced for a while, this film is decently REALISTIC and PERSUASIVE to me.Because it's about the unbelievably wrong methods the government and army carry in Eastern Turkey. It's about ordinary and irrelevant young men named \"soldiers\" after a couple of months so called training and are forced to fight an imposed and everlasting war.It's partly about a commander, who lost his sanity and hope after his best friends death.And it's not about anything else...",

It is purely the war from the viewpoint of Turkish soldiers, but the message is universal and I firmly believe a soldier from any army of the world would easily appreciate the film, and see something from his own experience.That said, the film also well depicts the Turkish army in a micro scale; with its flounders (hand grenade), abuses (torturing PKK fighter), fierceness (the successful ambush), and heroism and selflessness, as well as the somewhat tragi-comic side of the daily lives of soldiers, that is present in every barrack, I presume. This is all given in great cinematography from the mountains south-east Turkey (one Turkish general called the area as being \"so rugged that, if it would have been possible to iron that small region, another Turkey-sized flat country would emerge\").Contrary to what has been said, the soldiers are neither glorified, nor booed. So, the film is pretty neutral in that sense.Special mention has to be made about the end of the film. With all the technical difficulties, the director managed to pull the end-scene very nicely without much resorting to use of computer graphics.This is one of the best war movies I have ever seen.",

I just can say that this movie contains some samples from \"Saving Private Ryan\", \"Full Metal Jacket\", \"Jacob's Ladder\", \"Apocalypse Now\", \"Flags Of Our Fathers\", \"Letters from Ivo Jima\".Some mates criticize the movie because of its lack of objectivity. You should understand that this movie does not represent Turkish nationalism, it just reflects the most important problem of our land: PKK terrorism. I classify it as \"most important\" because Turkey have been suffering this for about 25 years. We are still losing our innocent brothers, including our Kurdish citizens. Also in the movie you can see a Kurdish citizen in Turkish forces. He can freely speaks in his native language when he makes phone calls to his relatives. Unfortunately he is killed by PKK terrorists. If you live in Turkey and have some idea about our ethnic structure, you wouldn't use words like \"nationalism\".

The Turkish soldier unlike the street yob found in abundance in all the other paid legioneer armies is a very different one. It runs in the bloodline and all Turks are born fighters. The movie is about how that soldier feels, and I can completely get it why it is so offending to the viewers, reviewers from western developed and glorious countries.

There is a lot of elements the director can use to make the movie funnier, more dramatic or popular or fill with bloody action scenes. But he does not. He gives you everything as they are. A soldier gets dumped by his girlfriend during his military duty; there is a lot of bonuses that the director can get from the Turkish male audience who have been through the same, but he does not. It is like the door scene in Big Lebowski, one of the funniest jokes I have ever seen, but the Coens do not lose a second over that joke, even risking it to go unrealized. Nefes is full of details like this. But the director's real focus is the captain's psychology. It's dark. It's hopeless. It gets even darker and more hopeless. I agree with other comments drawing analogies between Nefes and Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.Do not care to watch this movie if you expect to watch two hours of the Normandia scene in Saving Private Ryan. Watch is if you want to witness an altered psychology as in Apoclypse Now.With no doubt, this movie would affect a Turkish citizen more than any other person, especially if you have been in military or lost someone to terrorism. It is normal, like any Vietnam veteran affected by a Hollywood war movie or any Jew affected by a holocaust movie. As an amateur cinemaphilie, I was impressed by many aspects of Nefes. But it is hard to describe how much I was moved as a Turkish national who is extremely annoyed by the political environment surrounding terrorism these days.As others have put it nicely, Nefes is neither militarist nor anti-militarist. It merely gives you the bare truth about terrorism in Turkey and a professional soldier's psychology as well as of those who are soldiers for a few months for their statutory military duty. The fact that the same event that the movie is referring to happened only last year doubles its impact on the audience.Nefes is a must-see.",

Mete (Mete Horozoglu), who has been unbalanced by recent casualties, takes command of an ill-prepared platoon of military service conscripts assigned a relay station in the South-Eastern mountains of Turkey at the height of the conflict with the PKK in a plot inspired by a number of genuine incidents.Mete Horozoglu is superb at the head of a truly ensemble cast of unknown actors who underwent rigorous military training in preparation for their roles and who as a result come together to create a convincing group of everyday Mehmets, with Dogukan Polat and Ibrahim Akoz particular highlights, sent to almost certain death for reasons they can't truly comprehend.The debut director makes wonderful use of almost poetic imagery to break up the realistically mind numbing monotony of the majority of the film's 128 minute running time with rare moments of high tension such as the Captains initial motivating speech about the dangers of sleep and the brutal final act to create a seemingly realistic war film in the style of \"Full Metal Jacket\" by Stanley Kubrick.This film however steers a careful line between patriotism and anti-militarism prompting massive debate throughout Turkey as to the films true message but however you read it you can't help but be moved by the insight into the everyday lives and deaths of these simple folk facing the banal monotony and absolute terror of compulsory military service in a country at war against itself.\"You'll be heroes for 45 seconds!\"",

            "content": "Nefes (Turkish for 'Breath') is probably the most anticipated Turkish movie of this year. It is the best Turkish war movie of all time and has the best combat scene ever shot in the history of Turkish cinema, but, of course, what is there to compete?Breath is about a small group of Turkish soldiers in a remote patrol station waiting for their near-certain death during a time the conflict between Turkish Army and separatist militant organization PKK reached its peak point. A major who had just lost two people in his command in a combat with PKK militants arrives at the station and takes charge. He finds it very difficult to step out of the state of depression due to his recent loss and so intimidates his soldiers into bettering themselves to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again. During his stay there, he came across a PKK militant called the 'Doctor' who intervenes in his phone calls with his wife through radio frequencies. This becomes almost habitual with frequent exchange of hostile words between two. ' Why do you live like pigs instead of being a doctor in your village and serving your people' the Major asks and 'I would rather live in my mountains as a freeman than being a doctor from your universities' the Doctor replies. In parallel to that, we observe daily routines of soldiers and their sincere phone calls with their loved ones as we approach to the inevitable end.It is obvious that the movie is intended to be a propaganda device. We sympathize with our soldiers through their several phone conversations with their families and friends. On the other hand, militants are depicted as zombies who attack innocent people stuck in a cabin just like in a George Romero movie. Their leader, the Doctor, even has that 'jigsaw killer' voice. That is probably why the movie with its full title 'Long live the Homeland' is already hailed by top army officials during its opening day. However, it is difficult to understand why? First of all, the film gives you the impression that Turkish soldiers stand no chance against fierce militants that coincides with PKK's successful recent raids to such patrol stations. Another thing is the conversations between the Doctor and Major. The Doctor sounds very 'cool' as a man who believes in a higher cause, and the Major, on the other hand, just uses some clich\u00e9 sentences filled with swear words and there is also a hint (actually more than a hint at one scene) that the officer is inclined to commit war crime. Leaving politics aside, the movie does succeed in creating a great patrol atmosphere, with beautiful shots of Turkey's eastern mountains. Clouds and fog are an important focus of attention, which takes you out of this world to a mystical place. Combat scene technically equals a good Hollywood movie. I have my doubts about how much an outsider would enjoy this movie considering the fact that it brings nothing new to the genre, but anyone who had been through 90s in Turkey would appreciate this movie thoroughly.",

Really stupid parts exist... Half of the film is just talking and seeing landscapes:))-cheap-- what is really unrealistic? the shot from that window to the head of the soldier talking with the radio is impossible:)) because the side that the radio room window looks to a cliff..and hut is on the top of a hill by the way nothing exist in front of hut window that side except the cliff ,..so if you are not shooting from the same level of height from a helicopter:)) it is impossible to shoot that soldier. If your bullet is an intelligent bullet and it makes a huge curve to the upside than straight it makes sense:)))) Some say \"it is nationalistic or propaganda\" This is ridiculous. Until this film, there are thousands of American films or ww2 films that Germans are always shown like murderers and merciless people..in reality some good Germans must be existed:)) Bringing freedom is always to the poor countries, why they don't bring freedom to Russia or china? and their way is to rape, torture, murder and exploit petrol. Then making films to create fake heroes to cover up truth with heroic feelings. They never accused of making nationalistic or propaganda Films. :)) i think it is better than an American war film like Rambo who never die or Rocky never beaten:)))and i laugh at the commenter who talk about the girl who is innocent with an AK47.. what is she doing on the top of the mountain? A commenter said \"unarmed girl\" yes,she is unarmed after soldiers get her AK47:)).. Is she a mountain climber with an assault rifle? Anyways, the film is boring at the second half..and not a very successful film at all but better than an American propaganda film which inject people Uncle Sam brought you liberty and freedom. Anybody must not forget, liberty and freedom is not given by anybody. You even earn it not to become slaves.",

The film is about a soldier unit up on a mountain top, defending it against the PKK terrorist organization. It starts very well, very good acting and tough. It revealed real moments of military service and the truth about the danger up their. The shooting and screening is perfect. Didn't expect to see this level of quality in a Turkish movie, but the story, which started very good, ends very bad. After the first half of the movie, it shows too much of the captains emotions. Even though the goal of this movie is to show the emotional side of the soldiers, but this was just too much and it ruined the whole movie. This could have been just a perfect Turkish movie. The director tried to implement several messages to the Turkish - pkk conflict, saying we're all the same etc. but in one point it got unreal. Very good work, but still not good enough. Worth seeing though!",

            "content": "Nefes is the story of forty soldiers who are on duty to protect a relay station (Karabal Station of Gendarmes)at a height of 2361 meters. The job of the soldiers has taken on an added importance at a time of cross-border operation because the military communication will be established in the above-mentioned outpost. A captain who is supposed to command those soldiers is sent to this station from a district located on the Iraqi border. With the soldiers at his command he will protect the station no matter what.When a movie makes it to top 250 so quickly, it is so natural that it creates quite a furore especially if it's a non-US movie that has not been screened all over the world yet.A few Turkish movies like Babam ve Oglum,Eskiya and Saban Oglu Saban have made it to top 250 before but none of them have ever stayed on. Those who are obsessed with the top 250 and those who complain about the top 250 movies that they have never liked do always tend to forget something.TOP 25O list is perfectly a contest for popularity. It is not a competition of quality.Just take a look at the latest movies that have recently made it to the list, Hangover,Zombieland? They are just screwball comedies.Just because they got themselves a place on the list that does not mean they are quality movies but that doesn't mean they are not fun either but they will stay on the list for some time but they won't be there forever. Think about Hot Fuzz (2007)for instance it had been on the list for more than a year but now it isn't though it still is popular and has a good rating (8.0/10-117,958votes) Then again,Nefes is truly a unique movie. Why? Because Turkey is a country who has never ever been able make other countries see what it has been going through for a few decades now. We are losing our beloved sons every day and this has become so normal that fancy news announcers just mention their name in forty second news reel footages. It does not matter for others though. We are telling we are fighting against PKK and PKK has been officially designated as a terrorist organization by the European Union but EU and US press have always refrained from using \"terrorist\". German paper Die Welt speaks about the \"PKK guerrillas,\" \"Kurdish freedom fighters\" and \"Kurdish extremists\".The official news agency of Austria, APA, also describes the PKK as a group of \"Kurdish insurgents\".The BBC, for example describes PKK as a \"separatist Kurdish group\" so it is perfectly clear that we have never been able to clarify what we have been going through. We may just say \"oh come on,they are just a bunch of hypocrites who call Palestinians terrorists but when it comes to PKK, they are only extremists\" but that won't do because we need to make them (at least the Europeans and Americans on the street) see what we have gone through and making movies is the only way to do it.Americans have made movies about Somali,Iraq,Vietnam wherever their soldiers set foot, so Nefes is actually a \"first\" in a way. It is a start to tell about our suffering but we need to be more creative about it. It is nice to see that the movie is trying to tell that all those soldiers are just a handful of youngsters who don't know much about war. It is obvious that many foreigners do not know how conscription in Turkey works.In Turkey the duration of the basic military service varies.As of July 2003, the reduced durations are as follows: for those without 4 year university degrees fifteen months as privates; for those with 4 year university degrees or higher either twelve months as reserve officers or six months as short-term privates. It all depends on your luck even if you are a university graduate. You may do your military service in a western seaside a resort or an eastern highland outpost.Thankfully all the soldiers fighting against PKK will be consisted of only professional commandos by mid-2011.Anyway, like I said Nefes is a \"first\" but it does not live up to expectations.This movie should have been more creative. I mean, think about it you are making a war story and there is almost no armed,head-on clash in the first hour and you are filling it with a telephone conversation between a captain and a terrorist leader who dropped out of medical school and the whole message you are giving is that those terrorists are giving a meaningless fight. As viewers who have experienced those deaths closely we are aware of the fact they are fighting a futile war but how will you be able to get across your message to the world?Will you be able to make the whole world believe that Kurds are equal citizens with none of their rights ripped off from them? There are still American and European people who ask me whether we see Kurds as second-rate citizens? How will be able to show them we have never seen a Kurd in that way, like a Pashtun saw a Hazara or a white saw a black years ago? How will you be able to convince that we are the citizens of the same country, that we try to live on in the same conditions? I do not think it is convincing at all to carry a PKK woman in a helicopter do you? Everybody knows that all is fair on the battlefield and everybody knows that you do not try to enliven your enemies,at least not twice.I wonder how many soldiers drop his weapon not to kill a person who has killed a lot of fellow soldiers? In short, we need to show our support for Nefes so that more movies like that could be filmed but we still have a long way to get across our situation to the world.",

            "content": "War, what is it for? Nefes - Breath is one of the best Turkish films on the market. The film is based on a true conflict that goes around in the southeastern part of Turkey for many years. While I like to review without regarding the previous reviews, this film deserves some back-story. First of all, the film is not intended specifically for outside viewers. It is hard for a foreigner to understand the militaristic nature of Turkish people. Still, it is an important aspect of Turkish culture, without violent roots present in western militaristic mind. Note that Turkish Military mind upholds peace over war and prefers cease fires even the odds are with them. Secondly, this film is about waiting for an enemy who will strike for sure. The psychological stillness present in the whole part of the movie is the real thing on the battlefield. As a soldier, you will wait for countless nights and fight for just an hour. This was always the basis for wars throughout the history. So, if you really want to picture the war as real as possible you must consider the silence before the storm. This film does that. Thirdly, a woman always wears make-up, even in the mountains. And the make-up used by the women on the mountain is customary to regional people, dominant in Kurds, black lines on the eyelashes. Also, it is known that terrorists on the mountains mostly bring their families, girlfriends with them, especially during winter time where it is hard to go down the mountains. In short, this film is about people, waiting. It is highly artistic with real acting. Some people may criticize that exactly precise acting may be no acting at all. So, expect real people and expect real talks. A must-see for every Turk. Hard to get for westerners. Understandable for easterners.",

In other words the director decided to exploit Turkish people's low feelings of Turkish Nationalism and make some quick bucks. What's next a movie about how the Armenian genocide never happened? Turkish Nationalism reigns supreme in this horrible movie! By the way, this movie is WAY OVERRATED, a more fair rating would be 5-6 on IMDb but seems that someone is manipulating the ratings... I've noticed that several other Turkish movies are rated over 8.0 which is very high for IMDb standards. Considering Turksih movies are not really well known in English speaking countries the numbers are obviously manipulated.",

Unfortunately \"Nefes: Vatan sagolsun (The Breath)\" turned out to be a rather bad movie. First thing to analyze is to judge whether this is a propaganda movie or not: It is not a obvious propaganda movie, that is for sure. But looking at IMDb comments like: \"long live Turkish warriors\" and others, i think it's a simplistic and unidimensional war movie. The PKK-Dudes are shown as insane suicide bombers, evil misanthropists. There is no word about what caused this conflict. Another thing i must state is that this is not a anti-war-movie. I could explain that in words, but i strongly recommend everyone in the world to watch : \"Hotaru no haka (Grave of the Fireflies\". Then you will know why most of the so called \"anti-war-movies\" are not what they are trying to be.Well, there isn't everything bad about the movie. The acting is OK.I also liked some of the pictures like the scenes with the clouds. The characters could have been interesting, i mean their development in solitude. Problem is that i've seen lots of movies that to exactly that in a better way. In this movie i never really care for any of the characters. Well that's it. I don't want to disrupt you folks in your excessive nationalism, so just keep rating this as 10/10",

This movie isn't near this rate. I watched it because of this high rate and I was surprised. Perhaps it is one of the best Turkish movies out there, but I did not watch many of them, so I can't compare this one to others.In other comments i've read, that it is propaganda, but that is a point I can't support.I would give 5-6 points for this but I only give 2 for the existing high rate.

No girl in the mountain wears make-up. What did he meant to say with that scene when the tel is on. Should the girls be models or something?

Oh, for the user who wants to see everybody's sides: Why don't they show in the movie what happened or what is felt from the Germans side? Or, how a 7 person army kills entire German brigade throughout the movie on only 5 of them gets killed? If the Breath movie is full of nationalism and stuff, how about the above mentioned movie? My opinion is, I like both movies, Saving the Private Ryan for its storyline and its great scenes and the Breath for showing what has happened in the last 30 years. (I also find that there are some flaws at some scenes but overall, for the people who had to endure such conditions, this movie was the first one to express their feelings and it will probably be the last one.)",
