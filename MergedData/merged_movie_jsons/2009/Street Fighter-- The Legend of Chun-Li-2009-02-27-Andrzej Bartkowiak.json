            "content": "So this movie has been on my radar for quite a while. I was smooth talked by Justin Mark's assurance that his treatment of the movie was respectful and to be prepared for a new era of gaming films. I was pumped and on board, and then... I saw the film. THE GOD-AWFUL The script from this movie was a joke. When Bison utters something about milk and expiry dates, I laughed. It was a nervous laugh, but it was laughter. This movie makes no sense to me at all. The pitch was it was a Chun Li story about looking beyond revenge. In the end, she gets her revenge and the moral is? Revenge is the answer. THE BAD The costumes in this movie can also suck it. I felt terrible for Kristin in the night club scene, wearing a ridiculous dress and using her feminine wiles ( primo top dollar dancing to the unaware) to lure Cantana, a lesbian associate of Bison, into a bathroom. The pacing of this movie was dreadful, and we are hand-held for every scene, if Chun Li is walking on the screen she will undoubtedly inform us \"I was walking..\" ... REALLY? Really. THE UGLY The truth is this movie insults movie goers, gamers, and people, in general. Am I supposed to feel for Chun Li, even though she had a privileged life, and a loving mother? How is she a victim of circumstance? Am I supposed to feel Vega's threatening persona through five minutes of him getting the crap kicked out of him? Am I supposed to believe Bison is all evil when he continues to nurture his daughter? I think this movie was seriously edited so terribly, whatever good there was to salvage was lost on the cutting room floor. Whoever edited this needs to be bird kicked in the throat. It just makes no sense to me how the editor could do his job, watch the movie and allow this to enter the theaters. The best parts of the movie involved subtitles, and a sunset. That is it. So there you go, street fighter 2? Most assuredly, not.",

            "content": "There are people saying that this is the worst movie ever, obviously they have not seen the recent spoof movies and some movies made by Uwe Boll. Street fighter: the legend of Chun-Li is actually entertaining, it has actually some great music to follow the story and from my point, it makes the movie more entertaining. Acting is not that good especially Chris Klein's. The fighting scenes are not that bad, though they do have some confusing and sloppy stunts. It is based on the popular fighting game.The story: Chun-Li's father was kidnapped by some bad guys who are Bison and Barog. Few years later, she sets out a journey to find her father. The cops led by Charlie Nash and Maya. Blah, the story is typical. Fight scenes are slotted in between the action-packed journey. Charlie Nash(Chris Klein) makes the acting unintentionally funny. Even the way he walks. One word I can describe his acting: Lame. It seems that he is bored plus he is over-acting. I got to admit that some of his looks are priceless. He makes the story less serious. But whatever it is, I was entertained.Overall: It is not that bad as what other people commented on it. If you want an enjoyable movie, leave your brain at home. Don't take this movie seriously. If you do that, you will be groaning all the way plus it may seem to you that you are sitting on the sofa for more than 2 hours. This is the first video-game adaptation for the year. Be prepared for more are coming.",

            "content": "If you think my heading is cheesy and stupid you're absolutely right and I heartily agree...unfortunately that vary statement is the crux of the latest Street Fighter attempt's plot.Ignoring the 1994 Van Damme version of the franchise this film starts anew, focusing on the character of Chun Li, a young Asian woman highly skilled in both piano and martial arts. Her dad gets taken away from her at a young age by M. Bison who uses him in his criminal plot to overthrow Bangkok. Unfortunately for Bison Chun Li grows up, meets a mystic who teaches her some freaky stuff and sets out to kick his ass. While the Van Damme version was far from spectacular it had a sense of humor about itself and wasn't afraid to have fun with the material, which was at the very least entertaining for a lazy hour and a half. The Legend of Chun Li tries to be a dark brooding action thriller with something like Batman Begins as its model...but the material just doesn't support it. The plot goes back and forth between clich\u00e9s and just plan dumb hokey sci-fi stuff. Yes, being \"rid of your goodness\" is actually a plot point. The script is loaded with cheesy dialog and flat characters which doesn't make the actors' jobs any easier and they really don't live up to the challenge. Chris Klein is particularly bad in his attempt to be the bad ass.You would think the action would at least make it worth the time but even that is nothing to brag about. The fights are far too staged and obviously fake. They throw in some signature moves from the video games that are beyond reality. If they'd been shot differently they would've been cool, but here they just look ridiculous. These are things that would fit at home in a more cartoony film like its predecessor...but sorry, no go.",

            "content": "When i first saw the trailers of this movie, i thought that it was gonna be great and entertaining. I remember playing the video games of street fighter while growing up and remembering the characters so i got excited for this. But this was a big disappointment. I can honestly say that the script was just plain awful. Since the script was crap i cant blame the actors for there performances. Except for Nash (Chris Klein) he was truly terrible, how the hell is he able to be an actor and who is the idiot that decided to pay him for it. they should of really ran through the script and made sure it all made sense. The first fight scene was actually good so i thought it was going to be a good movie, all though i did not like the intro to the movie since it dragged on. I hate movies where the characters tell their story and when their telling it from their prospective. That was how it started for street fighter. Vega was over too quick and not great, the club scene was all right until Chun-Li did her upside down kick it was way poorly done. And the ending was really weird. While Chun-Li and Gem are talking, Gem mentions Ryu's name..it must be a hint that there will be a sequel. Hopefully if there is one, it will be better than this.The movie was very confusing to watch and I just didn't understand what exactly was the point. I just got cheesed off at a point. They ruined another video game movie...way to go. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, seriously bad",

It seemed that they took a really bad, wannabe Kung-Fu movie added some Street Fighter names and thought that would good enough to pass it off as a Street Fighter movie. Horrible, almost nonexistent plot, bad acting, and terrible fight scenes make this movie not worth the time it takes to watch it. At times it was funny though, but not intentionally. When certain characters try to be serious or they throw out some line they think would be good catch phrase you can't help but laugh at how poor the acting was.",

(try the fantastic movie, or hell ride, that should give you some perspective.) Second: What were you expecting? Some Oscar-winning masterpiece, based on a game like street fighter? Please! In what reality do you live in? Anyway. Now about the movie. I'm a huge (and often disappointed) fan of martial arts movies. Having of course seen the 1994-van damme-version, my expectations were low. But i actually liked it! The movie is somewhat mediocre, thank the Hollywood goods for that! OK, so some characters (vega, the two detectives) were underdeveloped and didn't quite fit in. The acting didn't have 'batman begins' quality and the fight scenes weren't all fearless-y (jet li), but so what?!! Kristine Kreuk looked great in those fight scenes. The fights were original, acrobatic and fun. Better wire work as in romeo must die! It (almost) never looked fake. But what I liked most was that there were no unnecessary special effects. (remember 1994? OMG)In other words: The film worked for me, because it was not trying too hard. Not too much action, drama and special effects. Its not a great film, but decent. Try not to expect too much and you will not be disappointed. (If you don't agree with me, you should go rent movies like the mummy 3 and have a blast with all the terrible CGI)",

Come on now, its a video game made to movie, by Capcom, whose never made a good adaptation of a video game movie.Some of the reviewers comments were legit. For instance, Chun Li was clearly Chinese when she was 10 years old. But when she grew up, she was half Chinese and half Caucasian.A lot of the people here complained about the storyline and the lack of special effects. Too much nick picking...The storyline wasn't too bad, it didn't stay 100% to the video game storyline, but somewhat similar. And to me, was the storyline good enough? yes it was, I wasn't expecting much in the first place so i could only go up from there.There wasn't too much special effects in this movie. Which I enjoyed more actually. The movie would look too unrealistic if fireballs were thrown everywhere.Acting was OK, not great and convincing, but for this type of movie, its good enough.Honestly, this movie isn't as bad as people claim, I've seen much worst movies made by the way-an brothers. And the notion that even the first street fighter movie was better than this one is totally ludicrous. The first one had the worst acting, color, special effects ever, not even close compared to this one.",

            "content": "I had never heard of Chun Li until I first saw the announcement that Kristin Kreuk would get the lead. What I eventually learned about The Street Fighter, I liked. A female lead in an action role which could compare somewhat to Batman sounded enticing. I guess another comparison that crossed my mind was Lara Croft.Kristin Kreuk won a great part when she got the role of Chun Li. Being a fair-weather fan of Smallville, I had long hoped she would find a fitting character in the movies. Her time has come. I like her ability to show intensity and weakness. Emotion is her best partner in acting.As far as the movie itself goes, I felt somewhat cheated. I was intrigued by the introduction which was narrated nicely by Kristin. Some of the narration that continued was OK, but it soon became an awkward and overbearing distraction. The director obviously did not recognize that crossing the line by over-narration in an action movie could be a definite drawback. He also did not seem to know that, while this is a movie about a fictitious crime/street fighter, you don't have to litter this kind of movie with weak and poorly played characters like Charlie Nash and Detective Maya Sunee. They both seemed to be square pegs being forced into round holes. Chris Klein overplayed his part as though he thought playing an immature detective meant acting like a 12 year old one moment and 17 otherwise. I am sure the 12 and 17 year-olds who played this game were just as disappointed as I was with his portrayal. Meanwhile, Moon Bloodgood seemed to be just as unsure what she was doing with her character. If there is a sequel, these two characters will have to be re-hashed - hopefully by two different actors. And at this point, I have to say, a new director should be considered as well. Andrzej Bartkowiak seemed too loosely connected to the true potential of this movie. Forget about accentuating bumbling law enforcement, focus more on action, mystery and oriental intrigue. Comic relief is good but outright stupidity is unforgivable.I found the fight scenes fun to watch and special effects were enjoyable although minimal. The story was good ; better than the story tellers.Michael Clarke Duncan and Neal McDonough both were great. The deadly threat they both portrayed helped to keep the story together by giving the good guys more evil to fight off than they seemed to be able to handle. And Robin Shou was a great trainer and partner for Kistin Kreuk. If Kristin and Robin come back for a sequel, then the sequel stands a chance of being better than the original, even though, I still give Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li a 7/10",

I felt ashamed even just watching the movie, must've been tough to be actually a part of it. Well, at least they all got paid.I really don't have anything positive to say about the film. 1/4",

The cast showed signs of \"mixing it up,\" with its choices and I was willing for the ride.While the overall origin story is strong (the piano playing a very nice touch for depth) unfortunately many scenes come off as campy. On a scale, the strongest scenes are easily those between Kristin Kreuk and Robin Shou as Chun Li and Gen, and sadly the weakest being Michael Clark Duncan and Chris Klein's characters of Balrog and Nash.That was the central problem for me here, there is an exciting action piece at work but is jumbled with various other plot lines and set pieces that really feel out of place. The feeling of the film comes off as uneven as was also the case with Director Andrzej Bartkowiak's previous works in CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE and DOOM. This film unfortunately continues Bartkowiak's pattern.Nevertheless, Chun Li was carried well by Ms. Kreuk and the effort was well mounted.RT.",

For anyone who knows anything about Street Fighter, set yourself up for disappointment because the movie has absolutely nothing to do with the game. There are little to zero special effects and the ones that are in the movie do not revolve around the fighters special powers. Let's talk about the characters....I realize the movie is suppose to be about Chun-Li, but that does not mean exclude every other character in the game. The ONLY characters are Chun-Li, Balrog, Bison, and Vega. None of the characters have the same power or skill that they display in the game. There are also a lot of over played scenes by useless characters such as Chris Klein's Interpol character and the other Asian chick that also has no purpose.

            "review_title": "what went wrong?",
            "content": "This movie is obviously going for a \"re-imaging\" of Street Fighter. Take a storyline and make it realistically believable. A number of movies adapted from comic books, cartoons and games have succeeded in that aspect; choosing to disregard the more far fetched and fantastical concepts and replacing them with aspects that are more rooted in contemporary reality.I respect such a decision and who is to dispute it? Previous game adaptations that stuck with its more \"unrealistic\" concepts(Dead or Alive, Street Fighter 1994) never did as well as those that underwent a realistic re-imaging; like Tomb Raider and Resident Evil. In fact, it would be a breath of fresh air to have a Street Fighter story firmly grounded in reality and without all the campy goofiness that made its predecessor such an embarrassment.So what went wrong? The story was simple enough to follow. The main character was well developed, as was she good eye candy. The acting was adequate with Neal McDonough giving one fine performance as a screen villain. Intense action and well choreographed fight scenes coupled with all the right camera angles made each battle a treat to watch. if its one thing that director Andrzej Bartkowiak can do, that is stage a fight and work a camera to bring out the best in that fight scene.(and not surprising since he was originally a cinematographer-turned-director). Each kick and punch is shown with such vivid impact, yet wire stunts and what not are played out with restraint so as to not take away from the realism of the show. Whats more, the director is in familiar territory. With crime syndicate/revenge/martial arts movies like Cradle 2 the Grave and Romeo Must Die in his resume, Legend of Chun Li is right up his alley.So what went wrong? Indecision. Either it was indecisiveness or a case of \"too many cooks spoil the soup\".I bet the producers were split 50/50 on whether to make a) Make this movie a complete realistic re-imaging or b) Stick to the far fetched concepts of special powers and \"dark qi\" and evil organizations bent on world conquestIn the end, they took what could have been one of the MOST grounded-in-reality story for any video game adaptation, and threw in some of the most unbelievable, far out elements from the game. THe movie was going strong until 30 minutes into the film when you see a character tossing a \"special power fire-ball\" around. Yes i know the game characters tossed special power balls around like pies among clowns but against such a realistic setting and backdrop, such a concept would be ludicrous. Fine, they changed Bison from a power hungry, \"psycho power\" wielding dictator in charge of his own terrorist nation, into a more realistic underworld crime lord who works through blackmail and subterfuge. Then they had to go and throw in \"ancient dark arts to rid a person of his conscience by transferring it into a baby\". One of the silliest things i've ever heard; it sounds like something out of a bad 70s cartoon.Unable to decide if it was going to be a straight out adaptation or a re-imagine, this movie failed to define its target audience and instead delivered a half baked product that was all over the place but not where movie goers want it to be. Overall, it is an entertaining but slightly clich\u00e9d cop/criminal organisation/martial arts/revenge story. This movie could have been so much more, but alas, it was not to be. Watch this one just for the fight scenes, and the ever attractive Kristin Kreuk. Way-ta-ruin a movie Capcom and thanks for the fireballs.",

It's been ages since I have seen a film of such poor quality, so much so that the many parts of the whole have come together to form a movie so insipid, so completely devoid of merit that only a team of evil geniuses, locked away in an isolated mountain fortress, driven mad by loneliness, despair, and bad TV sitcoms could have ever created such an atrocity.So, the film opens with a a lengthy, completely unnecessary monologue by Chun-Li that is supposed to set the story and give neophytes into the Street Fighter saga some background into her life. Great. This part proceeds with the pacing and depth of a newbie film student's freshman project, and is completely unremarkable. WHat is TRULY terrible, however, is that she NEVER SHUTS UP! Usually a narration is present to help you discern elements of a story that you might otherwise miss, such as a character's thoughts and feelings...but when she goes on and on talking about everything that you the viewer are already seeing on screen, well...someone was definitely trying to pad their script.Oh yeah, the script...let's talk about that for a little bit, shall we? Right from the get-go, you are amazed at the flat, base dialog that would only impress those who had just discovered the joys of reading - the speech is flat, stilted, and poorly acted by all in the cast. M. Bison's entry into the early set was particularly painful to listen to, and Balrog's cheesy entrance into the scene was so god-awful that I was actually pining for the time when he held a video camera as Chun-Li's cameraman back in 94! Oh, and let's talk about one plot point that just angered me off from the get-go: M. Bison's origin. So, supposedly, in order to drive out his \"conscience,\" (which is supposed to make him more powerful? Heh...okay...) he must rip his unborn daughter from her mother's womb in a spooky cave where evil spirits dwell.Huh. Riiiight.Now, it's bad enough that they made up such a stupid plot point to begin with, but can someone please explain something to me: just how is it that M. Bison could have actually even HAD a conscience in the first place if he was willing to go through with killing his wife and ripping out his daughter from her womb? Further, HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO MAKE HIM MORE POWERFUL?! ............yeah. It's a lot of this \"I stole these plot ideas from my ten year old son\" crap throughout the whole film.Oh, and if anyone EVER defends Chris Klein as an actor after this film, they lose all credibility...not just as a film critic, but as a human being with ANY opinion whatsoever. My God...that man brings suck to a previously unheard of level that actually elevates Sci-Fi channel original movie D-listers...How's this for a succinct clincher: Street Fighter: the Legend of Chun-Li actually gives Manos: the Hands of Fate some healthy competition for worst film ever.",

There are hundreds of highly skilled Asian actors that could have been casted in a better fashion. Bison/Balrog (lol confusing) kept reminding me of the Green Mile, the death sentenced good guy with a heart of gold. Now he is some buffed punchbag, mmm.

Good but not great film is an okay time killer. Seeing this in close proximity to the much inferior Dragonball Evolution I know raised the enjoyment level a great deal since this is a film that not only doesn't seem aimed at kids but also has some pretty good fight scenes.(I know my saying that may come as a surprise since I was less then thrilled with how the making of show on Fox Movie Channel showed the fights). Of course what I can decipher of the plot is clich\u00e9 and of course it would have helped had I had a working knowledge of the various story lines and characters from the other incarnations, but at the same time I could follow it enough that this was a good rainy Sunday afternoon popcorn movie.

Movies based on video games are generally at a disadvantage for not being liked. The strengths in this movie are the fights scenes, and that's about it. The formless projectiles don't really make sense. (Ryu and Ken's Hadouken's?) None the less, the fights were the only reason why I didn't really hate this movie. I also liked the background settings of Bangkok, seeing the characters weave around and chase each other through the market places, the back alleys and the housing was actually memorable.The writers at least tried to make a good story but fell flat on the concept of implementing Vega, M. Bison and Balrog into the story line. The acting was sub par, all the characters were practically mismatched. Michael Clarke Duncan looked like he was about to cry every time he spoke. I mean this is the guy who is known for his cheery/weepy emotional attitude in the Green Mile and Armageddon, and hearing his voice was annoying as a villain. (BTW-I don't recall him ever boxing here). Neal McDonough didn't fit the M. Bison role at all. At least Raul Julia looked like him in the uber crappy predecessor, and Vega was supposed to be Spanish. The Cantana character was somewhat intriguing with her lesbian tendencies, but she didn't have enough screen time that really mattered. Chris Kline was mismatched in that he acted too perverse to be an Interpol agent, maybe if he turned out to be an evil Interpol agent, it would have made the movie interesting; however, he and Moon Bloodgood do nothing but ponder upon M. Bisons would-be conspiracies and hog up too much screen time. When in-fact these two useless characters DON'T DO ANYTHING but theorize! (okay there WAS an exception at the end.) Gen reminded me of a generic character of the cheesy Englished dubbed kung fu movie. Saying things like \"Impress me with your training\" or \"You will know when you are ready to face him\" to Chun Li. It was laughable. Kristin Kreuk, was okay as an actress, she was more effective in her choreography than in words. She looked too much like the girl next door rather than a serious fighter.The story obviously doesn't fit with the story of the game. The title should have been called: The Girl-Next-Door Takes On THE MAN instead of Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.Overall, I can't be serious on recommending this movie. There are much better martial arts films, and even movies based on video games. But it could have been much worse, but its flaws are rather noticeable.",

The story is basic, but that's not why you watch this kind of movie. The stunts and fighting are pretty good. I like the Kristin Kreuk seemed to do most of her own stunts. If she didn't then that's another kudos to the film makers. The music is good, as are the set and costumes.I also like to see Neal McDonough in pretty much anything he does.

            "content": "This movie is very terrible in many ways.First off, the choice of characters is the worst possible ever for a game movie. Chun Li is meant to be Chinese yet you've chosen an actress who has problem speaking the language in the movie (when for example she asks for help which she asked in a terrible accent).Game movies are not really easy to be pulled off along with good reviews, not many are out there. The reason is shown very clear in this movie. The director ALWAYS misses the point of what the movie should be about; I mean fair enough you don't want a movie about Ryu fighting Ken or Bison, and want a Legend of Chun Li, But you could've put a better story in it, or give the movie better actors (I can't believe the acting in this movie). Take Marvel for example, their world interacts a lot of different marvel characters, but when it comes to their own movie/cartoon, they actually make the story relevant to the characters life(e.g just because Bison was the boss, it doesn't mean that Chun Li's life has to be revolved around killing him (which is what Ryu does)).The choice of camera shots used to try and show the story was also done badly. For example when Bison was trying to show the camera that he had a picture of his wife and daughter, which were dear to him; First off, would Bison do this? Secondly, this is very very corny.This movie had made me dislike street fighter. I would highly recommend better actors and directors AND story writers if another street fighter movie comes out.P.S Didn't finish the movie, it was that bad.",

            "content": "So one would think that this movie would be more accurate to the video games and Anime movies since Capcom had direct hands in this. Nope! This is even worse than the 1994 film. But unlike that one, this one isn't fun. This one isn'y laughably bad. It's just bad. I'll basically go through it, so spoilers if you actually wanted to be surprised.I went into it expecting crap based on the trailers. But at first, I'm pleasantly surprised! Duncan is Balrog and portrays him very well. Big black boxer, working for Bison, enjoys killing people. Spot on characterization and acting. The opening fight with Chun Li's dad against Balrog and his henchmen was good fun all the way through. I was having a great time! Then M. Bison comes in. Who appears to be the nicest British man in the world. I don't think he's actually British, but that's how he feels. He is not fueled by Psycho Power, he is not the be all end all badass. He's a guy in a suit. Now at first I thought this is how he would start, then later in the movie he would get his Psycho Powers. This never happens.Chun-Li's actress isn't a bad actress. She plays the role very well. But there's a big major problem, she looks nothing like Chun-Li. This is a glaring issue if for no other reason than it being so distracting to a fan of the games. She's barely Asian, more meek than the most powerful woman in the world, and her legs are NOT super duper awesome. Speaking of which, Chun Li never does her kick attack in this movie. Her trademark move is nowhere to be seen. She does something similar to a Spinning Bird Kick and a Kikoken. In fact, the focus of making Chun Li so awesome in this movie is her learning and performing the Kikoken. Nevermind that this move has never been the focus of Chun Li's character ever, it's her lightning fast kicks. But I'm glad there was a fireball in this movie, that was the main down note of the original live action Street Fighter movie. Also she's not a cop. At all.Robin Shou finally pops back up into movies playing Gen. Of course, the character is portrayed completely wrong. He's not an old assassin, he's a middle aged former criminal. He also teaches Chun Li the Kikoken. But since Gen hasn't been such a staple character like say most of the SF2 characters, it isn't as obvious. It's nice to see Robin again, as well.Charlie Nash appears in this as well. The name is pretty much all you get though. He doesn't fight, doesn't Sonic Boom, and doesn't really look like Charlie.Vega is a waste of Vega. He's dressed in all black and has long black hair, making him look like a ninja as opposed to a Spaniard fighter. Sure, he's the \"Spanish Ninja\", but his costume is ridiculous. The mask looks like a really cheap prop, especially even compared to the 1994 film. The actor, as well, is a horrible cast for Vega. Vega is beautiful. The Vega in this movie is a tough guy and sounds more like a black man than Michael Clark Duncan. Plus his appearance is horribly short both times, which is worse the second time around. You expect Chun Li vs. Vega to be the first really big fight and it's actually the shortest.The movie itself has serious pacing issues. Chun Li starts fighting about 15 minutes too late. A large chunk of the first act is based on Chun Li \"living amongst the people of Bangkok\". Something which could have been wrapped up in a few minutes, we would have gotten the point. Instead we're treated to what feels like a half an hour of boring narration and Chun Li walking around streets.Most of the time when Chun Li is kicking ass, it's entertaining. The problem is how little it happens. And how boring the rest of the movie is. Whenever we cut to Nash, we just don't care about that storyline. When Chun Li dances, it's un-needed, as is the borderline lesbian scene. The movie just crawls along trying to make its way to an ending you probably don't care about anymore.When we finally get to the end, Bison starts kicking ass. He is able to punch Gen across a room with little effort, but never does anything you would expect M. Bison to do. He fairs more poorly against Chun Li, while in a very nice suit, but keeps the upper hand until Chun Li performs her epic Kikoken technique, which hurts him way more than it should. And after it's been drilled into our heads that Bison put his soul into his daughter and that's his ONLY weakness, Chun Li kills him by snapping his neck 180 degrees. Thus adding another weakness Bison has, having his neck snapped 180 degrees.So both Balrog and Bison are killed in this movie, before the tournament even occurs.The film ends with Gen meeting Chun Li with an ad for the \"Street Fighter\" tournament, hinting that Bison is behind it even though he was (seemingly?) killed. He mentions that there's a great fighter in Japan they must recruit, \"His name is Ryu...something.\" And the film ends.So instead of properly making a Street Fighter movie, the filmmakers behind this opted to make a prequel to what the audience would care about. A poor prequel at that, which nobody will like, so we may never get a real/good Street Fighter movie (with Ryu as the main character). I would avoid this in theaters, or giving it money at all. The only reason to give it money would be so there's hope of a sequel about the tournament.",

Well, I had heard that this movie was so bad it was good, and I'm usually in the mood for laughable ineptness.This movie isn't so bad it's good. It's so bad it's BAD. Let me count the ways. The screenplay has a number of holes in it (Why was there no investigation for the kidnapping of Chun-Li's father? Why did Bison let his daughter get out of his grasp?) The screenplay also has a number of clich\u00e9d scenes - you'll be saying, \"I've seen this before!\" a number of times while watching the movie. The biggest sin the movie makes is that it's pretty dull. There's less martial arts action than you may think, and the martial arts scenes that are there are ineptly choreographed - a surprise, since there was some Asian control on this movie.I admit there was one thing I found amusing, and that was that the main villain strongly resembles Neil Patrick Harris.

            "review_title": "Somewhat misses the mark",
            "content": "We now have Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li, a story about the First Lady of Fighting Games herself. Yes, Chun Li was featured in the previous movie (played less than adequately by Ming Na), but she was only a supporting character in that flick, and aside from knocking a few heads and spewing some lame dialogue, she didn't have much to do. So it's nice to see her finally in the spotlight, portrayed by an actress who actually bothers to put some effort into her performance: Kristin Kreuk.The previous Street Fighter film pretty much failed to give its characters any good development or reason to show any real emotions, making it rather hard to connect with them. This new film at least tries, and even succeeds in some places; when Chun Li sheds tears in this movie, we know precisely why, and we understand her sorrow. She is endeared far more to us this time around. It would not be spoiling anything to say this movie is much better than its predecessor. But is it really a good movie? Well...Now, obviously director Andrzej Bartkowiak and screenwriter Justin Marks had a daunting task before them. They not only had to please Street Fighter and Chun Li fans around the world, but somehow try to make a good movie in the process. And, of course, you can't tell a story about street fighters without the proper pacing. Pacing, in fact, is where the movie's first failure falls into our laps, as it's tragically rushed in all the wrong places. Events that should be treated delicately and given sufficient screen time to allow us to appreciate their significance are whizzed right by us, drastically reducing their impact. Instead of thoughtful remarks, we're given more passing comments on things that are supposed to tell us more about the characters we're watching. And, aside from Chun Li, Bison and, to a lesser degree, Chun Li's father and Gen, none of the characters receives much by the way of development, thus causing this film to fail in the same general area the previous one did. And Interpol Officer Charile Nash (yes, the same Charlie Nash whom Guile was so eager to avenge in the games) is on the scene as well; he's determined to bring Bison down. If only we learned why. Actor Chris Klein and actress Moon Bloodgood (who plays his partner Maya) aren't given much to do, and what they are given to do isn't very engaging or exciting. Much of their contributions to the story are tossed out as quickly as they're flung in, leaving us very little time to appreciate any of it. And Nash's one-liners, which are, of course, meant to be witty, are not really that witty. Or all that funny.On the whole, the movie doesn't quite work. It has some good ideas and an interesting story, but it really doesn't handle them properly. For every strong moment the film has, there is a weak one to bring things down again, and of course there's an open ending, though if they actually make a sequel to this I'll be amazed. I likely won't be the first in line to see it, though. I probably won't see the movie again, either... well, not in the theater, anyway. I may buy the soundtrack, however; the music wasn't half bad. If you like solid electronic dances tunes, the soundtrack may be worth your while. The movie, on the other hand, won't really entertain general audiences, and I imagine fans of the games will be pretty divided on it.Oh, and they mispronounced Ryu's name. AGAIN.Final score: 6/10. Nice try, but try harder next time, guys.",

Then he said this one made that one look like \"Citizen Kane\"! Yeah, I can agree with him. Whereas the original film was extremely stupid with horrible acting, at least they had the nerve to actually make the characters look the same way they do in the games. In this one, they could barely even get a single costume right. Even Vega's mask looked off! You could in fact change the name of every character and the title and absolutely no one would know it was based on \"Street Fighter\".None of the characters look or act anything like their video game counterparts. Why did they make these drastic changes anyway? Why even make it a \"Street Fighter\" movie? Why not just make it an original idea? I don't even think people would accuse it of ripping off \"Street Fighter\" because of how unrelated it is! It would still be horrendous either way. Even the plot is completely stupid. It features M. Bison being the father of Rose and he actually created her so he could sacrifice his good nature directly into her to become evil. We even see a flashback where he literally performs a C-section on her mother. He still has a soft spot for her. Why? He's pure evil now! Most of the hair colors weren't even right! I would expect a \"Street Fighter\" movie to have the main character Ryu in it, but they couldn't even do that! They didn't even have the secondary character, Ken in it! Ryu is in fact mentioned at the VERY end of the film when discussing an actual \"Street Fighter\" tournament. Chun-Li says she isn't interested so the film doesn't even technically set up a sequel! Granted, it's wonderful that it didn't, but still very misleading. I admit to not being that familiar with the newer \"Street Fighter\" characters.Of course, I didn't have to be to even know that they were represented horribly. Everyone in this movie is stupid, even the extras! There's one scene where someone's shot and a crowd responds by throwing fruit at the shooter. Yeah, I think that'll stop guns. Most of these characters serve no purpose with no distinct personalities. You could literally replace them with anyone else and no one would notice the difference. In the end, M. Bison is defeated by having bags fall on him. Wow, it's a \"Home Alone\" prank that does him in. This is idiotic in every sense, but I guess it might be because it's worse than the already awful 1994 movie. Not for fans, critics, moviegoers or ANYONE. Zero stars",

Martial arts fight choreographer Dion Lam of \"Exit Wounds\" and \"The Matrix Reloaded\" stages several exceptional hand-to-hand combat scenes involving wire work. As the heroine Kristia Kreuk is convincing here as Chin-Li and handles herself well in the fight sequences. She possesses an expressive countenance,and this gives \"Streetfighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\" (*** out of ****) its heart and drive. Moreover, as Chin-Li, our heroine changes over the course of the story so that she emerges as a round rather than a flat character. \"Exit Wounds\" director Andrej Bartkowiak never lets the action stall out during its trim 96 minutes. Of course, the Justin Marks screenplay contains nothing but formula with the usual expository scenes for an origins story. A heroic heroine, ruthless villains, scenic locales, and a by-the-numbers crime empire building plot keep thing warm but rarely sizzling. Ostensibly, \"Streetfighter\" is a sequel to the Jean Claude Van Damme original.The movie begins as an origins story with Chun-Li (Kristia Kreuk) talking about her youth in San Francisco. Her international businessman father Xiang (Edmund Chen of \"Saigon Eclipse\") wants her to become a concert pianist. Eventually, the family relocates to Hong Kong, and her father teaches her Wushu while she practices the piano. Suddenly, one evening, criminals invade her house, and Xiang battles them until Balrog seizes young Chun-Lie and threatens to kill her. Bison (Neal McDonough of \"Walking Tall\") and his men abduct Xiang. Later, Bison appropriates the Shadaloo Empire, the biggest crime syndicate in Asia. He has acquired his power and authority by having his assassin, Vega (Jaime Luis Gomez) decapitated the heads of all the crime lords in Bangkok. Bison has a grand scheme to lower property values in the Bangkok slums, buy up as much as he can, tear it down, and then rebuild it with luxurious housing for the affluent. Bison has no qualms about killing. He abducted Chin-Li's father years ago and when she comes to Bangkok to straighten things out, Bison murders her father in front of her eyes. Previously, Bison had held Chun-Li's father captive for years and forced against his will to help develop his infamous plan.Meanwhile, Interpol agent Charlie Nash (Chris Klein of \"American Pie\") has pursued the elusive Bison through eleven major cities on four continents and only now comes close to catching him. He teams up with Bangkok Police Detective Maya Sunee (Moon Bloodgood of \"Terminator: Salvation\") in the Gang & Homicide Division. While this is going on, Chun Lin is building a reputation as a successful concert pianist when she learns that her mother is ill. Eventually, Chun Li's mother dies. The mother was an American and her father was Asian. Chun discovers a scroll in ancient Chinese. She looks for help in translating the document which she suspects will have something to do with her life. Our heroine takes the scroll with her and checks it out with her. The old lady observes, \"This is not a letter, it is a light shining only upon you.\" She advises Chun Li to travel to Bangkok and search for a man named Gen. Before she locates (Robin Shou of \"Mortal Combat\") who gives her a brush course in defying gravity while decimating the dastards, Chun-Li lives in the streets, observes the crime-ridden slums first hand, and later interferes with a gang intent on beating up a helpless man. Principally, Gen shows Chun how to control her rage in a fight.Not only does \"Streetfighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\" relate the story of our heroine's humble beginnings, but the film also details the origins of the cruel villain. Son of Irish missionaries, Bison grew up as an orphan and stole fish from people in Thailand. Just to emphasize his evil, Bartkowiak and Marks show how Bison jettisoned his conscience. He does this by removing his infant daughter from his wife's womb prematurely, killing his wife. This transferred his conscience into his daughter. Again, Bison is a first-rate bastard. Later, Bison's thugs attack Gen while Chun-Li is away buying groceries and Balrog destroys Gen's house with a RPG. Bison orders Vega to finish off Chun-Li, but he is surprised when Chun-Li whips Vega in a knock down, drag out fight, leaves the assassin hanging upside down over the side of a building. Chun-Li heads out to deal with Bison. She learns about a secret delivery of White Rose and determines to help Charlie Nash and Detective Sunee get Bison. Bison's tentacles stretch to the police and Sunee is told to drop the case. Consequently, Charlie and Chun-Li take on Bison. The fight between Bison and Chun-Li is energetic and the outcome is nothing if not impressive.Indeed, the producers tampered with the video game when they adapted it to the big-screen. For example, they removed the gloves that Balrog wore. Furthermore, they changed Chun-Li from strictly Chinese to Chinese-American. Producer Ashok Amritraj wanted the film \"to stand on its own, not just for the gaming audience, but also as a movie.\" \"Streetfighter: The Legion of Chun-Li\" with its formulaic plot doesn't rank as a great martial arts film, but it is a good, exciting, action-packed saga with a surprise or two to keep you on your toes. As much as I like Jean Claude Van Damme's \"Streetfighter\" (1994), \"Streetfighter: The Legion of Chun-Li\" tops the JCVD movie in every respect.",

            "content": "This movie wasn't THAT bad. Everyone acts as if they would rather spend 90 minutes strapped to a bed of nails whilst being whipped by a hairy woman in leather named Butch than they would spend the same time watching it. I assure you that is not the case.If you're expecting a repeat of the vandamme flick, then you will be disappointed as that is not what you will get. This is not a turn by turn fight movie; it is an adventure movie. Chun Li goes to Hong Kong to rescue her father and ends up fighting a bunch of people along the way. Many of the fights involve gun ambushes and typical fight scenes for cheesy action films with people who don't do martial arts in real life. There is no tournament, just her journey. The fighting is marginal, the acting is marginal, the action is marginal.Kristen Kreuk (Chun Li) is the same character as any other part she plays (notably Lana in Smallville) - she talks the same and pretty much acts the same, but with more violence (not that much more). She is not a great actress, but she's not a terrible one either, considering she has played the same role her entire life.Chris Klein, however, should die. He is almost entirely useless and tries to be a bad ass/smart ass/\"I say clever things and look really cool while saying them, then make a cool face after I finish the sentence\" character, but he fails. It was painful to watch him because he's just so terrible in the movie. Imagine his character in American Pie or the one is Just Friends as a \"bad ass\" cop who wants to be cool and impress people, but can't, yet still thinks he does. It just hurts to watch. He is the reason I give it a 6/10. If he wasn't in it, it could be a 7. Or an 8...or a 9, maybe even a 10 I don't know I couldn't watch without wanting to rip my eyes out during his scenes.The other people, though, are just plain average. They recite their lines and move properly. Overall a C for them.For the movie as a whole, though: I went in expecting complete crap and came out feeling like it was a decent cheesy action flick. I would not pay good money to see this, but it wasn't necessarily a waste of time. If you're bored and see it in the video store for a dollar, why not rent it? If it's on TV or if you see it online and you have free time, go ahead and watch.",

I don't even know what idiot would think this could make it well on the big screen. This should've been a\u0085 direct-to-trash can movie. The only good thing about it is Kristin Kreuk and you can't help but feel sad that she's associated herself with this poor excuse for a reboot. I wanted to hit my head into a wall repeatedly, it's that awful.Kristin Kreuk is a cutie, no doubt. That fair complexion and smooth legs and big hazel eyes and her long exotic dark hair, she's a goddess to behold but she is not chun-li. And this movie's attempt to make her Chun-Li is pathetic, every effort fails and what you get is a hilarity guaranteed to make you shake your head in embarrassment. I hate the narration.. why the hell do they have to make her narrate the story?! And sometimes it would come in the most unnecessary moments ever\u0085 she goes to an Internet Cafe and she says 'I know now that I have to do some research'.. do we really need her explaining that?! That scene could've gone just fine without her rambling.Neil McDonough is not too shabby as a bad guy but once again, he's not much a Bison as Michael Clarke Dunken is a Balroq, who also by the way will get you to wonder.. \"didn't he get nominated for Oscar for The Green Mile? What has happened to him?!' Don't even get me started with the story.. the only action scene worth enjoying is the beginning parts, after that it goes downhill for some reason. Nothing exciting about the fight choreography, They make it seem too easy to beat Vega. Fans of the video game will not be satisfied by this re-imagining.Very slow-paced, countless inconsistencies, terrible acting, crappy direction and it's downright ridiculous in all levels. Typically, when somebody blows up your house with an RPG and you're in it when it happens.. you won't survive.. but nope, this movie is so far fetched,.. you can come out of the disaster unharmed. The dialogue is cheesy especially the lines said by Chris Klein playing Nash. What the hell is up with his character anyway?! He's cocky but in a very unrealistic way, he overdoes it and it comes off laughable. Moon Bloodgood is drop dead gorgeous, especially when she bends down to talk to you and her cleavage all up in your face but she's as terrible as Chris Klein is and their supposedly detective work is sh*tty and unorganizedAfter watching this, you will lose faith in game-based movies and there's no way of reviving it. The movie's ending tries to give you a hint that there might be a sequel but I hope to heaven above that somebody up there would listen to my prayer and stop any effort of making this into a new franchise.

And that is pretty much all that is discernible from a plot that bounces around more than the heroine when she battles bad guys...and girls. The movie's downfall is its attempt to cram too much of everything into a world and story that is a lot more simple.The film starts off earnestly enough. The sweet tunes of a grand piano gently transport us into an ordinary world that is soon going to come crashing down. And crashing down it does and not in the good 'bashing your opponents face into the pavement' way, but rather in the bland character's, bad acting, convoluted and totally unbelievable story kind of way. Now, before I get into how bad this movie really is I will start with what is good about it. But 'good' certainly does not mean redeemable. The cinematography and camera work are great and truly capture the essence of the places the story takes us. The fight scenes are well-choreographed and well-shot for the most part, which is more than most Hollywood martial arts heavy films can say these days(I am glaring at the insanely hard to follow 'static-cam' of the \"Bourne\" films and Bond's latest foray into an unwelcoming action-genre).And that, viewers, is where the goodness of this hack ends. What follows is a lot of over-acting to the point of hilarity, cheap and pointless one-liners, too many implausible scenarios that don't have any basis in anything related to reality. And yes, I know, this is 'Street Fighter' and it is based on a mildly supernatural video game but some of the events that occur in this film are just too over-the-top(Bison 'delivering' baby scene...enough said). The film raises questions we as viewers shouldn't need to ask...and then we never get answers to those questions! Chun-Li and Gen are the films 'strong' points. Bison is nowhere near as imposing as he should be. And even though his Irish(yes, apparently Bison is Irish) parents died just after he was born and he was raised on the streets of Bangkok with nothing but Thai people, adult Bison somehow managed to retain a spot-on Irish accent. Balrog is just plain hokey. Vega (who is supposed to be a Spaniard, but certainly is not in the film) is...well he just is. His character is neither cool nor threatening and not even as arrogant as he is supposed to be. The characters of Nash and Det. Sunee are totally forgettable and as a matter-of-fact totally unbelievable as well. No decent high-ranking detective, like Sunee claims to be, walks around as scantily clad as she does when she's at work.Oh my God, ladies and gentlemen, I could go on and pick this film apart piece by piece but that would entail me giving away spoilers...and this film has spoiled having only been released yesterday. You wouldn't waste your money on spoiled food would you? I think not, so don't waste it on this tripe.And for the record I am a fan of the games and I have seen the animes and read the graphic novels. I think I speak for all real fans that we want Ryu and we want Ken. We want their journey from children to brothers to karate street fighting masters. We want their revenge on Akuma and Ryu's scarring bout with Sagat. Simple. Right? No Interpol, no sexy cops, and no Shadaloo (supposed to be Shadow Law btw). You don't need those things to have a great fan pleasing 'Stree Fighter' film do you? I didn't think so. Simple. Simple. Simple. God, I am writer...I should just write the damn thing. It would certainly be better than what has been so far.Done.",

In the cinema I was enjoying myself, and back home two days after watching it I'm starting to feel like I hate it, not sure what movie I just saw. I wrote a positive review here but this is an edited one to show my genuine feelings for this film (usually I don't do this), so bear with me on this one. The first with JCVD is better and more entertaining than this droll.The only good thing about this movie is Kristen Kreuk. Let me say that she is absolutely gorgeous, and that she is perfect for the part of Chun-Li. For those who say that she could not play Chun-Li because she's American, stop whining. She pulls it off in her role. She's also in plenty of fight sequences in here, most of them testing her physical abilities, which is a good thing.It is barely entertaining, as the action feels forced and rushed. The fight sequences and choreography, however, are well handled, contain little-to-no traces of CGI , and loyal to the game. It becomes clear that the filmmakers have played the game and done their homework, trying to best to imitate the moves. Chun-Li's trademark kicks and fireball superpowers are shown here (okay, sometimes TOO loyal). The special effects, however, are lackluster.Secondly Chun-Li never quite had an explained background and here it's sort of okay, if not clich\u00e9d, to see how she became who she was destined to be. It's a good, cheesy story with a bad script, as it has cheesy one-liners, but not as excessive and extremely cheesy that the first Street Fighter film had. Now instead of laughing at the mistakes, we dread them.The supporting actors are okay additions to the film. Tough guy Michael Clarke Duncan as Balrog and Taboo as Vega (surprisingly he's not bad) however, is wasted and their performances fall flat. But the real show-stealer here is Neal McDonough, who looks like he's having a blast playing the main villain, Bison, a role that tarnished the great Raul Julia's career (sadly it was his last cinematic performance) in the first movie.What makes the film give credibility is the lively and kinetic direction from director Andrzej Bartkowiak. The man is no stranger to martial-arts movies, as he directed Jet Li in \"Romeo Must Die\", \"Cradle 2 The Grave\" and Steven Seagal in his last big movie, \"Exit Wounds\". He is no stranger to video-game movie adaptations either, as he directed the lackluster \"Doom\" starring Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. However he has not quite bowed out of video games just yet. Hearing his name behind the camera brought me a glimmer of hope that this movie could very well be a success. Nope.If you are disappointed or hated the first film, or if you love the first film, the I don't know, because the film is disappointing. Sorry for those misleaded who thought I was writing a positive review. But then again, I don't know. I think I enjoyed the first one more than this. At least the first had something to laugh at.Overall: 3/10",

The only one that I felt was lacking was her father. But with that minor distraction aside, the movie was done fabulously and I enjoyed it very much. I think Kristin brought out a more dramatic aspect to a video game action hero run of the mill action movies. She showed very nice intensity and seriousness to the action fights. She sets a darker, yearning tone throughout the movie and in those moments when she smiles, she lights up the screen. Did I mention she was lovely in the movie? She really was. Neal as Bison, Robin as Gen and Michael as Balrog were fitting supporting cast. Chris and Moon provided a distraction to the main story flow in a good way. I enjoyed it and cast my thumbs up to all you negative reviewers. In fact, I enjoyed the movie much more than most of the recent action movies I have seen,especially this boring Dark Knight. I threw that in because of all the high review for that movie on this site. Anyhow, I'm going on a tangent.

If they did, it would look at least somewhat like the 1994 Street Fighter movie (which, of course, wasn't good either, but that at least tried). Instead we get a weak story of Chun-Li's \"legend\" of going from a nice existence as a concert pianist to going to the streets to uh learn how to fight (who and from what, maybe it's the scrolls, is never explained) and make fire/energy-balls from her own inner-self. That's about as much as I got on what it's about, except there's a villain played by Neal McDonaugh with an inexplicable and horribly acted Irish accent, and Chris Klein playing... holy s*** it's Chris Klein trying to channel what Nicolas Cage is doing right now, which is not something pleasant to watch! I watched it for all of the reasons of a guilty pleasure movie night with some laughs. Some are to be had.

Not a huge fan of the series, I just like fighting games in general, whether they're 2D or 3D, doesn't matter. But fighting games don't make for compelling story lines; after all who plays them for the story anyway (well at least for Soul Calibre among several other games)? Although I never had the pleasure of seeing the first film, I saw it on TV on a hot, boring day in the summer of '98; thank the stars!! Now with that out of the way, on to the review.OK, so the first film sucked badly and though I hated it, I kinda understand where they're coming from. So they decided to just start from scratch trying to make this new installment edgier and action packed with moments of emotion and drama but they only succeeded in making it marginally better than it's predecessor which isn't saying much considering the fact that \"Enter The Dragon\" was the main inspiration of the series. That film didn't have much of a story to begin with but at least the fight scenes were much more memorable and well choreographed than this film put together and overall better acting performances especially when Bruce Lee was on the road to martial arts super stardom at the time until his untimely tragic death; even to this day remains a mystery.Which brings me to my next points: Fight scenes and acting. Kristen Kruek does her best for what she's given but the others are so flat-out bland that at times I found myself laughing and shaking my head in utter disbelief. We never get a chance to get to know the characters from the inside out or marvel at the fight scenes due to the consistent ADD-riddled editing and uneven pacing which, ironically, plagued the first film as well. Neal McDonough is the only one who's credible as bad boy Bison even more so than the late Raul Julia. There are many inconsistencies with some of the characters; namely Gen, whose supposed to be a Miyagi-type Kung-Fu master rather than a young man. I'm no purist but I was disappointed that they altered his character so drastically. Balrog and Vega, on the other hand are just \"extras\" to be kicked around when the film calls for them to do so.Speaking of fight scenes I know martial arts films don't necessarily have to be deep and meaningful(with the exception of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) but c'mon give us a decent story. So Chun-Li goes to Thailand to seek revenge against Bison...big deal. What else is there for her? What purpose is she seeking beyond just revenge? The film never gives us an insight nor goes into detail beyond the basic plot. Granted, character development isn't one of the series's strong points but it wouldn't hurt to put more effort into the script and the characters.I suspect Bartowiak and co wanted to follow in the first film's footsteps and instead jammed together and rushed the \"finished\" product in the hopes that not a single idiot can't see the cracks. But I assure you, fans and moviegoers that I am not stating anyone is an idiot in this review. However I will state this: Video game movies JUST DON'T WORK!!! They never have, never will. Any way you slice it, this film is more or less just as bad as it's prehistoric cousin. Although Mortal Kombat was a little campy in some respects, at least they captured the look and tone of the games almost perfectly, combining impressive fight scenes with a thumpin' soundtrack and likable characters. It's an old movie but hey it's much better and cheaper than ponying up 12 bucks for this one.So Kristen Kruek thought it was wise to leave \"Smallville\" to play the iconic role of Chun-Li. Only problem is she looks nothing like Chun-Li.My advice: Get your kicks elsewhere. This regurgitated mess isn't worth the time and the patience to sit through.And one more thing. What's my motivation? Can somebody PLEASE tell me?!?!?!",

Bison and Barog, years later Chun LI is all grown up and sets out on a journey to bangkok to find a warrior named Gen who will show her a way to defeat Bison and get her father back.This game to film adaptation is directed Andrej Bartowiak, whose credits includes more superior fare such as ROMEO MUST DIE, EXIT WOUNDS, CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE and the game to film adaptation of DOOM, although this film is not the director's best work but it is far from being the worst movie ever made, this adaptation is mostly reinvented, the characters are portrayed differently such as Vega who in the game wears a mask to protect his looks, in this film he wears a mask to hide his identity, none of the things that were attempted in this film were meant as bad intentions, it was a case of the filmmakers maybe wanting to give STREET FIGHTER fans something different, only it wasn't very well received.The acting isn't all bad but not all good, seeing Chris Klein as Nash who is a cocky police detective, you kind of figure someone needed to tell him that he didn't need to make it so obvious that he was acting lame, Robin Shou who plays Gen is not a bad actor but here he's a bit wooden as if he didn't have much to work with, the rest of the cast did all right, but Chris Klein doesn't fit in with his role.On the Positive side there are a few good fight scenes and a strong female lead, its truly not the best action film you'll find but at least it won't join the same list as the game to film disasters of Uwe Boll.",

            "content": "I tend to make it a habit to vote on IMDb after I've seen a movie, and usually I'm pretty spot on with the grade I have in my mind compared to the average here. I did expect to be voting above average this time, but I didn't expect the average to be this low.True, during the movie there were quite a few moments that I had to laugh because of predictable, or over the top things, but I expect that from a movie based on a game which is over the top by itself. Now it's also true that the story hasn't got much in common with the game story, but I also think the game story isn't that extraordinary to care for it. Perhaps they could have called it differently, and use different names. I had not problems putting it aside.Anyway, when I started this movie I was expecting something bad, but I was in the mood for something bad with over the top martial arts. Unexpectedly, something about the movie just grabbed me. Even though the plot is not spectacular, it was definitely not unwatchable. Most modern action movies have me lose my attention soon, because of their simplicity. They usually just dump a handful of characters on your screen, tell you who's good, who's bad and then let you watch two hours of constant running and fighting. In this case they did seem to wanna try and tell the story, and not just put a bit of story in there to justify the fighting, so I guess that made the difference for me.Compared to the 1994 Street Fighter I think it's a lot better, even though that's not very hard to do. 6.5/10 rounded up.",

I thought it couldn't get much worse than Rollerball and Say It Isn't So, but in Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, Klein goes the extra mile, putting in a turn (as tough cop Nash) that is inexplicably bad in every way, each line delivered in a raspy macho manner whether it suits or not, and with a range of bizarre facial expressions that are hard not to find funny.To be fair, it must be said that it's not all Klein's fault that The Legend of Chun-Li is as terrible as it is\u2014almost everyone in this clunker is dreadful, from Kristin Kreuk as the titular heroine, who never once convinces that she is capable of unleashing major whoop-ass, to Michael Clarke Duncan as musclebound henchman Balrog, who hams it up a treat, to Neal McDonough as head villain Bison, who gives Duncan a run for his money in the overacting stakes. Maybe something got lost in translation between the cast and Polish director Andrzej Bartkowiak, but then again, maybe it's just that everyone involved stinks.Admittedly, Bartkowiak handles some of the fight scenes well enough, but he also throws in quite a few real howlers as well, worst of all being Chun-Li's nightclub seduction of lesbian henchwoman Cantana (Josie Ho), who she lures to the ladies washroom for a smackdown, a majorly mishandled moment that makes one wonder how anyone could have considered it a good idea.",

It focuses more on a single character and tries to depict her as well as her adversaries as interesting characters with history. The effort is admirable though doesn't work perhaps completely all the way through.After a fairly strong beginning the second act of the film deteriorates a little bit. The section following Chun Li's life in Bangkok suffers from some shotty editing and skipping between unrelated events. The feeling of a coherent transition is lost because of this. The film also makes the faux pas of redundant flashback usage in a 90 minute film.However, the effort seen in the dialogue scenes of the film's shows that this is clearly trying to be different from most other video game movies. Sadly the Doom-director's natural ability for action-scenes doesn't lend much here and a few of the scenes feel sobby and forced. But at least the film made the effort.Over-all the actor performances for the more recognisable characters are all solid and only Charlie stands out as being a clich\u00e9d character-type. The action-scenes look excellent and if the dialogue scenes were a little bit more involved then the movie would certainly earn praise.Even as it is, the film is good and worth a watch, but I personally always preferred the entertainment value of the 1994 film more.",

Some people still couldn't understand how to evaluate a movie. This is a game adaptation. Characters were good, plot was OK (except these police guys that didn't have any influence on the story), directing was quite good and the overall performance was better than average. Chun-Li fights exactly the way it was shown, some of the street fighter characters were there and most importantly they at least stick to the general plot of the game. If you remember Max Payne for example, the movie had nothing to do with the game, yet it was never evaluated as harsh as this one. I am giving a 7 because the movie deserves a 7 from my point of view. If you don't know anything about Street Fighter, the plot may look strange.

She was expressive and authentic. The same goes for Robin Shou as Gen, and this excellent duo master/disciple fortunately caught up with the poor one formed by Nash and Sunee. Dunno whether it was because of their acting or the script they had to follow, but I really didn't care for them.Watching Chun-Li's life from her training with her father in a luxurious home, to the slums of bangkok has proved to be a good trip.

Rather then being a fighting movie it struck me as more of an action film. The cast was great and perfect for each character they played. Sure there was some fighting in there it could have had a little more fighting scenes but other then that I really enjoyed it. The explosions and gun fire makes up for the lack of choreography even though there is a few decent fighting scenes anyways. From the way they ended this it looks like they are going to make a sequel and if that happens id definitely pay to see it.

Some take the comical route as did \"Double Dragon\", which went well in my eyes when I saw it as an early teenager - I would find a lot more to bash about it today, some were written with monkeys with down syndrome; Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, case in point, and others veered from the original idea to form their own story; Resident Evil.The original \"Street Fighter\" was terrible; now comes \"legend of Chun Li\". To be honest I didn't know what to expect and I merely wanted it for my collection - just another DVD I could poke fun at with friends down the road. Though not perfect, I found this to be far more entertaining than I was going to give it credit for. I didn't find any overly-drawn out romance scenes, I didn't notice any over the top special effects or special moves (Though I did recognize some of the fighting moves as those found in the various \"Street Fighter\" games) and just about everything is almost plausible as far as realism in the fighting.Also to note, I don't feel any one character was over-cast or added in \"just because\" as was the case with \"Mortal Kombat: Annihilation\" (take Rain for instance). Vega only has a handful of scenes, Balorg is merely the Hench man without much dialog to screw up, and the only other character besides Bison is Chun Li herself (obviously) and Gen (acting as mentor).I laughed at some of the attacks, like Chun Li's spin-kick, but moments like that were too far between for me to seriously point out as down grading the movie. Also it almost gave me a toned-down \"Kill Bill\" feel, and while I won't reveal any real spoilers, I would like to address that this movie is probably to date, one of the rare gems that don't put shame the title it's representing (\"Street Fighter\").The movie does end with an opening, suggesting there may be sequels or a franchise (I can only speculate that the series would, if pursued, will follow the likely trend of drifting down hill). It does have some dialog that is pretty stock and uninspiring, but I can't really downgrade my rating based solely on that.With all the Hollywood adaptions of popular themes (Transformers, Terminator, X-Men, etc), they could have done far worse with this movie than they did.You can't please the fans, they will always find something to complain about (I'm a \"Street Fighter\" fan and I could have found lots to bash), so I take a step back and review it if I were going into this movie without a clue about \"Street Fighter\", and the result is, while not perfect, it's not a bad flick. I'll end this by saying, watch this with an open mind and average expectations and you will find an enjoyable 97mins.",

The other characters serve peripheral roles and, with the exception of Michael Clarke Duncan who plays Mr. Bison's henchman, all of them are quite unspectacular, some being outright ludicrous. The young lady playing the street fighter is utterly miscast and her mentor-friend is equally out of place in this otherwise interesting if not overly impressive movie. The movie does have its good moments but only when Mr. Bison or Mr. Duncan are in the scene. Mr. Bison is the only character which is developed in the movie, the others being mere caricatures of good guys or bad guys. A good performance is given by Mr. Duncan who could have played the lead villain too. Mr. Duncan deserves kudos for his performance.",

Cinematographer turned director Andrezj Bartkowiak applies his trademark hip-hop/martial arts fusion to the familiar tale of a young woman, the titular Chun-Li (Kristin Kreuk) seeking revenge for the loss of her father at the hands of criminal mastermind Bison (Neal McDonaugh) while being guided in the ways of the warrior by wise master Gen (Robin Shou.) But it's amazing how lifeless and limp the whole thing feels, dull and unexciting, trying to be more serious and full of itself than it's more joyfully camp predecessor. Most notable is Michael Clarke Duncan in a supporting role as the bad guy's henchman, making you wonder how he went from being nominated for a Best Actor Oscar in The Green Mile to something as down market as this. Leaves you wondering what anyone was trying to accomplish with it. *",

            "content": "The fact that \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\" is on the infamous Bottom 100 List on IMDB is not at all surprising. After all, films based on videogames often are terrible and several other films based on videogames are on the list--including \"Super Mario Brothers\", \"BloodyRayne\" and \"Street Fighter\"....yes, the first installment in this franchise. However, this sequel has none of the folks from the previous film and it has a very different look and style from \"Street Fighter\". It currently is #79 on the list and \"Street Fighter\" is #80. And, incidentally it earned back far less than the cost of the film.\"Street Fighter\" was a very cartoony looking film....with a ridiculous villain who seemed right off a kid's TV show. In contrast, \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\" looked much, much better and was much more cinematic. It also used a lot of modern wire fu and camera tricks....so the filmmakers looked far less inept than in the first film. But, one thing the first one wasn't was dull...and often this follow-up film is dreadfully dull. Too talky and with to many flashbacks and expositions. When the actually DID have fights, the film looked pretty good...and very acrobatic. Of course, with a dull story, these scenes cannot make up for all that...but they help a bit.The story, if you really care, is about a young girl who sees her father abducted by some baddies and you know that sooner or later she'll have a day of reckoning with the blond guy. In between, there's a decent amount of boredom and mumbo jumbo involving her being trained to take him on in the final boss battle. My problem was I just didn't care about any of this and had a hard time focusing on the story, such as it was.Overall, a dull and oppressively dark story but not a completely terrible film. I am sure that it lost so much money because fans were disappointed...but disappointment is not exactly the same as this being a Bottom 100 film. I'd give it a 4...which is bad but not horrible...and there are thousands of more horrible films than this one.By the way, again and again, I couldn't help but think....why didn't Chun-Li have a gun?! So many times it would have saved her from all these beatdowns! And, martial arts can't stop bullets.",

Is this a video game franchise that even has any real fans anymore? I'm old enough to remember spending time playing Street Fighter and the various sequels at the local arcade, playing in tournaments, etc. There wasn't any plot in these games, just stylish characters and a fight tournament. Perhaps a dull premise that has been done, but it seems if the cartoonish style were translated into a campy action film, it could have been somewhat entertaining.Instead, we have a movie with a serious yet dull plot, horrible overacting, no real mythology, embarrassingly inappropriate music, visible boom mics, bad makeup and a terrible script. Even the fight scenes and choreography are bad, making this movie pointless and unwatchable. Really, there isn't anything very good to say about this movie and I really wonder what inspires someone to make a film like this. This is definitely not recommended.",

The movie makers were promising a more mature picture that will change the fate of movies based on computer games forever. Promises , promises\u0085 The movie seems to follow \"Batman begins\". The story about Chun Li reminds me quite a lot of Wayne's story \u2013 similar motivation , traveling around the world , finding a teacher from secret society , becoming an urban legend. The inspiration is good , but it's badly made.The movie wants to be realistic , yet the fights defy the laws of gravity and there are magical powers too. The Dark knight trilogy had more or less far fetched science fiction gadgets , but bringing a magic into movie is a completely different thing. I mean seriously it just looks stupid and laughable when other characters seem to treat it as something natural . Either the movie makers should make a movie in fantastical world (like Van Damme's movie) where magic would be natural or set the movie in real world and don't use it . You can't have both the realistic world and magic . Same goes for the over the top fights . The lack of gravity in \"Matrix\" makes sense , here it doesn't.The acting is awful . The only good actor here is Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP) , but even he is limited by terrible dialogue lines. It's sad to see him in another crappy movie. I guess it was really hard for him to find a good role worthy his talent considering his physical appearance. Kristin Kreuk who plays the main role is pretty and actually OK . She puts a heart in her performance , but she can't save this big mess. Other actors and actresses should never do anything related to movie making.I doubt that fans of computer game will be satisfied with this movie as adaptation . With the exception of Chun Li other characters who appear here barely resemble the characters from the game. Especially Vega who was supposed to be bad ass , yet ends pathetic. I understand the need for changes , but in the end Van Damme's movie has much more cheesy charm and reminds the game better. It also doesn't take itself too seriously like \"Chun Li movie\" .Bad acting , dialogue , badly written screenplay , many scenes who were supposed to be awesome are laughable (the seduction of Bison's assistant , soul into child , escape from torture and many more) , dumb fights , weak special effects. Jesus ,seriously better watch Van Damme's movie . At least is unpretentious and funny.I give it 1/10.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li",
            "content": "Made in collaboration with Capcom, I think someone probably thought enough time had past and the past stinker forgotten, and to follow suit in a franchise milking programme like what Marvel and DC had embarked upon, a reboot is in order and the current buzzword. So just like how the characters in Street Fighter hail from all over the world, the production too has input from everywhere, like actors in the West and in the East, being filmed in Thailand and having Indian producing input as well. It's like a melting pot of cultures collaborating in breathing life into a possible franchise should this film prove to be successful. But chances are I suspect it'll at most hit the direct to DVD route after this.It's a little surprising that the filmmakers opted for Chun Li instead of the signature character of Ryu. Maybe they have faith in Kristin Kreuk, better known for her Lana Lang role in Smallville, to pull in the fanboys, or once fanboys, of the video game. But as it turns out, while she may be a looker, and her personal grounding in gymnastics and martial arts do help, she's ultimately let down by a weak plot (ok, so that's expected) and some very weak supporting characters. On the side of the good, you have Cheng Pei Pei in a one scene cameo, who does nothing but to tell her to go to Bangkok and live like a pauper, useless cops with Chris Klein as an Interpol cop Charlie Nash who's basically cardboard and Moon Bloodgood (love that name) as a Thai policewoman Maya who just preens and purrs, and Robin Shou as Gen, a mystical David-Carradine-Kung-Fu knock off with long grey hair.As if the villains were good enough, being nothing but bland and uninteresting. I thought it was a good spin on things to have Neal McDonough's Bison being a corporate raider with his Shadaloo organization, aided by lesbian femme fatale Cantana (Hong Kong's Josie Ho), a very underused Vega (Black Eyed Peas' Taboo) and Michael Clarke Duncan's Balrog, who's more like a relegated Kingpin of Crime from Daredevil, now playing sidekick. Like Robin Shou, who also once had leading role status, I feel that this film was like a collection of would be has- beens waiting for another chance at the big league.If there's any cause for celebration, then it might be Edmund Chen's role as Chun Li's dad Heung. From Ivan Heng to Adrian Pang to Fann Wong and to the coup of seeing Chin Han having possibly the role of his life in The Dark Knight, Edmund Chen looks set to follow in the latter's footsteps, but only up until some stuntmen unceremoniously took over almost all his fighting scenes, even those that require him to perform some non-life threatening qi- gong stances. The body double is really too obvious and one can tell it isn't him at all. So shave off some 50% of his \"appearance\" from the film.Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li is a straight forward film without much depth in its story, and it's relatively lower production budget translates to many of the jazzy special prowess in the game being considerably toned down. Perhaps director Andrzej Bartkowiak's intention was to have it more rooted to reality, but therein lies the danger see, because this film has tremendous parallels with that of another super-powered movie called Elektra. Both have recognizable female actresses in the lead role, and they share a plot involving secret organizations, mystical healing, an experienced teacher to learn the ropes from, and plenty of hokey martial arts. Even the training sequence looks super summarized, uninspiring and filled with unremarkable, clich\u00e9d dialogue.Having said that it was more rooted in reality, that doesn't mean there weren't fun opportunities for some game-like signature moments. I had enjoyed how Bison power packs his punches and kicks, just like in the game but without any glowing-blue glove to visually enhance it (just throbbing sound effects). Chun Li doesn't appear in her iconic qipao, but makes up for it in one scene where she has to execute her Tenshokyaku, the spinning bird kick where she inverts herself and spins her legs like helicopter blades, and dons her hair \"ox horns\" style. Other than that, her costume's pretty much well suited for the heat and humidity of the Bangkok temperature, as well as the usual black ensemble made hip by X- Men.It had tried to be more cerebral in crafting a father-daughter story between Chun Li and dad Heung, Chun Li and her master Gen, and that between M.Bison and her daughter Rose. But anything in depth has no place in the film as it opted to be more fleet-footed that even a three year old could follow. It's an origin story, and depending on which camp you're on, you may or may not agree with some of the tweaks made here to accommodate the film version of things. Despite being called \"Street Fighter\", the fights here are nothing too fantastic or memorable, and looks comfortably in place with many B-grade action movies out there, with the occasional lapsing into the crutch of having the fight scenes edited in double quick time.I suppose the filmmakers had tried their best, but there's a lot of room to try harder and come up with a better product. The lead to the sequel involves a martial arts tournament, but please don't go down the same road as Mortal Kombat and the likes. Come up with a proper and stronger story, and perhaps, we could get a chance to see a franchise being developed, straight to the cinema or DVD market. I'm willing to give it a shot, even with or without Kristin Kreuk returning.",

For anyone who actually does know anything about street fighter will find that they have stuck close to the story line unlike its 1994 counter part ( which did have big film stars). Chun-Li's story line is connected with Bison. Chris Klein's Interpol character links in with Guile ( hardly a useless character). I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the game. I hope they do continue to cover all the characters stories. If you did enjoy this to the end you will also know Ryu will be in the next one, it may even be his legend. Most fans of the game will be disappointed that they didn't start with Ryu but you have to remember Chun-Li was on the scene long before Ryu, Ken, Guile etc. The only thing I feel was wrong with this film was the lack of advertising.

To those who say she is not the right choice for the movie as she is American, you are wrong. She was born in Vancover, Canada. Her father is of Dutch descent and her mother is of Chinese descent. So there you go, she is half Dutch and half Chinese. Neal McDonough was also very impressing in this movie. He portrays Bison as a true dictator. His character seems rational most of the time; although where he shines the most is in one of his psychotic episodes where he uses \"spoiler\" as a heavybag. Now for the rest of the cast. Balrog was OK but he could have been much better. His character was not really developed. Taboo as Vega was a wrong casting choice. Vega should be taller, with ponytailed blond hair and a slight Spanish accent (would hold truer to the game). Gen was okay as well, he could have been older though to look more like a martial arts master. And lastly, Chris Klein as Charlie. He was horrible. Every time he showed his face on screen the audience burst into laughter. His facial expression and dialogue was ... well, go and see it. I would have imagined Charlie Nash as a serious character. He ruins many serious scenes in the movie with his presence. He is like Horatio Caine in CSI Miami (although I like Horatio because he is not ruining Street Fighter). I don't know if that is what the director was trying to portray with his character. Don't get me wrong, he is not a bad actor, he does well in American Pie, it's just that his character in Street Fighter is abysmal. As for the story, there are discrepancies between the game and movie as it happens with all video game to movie adaptations (not a major concern for me). So why did I give this movie a 10? Well, it's Street Fighter (besides, if you take Nash out, it's close enough). I will be waiting for the sequel and hope that Capcom hires Christopher Nolan or someone along his lines, since the next movie should be starring Ryu and Ken and there is no room for error. I do hope they keep Kristin Kreuk and Neal McDonough though.",

The fighting scenes are edited so poorly that makes it real hard to enjoy them. And this is the second point I want to make. The lack of humor. This movie takes it self too serious. Say what you will about the Jean Claude van Damme version. At least it was funny as hell and a bleeping masterpiece compared to this piece of crap. So do your self a favor and ignore this movie!",

            "content": "Before I continue...I have a confession to make... back in May of last year I got my hands on the script to this film and yes I did read it. Because of that, I have to admit it hindered the film for me in a lot ways.There was just so much in the script that I wish was in the film that wasn't! Overall, the script just read better than the film... Also I spent a lot of time comparing the film to the script... this is why I can't read books that are made into films before the film releases! The text is always better! To make this easier for myself and for you guys, since I really don't want to get into too much details, since I don't want to spoil the film TOO much, I'm just going to make a pro and con list for you all! Pros: - Kristin Kreuk, she was great in this film! and no it's not just my blind bias... REALLY! PROMISE! Honestly, she did a awesome job with the fighting and the acting. One thing I have to agree with IGN, Kristin did NOT make herself look bad in this film at any point! - Neal McDonough, also great! His Bison was badass! Also IGN can go somewhere with that review of theirs. The man didn't even have an Irish accent in the film! For them to mistake the accent Bison had as an Irish accent, makes me question them a lot! - Michael Clarke Duncan, for what he did in the film, I did enjoy his scenes.The music, I really enjoyed the score for this film... my favorite thus far is the score of when Chun-Li is arriving in Bangkok, also enjoyed all the scenes that went along with it.The fights! when the first fight came on screen, which was Balrog vs. Chun-Li's father, a smile just came to my face. What you see online of the fights doesn't compare to the film! So much better! I thought the fights were the highlight of the film... rightfully so.Vega, he didn't come off as awful as he did in that one clip. He was the one I worried the most for, but he came and went... which was just perfect. Also there's one scene at the beginning with Vega that had us all in the theater laughing.The girl on girl... I know people were worried about this film for whatever reason, but it wasn't all that sexual and it was actually pretty funny.Cons: - The Nash and Maya duo... I didn't enjoy neither of them at any point. Nash was overly corny and Maya just seemed to want to get into Nash's pants throughout the film. Funny thing is, when reading the script, I didn't care for Nash either.Gen, Oh Gen! He was almost as corny as Nash. I didn't enjoy Gen at all... okay, I lie, he was pretty awesome during his first fighting scene with Chun-Li and that's only because Chun-Li was awesome! - The Bison/Rose plot... again since I read the script I personally preferred what was done in the script vs. what ended up in the film.Final thoughts: - My theater was pretty full, I was surprised by this due to the lack of promotions this film has gotten here in the states and because there was another theater about a mile away that also had a midnight showing.The people in my theater seemed to enjoy the film a lot more than I did... the guy next to me kept pumping his fist in the air and going \"OH SNAP!\" every time there was some type of fight... and when Ryu was mentioned at the end, I swear I thought he was going to wet himself from excitement.This film was NOT worse than the first Street Fighter film, nowhere near! For anyone who believes that, also believes Neal had an Irish accent in the film!",

            "content": "Now, before I had watched this, I read a lot of reviews about the movie. And For some reason the majority of the reviews were harshly negative! Now I just watched it today and to tell you the truth, I went in expecting it to be horrible. But as I watched it I became confused because I was waiting for it to suck big time! But through the whole movie I maintained interest! The movie had a plot and story that kept me hoping that Chun-Li will get her way. I kept wanted to know what would happen next. And I thought the fighting was pretty well done. They made sure to include some of Chun-Li's signature moves which I was excited about and to tell you the truth I thought Kristen Kreuk was a good pick for the part. If you pay attention you realize that in some ways she kinda looks like Chun-Li. Now I had read a review on IMDb saying \"Kristen Kreuk managed to turn in the least sexy fighting heroine ever.\" But you see, I am glad they didn't try to make it all about how sexy Chun-Li is, but more about her and how she became such a great fighter. This movie isn't all about sex and flash. In fact there was only one kissing scene. it was all about Chun-Li! The title explains it! \"The Legend of Chun-Li\"! not \"The Body of Chun-Li\" Get a clue people! Now I will admit that I have been a big fan of the game Street fighter ever since i was a kid! When it was first on Nintendo AND I Ain't TALKING ABOUT SUPER NENTENDO! And yes Chun-li was always my fav! So maybe I am a little bias. But isn't that why they made a movie about the game? Because they were fans and wanted to make something for the fans? And of course they would hope to attract some people who may have not played the game before. But if you are going to watch the movie and make a negative review about it because they didn't make her into a sex goddess then maybe you should go find some anime porn! I am sure they have plenty of Street fighter Cartoon porn out there for the masses! I am happy that they made a new movie for the game, and I can't wait for the next one! RYU!!!! WOOT WOOT!",

It was Logan's Birthday and it was his (or rather his parents) idea to see this. So after we got our tickets and snacks, we went into the theatre only to discover that we were the only ones in the audience. I kid you not. So we took it to our advantage and made fun of it and the trailers before it.The movie itself isn't all that great, though it stars an all-star cast (including Kristin Kreuk from Smallville and Robin Shou from Mortal Kombat, which *surprise*, is a decent video Game film, or so I've heard) and is pretty much based upon one of the Franchise's most popular characters. it's writing, stunts, fight scenes and acting war below par and since this is a video game movie, you'd expect it to have CG. It does, but it's not featured a lot.So yeah, this movie's bad, but it does make for good movie Mocking (or MST3King, whatever floats your boat). Also in the scene where Barlog blows up Gen's Dojo with a rocket launcher, I made that \"I'm Firing my Lazor\" joke to that scene, we all laughed at that as its timing was perfect.Anyway, this ends another review from Phil MacRae.",

The movie has no real point other than to obviously jump start a series, but honestly with such a lame start I can't see how it would do that.It's sort of like \"Knight Rider\" the start of the new series, only much worse.",

This is the kind of movie that is just awful if you watch it alone but, if you watch it with friends, you can have a great time making fun of it. The direction is terrible, the script is moronic, the action lackluster, and the performances range from mediocre to pathetically bad. Chris Klein -- oh my god Chris Klein -- you have to see this turd just for his performance. It is the worst! I couldn't believe what I was watching. Was this guy for real or was he deliberately being bad because he hated the script? I mean, he's Chris Klein so nobody expects much from him to begin with but his performance here was one of the all-time stinkers. Every line delivery, every facial expression, every single scene he has is a lesson in bad acting.Street Fighter was pretty big in the '90s, which is when they made the last Street Fighter movie. Why in the world they thought Street Fighter was still popular enough to warrant a movie in 2009 is beyond me. I guess it was either this or Q-Bert.

The screenplay and the dialogue was so bad that I couldn't help but laugh at it. It was so cheesy that I couldn't even bare it in fast forward.Here are the worst of the worst parts. Chris Klein tried to put on a serious face to play a bad ass cop only to have it come off as if my 5 year old nephew is pretending to be mad at me....There was a huge scene where Chun-Li, the heroine, is sobbing and whimpering before she leaves for Thailand (a temporary visit). She goes \"I'm leaving everything I know... etc.\" WHAT THE HELL. Would \"the bride\" whimper and cry to her friends before she goes off to KILL BILL??? Did I mention the bad screenplay??? For spending her entire life in Hong Kong, Chun Li could not speak Chinese to save her life. The funniest part was when Chun Li's dad was being dragged away by Bison's Crew. Chun Li's mom comes running out hysterical only to get slapped down to the ground. It looked like a Marlon Wayans hysterical run from \"Scary Movie\". The script begs the question.. which idiot producer read the script and green lighted the film? And how desperate were the actors to take the role?

Of course you have to subtract the flips and all the flying and fighting. She is someone who you cannot relate to but just is totally awesome!!!!! Definitely see this movie right away. You can expect her to be her own person. I mean different from the game. Your eyes will never leave the screen.

I liked it well enough to post a '6', but admittedly I'm a big KK fan from her Smallville work.The flow was good, and it was cast well all around -- as well as can be expected for a movie cast from a video game with virtually .no. plot to it. Arguably KK doesn't have the quads to play a live-action version of Chun-Li, but in my eyes her very decent acting made up for that.The plot had some unexpected happiness within it also and that became what I cherished most about it.",

The acting was abysmal. Kirstin Kreuk was miscast as Chun- Li, she can do much better than this. Neal McDonough was laughable as Bison, and didn't resemble the Bison from the game. Michael Clarke Duncan was also laughable, he kept talking like a slave and laughed a lot for no reason. Chris Klein was atrocious as Nash. He overacts and makes dull facial expressions. Moon Bloodgood was sexy, like always, but can also do much better. Taboo was miscast as Vega, but luckily he was in the film for about 2 minutes. Now, the dialogue. The dialogue. was. the absolute worst dialogue. I have ever heard. In my entire life. Period. The fight scenes were pretty exciting, but unfortunately, the excitement wore off after each fight scene. Overall, the acting was laughable, the dialogue was epically horrendous and cheesy, the characters don't resemble the characters in the game. If you plan on seeing this movie, Don't do it! This is a waste of time, and a plague to cinema. Don't waste your time or effort, you're probably better off seeing the original. Rating: .5/10",

I dig Neal McDonough, but he plays a terrible Bison, with a horrific accent!. The fights are filled with nothing but people on wires, and fancy looking stunts, where as the original actually had some Realness to it!. The cast in the original was a lot of fun. They weren't the best actors, but they were fun to watch, in this movie they all take it seriously, and that's what really killed it in the end for me, along with the terrible acting. I realize this movie is not based on the original, but it's missing all the key characters, that made the original so much fun in a cheesy way. The movie relies heavily on the development of Kristen Kruek, aka Chun Li. Her character is interesting, but not interesting enough to focus an entire movie on her revenge plot. The people who complain about how bad Street Fighter is, I suggest you take a look at this movie. You may think twice, about calling that one bad.Performances. Kristin Kreuk is pretty, and her performance ranges from weak, to above average. Here she is riddled with inconsistency. She clearly gives it her all, but the movie isn't good enough to support her. Chris Klein is an actor, I actually like, but his wooden, cocky performance here, does not do the movie any favors, what's with the hair do?. Neal McDonough is terrible as Bison. He looked like he was having fun, but I didn't have fun hearing that god awful accent, and he's certainly no Raul Julia. Robin Shou isn't bad, but his charisma can only take the role so far. Michael Clarke Duncan has spirit, I'll definitely say that much. Moon Bloodgood is good eye candy, but that's about it.Bottom line. This is the pure definition of a clunker. There are no redeeming qualities about the movie, nor is there much entertainment value at all. It's a rather dull 90 minutes of your life, that you can spend much better elsewhere, Avoid.2/10",

Laughably absurd whitewashing aside, this is without a doubt one of the worst video game adaptations I have had the misfortunate of viewing. Did anyone actually try here? It shouldn't be that difficult to make a Street Fighter film, yet this atrocity makes the 1994 adaptation look surprisingly decent (newsflash: it's not). Chun-Li's father is taken by a shadowy organisation who wants to redevelop Bangkok's slums (of all places...) She grows up and naturally seeks revenge by \"becoming one with the streets\", because y'know...it's Street Fighter.Punches weaker than Chris \"Keanu Reeves\" Klein's acting, which literally seems impossible at this stage, and kicks lighter than Kreuk's skin colour, which conversely is entirely possible. There really isn't a redeemable quality to be found. Despite Bartkowiak seemingly trying to direct a relatively mundane plot into a more exciting direction, everything he touches turns to 16-bit nonsense. The inclusion of A-list actors, Clarke Duncan as Balrog and McDonough as an unnecessary Irish Bison, hinders both the film and their careers. Honestly, no one is acting. And it's as if no one has played Capcom's arcade fighter before, as nearly all the characters except Vega are completely wrong.The plot, characters, score, direction, visual effects, costumes, Chun-Li's hair, fight choreography, my life and dance sequences (no seriously, Chun-Li dances and it's like watching a horror scene) were all the epitome of frickin' boring. Sleep-inducing nonsense.

Scenes doesn't always move smoothly. I can forgive this one because it only happen sometimes. Second, predictability. The scenes, the dialogues, it's all very cheesy and predictable. I also can forgive this one because, hey, what do you expect from a Street Figter movie. Third, lack of logic. In this movie we will find highly illogical decisions that will boggle our mind. I find this part especially irritating when watching this movie. They don't even bother to offer a decent explanation, everything is 'just because'. Fourth, it doesn't stay true to the game. Lets face it, we want to see awesome moves from the game. Instead, this movie offer very little of that and a lot of generic fighting & shooting actions. Fifth, it's about Chun Li, a fairly minor character in the Street Fighter series world whom not many care about.Overall, it's just not a very accurate depictions of the characters that we loved in the Street Fighter series.",

They are warriors, some of whom possess extraordinary abilities, all of whom are determined to see their side prevail. Some fight for us; the others for unlimited power. Now, they are preparing for the ultimate battle\u2014of terror versus beauty, light versus darkness, and good versus evil. The forces of darkness are led by Bison (Neal McDonough), a crime boss of seemingly limitless power, and whose past holds a shocking secret. Bison's syndicate, Shadaloo, is taking over the slums of the Thai capital, a task overseen by Balrog (Michael Clarke Duncan), a massively built enforcer and killer. Also in Bison's employ is the assassin Vega (Taboo, of the group The Black Eyed Peas), a masked talon-wielding warrior, whose weapon is tailor-made for slashing and stabbing attacks. Bison's attache is the beautiful but deadly Cantana (Josie Ho). Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li 2/10As Bison instigates a wave of violence in the slum districts, grabbing power and land no matter what the costs to its residents, a team of heroes emerges. Chun-Li (Kristin Kreuk) is a half-Caucasian/half-Asian beauty who gave up a life of privilege to become a street fighter, battling for those who cannot fight for themselves. Her kung fu master, Gen (Robin Shou), once a feared criminal, now fights for the forces of good. Equally determined to stop Bison is Interpol cop Charlie Nash (Chris Klein), who has tracked the crime boss all over the world, and Nash's partner, gangland homicide detective Maya Sunee (Moon Bloodgood).",

            "review_title": "\"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\"- Basically every bland 90's direct-to-video action-flick, but with an actual budget and an inexplicable theatrical release.",
            "content": "Honestly, perhaps the most perplexing thing about 2009's \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\" is just how completely and utterly average a movie it really is. It's basically completely sanitary and relatively inoffensive in its structuring, with just competent enough production values and a generally passable cast. But it's so plain and \"blah,\" you can't help but feel yourself starting to nod off should you chose to give it a watch. And I think that's the real problem. It's not the terrible crime against film that it's made out to be... it's just so wholly unremarkable as a movie-going experience, that it feels empty and pointless. It really does remind one of those cheap-o 90's direct-to-video action flicks that used to pollute the video-store shelves back in the day. This feels like the sort-of film you'd rent on a whim because it looks like it might be good for a laugh, watch on a Friday night and forget about a day later. The sort of film Z-grade actors like Antonio Sabato Jr. or Cynthia Rothrock would pop up in and kick some butt while a cheesy synth soundtrack blared in the background. But inexplicably, this one somehow got a theatrical release, a $50 million budget and was tied in to a popular tournament-fighter video-game series. Unfortunately, unlike the other \"Street Fighter\" live-action adaptation, which at least was semi-comedic and benefited from campy laughs and a great performance by the late Raul Julia... \"The Legend of Chun-Li\" is just boring and mind-numbing in its standardness.The film follows one of the characters from the \"Street Fighter\" game series, Chun-Li. When she was only a child, she witnessed the kidnapping of her father by the dreaded M. Bison. Years later, after losing her mother to cancer, she encounters martial-arts master Gen, and trains under him, vowing to get vengeance for her father's abduction. And so, the film degenerates into a standard tale of action and revenge as our heroine faces various thugs and obstacles in her struggles against Bison and his cronies. Yawn.It shouldn't be too surprising that the film is helmed by Polish cinematographer-turned-director Andrzej Bartkowiak. After all, he was already responsible for another extremely bland and toothless video-game adaptation in \"Doom\", and this film falls into many of the same trappings as that release. Inspired by a video-game source material yet afraid to follow the details and formula of the original work. Filled with lots of high-concept ideas but a slave to clich\u00e9s. Cast with generally decent performers who are hampered by sub-par screen writing. And assembled with relative competence while simultaneously feeling generic and trite. While Bartkowiak's films might not be as ludicrously awful as other, more infamous video-game movie directors (I'm looking at you, Uwe Boll), in a way, his films are worse. At least the poorer films generate some talking points due to their overt failures... Bartkowiak's are merely wholly forgettable.To give credit where it is due, the film does have some minor strengths. I really liked some of the supporting cast for one. It was really great seeing \"Mortal Kombat\" star Robin Shou back on the screen as martial-artist Gen, and he's a criminally underrated and highly likable actor. It was also good fun seeing the late Michael Clarke Duncan as one of Bison's main cronies. Some of the action was appropriately thrilling and the effects were generally passable. And there's even a few really fun, schlock-tastic instances of blood and gore in the Unrated version of the film that generate an appropriately queasy response.But the script by Justin Marks is the most basic of the basic, the cinematography is flat and uninspired and lead actress Kristin Kreuk is hilariously un-charismatic, leaving the film just feeling dull. Not terrible. Just dull and average at best. There was really no reason this film should have been tied to \"Street Fighter\" besides brand recognition, and it could just have easily been re-written to be an \"original\" story. The purported $50 million is barely visible on- screen and could easily have been slashed in half. And the movie really didn't warrant a release on the big-screen. This really is just about on- par your standard direct-to-video action-thriller. And that's where it should have been released. At least then, I would have known to set my standards a bit lower.\"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\" is a 4 out of 10. If you catch it on cable and there's nothing else on, give it a shot. It'll at least kill 90 minutes on a slow afternoon. But if you're thinking about actually paying to rent or buy it, don't bother.",

            "content": "Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li: 5 out of 10: A Batman Begins style reboot for the Street Fighter series which up to this point consisted of one highly derided film released 15 years earlier. The Good: You know if you forget this is supposed to be a Street Fighter film (Not hard to do at all since outside of some the character names this really has nothing to do with Street Fighter) this really isn't that bad. Good production values and location shooting with the occasional action beat. Considering this is currently at number 76 of the 100 worst movies of all time on the IMDB list, the low expectations do it some favors as well. Both Kristin Kreuk as the titular star and Moon Bloodgood as a detective are watchable and refreshing. In addition, Michael Clarke Duncan is clearly having fun and his enthusiasm is infectious. The Bad: Entire doctoral thesis has been written about all the things wrong with the movie. Among the various sins child actors that look nothing like their adult counterparts (to the point of being a clearly different nationality), Chris Klein is awful and drags down every scene he is in, Chris Klein is in way too many scenes, and the villain makes no sense.The Ugly: Here we get to the crux of the hatred for this unremarkable action film. Street Fighter fans. This is, by any measure, a terrible adaptation of the source material. Now I have to admit my eyes glaze over when rabid fandoms go on the attack because the backstory written to sell some toys and fill five minutes of a twenty-four-minute cartoon is treated as if Moses himself brought it down from the mountain. (I am looking your way Transformers fans), but Street Fighter fans have an understandable beef.As source material goes Street Fighter is a pretty thin gruel. Unlike many modern video games, Street Fighter has more in common with Pac-Man or Donkey Kong than say The Last of Us. You have colorful characters and a fighting tournament outside of that a screenwriter pretty much has carte blanche to do what he wants with the story. Guess what this movie does not have? If you said a fighting tournament and colorful characters guess what you win a prize.\nIn Conclusion: Clearly, the screenwriter had a Tomb Raider script sitting in a dusty drawer (The film makes much more sense as a Tomb Raider reboot than a Street Fighter one) and got a call from his agent. Meh, one video game is the same as another just change Lara Croft to Chun Li and change the Irish real estate mogul into Bison and we are good to go. No need to change the plot about the cave of soul cleansing or the mysterious scroll or the heroine living alone in the mansion with servants after her father's disappearance. \nDecent B movie action film but in all fairness a horrible adaptation of the source material.",

While some might have a soft spot for \"Street Fighter\" it's not really a good movie but it's high art compared to this trainwreck.Let me put this out there first. While I think Kristen Kreuk is a lovely woman her acting is atrocious. I'll even forgive them using a white girl to play a Chinese girl as Kristen is part Asian. I can think of a half-dozen other actresses that could have played Chun-Li and would have been much better in the role. But one bad actor shouldn't take away all the fun from a movie so I doubt a better actress would have made it at least watchable.The story shows us Chun-Li's life from the time she was young to the end when she receives word of another she should meet, namely Ken Masters.

This movie was one of those movies that you watch for about 10 minutes and you're thinking, are they serious??? The acting is horrible, plot is stupid and when you look at the cast before you even see the movie you already know its going to be a bad movie. To name a few, Kristen Kreuk as Chun Li: OK she wasn't that bad in the movie but as a fan of the game, when I think Chun Li I definitely don't think Lana from Smallville. Taboo as Vega: OK I don't know what the hell they were thinking when they mad this casting role because this itself screams box office flop. Chris Klein as Charlie Nash: definitely without a doubt the worst actor in the entire movie. Every time he tried to turn his tough guy attitude on it was way more awkward than intimidating. Robin Shou as Gen: Robin Shou obviously can't say no to any action movie he is offered. Mortal Kombat was enough Robin, stop ruining other classic fighting games turned into movies. And finally Neal McDonough as M. Bison: let me repeat that Neal McDonough as M. Bison???? WHAT?!?!? Neal is nowhere near anything close to resembling Bison's look or attitude. Did not criticize Michael Clarke Duncan as Balrog because I am a fan of his, but the character in my opinion was pointless in this movie. And the only reason I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 out of 10 is because of Moon Bloodgood. She is such a stunning and beautiful actress and without her appearance on screen, I would have had no recollection of this movie whatsoever after I watched it. She is such an underrated actress and needs to be put out there in way better roles than this piece of crap.There were many instances in this film that had me go what the hell was that? (For example the spinning bird kick was one of the most awkward things in the movie) and all the acting was beyond laughable. And to put the icing on the cake, the ending where Gen goes, \"There's a fighter in Japan. Ryu......something\" was the biggest shame this movie could possibly put on a classic video game series.

Anyway, who needs 'acting talent' in a movie like this anyway, as if Rothrock, Van Damme & Norris were great thespians!It bears no resemblance to the colourful & garish world of the Street Fighter games and considering the frenetic energy which is the trademark of the Capcom series the action when it finally comes is a major let-down. Too much time is spent developing the rather dull story line instead of having Chun-Li beating people up. Kreuk's acting is uninspiring, but it was her physical condition which appalled me most - she looks so thin and frail resembling a near anorexic teen instead of the muscular thunder thighed Chun-Li of the games. I'd love to see some movie producer have the courage to cast a woman with a muscular build in movies like this instead of always serving up female stick figures flying through the air on wires. The original Van-Damme 'Street Fighter' was poor, but like the movies of Uwe Boll it did have a little style and camp energy which 'The Legend of Chun-Li' totally lacks. Its a movie which has been remembered for all the wrong reasons, but I doubt anyone will be talking about 'The Legend of Chun-Li' .",

It's bad...really, really bad but it helps the movie in a strange way because you just can't help but laugh at it. The only person who isn't tripping over themselves to deliver this trash is Michael Clarke Duncan...but what do you expect from a man who's usually hired more for his stature than his talent? I'd love to be able to say this was better than the original Street Fighter live action movie, but it's not. Mind you that it's bad for very different reasons, but still...it's pretty lame. The only thing that really bothered me in this film is the absolutely perverse amount of clich\u00e9s and the stunning amount of suspension of disbelief required (Kristen Kreuk as a Wushu master? I barely buy her as a human being). Yeah, I realize it's a movie based on a video game, but there's got to be a line somewhere. And if anyone reading this is old enough to remember when Kevin Costner caught all that crap for his on-again-off-again English accent in Robin Hood, then you'll practically die laughing when you hear Neal McDonough lapse in and out of the worst Irish accent I've ever heard...ever ever ever. Oh...and don't forget Chris Klein as the tough Interpol agent who can't stop delivering some of the most ridiculous dialog and one-liners I've ever heard. But the funny thing is that despite all of this the movie manages to at least be watchable. You just can't help but laugh at this stuff and, while that's not it's intention, it doesn't make it any less entertaining. It's a bit of a crap shoot...if you've got something better to watch, go with that. But you might not be as disappointed as you think with this one. It's good for all the wrong reasons.",

BUT and i emphasize BUT, she was also disappointing. The character was carried pretty well by Kristin Kreuk, but she still needs to fine tune her acting skills a little more.Matter of fact the whole damn movie was INCOMPLETE. The highlight of this movie is when Chun-Li used her \"helicopter kick\" and the hard part about it is that only lasted about 2-3 seconds.",

The plot is this movie is not bad at all. It's another revenge plot we've seen over and over. This time a little girl sees her father kidnapped right in front of her. She grows up wanting revenge and gets it in the end (so to speak).The fight scenes are fine. They are stylized, so people complaining that they \"don't look real\" should go write a review about an animation and complain \"it doesn't look real\". This is a movie based on a video game, and the fight scenes will never look realistic. If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then don't see the movie. Anyone going to see a movie like this expecting realism is one brick short of a full load. One person tries to claim that the movie takes a few ques from Batman Begins....yeah, Batman...how was that for a realistic movie? The acting is just fine, the plot works and the effects are more than enough to allow for the suspension if disbelief.The final battle between good and evil could have been better. It was a bit of a letdown. The skills taught to the main character Chun-Li reminded me of Goku's Kamehameha move from Dragon Ball Z. So, yeah, it's a little on the corny side, but what do you want for a Street Fighter movie? The worst thing I can say about this movie is, although her acting is fine, they really miscast Kristin Kreuk in the lead roll as Chun-Li. She is supposed to be part white and part Asian, and although the actress who plays the part when she is a young girl fits the part perfectly, Kristin Kreuk does not. She does not even remotely look Asian. On top of that, every time I saw her I could not help but think of Lana Lang in Smallville. They should have gotten another actress for this part, preferably one that actually looks the part.If you like corny martial arts action movies, you'll have fun watching this one. Just try and squint your eyes a bit when Kristin Kreuk is on screen.",

Sunee, but more clich\u00e9 than Chris Klein's Nash, there isn't, he is probably competing for worst portrayal with Kreuk, because, he was ridiculous, trying to look bad ass, instead, he looked like a 12yo on drugs.Conclusion: I've seen worst movies, but this is still isn't even worth a free download.2/10.",

I hesitate to mention acting when reviewing a martial arts movie but when it's this bad you have to mention it. Chris Klein's Interpol character was ridiculous. Everything he does is so over the top and exaggerated that it looks as though he watched every cop movie from the past 25 years to get into character. Of course when you are given dialogue like \"He walks through raindrops\" to describe the villain's elusiveness, there's not much hope to begin with. Oh and he loves his job. So much that not one, but two scenes are punctuated with him smiling to himself and saying \"I love my job\". Enough about acting though because good fight scenes can save any martial arts movie but unfortunately there's none to be found here either. Kristin Kreuk is never believable at all in the action scenes. Her character is shown being taught Wushu by her father in the beginning of the film but I would describe her fighting style later in the movie as wire gymnastics. Girl can flip good though, I'll give her that. It was good to see Robin Shou again even if he does have the thankless role of teaching Chun-Li how to make a floating ball of something. He's the only one of the main characters who has any real martial arts background. The dude from The Blackeyed Peas is a pretty good dancer though. Guess that's why he got the part of Vega. What I will never understand is this: If you are going to make a martial arts movie that has a terrible script and terrible acting anyway, why not cast real martial artists. At least cast a real martial artist in a role that has only two lines of dialogue. Terrible acting, terrible fight scenes, and a terrible movie.",

            "content": "In the street fighter games, a diverse group of characters from across the globe face each other in martial arts battles. So wouldn't it make sense then, for a live action Street Fighter movie to be one of those fighting tournament films? You know, like BloodSport or The Quest or Superfights or Shootfighter or Mortal Kombat or even Dead or Alive ? A fighting tournament movie would have been the most logical way to adapt Street Fighter into film form and I'm sure that fellow fans of the game would agree with me. However, the people behind Street Fighter : The Legend of Chun-Li clearly didn't give a damn about the games fans, which explains why this corny, nonsensical and dull film defecates all over its source material.Like the 1994 film, '09s Street fighter movie just completely ignores every thing about the game its based on. Sure, the characters share the same names as their video game counterparts but that's where similarities stop - while the game was about characters fighting each other in rounds of supernatural combat, the '09 movie is about a pianist taking her revenge against an Irish land developer, who decided to lose his conscience by pulling his child from his pregnant partners stomach (I wish i joking). While the game was high fantasy, the movie goes for grittiness and just ends up looking camp and anachronistic. While you could clearly see every punch, kick and fire ball thrown in the games fights, the movies fights are a poorly shot, over edited mess. Its frustrating to watch how badly the production team got everything so, so wrong -particularly the films out of touch writer, Justin marks, who just doesn't get Street Fighter at all and Andrzej Bartkowiak, who fails to deliver a satisfying action movie for the fourth time in a row.So it's been established that it bears virtually no relation to the game, but is it any good, based on its own merits? Nope. While the '94 film was terrible , there was logic in its simple plot. The legend of Chun-Li on the other hand doesn't even have the courtesy to make sense- the story just rushes from A to B, not taking the time to explain all the crap its asking the audience to swallow and the boring narration doesn't help things.Dragging the film further into the gutter is the cast- every one sucks here, the biggest culprit being Chris Klein (\"NASH OUT!!!!!!\"). Totally abusing his status as the \"token white guy\", Klein overacts his ass off, delivers his corny lines like a low rent Keanu Reeves and really makes Raul Julias portrayal of M Bison seem like Oscar worthy stuff.When viewed as a stand alone film, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li is really, really bad. When you look at what its inspired by and what it could have been, its worse. Much, much worse. I'm glad it flopped.",

The Legend of Chun-Li takes cues from Christopher Nolan's hit Batman reboot and the similarly back-to-basics Superman series Smallville, with Kristin Kreuk (a half-Chinese Canadian) taking the lead as Chun-Li.Ming-Na played the role in the 1994 Streetfighter (directed by Steven E. de Souza) and this version sees her taking centre stage. But that isn't the only thing that distinguishes the two films. Gone are the primary colours and theatrics and instead we have a \"real world\" story with a handful of fantasy elements. Shadaloo is no longer a place but the name of a criminal organisation, pronounced Shadal-ow. M. Bison isn't the elaborately dressed cartoon dictator fans are familiar with, instead he's smartly dressed gangster with an Irish accent. As befits a martial arts movie, this is a revenge tale but there's a lot of other stuff going on too. Whole sub-plots that serve no purpose. The Legend of Chun-Li doesn't remind you of the Street Fighter game but it does remind you of a lot of other movies. Not only the aforementioned superhero adventures either. Every scene or plot point gives you a feeling of deja-vu. Director Andrzej Bartkowiak even rips off a memorable scene from one of his own movies (Romeo Must Die, 2000). Several moments (especially the ending) imitate Batman Begins but the results are similar to Catwoman (Pitof, 2004).Tipping its hat to video game predecessors by featuring Robin Shou, this is a curious failure, the whole thing feels more like a TV pilot or a B-movie than the major motion picture it's supposed to be.",

The story lacked cohesiveness and jumped around without direction. The actors' performances were extremely wooden; most of the time, they seemed to just shuffle from one scene to another. Cinematically, instead of having a big screen feel, the framing appeared more like the film was shot for TV. Fight scenes were badly staged and choreographed - in this day and age of special effects, actors don't need to know how to fight to look like they know how to fight.In summary, I cannot think of anything redeeming about this movie. If you really want to see a \"Street Fighter\" movie, watch the 1994 \"Street Fighter\" movie. That one is pretty bad as well but at least you'll have a few laughs while you suffer though it.",

I'll explain this more later, but first...*SCREAM*...*CRY*...*SIGH*....Let me start by saying that I am a hardcore, old school SF player, and have been playing the game for almost 20 years, been to tournaments, etc, etc. That being said...I will not nitpick about this sad excuse for a movies' mistakes in the SF universe. We all remember the last one. It was bad. We hoped this would be better, but we knew it wasn't going to be great. When your expectations are already very low and you are still disgusted beyond words, then you know you've got a real turd on your hands. I will let other SF players point out the flaws, which are far too numerous for me to mention. Suffice to say, if I may steal a line from Alex Trebek of SNL Celebrity Jeopardy - \"I'm speechless!\". :( To sum things up, all I can say to the actors, producers and writers is - FOR SHAME! I know what it's like to do something detestable for money (like doing phone tech support, or maybe acting in a crappy movie)...but have you no honor? And what's more - how on earth did you expect this unholy abomination to actually make a profit? Alienating the SF fans is one thing...but making a movie this bad seems a total and utter waste of time and money. This movie isn't just bad...it's Highlander 5 \"The Source\" bad! I know, I know, that's a very low blow...but I feel that IT IS that bad...a movie that makes you just sit there and say \"WHY? OH WHY??? HOW COULD YOU SINK SO LOW?!?!?\".This is the first, and probably last review I will ever write for a movie, so let me point out a few things that reflect my above sentiments:On the Streets? Chun Li's \"soul searching\" that she does on the streets of Thailand. Now then, as soon as I saw a beautiful, yet utterly broke, lost and homeless young Asian woman trying to find herself in Thailand of all places...I immediately thought of only one thing happening to her...and for decency's sake, I will not list it here! Unforgivable...SF IV? When the movie started...the first thing I noticed was that the SF logo was taken right from SF IV. I was excited thinking...hey, they're going to use this flick to promote the new game...right? WRONG! If it wasn't for the title, quite honestly, I wouldn't have any idea what game this movie was based on, and well, I still don't.Is this Mortal Kombat? When the female cop character was introduced...my first thought was...hmm, she sure doesn't look like any woman from SF...but hey, give her a skimpy outfit and a pair of sais or fans, and she'd be a dead wringer for Kitana or Mileena from MK II. And then when Gen came on the screen, I kept thinking...why can't I get MK out of my head? Then my buddy pointed out \"hey, he played Liu Kang in the MK movie!\"...so there you have it...the worst MK movie ever made! Please Stop with the DANCING! Let me start by saying that I have nothing against dancing. I am a dancer! I used to hit the Salsa clubs and go Ballroom dancing 5 nights a week. But what the *#$* is up with so many movies putting in these stupid dance scenes? I blame Dancing with the Stars for most of this bile...come on folks this is supposed to be STREET FIGHTER, not DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION! Even with the kinda but not really hot girl on girl tone to the dance...it was still pointless...worthless...and in very, very poor taste.In closing, if you are a fan of SF, AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE! And for everyone else, AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE TOO! The bar has been lowered so very low now, I don't think it is possible to sink even lower (well it probably is, as this movie has proved).

As a long time student of Chinese martial arts...I was impressed by that...yes, those were real moves...someone did their homework for that scene...if only...if only the rest of the movie had followed...If only....",

The sequencing is absolutely terrible, they start out with a narrative, and have a few good parts, but then the narrative just keeps going and the movie keeps bogging itself down with very poor wire-stunt work, and some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The \"kungfu master\" Gen, who is obviously a combined character of Ken and Ryu, has the most clich\u00e9 dialog ever thought up to go along with his infinitely clich\u00e9 role. The only really good performances I could find were from Michael Clark Duncan and Neal McDonough. Through out the movie, you could very easily predict what was going to happen several minutes before it actually did. All in all, another depressing look at one of my favorite childhood past-times, put into live action and carelessly flailed across the screen.",

First, this is an origin story of a character so put that in mind. Second it is not a Street Fighter movie so don't expect to see something like Mortal Kombat with a bloody tournament. It is a good written action move which includes the taste of Street Fighter elements. The Movie has a story which is kinda true about Chun Li at some point. Just give it a try and, it is not absolutely perfect but it is not really that bad. In my opinion, it is very good movie to enjoy the night.",

But in order to do that, he has to give characters ample screen time.Wow, I was sold.But the trailers that eventually came out looked mediocre and they changed a lot...But it only got worse after I seen the film for myself. Why couldn't they just make a story around a tournament of world class fighters? People already know that they're seeing a fighting movie, so the worst they could do is be criticized for having TOO much fighting and NOT ENOUGH plot. Doing it the other way around - too much story and not enough action - is worse. Well, actually having too much BAD story is worse. And that's what we got.",

Chris Klein desperately needs acting lessons - had they hired a tone deaf mute with one leg and no fingers, i'm pretty sure he would have done a better job in the role, this man made me want to actually pour acid into my eyes rather than watch him for one more second. For the first hour of the film, nothing happens then when the last forty minutes of eyeball torture comes around......nothing happens.

The good points: Camera work was pretty good. Fight choreography was OK. Set design was good.The not so good points: The actors were trying, but their deliveries were awkward at times. There are a few plot holes that are never explained. The music at the club scene - WHY did they choose something that BAD? Decisions made by Chun-Li, no real life human would ever do.

Some of the scenes in the film are absolutely beautiful and the action scenes are fairly par for the course, but this isn't bad.They took a few liberties with the origin of the video game character, but I can forgive that to make the film work.Overall, it's an average flick and good popcorn and riff material.

Now, with that said. Let me break it down a bit here. It is NOT an all out martial art's fighting style of movie. And, here is actually why many people let it go over their head's(Because, I have seen many of these type's of spin-off's. If you want a better idea, of why I say it's a \"spin-off\" & a cliche' style of a backtrack to the first movie &/or the game. It may not be a game. But, it does refer to the background's of the original character's, of the original movie's. Check on the movie \"Logan\", in reference to where Wolverine, from the X-Men came from. It's not an all out battle and special FX through the whole movie. It's your basic dull climb to where the original could actually begin, or start from.). Okay, to not give away any spoiler's, the plot that seem's choppy to most and a downer, to them. Is actually set on the beginning of the lives of certain character's, like Chun-Li(AKA Chun-Lee, if you seen the name, in I think 2 of the original game's, for the Nintendo, or Super Nintendo. I forget which one, though.), Bison & Vega. Before she get's the dual side hair bun's and her infamous dress, that you see her fighting in, in the game's. It's basically, an intro, to the possibilities of the original. Kinda like the Star War's movie's. How, they made them, like 30 years, AFTER the original trilogy. To me, they were cheesy and dull. But, what do you expect, from an intro style movie!? Where, the character's, don't really know, who they really are, yet? It's kinda like a right of passage, to give a background story, on the character's, themselves, to let people see, where they came from(Exactly the same thing, that they were doing, with the X-Men movies. When, they spawned the Wolverine side movies. And, those, after the first, weren't too bad. But, the first of those spawn's, was dull as a marble. But, it set the ground, of where to take the next sequel that would eventually, lead up to the original movie.). So, I wasn't expecting the tournament style fighting. But granted, I did expect some better acting. But, it didn't seem like the actor's were really at fault. I have seen many of the actor's/actresses in other movie's/show's. And, they did much better work in those. So, it seemed like they were at a loss, of which way to turn, without their leader(The producer, to tell them, what they needed, for the scene to look more realistic.). As if, the producer, just told them, to ad-lib half the movie. Where, they kept bumpin their head's, a lot, when they should have been more in-sync, then tryin to cross each other's path's. Now, most of the fight scene's were pretty good, like I said. Where, the obvious best, were between Robin Shou(Loved him, as Liu Kang, in the original & sequel of Mortal Kombat.) & Kristin Kreuk. And, the fight in the girl's restroom, with Josie Ho & Kristin Kreuk, wasn't bad, either. But, there are a few other good short fight's, where it makes it worth while, to get the cheap seat's, for the movie. I would bet, if they had a different producer, that knew what they were doing, it could have gotten a 7 or 8, or maybe a 9, instead of the 5 star...",

But with one exception: They forgot to include any \"good\" parts.Street Fighter II, the iconic video game responsible for more than 2 billion reported cases of \"Gamer's Thumb\",not only had already built in back stories for so many of their characters, but also featured the first \"where are they now\" segments after beating the game. Built. In. Stories. Neato! But, apparently the writers of \"Street Fighter: Legend of Chun Li\" never beat the game. Or played it. Or knew it was based on a video game. Or realized that what they wrote would be made into an actual movie.So here's my review. I'm not going to take you through the entire movie. Simply because... it sucked too much to write about the whole thing. I will, however, take you up to the point where we finally get to see that titular character blossom into the Chun Li we know so well from the game.Opening credits, title card, Asian music, and BAM! Young Chun Li and dad. We know they're in America because we see some stock footage of the Golden Gate Bridge. Chun Li is a happy little girl who loves to play the piano and watch her dad do Tai Chi in the back yard.A-HA, you think, that must be when she learns how to fight! No... the writers didn't want to spring THAT clich\u00e9 too early on, so they decided he would be more of a pacifist. So dad encourages her to play piano, and she does. I love it when they break the mold, don't you? So, one day daddy gets a visit from some bad guys. Enter Michael Clark Duncan (aptly portraying the bloated boxer Balrog) and Neal McDonough as the flaxen haired, limerick spoutin', shillelagh totin' M. Bison.(This is where you should hear that ear-piercing tire screech noise.) An Irish M. Bison? Of course! Remember when I told you the writers never played the game? Apparently making Bison IRISH made him more... fair skinned. Thank GOD they did, because the very last thing I want to see in a crappy movie based on an awesome video game is any slight resemblance to any of the main characters from the 16-bit masterpiece I spent my entire childhood obsessed over.So, Ballrag beats dad up with a table while, before carting her dad off, McBison eyes Chun Li for about 5 awkward minutes. All that was missing at this point was the heavy raspy breathing and a bag of candy. Revenge boils in her tear-reddened eyes.A-HA, you think, that must be when she learns how to fight! No, she grows up and moves to China. We know she's in China because everyone speaks perfect English. And she's still playing that piano, professionally now, and reaping the benefits of tons of free gifts from fans. Roses... chocolates... ancient Chinese texts written on the dried skins of their enemies. You know, the usual. Chun Li decides to get the text decoded and travels deep within the back streets of China to a hidden shop run by the old lady from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. You may be thinking... \"Why not take the text to a local university? Wouldn't that be easier than trying to find Jade Fox's Bait and Tackle Shop?\" Of course not, you logical moron! Jade Fox tells her she has to go to Bangkok and learn to live on the streets and forget to shower for a month.A-HA, you think, that must be when she learns how to fight! No, she just keeps withering away, while somehow keeping her makeup from ever smudging. So, Chun Li, in a furious montage of her walking a lot, reveals in the somber voice over that she hates crime and wishes she could do something about it (Don't we all, sister?). Yes, our poor heroine seems to be out of luck. That is until a kind mini-corndog vendor gives Chun Li a free sample after she all but licks the grease droppings from the deep fryer.A-HA, you think, that must be when she learns how to fight! Right you are, my friend! That night after feasting on the most scrumptious pig-in-a-blanket she'll ever taste, she suddenly decides to learn Kung-Fu! By simply wanting it real hard! Those thugs can kiss their matching waistcoats goodbye because Chun Li lets forth a ninja storm of backflips, handstands, karate chops, and spinning star kicks (I'll have what she's having).And as fast as the barrage of fury begins, it ends. Chun Li drops to the ground with the grace of a load of concrete. I blame the mini-corn dog. She's picked up and carried away by the guy who played Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat. He takes her back to his temple and teaches her how to blame herself when he beats her up, throw fireballs, and catch marbles he throws at her.Of course, the movie progresses and continues to fail miserably on every level until ending at the hour and a half too-long mark. It does, however, feature some guy from the Black Eyed Peas and Chris Klein playing a cop. Badly.There you have it! My rant for a movie that was so bad, it prompted me to sit at this computer for an hour and infect the internet with yet another two cent opinion on a film that no one should go see when I COULD have better spent my time watching the original Street Fighter movie and appreciating how much less I hated it than THIS version.

In August 1987, Capcom debuted their first game of \"Street Fighter\" in what would be a long and successful line. Recently in order to boost the re-launch of the game series with \"Street Fighter IV\" Capcom's decided to do so with a joint venture of \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\" a second live-action film adaptation which wasn't as hokey as Jean-Claude Van Damme's \"Street Fighter\" from back in 1994.\"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\" revolves around one of the fans favorite character's of the same name (Chun-Li) played well by the young, fresh faced Kristin Kreuk in her pursuit to stop and right the wrongs of the villainous (Bison/Vega(Japan)) portrayed surprisingly well by Neal McDonough. Unlike 1994's \"Street Fighter\" which managed to squeeze in at the time all of the game characters; this time around both (Director) Andrzej Bartkowiak and (Writer) Justin Marks decided to focus mainly on a handful of characters while developing Chun-Li for the most part. One other notable mention is (Gen, Chun-Li's mentor) played by Robin Shou (the veteran actor of video game to movie adaptations genre like Mortal Kombat), showed me that he's still very much relevant in the acting community and makes you wonder why he's not seen more often on the big screen.As for the disappointing factors of \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\" revolved mainly around the major draw/concept to this film which was the fighting: 1). The epic battles of this movie were extremely short. 2). Nothing really stood out during or after any of the fights (for example: no real memorable move or moment). In fact the characters key/signature moves were hardly touched on. 3). Speaking of disappointment; why did Nutjaporn 'Bow' Swasdiprom (Casting) cast Taboo from \"Black Eyed Peas\" fame as (Vega/Balrog(Japan)). Instead of the menacing cutthroat image established from the franchise for this character, I simply started to laugh at how they made him look soft as hell and very laughable. 4). My one last issue with this movie was with (Charlie Nash) played by Chris Klein from \"American Pie\" fame. Prior to watching this movie I already had my reservations about him being in this movie despite the fact that I normally do like him as an actor but this simply wasn't his role. He didn't look the part and much like with Taboo I ended up laughing at the screen more often than not (though I must admit that I'm not entirely sure if it was Chris Klein's acting that I had a problem with or was it more so with the lines and role he was presented with by (Writer) Justin Marks).In conclusion though I can appreciate the new take on the \"Street Fighter\" franchise and how they wanted to focus on someone else other than the usual Ryu and/or Ken, the movie itself fell short on signature moves, action and most importantly fights. Had this been called anything else, gone straight to DVD or had it been a made for TV movie then it would've been OK but for the simple facts that it had a much larger budget, several character actors, publicity/hype and worst off... the \"Street Fighter\" title attached; left me fairly disappointed and would suggest that you wait until you rent it or until it makes its way onto cable TV. I hope this post was of some help and use. Enjoy.",

No you probably have the worst performance ever from Chris Klein, for those who watched this movie think about the scene in the office. So out of character... Kristin Kreuk...i have watched small ville all the way through. Even though small ville is far from perfect, the performance in this movie is badand i mean really really bad, there is no way around that. The only one remotely credible in this movie is Michael Clarke Duncan even though with his 5 lines he does not have much to talk without him i'd contact the staff of IMDb helping me to give 0 stars if he wasn't in this movie.

Why take an American actress for Chun Li? They could have taken Zhang Ziyi for example, but no, they went for a typical American girl that can't say three words of mandarin Chinese and then give her a load of lines to say in that language... not a good choice. Neal McDonough has only one face in acting - ever seeing him as Dave Williams in Desperate Housewives has done it for me. He can't act. He can only look slightly smug, so that's all he does. Michael Clarke Duncan is a great actor, but he is reduced to a brainless thug in this flick, what a waste.... Chris Klein and someone named 'Moon Bloodgood' as detectives? Really? Are you kidding me? I could go on, but suffice to say - the acting is very bad. b) the plot is useless. nothing is explained. what does chun-li's dad do? what does he have to do for this bison character? why should we care? whats this bison guy's motives? why does he kill all his associates? why do we see that? should we care? how did gen survive an rpg explosion in his home? why didn't they just fly in the guys daughter? why do we need to get to know his daughter? again... why should we care.... c) the fighting is unbelievable and below par - you would expect that in a movie that's based on a beat'm'up, the martial arts is at least up-to-par. but it's not! oh my god, this movie is such a let down. and someone please explain me why chun-li had to finish with some fireball thing and then break the guy's neck in such a complicated manner? it just doesn't make sense.... like the whole movie...do yourself a favor - do not see this. don't spend your time and money, you WILL be disappointed!",

Firstly this has nothing to do with Street fighter apart from the name. Its a load of rubbish, Chun Li was the daughter of a police officer who Bison killed in her youth, for this she swore revenge, not some teaching business man. Gen was an old man who taught Chun-Li her way not a late 20;s early 30's rouge assassin. Balrog was a boxer but every time he gets into a confrontation is when hes holding a gun, the only thing I saw him hit was a punch bag. Bison, well Bisons's Bison Neal McDonough was the only person who played his character even slightly convincingly. There were no other Street Fighter characters which surprised me as Ryu and Ken trained with Gen in the games and even they don't make an appearance. Chris Klien or Nash as hes known, played the worst part of his career, his acting was stale and transparent, there was no enthusiasm, it sounded as if there was a kinderg\u00e4rtner reading from the script, reading everything monotone All that aside, if you've never played the games and only heard of Street Fighter because of this movie your still not missing out, the plot is weak, the acting is weaker and this lead to what seemed to be the slowest hour and a half of my life.

If you are going to do an action movie then pick an action director and style it that way, but if you are going to try and throw in romance, military and martial arts as well then at least pick a director who has a familiarity with those genres.What you get here is a film that works in places but fails in others, because the director has no idea of how to shoot scenes with police or the armed forces and yet insist on including them in the plot.

This was clearly misplaced optimism, the legend of Chun-li is such a poor film, that i consider the fact that it made the big screen, cunning and deceptive.The movie has the feel of having being shot using an old tea bag as filter, and a camera crew comprising three people. i would even allow Jean-Claude to complain about this movie, because the previous one was better, and that statement speaks volumesWith that said, had the film had it's full compliment of camera crew, it still would not have rescued the weak plot, and even poorer performances. The cast itself was OK, but when you mix underrated actors from your typical blood and guts films, with semi-household names the likes of Michael Clarke Duncan, their average performance resemble the rest of the poor actors.another corny thing i need to mention, every time Bison alights on the screen, a sound clip or a tiger is played????

I just don't understand why a piano playing school girl is chosen by the \"order if the web\" to dismantle the biggest crime syndicate in the world. And there was no attempt to even explain so. Along with lacking information and background, the plot also lacked in any realism. Why would a piano playing school girl leave home ( a mansion and several servants ) to become a homeless wanderer in bangkok because some mysterious scroll told her to. Chris Kline as Charlie Nash was a horrid performance. Kline should stick to his roles in teenage comedy dramas.

            "content": "Honestly I have nothing more to say about this awful movie. I myself have actually enjoyed playing Street Fighter games because their movesets are very simple to pull off and most of it's roster just has the perfect kind of appearance they would also look for most of Capcom's gaming lineup.So this is based on Street Fighter's iconic female fighter Chun-Li, this movie is focused around her and the revenge she gets at M. Bison for killing her father. And asides that this movie tries so hard to explain her story throughout the film, it seems to fall off so hard and panned.The casting is pretty god-awful and horrible and it seems to me like they added Kristen Kreuk to play as Chun-Li. Even though she was a lot better playing as Lana Lang in Smallville, I feel that her role as the popular female fighter is an absolute mis-cast because she happens to be a mixed-race (she is Chinese Canadian) for the Street Fighter character who is fully Chinese, at one point in this movie she puts on her trademark hairbuns and wears a blue dress (not even a qipao), but then the rest of this movie shows her wearing black or other clothing that doesn't match Chun-Li at all. Neal McDonough is even worse for playing as M. Bison because he looks nothing like his video game counterpart, doesn't even wear his iconic outfit, at least Raul Julia had dark hair for the role of M. Bison back when he played as him before his death. Although we can safely say that Julia's role of the villain had more better experience than that of McDonough who's hardly even acted out like Bison especially with that dumb fake Scottish or Irish accent. Chris Klein and Moon Bloodgood that both played as Charlie Nash and Maya (who is basically C. Viper from SFIV) don't even look like their video game counterparts and just go off as useless detectives in scenes from this movie. They're using guns most of the time and I don't know if they would've known that this movie is called Street Fighter and they should've been using their hand-to-hand combat besides using firearms for most of the movie. Two other one of Bison's Shadaloo men Balrog and Vega were played by the late Michael Clark Duncan and Taboo (singer of the Black Eyed Peas). Both of their roles also had major flaws. For Duncan on his role as Balrog goes off using firearms and can't even throw punches at one of his opponents just because he's a boxer. For Taboo on his role as Vega shows that he's too short to play the role and is also Native-Mexican while Vega in the games is actually tall and Spaniard. Overall the one interesting role I would somewhat like is Robin Shou who you might remember him as Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat from 1995 and plays a small role as a pirate leader in DOA: Dead or Alive. He plays the role of Gen who is Chun-Li's master and spends his time training and also fighting alongside with her in the movie. The one thing that throws me off is when he pronounces Ryu as RAI-YOO and not REE-YOO or if you were to roll that \"R\" with the name it would've sounded more accurate.The fight scenes in this movie somehow feel ok at times but then they would show the scene where Chun-Li would actually kill one of those guys in this movie especially when she's a police officer! And not only that, there are some brutal scenes that make it a little hard to watch just because they would slap on the Street Fighter name on the title of this film!The special effects in this movie are absolutely the worst ones yet. There are times when you know that the bullet shots are digital effects without using prop firearms. And the Kikoken scene is the most terrible cheap special effect of all-time. It's not even colored blue in the games, and the appearance on it looked like it was taken from an old 90s computer graphics that still looks awful today.The quotes in this movie are probably the worst, no where near as corny as what we usually would hear in Street Fighter the Movie with JCVD and Raul Julia. That movie at least was cheesy and had fun moments which still shows some better word quotes from characters like Guile like when he gives out a speech or M. Bison talking about raiding Chun-Li's village ending with the phrase \"For me, it was Tuesday\". But in Legend of Chun-Li, it seems their lines were murky and also uninspired like Bison would tell Chun-Li that her father is the milk of his business and would finish with \"But even milk has an expiration date\". I mean how would you not know that milk goes bad all the time! Especially all the other characters quotes feel so flat and terrible in terms of a scene they would be mentioning.Ok so this movie of it's own would think that Rose (and yes I'm talking about Rose from Street Fighter games) is the daughter of M. Bison. There is no blood-related connection between them in the games. Rose is in fact Italian from the fighting game she originates and has a fortune telling ability. This movie's version of (White) Rose is nothing more than coming off as Russian (due to the language she spoke) and is never actually a fighter.Overall this movie is nothing more than a pretty bad reception and a god-awful superhero like fighting game adaptation. Everything about this movie is so bland, most of the characters in this movie don't even look or dress like their appearances from the video games because they're all wearing black for the majority of the film, the special effects are all so cheaply made like it's an independent movie despite being released by 20th Century Fox (now known as 20th Century Studios), the acting and writing is so piss-poor with each character's lines saying something nonsensical, and all about this movie is that they were planning to have a sequel with Ryu and Ken Masters. Unfortunately it didn't happen and I'm just so glad that the sequel of this misstep of an adaptation would never have been made, it could've been much worse.This movie's runtime is about 96 minutes, well apparently the deleted scenes included multiple scenes that were cut from the final product! One being a cameo scene with the producer of Hyde Park Entertainment, Ashok Amritraj. And at the very end is suppose to be I think a post-credit scene where the White Rose is at the police station then all of a sudden her eyes show that she's possessed almost thinking she's taken M. Bison's aura around her. But again overall I'm just glad that a sequel had to be cut out for this abomination.It's hard to believe that the writer for this movie would later go on to write the live action Disney Jungle Book movie from 2016 and of course probably the best drama movie of all-time, Top Gun Maverick! It's incredible he went from a rocky start to a smooth flowing safe trail. I recommend watching those movies instead, but stay FAR AWAY FROM LEGEND OF CHUN-LI!! I recommend axing it or Hadouken it in flames!",

If you had been orphaned as a small baby in Thailand, what accent would you have after growing up there? Well, according to the makers of this movie, it would be Irish. If you're looking for an explanation to this, the movie intelligently provides one by informing you that the character in question (Bison, for those of you who know your Street Fighter games) had an Irish mother.Erm...right! This is a movie in which we have a renegade cop called Nash who has obviously never had the time to look up the word 'cliche'. With two day stubble, he swaggers around his scenes shouting things like \"What orders?\" or growling at computer screens. At one point he walks straight up to the camera to recite plot-moving dialogue straight to the audience with a knowing wink.This movie is awful. Absolutely terrible. There is even a scene in which Chun Li actually has a sexy dance-off with a lesbian enemy. I swear to God, that I'm not joking about this. What's even better is that this scene ends with a character asking renegade cop Nash 'Are you going to tell me or should I guess?' with Nash growling back in a Dirty Harry voice (whilst squinting like somebody playing a parody in one of those \"Epic Movie\" abominations) 'Go ahead and guess.' It's as though Chris Klein (who plays Nash) was the only actor who realised that this entire movie was a joke and decided to pretend he was in a comedy.I can't recommend this movie enough if you get any amusement over cinematic car crashes.Terrible.

            "content": "I went to see this movie having easily the lowest expectations possible figuring that if I had low expectations, the movie may surprise me and be decent. Needless to say, this movie was worse than those expectations.The movie was a clich\u00e9d mess filled with terrible editing, terrible acting, terrible dialog, terrible effects, and a terrible story to boot.Bison in this is your typical crime boss operating out of Bangkok, instead of an evil mastermind whatever-the-hell he is in the games. The writers essentially turned M. Bison from a legit-badass into the movie version of Lex Luthor. The entire reason he does what he does in the film, is to make super-condos on waterfront property in bangkok for the super rich.Michael Clark Duncan is decent, you can tell he had fun making this movie, unfortunately his lines usually get cut off half the time, or he doesn't actually say more than two lines within a 20 minute time-span. His first fight scene was actual decent, but the others were really lack-luster.Kristin Kruek wasn't that bad as Chun-li, like with the others I believe she did the best she could with what she had to work with, which wasn't much.Now I did say the acting was terrible, and I stand by this, I say the acting was terrible because the writing was even worse. The dialog was ridiculous and unbelievable and sounded so forced coming from the actors that it ruined any chance of immersion and turned what tried to be a series kung-fu film into your typical sci-fi original garbage only with worse writing.The fight scenes in the film are sparse, the fight with Vega lasts a good 2 minutes, which wouldn't have been a problem if they hadn't hyped Vega up so much within the film. I can't tell if the fight scenes were bad because of the poor job of editing them together, or if the people in the fight scenes were just that terrible at the fight scenes themselves.The special effects were stale and seemed like they were from 2002, instead of using pyrotechnics to blow up a building, they instead use cgi explosions, this wouldn't be a problem if the cgi explosions didn't look like it was a cgi-explosion.Then there were spots in the film that just make no sense. In order for Bison to become truly evil, he stabbed his pregnant wife in the stomach with his hands and took out the baby inside of a cave, and apparently transferred the good part of his soul into the baby. This was easily the most WTF moment within the entire film, the actor playing young Bison looked creepy as hell, and I couldn't tell if he was going to eat the baby or not. I'm not entirely sure why I brought that up, but it was just weird.There is a lot more I could say about this movie. If you're expecting a good video game movie, you will be disappointed. If you're expecting a decent kung-fu flick, you will be disappointed. If you're expecting a decent action movie, you will be disappointed.If you're looking for a movie that is so ridiculous you and your friends(I suggest bringing friends) can't help but laugh and make fun of the movie throughout. You're in for a treat.There is a lot more I could say about this movie, a lot more negative, not a lot of positive.But like I said just a minute ago. Go into the movie expecting to see some bad acting, bad writing, bad action, don't take it seriously and have a few friends along so you can MST3K the film. Then you'll feel like you hadn't wasted your money.",

            "content": "I don't even know where to begin listing everything that's wrong with this movie. I guess I should start with the fact that Kristen Kreuk is starring in a movie about a martial artist (although wu shu is more of a performance art than a martial art \u2013 but that's another story) despite the fact she is utterly incapable of moving gracefully. However, she can't take all of the blame for the poor fighting as the choreography was atrocious (people getting knocked out by being kicked in the leg?) and the multiple interrogations were intrinsically stupid (Chun Li asks question, bad guy resists, Chun Li punches bad guy and bends his arm funny, bad guys tells her everything \u2013 all in the course of ten seconds.) But when you put her together with Chris Klein, it creates a void of acting ability that would have made it impossible to buy into the plot if the plot were actually plausible. The only decent performances in the entire movie were by Neil McDonough as Bison and, surprisingly, Moon Bloodgood as a detective \u2013 but that's made moot by the fact that the writer has apparently never heard actual humans converse before, so the dialogue wouldn't be worth listening to even if it were delivered well. Plus, Bison's evil plan is to . . . build quality housing and sell it to the rich? He became head of an evil empire for that? Also, he wipes out other crime families to be able to do it and is doing it because he wants a better life for his daughter \u2013 if they hadn't repeatedly called him the head of a criminal organization, I might've thought he was just a decent hardworking businessman/superhero.It seems the entire movie was just filler until they could put the inevitable final confrontation on screen. And when she threw a fireball in that final confrontation, it was probably the worst special effect ever seen in a big-budget movie. The only way I could imagine anyone enjoying this movie is if they appreciate watching has-been actors ham-fist their way through a script that was written by someone with almost no knowledge of Street Fighter over the course of one booze-filled weekend.",

And although this is getting a little lame after Marvel adaptations, I also appreciate the attempt to furnish the chars with a darker, modern, casual look and attitude.But such a dim witted plot is unacceptable. The title is \"legend\", but all we get to see is a teenager depressed enough to leave all her wealthy and satisfactory life behind in order to pursue Gen (why? a mystery even Chun-Li doesn't know), listening to the psychedelic bablings of a street fortune teller.Purchasing slum lots illegally and opening them to luxury construction is quite an absurd line of business to choose for any SF boss. But killing all shareholders to acquire all shares? Very clever indeed...Side character development is none, so there s not much to talk about. The general flow implies that Balrog is a loyal scum, but why? to what extent? None hinted... Vega is supposed to be an ice cold mercenary, we should have felt his cold breath on the neck of our girl. Should have seen something like Sabretooth, Agt. Smith or Cromartie, but instead we have seen monkeyish Taboo getting his ass kicked by a teenage girl at the first round, without even being able to cut her! She hanged him like a flag for gods sake...Chris Klein and Moon Bloodgood duo is possibly the dumbest crime investigation partners you may ever see. They have no significant effect on the general plot whatsoever. But ironically enough, after their task-force is dismissed (thanks to Shadoloo pulling a few strings), the two gets to be able to assign six fully equipped vehicles carrying a SWAT team, for a midnight raid operation.I don't think any movie from any genre could reach the stupidity level of the first SF movie.

            "content": "Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun-Li was intended to be a reboot in place of a sequel. It was intended to be more faithful to the games unlike the previous movie, but derailed. The only connections to the game are that Balrog and Vega work for Bison, and that Bison is in charge of Shadaloo. But other than that, you can barely recognize these characters from the game as they do not sport their counterparts' costumes. In fact, we only see a small handful instead of a large ensemble of the characters from the game, leaving this movie flat and dull. I guess the writers could not accommodate them into the script without any real motivation. The worst part of this movie is Chun-Li's monologue, with a non-Asian (Oriental) actress playing her. A Chinese young girl grows up into a Latina woman and yet does not even don her counterpart's costume. (I think they took her video game counterpart's resemblance to a Caucasian too seriously.) This 'reboot' is a colossal letdown, and it hurts to watch every minute of it. If you remember Bison from the game, you will not recognize him in this reboot: he sports a business attire instead of a dictator general's attire from the game. Even the 1994 movie stays true, with the villain donning the suit throughout the flick. I have seen fight scenes in this reboot which are so unrealistic that it would be insulting to think that they would cause any real injury. Even on an algebraically larger budget (inflation not taken into consideration), this reboot fails largely on sticking to the game. However if inflation is taken into account, the 1994 movie is more expensive than the 2008 movie; thus no expenses were spared in the former. Street Fighter In 1994: Budget: $35 million Box office intake: >$99 millionIn 2014: rate of inflation = 8% Budget: $163,133,500 Box office intake: $461,434,757. 24Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li In 2008: Budget: $50 million Box office intake: >$12 millionIn 2014: Budget: $79,343,716 Box office intake: $19,042,491.88So where did they go wrong? How could they botch it up? The first movie was campy but more faithful to the game at the time, but this reboot was a dreadful hit-and-miss. I would not criticize the first movie, featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia, any more than this crud, as watching it proves my point. I bet the first movie will be treated as a superior live-action adaptation of a video game to the second one (although Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie remains the overall best adaptation of the video game). I can see why Street Fighter is regarded as Citizen Kane compared with Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.",

Balrog was horribly casted with Duncan. Vega is supposed to be like 7 feet tall.

Yet, in the true nature of being a Street Fighter fan, I set out to see it with optimism.The cast members in my opinion were hastily chosen. I suspect the choosing process may have revolved around what faces are pretty and readily recognizable. Though some actors have worked on other projects before, (American Pie, Smallville, Desperate Housewives, Terminator Salvation to name a few) realize that a decent cast with terrible writing a good movie does not make.The writing ugh... seriously? Aside from the main plot itself, which couldn't decide whether it was a heart felt family vengeance film, a B Rated action film, or a slaughter house caught on tape (Chun-li shooting someone in the chest point blank/ M. Bison boxing with a corpse), the banter between actors was less then imaginative.The actors themselves barely resembled the game players at all. Even giving Kristin Kreuk the time tested Chun-li hair buns, I never felt a connection with anyone. They were not the part, they were simply playing the part, and this can make the film seem flat, no matter how many fighting scenes or Special Effects you put in.Gen is a terminally ill assassin, who seeks to fight Akuma one last time before he dies. Did I also forget to mention HES OLD, possibly in his 70's, they didn't emphasize that enough. He felt more like Chun-li's BFF then a mentor and instructor.The sexual tension between Charlie Nash and C. Viper (Det. Maya Sunee) was also poorly thought out. The scene in the car as they are staking out Balrog could've been written by a 13 year old. I was also terribly disappointed when I heard the name 'Nash' as he walked out of the car, all I could think about was.. 'Where is his Vest, the glasses, his blond hair?' The one liners were also in poor taste. 'I want you to send Bison a message. Tell him the schoolgirl's grown up.', when he repeats it back to her, she's on the floor with 5-6 guns to her face.I would recommend this movie only to those that have a love for the franchise name 'Street Fighter' and want to say they have seen and played anything connected to that name.I give this film a D.

Kung-fu ensues, and Bison reveals that he moves so quickly gusts of wind herald his arrival. Bison and Balrog kidnap Chun-Li's father. Fast forward: wealthy Juliard grad and concert pianist Chun-Li decides that some old lady's translation of a vague ancient scroll she received in the mail is a convincing argument for her to abscond to Bangkok to live on the street while she searches for some guy named Gen. Eventually Gen becomes her master, we discover her father is still alive and the financial backbone of Bison's criminal organization, the most unlikely interpol agent you ever could cast (Klein) is bumping rap music while maintaining a healthy sexual interest in a Thai detective (Bloodgood) and doing no useful police work, Chun-Li lures a lesbian to a bathroom to beat information out of her, Vega appears briefly, and the diabolical plot of Bison to tear down the slums of Bangkok and develop townhouses is revealed. Two Hadouken-like energy blobs are fired off in total.Good: Kreuk surprisingly, hearing her say \"these streets\" in a wistful tone particularly satisfying in a bad>good way. Some decent kung-fu, hilariously awful four man gun-circle around Kreuk which she dispatches handily by break dancing, Klein being a total weirdo, Klein noticing the most obviously placed bomb/wireless-router with an L.E.D glued onto the front ever and jumping out of the buildings as it explodes.

Kreuk/Lesbian hench-woman share strange courting ritual that resembles bad dancing.Bad: It's all bad in some respect.Ugly: Use of screen-time, involvement of police, bad guy's endgame, casting in general (not Kreuk), lack of commitment to either realism or \"powers\" of street fighters: instead movie treads awkward middle ground, Bison's backstory, Vega's character, the Hadouken-like energy ball thingy, cops losing a tail due to imposed make-out/cover-up of surveillance by Klein, Bison manipulates well-connected businessmen and crime bosses like they are twelve and openly confronts police forces with armed security forces bearing the logo of his company. In short the plot.Strangely watchable if you can remain un-phased by all the terrible things that make this a terrible movie in order to appreciate kreuk kicking ass and Klein sucking it in their respective roles.",

            "content": "It is almost criminal that a director, given the fan base, premise, and interesting character backgrounds/moves in advance to filming can produce such a steaming pile. This man had four aces and traded them away because he didn't understand the basic rules to five card stud.What the hell was with the story? M. Bison with children? Who the hell wants to see that? Chun li's three minutes of training was almost as much of a joke as casting the dude from American Pie as an interpol agent..What happened to the tournament.. you know.. the idea behind the game? Even the two mortal kombat movies got that much right. (I know at least the casting director saw those movies because Lou from MK is Gen) Worse, what the hell was with the fighting scenes.. Where is M. Bison's moves from the game, he does slides in the game, not standard martial arts, and where the hell was his Special MOVE? Worse, when do you see M. Bison with a bamboo stick in the game.. NEVER! Why is Vega such a push over.. why are the effects on chun-li's fireball so corny! It didn't look anything like the game, which is a fast-paced single motion fireball of chi and which could've been done aptly with today's cgi.The only thing worthwhile in this movie is a) the soundtrack (which was fitting), b) the cinematography (which was mostly fitting, good high key lighting, good color combination, fitting aura.. even though the Mise en Scene lacked originality or thought.. docks and guns.. really?) The casting is stupid (nobody looks like they should, or ACTS like they should.) The writing is corny, pretentious, and lacks ANY of the INTERESTING characters from the Street Fighter Game. The directing/editing was brilliantly as talentless as all these other elements. Too many dissolves. Too many pointless scenes. The inciting incident was stupid, as well as the plot.I could go on forever. To a person who paid 85 dollars to get the Street Fighter Championship and Hyper Edition on Sega Genesis when it first dropped, this movie is not just a disappointment, but a mind-boggling failure.",

This movie is so bad, I don't know where to start.. The script is so cheesy and corny; some of the characters are using clich\u00e9s I just had to wonder out loud:\"did he just say that?\" and I mean\u0085 In this one scene, Chun-Li wanted to do a research on Shadaloo, she just go to an internet caf\u00e9, sits on the computer and framing evidence just pop up \u0085 what did she write\"stuff I can use against a worldwide organization trying to take over Bangkok\"? And the movie is filled with this stuff... Basically, the whole movie feels like it was written by a fourteen years old kid, and while some of the fighting scenes are cool, they are not enough to hold the movie.The characters are another lame part in this train wreck: Nash is far over-acting and too corny. They turned Vega, a handsome matador, into a ridiculously low-pitched ugly Taboo, that more or less, got bitch-owned by Chun Li. Gen looks vital than ever, having him AGED BACKWARDS. Bison (Neal McDonough) is now a business man that runs an international crime organization, and still has time to practice the martial arts and moves-that-should-kill-you-but-you-just-bounce-right-back-up. And of course... Chun-Li... I mean SHUT UP! She's just blubbering the entire thing...\"I was walking in Bangkok\" I KNOW, I CAN SEE THAT!! And she doesn't even look Chinese!! What happened to her accent?? And who faints after beating the crap out of a group of thugs? This version of Chun-Li has no credibility what so ever. Balrog was the only character I found convincing, I mean Michael Clarke Duncan was perfect for this role, even thou his character was pretty flat. Come to think about they all were (despite some good actors).In conclusion, if you like the game DON'T watch it. In fact, if you love YOURSELVES don't watch it. Unless you're studying film and want to avoid all possible clich\u00e9s, and see the definition for a bad film. And to sum it all up, when I finished watching this, i said to my friend \"well... I've seen worse\", so that's why I gave it 2 stars. (worse = Moral Kombat Annihilation. God, I feel sorry for Robin Shou)",

Further all of the actual fights involved felt just odd and 'uncool' looking. Chuns unnecessary backflips over rooftops were funny. Dialogue is remarkably cheesy and even folly and awkward at times. It is so poor and offending to me and surely other fans of the game who are still waiting to see a decent Street Fighter movie. This is even worse than that other one apart from the strong hint of more to come involving a \"Street Fighting Tournament with Ryu\".

The skinny-minnie at the center of this, Kristin Kreuk, isn't exactly the most engaging leading lady, but she's cute and looks convincing in her fights and stunts. Chris Klein (of 'American Pie' fame) tries to show some edge as an Interpol agent but is too bland to pull it off. Exotic-looking Moon Bloodgood (is that her real name?) is more interesting as his partner. Neal McDonough, with his steel-blue eyes and white hair, is always a scary-looking villain. As is the man-mountain known as Michael Clarke Duncan. Robin Shou, who played Liu Kang in those 'Mortal Kombat' movies so long ago, has aged into a credible martial arts guru who trains our heroine. Director Andrzej Bartkowiak did 'Romeo Must Die,' 'Exit Wounds,' 'Cradle 2 the Grave,' and the movie version of 'Doom,' so don't expect much. The story is nothing more than a revenge tale, with masked thugs dressed in black as generic fighting foes. The dialogue and voice-over narration is laughably arch.

Good production values and location shooting with the occasional action beat. Considering this is currently at number 76 of the 100 worst movies of all time on the IMDB list,  the low expectations do it some favors as well. Both Kristin Kreuk as the titular star and Moon Bloodgood as a detective are watchable and refreshing. In addition, Michael Clarke Duncan is clearly having fun and his enthusiasm is infectious. \n\nThe Bad: Entire doctoral thesis has been written about all the things wrong with the movie. Among the various sins child actors that look nothing like their adult counterparts (to the point of being a clearly different nationality), Chris Klein is awful and drags down every scene he is in, Chris Klein is in way too many scenes, and the villain makes no sense.\n\nThe Ugly: Here we get to the crux of the hatred for this unremarkable action film. Street Fighter fans. This is, by any measure, a terrible adaptation of the source material. Now I have to admit my eyes glaze over when rabid fandoms go on the attack because the backstory written to sell some toys and fill five minutes of a twenty-four-minute cartoon is treated as if Moses himself brought it down from the mountain. (I am looking your way Transformers fans), but Street Fighter fans have an understandable beef.\n\nAs source material goes Street Fighter is a pretty thin gruel. Unlike many modern video games, Street Fighter has more in common with Pac-Man or Donkey Kong than say The Last of Us. You have colorful characters and a fighting tournament outside of that a screenwriter pretty much has carte blanche to do what he wants with the story. Guess what this movie does not have? If you said a fighting tournament and colorful characters guess what you win a prize.\n\n\nIn Conclusion: Clearly, the screenwriter had a Tomb Raider script sitting in a dusty drawer (The film makes much more sense as a Tomb Raider reboot than a Street Fighter one) and got a call from his agent. Meh, one video game is the same as another just change Lara Croft to Chun Li and change the Irish real estate mogul into Bison and we are good to go. No need to change the plot about the cave of soul cleansing or the mysterious scroll or the heroine living alone in the mansion with servants after her father's disappearance. \n\n\nDecent B movie action film but in all fairness a horrible adaptation of the source material.",

He's the equivalent of Justin Chatwin as Goku in Dragonball Evolution (Another godawful cinema atrocity). Nothing makes sense, the plot is messy and incoherent. Kristin Kreuk as Chun-Li? atrocious. Chris Klein as Charlie Nash? Atrocious. Taboo as Vega? ATROCIOUS. Robin Shou as Gen, Neal McDonough as M. Bison, and Michael Duncan as Balrog are okay, however. Michael Dunkan as Balrog is the closest thing to being faithful to the video games. M. Bison as an Irish? Well, I know a lot about Street Fighter, and rumor has it he's either from Cambodia, Thailand, or Ireland. So don't mind the Irish nationality much. I also felt really bad for Neal McDonough. He tried his best to make his piece of garbage work, but he couldn't because the writing, the dialogue, the screenplay, everything was awful. Same case for Robin Shou. He tried his best, but his efforts hindered by incompetent amateurs in the film industry. \n\nVerdict: 1/10. F-. Atrocious. Godawful. It spits not only on the very practice and art of acting, but also on the greatest fighting game franchise ever created, Street Fighter. A disgrace.",

            "content": "Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li is a 2009 martial arts action thriller film directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak, written by Justin Marks, and starring Kristin Kreuk, Neal McDonough, Michael Clarke Duncan, Chris Klein, Moon Bloodgood, Robin Shou, Taboo, Josie Ho, and Elizaveta Kiryukhina. The film is based on Capcom's Street Fighter video games and is a reboot of the 1994 film Street Fighter.\n\nWhen she was younger, Chun-Li (Kristin Kreuk) witnesses the kidnapping of her father Xiang by the wealthy Irish crime lord M. Bison (Neal McDonough), the CEO of Shadaloo Headquarters. Years later, she goes into a quest for vengeance and becomes the famous crimefighter of the Street Fighter universe.\n\nI was introduced to the Street Fighter universe when I bought Street Fighter IV for the Xbox 360 a few years earlier, and I loved it. A wide variety of characters, fun gameplay, inventive fighting styles and powers... it was pure awesomeness. I also bought the updated version of the game, Super Street Fighter IV, and I loved that even more.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, I rented the 1994 live-action Street Fighter film from Family Video. The Steven E. de Souza-written and directed film starred Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile (tremendous miscast), Ming-Na Wen as Chun-Li, and Raul Julia as M. Bison (best part of the film). While very different from the games, I gotta admit, I had a bit of fun with this film. It's bad, yes, but I'd consider it a guilty pleasure. However, that film is Oscar-worthy cinema compared to this abomination.\n\nIf you thought the 1994 film was a terrible adaptation of the games, take a look at this shitstorm. This film rapes pretty much everything people loved about this franchise up the ass. Director Andrzej Bartkowiak (whose previous films I did enjoy) and screenwriter Justin Marks make absolutely no attempt to try to follow the games and that pisses me off.\n\nThe performances are awful, with the three exceptions being Neal McDonough, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Robin Shou. Despite his truly horrendous Irish accent, McDonough was trying very hard to make this generic, non-threatening bad guy work, and Shou was mildly entertaining as Gen. Sadly, Marks' dismally-penned script and Bartkowiak's tenuous, amazingly effortless direction prevent McDonough and Shou from being allowed to truly shine.\n\nMichael Clarke Duncan as Balrog is admittedly a delight. You can tell he's having a blast playing this guy. Not to mention, Balrog is the only character who bears any resemblance to his video game counterpart. Kristin Kreuk is atrocious as Chun-Li, which is a real shame, given that I loved her as Lana Lang on Smallville. Her line delivery is just abysmal and she shows hardly any genuine emotion.\n\nMoon Bloodgood is bland (although sexy) as Maya Sunee, who becomes Crimson Viper in the video games. Taboo as Vega is a tremendous miscast, one of the biggest in film history. However, the worst performance comes from Chris Klein as Charlie Nash (Blanka from the games). Klein looks beyond bored to be in this film and he sounds as if he's a petulant five-year-old doing a bad Christian Slater impersonation. Phenomenally awful.\n\nIf you watch this film expecting some bad-ass fight scenes, you'll be disappointed. The action scenes in this movie are pitiful. Andrzej Bartkowiak directs the action and fight scenes with no skill, effort, passion, or energy, and not to mention, they're very poorly edited by Derek G. Brechin and Niven Howie, and the choreography is nothing short of a joke. They even use Chun-Li's signature Spinning Bird Kick with truly deplorable results. However, the cinematography by Geoff Boyle is occasionally crisp, so there's that.\n\nThe whole affair is just a tired, generic mess all around. Stephen Endelman's musical score is insipid and flavorless beyond definition, there are countless martial arts and action film clich\u00e9s, and there's not even a lick of originality and creativity to be found. The visual effects are spectacularly horrible. There's one bit five minutes into the movie where Chun-Li's father attacks a guy by using a bottle of wine as a water pistol, with the wine being as clear as water. The CGI for the wine is just... blecch. I mean, dear God.\n\nJustin Marks' screenplay is reprehensible. Hardly any character development, really god-awful dialogue, and a story so redundant, outrageously ridiculous, and nonsensical you'll want to pull your hair out. Not to mention, the tone is completely wrong. It takes itself so goddamn seriously. What dumb-ass wanted a dark, gritty, more realistic version of Street Fighter? What the fuck.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 1/10\n\nStreet Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li is bar none one of the worst video game movies ever made. Holy mother of God was this terrible. Bad writing, bad acting, bad action, bad story, bad characters, bad adaptation, bad reboot, bad movie. The 1994 film may not have been good, but hey, at least it was fun. This, however, is not enjoyable in the slightest. Fuck this movie and never, ever watch it.",

This got a lot of bad reviews and I am stumped on why. I thought it had a a good story and yeah the acting wasn't perfect but it still was a fun and action packed movie. It had characters from the video game so that was a plus. I did think though that at times Chris Klein was annoying and yes he does not act that good but I could not let one person ruin it for me because I was really enjoying it. Michael Clark Duncan was in this movie too. So sad to hear about his passing. There was a lot of good action and the story was entertaining so I thought this movie was really good.",

            "content": "Ahhhh, takes me back to my secondary school lunch breaks where me and my friends used to sneak off and play 'Street Fighter' for half an hour on the Mega Drive. Sorry to see that not many of the characters from the original video game have made an appearance in this film though, probably because the majority of it is based around Chun Li as the title suggests. It's basically about her fight to rescue her father, who was kidnapped by the big boss himself, Major Bison - and what a formidable baddy he is too, it always took me hours to beat him up on the final stages of the game! Along the way, there are several battles and Kung fu style fight scenes as you would expect, which to their credit attempt to mirror the classic attributes of their individual game characters. There are also a number of not so combative cast members who I presume have been employed to boost ratings I.e. Chris Klein from American Pie, Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas, and the late Michael Clarke Duncan, who performs the very fitting character of Balrog, a big meathead boxer. It's good harmless fun, but probably not recommendable if you are genuinely after a quality Kung fu film and have no prior knowledge of the video game. Even despite my familiarity with it, it's still quite a disappointment to see such an absence of classic characters, plus the key battles were all a bit of an anticlimax as some of the so called invincibles were beaten after just a few hits, including the big man Bison himself! I guess when you employ non-combat actors to perform kick-ass roles, their fight scenes are always going to be a tad limiting though! Still, I'll always love bashing away aimlessly at the control pad in a game of 'Street Fighter', just won't ever be as crazy about this movie!",

            "content": "This movie was so bad that I have to give the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Oscars for being a success and yet not getting much credit. The story was boring, there were rarely any action scenes in it and when there were any, they looked like they were choreographed by an 8-year old, even the montage. The music wasn't even that catchy, the scenes felt like they had been ripped off another movie and the actors we like are wasted and the ones we don't should be doomed. While the games focused on Ryu and Ken and sort of Chun-Li because she was the lead actress in the games, this movie focuses heavily on her only as the title says so. Kristin Kreuk looks nothing like Chun-Li and whenever she does, she's either not fighting or not wearing her blue outfit and whenever she does fight, it doesn't look the least bit realistic infact all the stunt choreography/ fight scenes are horrible and there's only like 3 or five of them including a training montage so that we can build up to the big vengeful climatic battle.  In this movie, Chun-Li's a pianist which is an even worst origin than a reporter who's seeking revenge on M.Bison because they captured her parents well at least they got that right. There is one scene where I thought she actually looked like Chun-Li and she was doing this mystical ball kind of thing that her master taught him and yet she wasn't wearing her blue costume and her hair was in a pony tail which is what killed it off. Ming-Na Wen who voiced Mulan played Chun-Li in the 1994 version looked more like Chun-Li and she didn't even need the blue outfit. Nash played by Oz from American Pie is supposed to be Guile's friend or brother but has turned into one of the most annoying characters in video game history. What happened to the goody-goody singing sportsman Chris Fucking Ostriecher from American Pie? He's now turned into total annoyance but wait, Tara Reid being a cliche scientist in Alone In The Dark is much worst. He is the lead actor and he doesn't do jack shit other than spew annoying single-dialogues and be little-useful in the climax with one pistol again that killed it off. Neal McDonough who plays M.Bison can't even feel Raul Julia's shoes. Do you know what Raul had he had to go through before when he got the role of M.Bison? It was requested by his children so he chose it as his last movie ever plus he even died before the film's release and so the film was dedicated to him. That was a lot of hard work put into one man in one movie. Here it's the total opposite. At least that movie got his origins right, In this he's a fucking businessman! He doesn't even look like M.Bison; Instead he looks like Tony Stark's stepfather. Robin Shou who played Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat plays Chun-Li's master Gen and that's another talent wasted. Robin, you're better off as Liu Kang. Go back to Mortal Kombat, you're better off there and don't even bother if the special effects in MK2 are one of the worst, you can survive that movie, but you can't survive this. Balrog isn't too bad as he's played by Michael Clarke Duncan and to be honest and fair, he was the only enjoyable character in this movie. He does some pretty crazy street gangster black guy's shit LIKE A STREET FIGHTER WOULD DO! Taboo from The Black Eyed Peas plays Vega and rarely does anything and is even more useless than Nash. Vega  is one of the coolest characters out there because of his wolverine-like claws and instead gets taken out like a bitch the second time we see him. The first time we see him, he's in action killing M.Bison's businessmen but it takes place off-screen in fact that's another talent being wasted. Moon Bloodgood plays the Crimson Viper and she's hot but she does nothing Crimson Viper-related which is kind of a shame so you can see how bad this movie is. It's broken, lame, annoying, depressing, tiring, childhood-damaging, boring, ridiculous, severely-miscasted, terrible, IT'S JUST BAD! Street Fighter: The Legend Of Chun Li gets a 3/10.",

If anything to say the one sided fight between Van Damme and Raul Julia in the first adaptation was a better fight than most of these fights. And turning Bison from a wacky cape wearing psychotic dictator super villian into a irish blond haired psychotic gangster with streaks of misogny isn't helping. And  Ming-Na had better charisma than Kreuk as Chun-Li, plus she was more asian  than Kreuk. And by the way Chris Klein probably destroyed his career with this movie, giving one of the baddest performances i've seen since Battlefield Earth.

The story had a lot of plot holes and climax events that didn't make sense... having you question why they were doing what they were doing and what the hell for? Taboo of Black Eyed Peas fame, played the role of Vega, which if anyone ever played the Street Fighter games would know that vega is a beautiful, blonde, vain, prick. Taboo has a face only a mother could love. There a weird lesbian club scene, chinese actors with broken english and bad wigs, and a villian with an irish accent that goes in and out. If you get interested in seeing a street fighter movie, just rent the 1994 Jean Claude Van Dame version. This movie was just bad.... yeesh.",

            "content": "This is why a film should not be adapted from a video game. The film is a sequel to another video-game adaptation called Street Fighter, that being said we know that we are heading towards a disaster. The plot of this film is about Chun-Li a young pianist whose father is kidnapped by a dude named Bison. As Chun-Li grows she realizes who are the men whom captured his father and now she must learn martial arts to hunt down the men whom took a way his father. Chun-Li goes to Bangkok and finds how much terrible the citizens are living with Bison's Iron Fist. \r\nThe film is freaking terrible. Is not that there is a lot of action and little story, is that the action sequences are poor, dull and surprisingly boring. There's a scene in this movie in which the girl jumps from one house to another and you can clearly see the cable on top of her. None of the fight scenes made me say wow except at the climax when she breaks the neck of a person. That is it! Another scene is with Chun-Li fighting against another woman (whom supposedly is one of the greatest fighters in the video game) and Chun-Li only grabs her hair for like 5 seconds and instantly the lady gives up. There is no hype in this movie everything in this movie goes to fast or happens absolutely nothing. \r\nThe movie is short and they did something terrible with the pace. The film went just too fast for example that dad is fighting a couple of bad guys, they look really strong. Then Mr. Bison comes in, which looks as the weakest of all the bad guys, and the father instantly gives up. With no struggle at all, just like that he gives up. We don't see Mr. Bison fight until the end of the movie and he is supposed to be the Big Bad Boss of this entire movie but he isn't. He is not even menacing, he tells the protagonist: \"You will not stop me.\" In the most hideous, dullest way I have ever seen in my entire life.  \r\nThe problem with video-game films is that they look like video-games and we are not here to waste our money to watch video-games, we are here to watch movies and this is not a movie. Films should have characters, a plot, cool action sequences but this did not buy anything that had in this movie. The screenplay is just terrible up to the point you want to vomit. It did not explain everything what was going on and you felt completely alienated. Another problem with video-game films is that there's nothing fresh in them. Absolutely nothing. I mean is like I was watching another dumb and pathetic kung-fu movie. \r\nWhat I like about this film is that it meet with my expectations. I thought this movie was going to be bad and it was a bad movie. What I like about this movie is that it had a narrator so that we don't get lost while watching this movie. The film has a story is about justice, about finding your father and don't let nothing stand in your way. This film could have been much better. \r\nThis film was directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak whom most of his films are about action movies. So don't expect to see a good film about this guy. He seriously need to get better on his movies, even do he is more of a cinematographer than a director. The directing was this film was really terrible up to the point that makes you want to leave the film. \r\nI would recommend this movie to people that love video-game films because it lacks everything else. I mean if you like films with dull and boring action sequences then this is the film for you guys because this film really bored me to death.",

But honestly, everyone is comparing movies against videogames here. In a game you mash all those buttons, make combo hits, fatalities to take down the enemy. The story is usually ignored and 4 out of 5 people doesn't care about story in a game. In movie i want to know about the characters, their origins. If you put a 90 minute long fighting scene in a movie, there will be no difference between a game and a movie. I think this movie was pretty cool and exciting and the reason that many people disliked this was that they want to see meaningless fighting scenes, 10 punches + 3 kicks per second... I am a nerd too, I like marvel, dc, mortal kombat (not so much of a Street Fighter fan actually i always find that game rather dull) but honestly i want to see a background for characters in movies; not a 90 minute full with brawling and gun shooting. The only reason that i gave 9 instead of 10 was that interpol officers kinda stood outside of movie and couldn't participate that much. They should were either totally removed or used more often in film. I strongly suggest this movie to all of you who are interested\u00e2",

How hard can it be to shoot a concert pianist? Very hard, as it turns out; like in the nightclub scene, where the piano player does a handstand and kicks the guns out of four shooters' hands by virtue of a fluid pirouetting motion. Don't mess with Hong Kong via San Francisco, with a matriculating stint in New York, somewhere in the timeline; don't mess with a Julliard grad. Some of them know Wushu. Rachmaninoff isn't just for girly girls. Concert pianist/martial arts expert: that's a pretty absurd notion of being multi-talented, but for a film like \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li\", musicianship serves as shorthand for character development. Unfortunately, the girl's piano career is subordinated as a tangent, in favor of her other, more kinetic pursuit. When Chun-li(Kristin Kreuk) goes underground in Thailand, the concert pianist explains that she has to forget her past, in order to become one with Bangkok. How convenient for the film's cross-purposes. Instead of being one of the common people(like the slumming rich girl in Pulp's \"Common People\": Chun-li's rich, too; she says goodbye to her servants before going \"Bangkok Forgetful\"), Chun-li could have stayed off the streets by playing the piano in some dive(and evoke Francois Truffaut's \"Tirez sur le pianiste\"). But that won't do; after all, \"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-li\" has no real aspirations of being a proper movie. It's pleased as punch with its essentiality of cheesy and uninspired fight sequences under the adulterated facade of girl power. Having the accomplished girl shed her identity just makes it easier for the film to ply its patriarchial bent. Sure, Chun-li kicks ass, but she's under the tutelage of a man. How do you say \"To Sir With Love\" in Mandarin? So the film takes away her best asset: her fingers. For the film's target audience, a woman who supports herself by playing the piano for tip money may constitute the rumblings of a chick flick.",
