            "content": "This DTV sequel to Eli Roth's film debut sees the flesh-eating virus spread due to the incompetence of Deputy Winston. The film opens with a badly infected Paul waking up in the river where Winston dumped him at the end of the original. He stumbles up to the highway and is killed almost immediately when a passing school bus splatters him across the pavement. The end of the infection? Hell no. The river water is being used by a bottled water company, and they have a shipment heading to a nearby town's high school prom.Director Ti West reportedly wanted this to receive an Alan Smithee credit after the studio interfered and took certain things in a different direction, though he didn't get his wish. I'm an unabashed fan of Roth's film, but this really felt nothing at all like the original. Even the Deputy Winston scenes felt a bit different in tone, the sequence where he's talking to the water company's night watchman notwithstandin. The aforementioned scene and it's climax cracked me up, but Winston's character wasn't written as amusingly as he was in the first film. Aside from seeing Winston again, the main aspect of interest here was seeing two guys (Noah Segan and Marc Senter) who played memorable psychos in two other genre titles (Deadgirl and The Lost, respectively) as rivals in this. Segan in particular seems to be playing the exact part his Deadgirl co-star played in that film.Anyway, there didn't seem to be much continuity between the effects of the virus in the original and what we see in this one. There is some pretty nasty and over-the-top stuff, though. Most characters were over-the-top as well. I wish the film had spent more time with Lindsey Axelsson (Sandy, the prom queen). She was yummy and had one of the film's more amusing moments. She didn't even get an on screen death scene! The last ten or so minutes with the strip club feel very tacked on, but I guess that makes sense, as West said the producers did the ending their way. I also didn't like the final cartoon bit in the least, not to say that the opening cartoon segment was any great shakes itself.If you like pure splat-stick with not much sense involved, you might enjoy this on some level. At one point, with chaos erupting around them, two teens continue making out even after they vomited blood into each other's mouths. That pretty much says it all. I would love to see the original cut, but doubt LG will release it. It took them forever to release the DC of the first.",

            "content": "Having seen the first Cabin Fever, which I really liked (it showcased Eli Roths talent for sick and twisted horror comedy, so to speak), I kinda had hoped this could be better. But even before watching the movie, I heard the \"director\" Ti West, distancing himself from this movie (at a Festival, where I didn't have another option/movie to choose from, that's why I chose to watch this anyway, despite the warning)!!! He didn't like the movie and he didn't cut it together (there are also some additional scenes shot and edited into the movie, especially the ending) and he also said, that people might like it or hate it, but either way, he is not responsible for what people will think of the movie ...Having said that, I for once thought it was dreadful. Almost every \"funny\" line doesn't work, the chemistry between the two best friends is off, not to mention that the American Pie style thing just doesn't work. Unfortunately the main character isn't as good in his role as he could have been (you might have seen him in \"Dead Girl\" where he is phenomenal). There is also a side story that is really bad (it's supposed to be funny, but it just isn't).Some gory moments and a few actually not that bad one liners can't save this mess of a movie. There are movies out there, that are worse, but this still has got quite a few things wrong. If you want to see a good Ti West movie, watch his House of the Devil instead ...",

            "content": "An infected guy from part I crawls out of a water treatment plant, stumbles through the woods, makes it to a road only to be aerosolized when he's hit by a school bus. The world's most incompetent sheriff deputy arrives on scene and the tells the bus drive he just hit a moose. What a great way to start the movie! But things go way downhill from there.Meanwhile, infected water is distributed all over the place. The movie focuses on what happens at a high school...during prom day...of course. Hollywood just can't make a movie about high school on any day other than prom.Our main cast is a nice guy and his heavy and horny sidekick. Nice guy is bullied by some bad guy over a girl. Slowly the infection spreads at school, with blisters being the first sign. Sidekick hooks up with an infected girl in a bathroom stall. Nice guy doesn't have a date for prom so he decides not to go until sidekick convinces him to.The punch at the prom is made with infected water and the disgruntled and infected janitor urinates in it so in time for prom dance every one starts projectile vomiting blood.Somehow the deputy realizes what is going on, rushes to the water plant only to encounter some secret army taking control. This army also reaches the high school, locks it up and executes everyone, but our heroes who will try to find a way out.Cabin Fever 2, subtitled \"Spring Fever\" for no good reason whatsoever, has nothing to do with the original, there isn't even a cabin. And IMDb quotes that there were re-shoots and re-editing because of producer-director disagreements. It is obvious in Cabin Fever 2 that something wasn't right behind the camera. The movie just doesn't work, there is plenty of story missing, characters that serve no purpose, like the deputy, what happens with him? The ending of the movie is told in...animation!? But there are also problems with casting. The nemesis is very well cast, the sidekick is alright, too. But our main guy and his girl are dull and the girl unattractive. Before infection starts, the pace of the movie is atrocious as we are introduced to the characters. The prom itself is poorly filmed, dark, and unoriginal.Despite all the movie's shortcomings, I'm compelled to give it a better rating. The crew went places few dare these days when making a horror movies. Most are concerned with getting that PG-13 rating and offending no one. Cabin Fever 2 aims to be extreme in violence, gore, disgusting scenes. It has a bit of nudity and sexual situations, too. This movie was done in the right spirit, but somewhere something went wrong.",

            "content": "In Springfield, Paul contaminates the supply of bottled water of the Down Home Water to the local high-school on the day of the prom. Alex (Rusty Kelley) convinces his friend Jonathan (Noah Segan), who has a crush on Cassie (Alexi Wasser) and is bullied by a school mate, to go to the prom. However, the contaminated water spreads a deadly flesh-eating virus among the students. \"Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever\" is a weak sequel, with a bad development of the plot and characters, gross and unpleasant. It seems that the writer was in a hurry to finish his work and was not careful with the story; or maybe Ti West was only interested in gore and special effects and used a \"heavy hand\" and the black humor never works. In the end, this rip-off \"Carrie\" with \"Outbreak\" (or any other movie of virus outbreak) is only nasty and not funny. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): \"Cabana do Inferno 2\" (\"Cabin of the Hell 2\")",

            "content": "...I'm a gorehound!Look...it's pretty obvious after watching part 2 that Ti West had multiple options:\nfollow Roth's vision and develop a decent movie, orpush the boundaries and make a grotesque, blood-riddled gore circus.He very much went for the latter. Indeed, many of the reviews here aren't wrong. What makes the difference for me is that in my opinion, TW did what he did intentionally, passing on the the opportunity to craft a fully cohesive part 2 in exchange for putting out the most vile and disgusting sequel he could, with the money he had. What does that mean? Well,\nthe acting is not superb but it's at least average,the script is likely the least developed part of the flickyou get EXACTLY what he intended, which is likely why the ending is what it is, and the entire movie is barely more than 80 minutes.Look...I could be wrong, but the purpose of CF2 is it not to take a prestigious ranking in the lexicon of horror cinema. It's GORE! There's really no other reason for its pervasive and continuous use and lack of other characteristics. That being the case, I enjoyed it! I didn't pick at the myriad of plot holes or script issues, or logically false issue that popped up, but enjoyed it for what it is...or a gorefest. Granted, I would have liked a better all around movie, but not at the expense of what he put out. There's just not enough straight-up gore flicks anymore, so I appreciated the graphic nature of the film.It is worth noting that the fx are very well done. All the gore is done by way of practical fx, which is preferable to CGI. The largest part of the budget obviously went to the fx and it is noticeable.All these meanderings are just my opinion, which means zilch, but for my purposes, being the gorehound I am, I enjoyed the flick. It's certainly not for the squeamish.",

            "content": "To be honest, I didn't want to review this flick for a number of reasons. One of which being that Cabin Fever is one of my favorite films. Another reason being that Ti West has become one of my favorite genre directors. I remember becoming stoked the day I read that Ti West was taking on a sequel to Eli Roth's Cabin Fever, then all the delays and production problems, and reading that West had all but disowned the film, My anticipation turned to disappointment. The end result turned out to be much better than expected, but still felt incomplete.Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever spreads the infection from a cabin in the woods, to a nearby high-school prom. With a solid performance by all players involved, some superbly fitting music, and well done gross-out effects, Cabin Fever 2 is a worthy watch for anyone into indie splatter comedies.One of the biggest problems with Cabin Fever 2 is that Ti West wasn't available for the editing process. Sure, 90 percent of the footage that he shot was used,(and it shows) But if a director isn't there for the editing process of a film, It's not going to turn out the way it was intended. The film feels incomplete, as the producers decided to shoot an entirely different 6 minute ending sequence that feels so out of place, that if it didn't contain one of the early characters, you'd thing you were watching a completely different movie. Just as the film picks up, it's brought to a complete halt by this weird, unsuited ending. The ending actually made me feel as if the film had no ending at all. Giuseppe Andrews puts in an amazing performance as he always does, but his character isn't given the depth that he deserves.Despite it's problems, Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever is definitely worth the watch. It has one of the best opening sequences in b-movie history, and you can tell by the cinematography that Ti West not only knows his stuff, but has a deep love for the genre. I wish they would have given him creative freedom, as I feel this would become a cult classic, but as it stands, we're left with a competent, gory, fun romp at the prom, with a bloodbath that makes \"Carrie\" look like Babe: Pig in the city.http://liberaldead.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Wow, this movie sucked. It totally blew! It is possibly one of the worst sequels ever made! Now the first Cabin Fever movie was adequate, nothing to get all excited about, but this movie, this 'sequel', it was like watching your will to live fading away right in front of your eyes.THE GOOD PART? Well the movie had a couple of scenes that will make you cringe in pain or disgust. It had fairly good gore make-up (though only a few places).THE BAD PART? Horrible acting all throughout the movie, except by Noah Segan. The storyline was a weak spin off from the first Cabin Fever movie. The only thing it had in common was the party-happy police officer and the lake with the corpse in it - pretty weak basis for a follow-up story. The effects when the projectile vomiting started! Oh my god, that was just pathetic. Even a blind person would be able to see that it clearly was ejected from some contraction placed at the side of the open mouth and out of camera view. It looked so pathetically fake.THE BEST PART? The movie ended (and hopefully will not spawn a second follow-up movie).THE WORST PART? That someone thought this would make a good sequel to a mediocre horror movie from back in 2002.If you plan to watch this movie, please forget all about having seen the first Cabin Fever movie, and just watch this for what it is, a crappy low-budget horror movie rip-off. Though the first Cabin Fever was just a lukewarm experience, this 'sequel' was really a low blow to the gut.",

            "content": "Whereas 2003's Cabin Fever at least tried to be a normal horror film, albeit using a hundred movie references, Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever is a dark-comedy/horror/homage onslaught.And even though Part 2 takes off immediately after the conclusion of its origin story and it carries the virus planted to new heights, it's a sequel in name only. I.E. there's no cabin here and the only woods are in the background this time.Does this make the movie any less entertaining? By no means, but as I said with the first one (in my review,) you really, REALLY have to be a member of the 1970s and 1980s horror fan club. Namely with movies like Creepshow, Carrie, Prom Night and especially Peter Jackson's Dead Alive. (By the way, only naming 4 doesn't equate to the hundreds this horror comedy plays homage to.) Sure the movie's silly \u2013 they don't even bother to cover up the vomiting blood is coming from the side of the victim's mouth vs. throat, it's certainly over-the-top and virtually had nothing to do with the first movie, aside from the virus, but it's enjoyable and fun. AGAIN \u2013 for those select fans of the above mentioned movies. I can't see this having any appeal for any other group of fans.After the movie begins with a school bus hitting an infected human, setting the loony deputy from Part 1 into an actual investigation, it thrusts you into an animated opening credit scene. To be bluntly honest, as a fan of said movie and genres, this creeps the hell out of me. Growing up, any horror film featuring this, just as an example, as I am sure there are more, Creepshow and Frogs, always scared me the most. So, this particular homage (not portrayed in Part 1) already hooked me. (On a side note, for those who will see this, I loved the fact they used red for the blood, yet, it's obvious that was just for our benefit \u2013 it was never red in live-action.) The animation also serves the purpose of setting up the premise: highly infected water is being inadvertently bottled and shipped to a local high school, which of course is on the same day as the Prom. Enter in two best buds: John (Segan) and Alex (Kelley,) both sadly in love with the two girls they can't have and in turn they vow not to attend the prom later.All the while, the film follows the virus closely as victim after victim set themselves up to be sick later (for those who already know how bad things are about to get, i.e. anyone who's viewed the first film.) This includes Alex who has bathroom sex with a girl who has no business infecting someone with what she had (cold sore virus, maybe?) with or without the movie's main bug, nor should the eternally horny Alex agree. At any rate without any sort of spoiler alert, this seals his fate.The movie actually does a good job of transfixing on multiple story lines, groups of kids and the typical group of secret militants who are trying to contain the virus. Unfortunately, it contains a lot of offensive behavior along the way, all for laughs, of course. But, it's rarely funny when movies continually say it's okay to be homophobic or good to poke fun at heavier set people. Nevertheless, the movie's not trying to act moral in anyway, it's merely an excuse to show a lot of blood, guts, humor and homage.I truly believe everyone on set had a good time. It shows. They were all involved and produced a movie in today's time that translate to horror of decades past.So, the movie continues, the boys, John and Alex end up at the prom (duh) and the military shows up. This is another aspect I liked \u2013 the big and extremely obvious prom-bloodbath (seriously, that cannot be a spoiler) wasn't the finale/climax as it was set up to be. You have so much more. More blood, tension, nudity and again, what scares me \u2013 another cartoon.Honestly, I would recommend this movie for those looking for a fun, gory and no-brainer horror film. For being direct-to-video, it actually had good production value, decent acting, nicely paced scenes and an enjoyable roller-coaster ride of suspense. Was it better than #1? I would say they were equal and separate as they are two completely different movies with a thin line connecting them.You can watch both in one night, like I did, but you might need to take a break from horror, as I will..for a long time. Enough gore is enough for awhile.(Okay, not too long. I still have the remake, A Nightmare on Elm Street to see next month\u0085it is my favorite horror series of all time, after all.)",

A sequel to Eli Roth's semi-successful yucky horror yarn, it turns out to be a film for the immature, made by the immature, with Roth wisely nowhere in sight.The opening animated credits alerted me to the fact that something was wrong, as if they can't afford to shoot this stuff in live action, then why bother in the first place? Then we move into a typical high school scenario, complete with moronic expletive-filled dialogue that sounds as though it was scribbled on a beermat before being typed up on the computer.Inevitably the only horror in the thing comes from the various gore effects, which are pretty pitiful. In order to counteract this, there's a ton of lowbrow comedy (not my cup of tea), over the top performances and characters, and a handful of truly gross-out moments (such as a fat woman dissolving in a swimming pool) in order to provoke a reaction from the viewer. It's all a mess - a huge mess - and it makes for a crashing bore of a movie.",

            "content": "Back in the days of 2002, newcomer horror director Eli Roth came into town and we didn't know what hit us when he brought Cabin Fever into Hollywood and onto our big screens. I remember seeing the movie in the theater and it freaked me the heck out, the characters were horrible but the story was good and the gore was just overflowing. There was a scene where like Psycho kept you out of the showers, this scene would make you think twice about shaving your legs. Despite the flaws, I think the film overall worked. However, not everyone felt that way, if you liked the film or hated it, you have to admit though it still grossed you out. Naturally Hollywood looked at the success it did have and brought on the sequel\u0085direct to DVD. Usually that's not good, it's lower budget, a lousy script and really bad actors, but I still wanted to give the film a fair chance. However, because the first film grossed audiences out, that's what this movie focused on and it ended up puking on it's own blood.The creek Paul was lying in from the first film was connected to a bottled-water company and the infected water was distributed to the local high school. John, a senior at the high school, is deciding whether to go to prom with his long-time crush Cassie or stay home. John asks Cassie to go to prom but she refuses. Meanwhile, Winston is at a restaurant where a worker from the bottled-water company dies from the infection. He then realizes the creek got heavily contaminated and goes to the water plant to tell the officials that the water is contaminated. At the high school the infection begins to spread slowly. Alex is disappointed that Liz didn't come, while John gets into a fight with Cassie's boyfriend Marc. The principal then kicks John out. Cassie follows him and John confesses his love to her. Fredricka dies in the pool from the infection and Rick is killed when he drowns after hitting his head on the bottom of the pool. CCD then force the two back into the school. The CCD locks all of the main exits from the school and kill the principal when he demands to know what is going on. The infection then begins to kill the students in the gym and now it's a real party for our three survivors to get out alive.Like I mentioned before the flaw with the first Cabin Fever is the characters, they were all horrible in some way or another. I can understand so you don't have much of a connection when they die, but still if you're to have any realism you should make at least one of the characters likable. One of the most obnoxious characters in the film was the deputy party man who for some reason is more like Doofy from Scary Movie and we are supposed to take him like a real man on the force? Sadly, he is back to continue with his stupidity and it wasn't even funny in a silly way, I don't know what about this guy screamed that he could carry a movie. Plus, what was with the saliva kiss between the two main characters? Was that for just a cheap gross out? The \"triangle\" between the characters was a cheap ploy to keep the movie going. I think with the way they were going, why not just have a group of people in front of the camera puking on each other? Oh, wait, that's what they did. The movie had some major potential with it's story, prom night is a great setting for a horror movie since it's the greatest night in senior year. However once again since the characters are horrible, I don't care wither they die, meaning they're just bait and meant for a cool kill. The story was also horrible, so there was really no saving this film. Eli Roth may not have a knack for writing, but at least he still knows how to carry a movie and knows how to give the audience a decent enough scare. Skip this movie, it's just bad.1/10",

If this will ever come out on DVD or even gets into cinemas, trust me and avoid it, even if you, like me, really liked the first one.",

I found that to be far from the case. The movie isn't worthy of being classed as B status. Performances are bad. Script almost non-existent. A thin plot exists to move the film from one gross-out scene to another. I could find nothing that would move me to recommend this film. How anyone could find something funny in this production is beyond me. It is one sick, twisted film whose only goal is to attempt to sicken the audience or desensitize viewers to the reality of tragedy in the real world. Perhaps I'm being a bit too philosophical for such low-brow \"entertainment\", but there is nothing redemptive about this feature. Cheap special effects, constant profanity, unlikeable characters (especially the deputy who cares only about himself). Whereas Cabin Fever displayed some originality, this sequel exists merely to cash in on its predecessor's name and reputation. There's no tension or sense of \"something worse coming\" that was present in the original. The movie itself is only about 72 minutes, followed by a 5 minute tangential story, which is itself followed by a crudely drawn cartoon of 2 or 3 minutes; filler, simply filler. There are better ways to waste 80 minutes.",

            "content": "Like a much maligned red haired stepchild, I couldn't help but rush to the defense of this wonderfully original and frighteningly gory sequel to Cabin Fever. The original, while a little overrated, has long since graced the front of my horror section display and continue to maintain a semi-annual viewing...even if some parts are skipped over. I had such low expectations for this movie until a few reviews poured in and shocked to find they were for the most part positive. This is beyond any normal run-of-the-mill successor and easily stands on its own as a caricature portrayal of high school angst, bullies, love crushed puppy romance, and even a fat chick who gets hers in the end (no pun intended). The beauty of this movie is that the grimy slimy disgusting bits so perfectly mirror the supporting casts and the movie's ability to hop and skip from one shocking, funny, bloody snapshot to the next. Now I am not a fan of B-horror, but this could very well convert the strongest objector. Cabin Fever 2 does do away quickly with the plot of the first movie, but thankfully retains some threads of continuity, not the least of which is Winston. With some of the funniest lines and a slightly larger role, Winston delivers his quirky, party monster deputy doggishness with the confidence and glee of only a seasoned performer. He knows we love him and basks in the light as long as it shines on him. We have hair lipped teachers, full frontal absurdity, body parts, fat chicks, fat dudes, nerds, jocks, you name it. The best attribute though is the loving nods to horror of old including Carrie, Texas Chainsaw, and even Kill Bill. I have to say, I loved every minute and like the movie, once you succumb to drinking the punch, you're in for a great ride!!!! Maddis 8/10.",

Can a select few make it out of the school in time, or will the shady government people lock it down to stop the spreading.Cabin Fever 2 is one of those unneeded sequels that dry up the well far too soon. The additional fact that the director wanted to disown the film doesn't help either. For what the film does right, it does 12 things wrong. Even by direct to DVD standards this movie fails to deliver. Instead of trying to comprehend what I just saw, I'll just go through the pros and cons.Pro:The film showcases some really great gore scenes, a few times I was squirming and I've seen some sick movies. Whether it be trying to super glue your finger nail back on, having puss ooze out of your penis, or smashing a guys face to mush with a fire extinguisher. Cabin Fever 2 ups the ante in terms of gore. It makes a lot of horror films seem like kids play. I give them props for that, especially in this day in age where it is extremely hard to get people to feel grossed out. Cons:Wow, at the cons already.The film doesn't feel like it follows the continuity of the first. Specifically for the infection. In the first, it dealt with the victim's skin ripping off. We start off with continuing the story of the first, somewhat. We see Rider Strong (great porn name) exit the river. He runs through the woods looking for help. Boom, get hits by a bus. Blood and guts everywhere. 2 minute scene and he gets top billing. Anyways, we get introduced to a bunch of character who are not interesting and makes you feel like you'd have more fun watching paint dry. It doesn't help that their dialogue makes your ears bleed. Non of them have any kind of charisma, nor do I see any kind of future in their careers. Thus, we couldn't give a crap if any of them make it out alive. They drink the infected water and get the infection. Yet it seems like it's different. They spit of blood left right and centre, but with the one exception of the man at the bar, who does rip his skin off. Everyone else coughs off blood and then dies. Boring and inconsistent. The one character who also returns is the cop, yet he does nothing. We have two characters who try to flee at the end and one gets caught, but we never see what happens with him. The last ten minutes are so are so anticlimactic that it hurts. It just drags itself out and it is painful. The comedy bits do not work and the one liners suck. Cabin Fever 2 is pretty bland and boring. Again, the gore effects are great, but the rest of the film is garbage. They have a special feature on the DVD that gives you all the gory bits, I'd suggest watching that rather than the film.",

I already had my problems with the strange mix of comedy and seriousness in Part 1 but Spring Fever is even worse in that department. What was the idea with the cartoon sequences? They feel incredibly squeezed in, especially at the end. And thats the problem with a lot of the editing of this movie... its bad! Not only they use circle wipes like in an amateur movie but there is sequences (like the beginning of the prom collage on music) that are so randomly and badly edited that it hurts.You get some nice gore, Spring Fever definitely tops Part 1 in this department. Obviously they went for the gross out factor, focusing on loads of teens puking blood, fat chicks melting in the pool and pustulated genitals and titties. After all if you look over the atrocious editing, the bad audio mixing and use of music (the \"staying alive\" bit is way too long and when they were shouting over silent music on the prom I thought it was supposed to be a joke which it obviously is not) the movie can entertain with the funny sidekick guy and plenty of tasteless jokes thrown in. A lot of the acting is rather wooden (great to see a badly acted cameo by Mark Borchard in that context ...) and the basic plot is like mixing Cabin Fever 1 with Dance of the dead. Nothing new here.With all this on the negative side I still found myself being entertained, so something worked there. I have to admit that the ending is a total incoherent mess which seemed like 3 movies mashed together. Obviously the director and editor have no sense of flow on all levels. So... its a badly made movie, BUT horror fans will surely not mind too much and rather enjoy the over the top moments. Its like a better Olaf Ittenbach Movie in some way.BTW... how come that the movie opens with nearly exactly the same sequence of someone stumbling through the woods and then being suddenly splattered by a car on an empty road as the french Mutants? Both movies were showing on this years Fantasy Film Fest... strange coincidence, or not? Reminds me of me wondering about Book of Eli and The Road and their similarities while being released at about the same time.

So, when I heard there was a sequel that was finished, it just was waiting to be released, I was obviously excited. And it had nowhere to go but downhill from there. First I heard that Eli Roth had nothing to do with this sequel, and I honestly don't think I need to elaborate anymore.Then, after stumbling upon the IMDb page for it, I saw that Rider Strong was in fact playing in this movie (I had heard that before this sequel was even in production, and I believe I had been told that it had come out of Eli Roth's mouth while talking about making a sequel). And since his name was at the top of the list I naively thought he was playing the main role. So my excitement had somewhat returned.I start watching it. Three minutes into it; SMACK! (pun intended). There went most excitement. The only reason I kept watching was to see what Deputy Winston had in store for us this movie (which was honestly very disappointing).I think the plot was very shallow, although it seems like they tried so hard to make it work. The gore was actually great, in my opinion (minus the throwing up). But the fact that they changed what this sickness/disease/infection does physically to people was just plain stupid. If this movie was just an original 80s horror movie and not a sequel, it may have been looked at as mediocre. Unfortunately, it's not an 80s original horror movie. It's a travesty sequel to a masterpiece.3/10",

            "content": "I've come to the conclusion that I may have judged Eli Roth's \"Cabin Fever\" unjustly because now that I think back to it, that movie HAD to be a horror comedy. I should really re-watch that film and re-rate it. The same can't be said about the sequel, \"Cabin Fever 2\" because it contains none of the laughs of the first film and is in fact, downright terrible. This time around, the flesh-eating disease has made its way into the water bottle plant of the town near the climax of the first film. We meet our main character John (Noah Segan) who is hard at work trying to convince his crush Cassie (Alexi Wasser) to go out with him. Meanwhile his buddy is trying to hook up with a classmate of his that is rumored to moonlight as a stripper, there are bullies trying to ruin everyone's day, unresolved romances, people freaking out about this flesh eating disease... and the prom is tomorrow! For long periods of time, the film is quite dull and when characters do start dying from the flesh-eating disease, most of it is painfully bad to watch. The film is unnecessarily disgusting, with several shots that will make even hardcore horror fans that can stomach tons of gore want to look away. The plot is very thin and the film feels padded with some very bad and cheap-looking animation at the front and back end of the movie to give us an introduction and epilogue. I can't stress enough how awful these animated segments are. They look like first-year student films finished in a hurry. Maybe the idea was to get the audience ready for a really really bad movie, or to lower their expectations so much that they would think this trash was kind of fun, but it certainly didn't work for me. The problems with the film begin way before this visual atrocity. It begins with the very concept of the film. Cabin fever 2? Really? You can tell that the original film really didn't lend itself well to a franchise because the ending had to be tweaked a lot to lead into this one, as if the audience wouldn't notice. I groaned at some of the other attempts to tie the two movies together, like an appearance of the man in the rabbit costume, which served little purpose in the previous movie and none in this one.The blood and gore effects range from convincing (and pretty stomach-churning) to cartoonish and idiotic, particularly during the prom when people start to drop dead. Some of the gross-out humor is very bad and overall, the dialog given to the mediocre actors is equally mediocre at best. The characters range from mildly interesting to the same old movie stereotypes we have seen countless times (why yes, there is a generic high school bully who is for unexplained reasons dating the love interest in this movie). The protagonists are OK but there are way too many of them going off in their own direction and that means that 3/4 into the movie several stories end and the movie comes to a close... only for it to start up again in order to tie up a bunch of loose ends no one wanted to see. The film feels mean spirited and is downright cruel to its characters (particularly the female ones), so it's not much fun to watch.Overall I really didn't have a good time at all with the film. The only amusement I got was fantasizing about the idea that if you re-cut this, you could probably make an over-the-top P.S.A. about the dangers of pre-marital sex. With some massive re-writing you could have made this into a fun, gory and dark comedy warning teens of the dangers of pre-marital sex and it would be so over-the-top that it would make \"Reefer Madness\" look like \"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room\". As is, \"Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever\" is an unpleasant movie experience with no redeeming qualities except for the occasional good gore effects. (Dvd, September 14, 2012)",

            "content": "I am a big fan of Eli Roth's Cabin Fever. Its a mediocre modern horror classic, a series of classic horror references, clich\u00e9s, funny performances, gore, silliness, quirky moments... a little unbalanced, but balanced nonetheless. It is also, most importantly, a first feature, made with sweat and blood, family money, and all kinds of trials and tribulations that eventually paid off, as the movie was bought by Lion's Gate and went on to make 15 times it's small budget. Some people feel Cabin Fever is gratuitous, that it steps over the line...perhaps, but not as much as Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever. This film is horrifying. Horrifying in that it was made, edited, boxed, all to be sold to an audience in connection with the first. I don't care that the director, Ti West, attempted to have his name removed from it after extensive re-editing and re-shooting by the producers, there is nothing to be proud of anywhere in this, I couldn't fathom any watchable footage, not from what can be deduced from this version. It gratuitously leaps well over the line in many scenes, for sheer shock value, while the plot is full of holes and incomprehensible behavior. It has no real link to the first film (this should be taken for granted) the acting and characters are ridiculous, and it is all done with no taste. Eli Roth's was coarse, vulgar, but was done with a love for old horror films. It was done with a bit of taste, and flair. This is lacking in all the above.The flesh eating bacteria from the first film makes it's way into the bottled water used by a local high school, on the day of it's prom dance. Any rules established in the previous film about the nature of the bacteria, the way it is spread and the time it takes to develop, is completely disregarded in this sequel, in lieu of plot timing. In this film, people can be tap dancing one moment, projectile vomiting blood the next. The 25-year-old high schoolers in the film stumble through awkward, unnecessary scenes, desperately trying to grasp dialogue from 'SuperBad', and acting in a generally unbelievable way. The sub plot, using an already unlikeable character from the first film, goes nowhere and ends ambiguously. The film is also very brisk at 87 minutes, ending with a long animated sequence similar to that from the beginning. More: Spoilers below: The climax of the film is tasteless in the extreme, unleashing an unbelievable shadowy government force of gun toting men on the school, who lock the doors up with chains and open fire on students randomly. Sound familiar? The actions by the students are so random and thrown together, the film seems almost like it was written by a couple of drunk guys at a table with paper and crayons. Sex with a fat girl in a pool that turns bloody! And how about bleeding, puss-oozing male genitalia? Thats sounds hilarious! Oh, and a botched pregnancy, a dumpster baby, to add a moment of real horror! A sudden, unexplained amputation, it goes on and on. It's not fun, it's squirm inducing, with no build up and no pay off. The whole film, the concept, acting, editing, producing, directing, characters, the whole thing is just convulsing, rotting away yet thrashing around bleeding at the same time, like it was infected with a......",

There have been a few Australian movies in the same vein, such as, \"Who Loves Mandy Lane?\" which is a bit of a sub-genre in the horror-comedy films--a kind of sadistic and gratuitous teenage eighties romp that is coming back round again.

            "content": "I was never a big fan of the original Cabin Fever, but there was enough in it that still made it a very enjoyable experience. Like any good horror movie, the film ended on a cliffhanger, suggesting a rather obvious path for a sequel to take. Except that sequel has taken almost a decade to get here, and feels a lot more stale than it should.Picking up some time after the original film, Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever begins with the delivery of tainted water to a local high school on the day of the prom. While everyone gets ready for the cherished event, some of the students begin coming into contact with the water. And sure enough, they become infected within hours. As an unnamed group descend and lockdown the school, John (Noah Segan), Cassie (Alexi Wasser) and Alex (Rusty Kelley) must fight their way out and remain uninfected.From the opening scene, I knew Cabin Fever 2 was going to be a hell of a mess. The opening is a totally missed opportunity, and then immediately cuts to a superfluous animated credits sequence, and then onto the rest of the film that plays out like a cross between bad rip-offs of 90210 and Evil Dead II set in the present day, but using music from the 1980s. I was unsure you could mix the genres, but apparently screenwriter Joshua Malkin (working off a story by Randy Pearlstein and director Ti West), thought it could be pulled off. Sadly, they were incorrect. When the film is not overplaying the really sappy and useless \"love story\", it is throwing disgustingly over the top gross out gags involving an obese girl, a pregnant teenager, the results of fellatio gone horribly wrong, and a gag that looks like it was taken from Evil Dead II almost shot-for-shot. Some of the gags work in the intended darkly hilarious way, but most of them fail mere seconds after beginning.The much talked about ending is also just as bad as you have likely read. It comes out of nowhere, and feels like it has no place in the final cut of the film. It serves no purpose, outside of adding more gross out gags and to reignite a setup for a third film that had already been setup mere moments before. Even looking at what comes before the final ten minutes, it still seems like everyone involved had no idea how to end the film. It feels like all the time and energy during production was used to creatively devise everything that had come before hand, but then was completely absent when it came time for some form of resolution.The film also lacks the ability of focusing on any one thing for more than a few minutes. As an audience, we know before the film even begins that we should not get attached to any one character for fear of their being killed later in the film. But our ability to feel for any of these characters is compromised by the fact that we do not even feel for the characters that likely will live. Much like the first film, almost everyone is unlikable and act with blatant disregard for anyone else. Stupidity is the biggest fallacy in the horror genre, but even when these characters are making smart decisions, they still end up being decisions that should never have been made in the first place. I think almost everyone who watches the film will be looking forward more to how the people will die and when, then to who will make it out alive in the end. It is not even worth attempting to discuss any standout performances, or even good performances, because all the acting is just horrendous.What compromises the film, at least from the standpoint of comparison to Cabin Fever, is that the filmmakers have taken liberties with the disease and have changed it without much explanation. While the first film mainly consisted of rotting flesh and grotesquely bloody demises, this film mainly consists of people vomiting blood or developing some form of disgusting bacteria (usually causing some form of bleeding) on one of their private parts. There are a few instances where the people who fall victim to the disease appear much in the same shape as their brethren in the first film, but it just seems like everyone was less concerned with making the disease appear similar and more concerned about how to continually make the next gag grosser than the last.Much like I thought before venturing into Cabin Fever 2, the only real reason to watch the film is for some of the wacky makeup effects that take place. Even when the gags fail to incite a response (whether shudders of disgust, or laughing hysterically), the makeup still excels and propels the movie forward. Even in its most ridiculous or even simplistic moments, the makeup holds up and stays consistent no matter what body part or bodily function is involved. There is obvious great care taken to ensure everyone meets their incredibly bloody and gory demises, and is evidently where all the effort went during production.Even though the flawed Cabin Fever setup a rather obvious path for a sequel, Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever loses anything it has going for it within minutes of introducing the plot. The story is an intriguing idea, but the execution is just lousy. Outside of some stellar makeup effects, the film just feels like a bad parody and ripoff of much better works. Worse yet, the filmmakers appear to have no shame in feeding the audience some of the most disgusting and vile of ideas, meant as gags but really just amounting to not much of anything. The film is a disappointment, even for a direct-to-DVD movie.2.5/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",

Then of course later where the same character rips a fingernail off???? Then super glues it back on???? WTF was that? Then later on he pulls his pants down and squirts a giant wad of pus out of his....you know... The gore I don't mind, its funny and pointless as in most gory flicks, but this movie was ridiculous..from the token hot guy banging the fat chick in the pool, to the oddly angry janitor who pisses in the punch, then bleeds into it. Then without ten minutes to spare the movie, it just kind of ends...and there is no real ending, just a bunch of random animation crap with no firm conclusion, which scared me in the sense that it left open the door for yet another sequel and if someone actually put this crap out, the chance of another one is not that far fethced! The only redeeming factor of this debacle is the holdover from the original, Guisseppe Andrews playing the character of Winston who loves to party, and chase \"beaver\" around. The fact that the top billing went to Rider Strong of \"Boy meets world\" fame was a misnomer.....He was unrecognizable and was hit by a bus within two minutes of the movie starting, good for him! A favorite of mine Judah Freilander of 30 Rock fame was really wasted in this movie, and I hope he was nicely compensated for subjecting himself to this....In closing, there are some funny comments, but they don't save this turkey",

A sequel to Eli Roth's Cabin Fever (2002) an infection movie/ cabin in the woods horror and his directorial premiere.In the original the infection attacks a group of friends through bad water. In Ti West's sequel the infection has infested the water filtration plant ultimately making water from a bottled water company diseased.In many ways these are origin stories for an outbreak movie. Eli Roth is a fan, according to his podcast History of Horror, of body horror and infection horror. His influence from David Cronenberg's Rabid is often voiced. In Rabid an STD infects as caused by a Typhoid Mary character portrayed by the Marilyn Chambers.In Cabin Fever 2 (2009) it's a by the troupe horror sequel, which means it gives you what you had from a previous installment, just amplified.However, I'd say it's less a sequel to Cabin Fever and more of a remake of The Crazies (1973) the infection horror quasi-prequel to Night of the Living Dead.This said, Cabin Fever 2 is Ti West's opportunity to make a fully funded and distribute md film. There's no attempt to not show off what he can do, however, he's hesitant to progress his film further than that of an amplified sequel choosing hectic action to the slow burn body horror infection of his predecessor. He wants to be a horror maestro yet instead makes an action movie with horror themes.Connections: anyone that gets infected is ugly, but the juxtaposition of a generational rift is not present by looks but by those of students vs military, but it's a stretch. Essentially his auteur vision is missing.What would I change?Every kid trapped in the building on the inside has a parent on the outside. I'd make the parents increasingly anti barricade. The military wants them safe from the infection. Meanwhile their healthy and infected children are attempting to get out. I'd have the parents break through the barricades at the end just to be devoured by their kids in the conclusion.",

            "content": "Eli Roth directed the sequel to \"Hostel\" but not \"Cabin Fever\". That's not a good sign. Ti West is credited as the director and co-writer of \"Cabin Fever 2\", which can be considered as a good thing since he directed the really cool \"The Roost\" and the fairly acclaimed \"House of the Devil\". But then you read around here that Ti West tried very hard to get his name removed from the final cut because he wasn't at all satisfied. That's a terrible sign! To top it all off the trivia section also mentions the film got shelved for two and a half years at the Lionsgate archives. That's pretty much the worst sign there is\u0085 And yet, in spite of all the negative omens, I had a great time watching \"Cabin Fever 2\"! Surely this isn't a genre masterpiece, but that should have been plain obvious already when you picked up the DVD at the video store. I really didn't like Eli Roth's original. It was a pretentious and obnoxious flick that nevertheless thought of itself as innovative and clever. At least the absolute last thing you can say about the sequel is that it takes itself too serious. This is merely just a light-headed splatter flick full of tasteless and even downright vulgar teenage sex-jokes, disgusting but horribly fake gore effects and a whole lot of senseless plotting. Dissatisfied with the result or not, Ti West clearly knows how to make horror entertaining again! It begins with the last but barely living survivor of the first film emerging from a lake, completely consumed by the flesh-eating virus, and struggling to reach the interstate. This is the only sequence featuring Rider Strong, by the way, and yet he receives top-billing. The opening credits sequence is even more fun, as it's an animated gimmick illustrating how the infected water streams towards a factory where it gets bottled and subsequently distributed in large trucks all throughout the area, like for example in the nearby high school. The animation looks terrific and the guiding song \u2013 Dancing on our Graves by The Cave Singers \u2013 is awesome! The scenes inside high school are familiar territory, of course, with nerds and outcasts trying to score a date to the prom. The prom where, in good old \"Carrie\" tradition, all hell will break loose! Particularly the second half of the film is a parade of ludicrous gore & splatter effects. Highlights include gallons of blood vomiting, a fat girl dissolving in a pool and shameless images of a rotting penis! The acting performances are (deliberately) awful, none of the introduced story lines are properly finished and there are nods towards \"The Crazies\" and \"Carrie\". Nail-free, decaying thumbs up from me.",

Some good continuity and a strong way to open a sequel. Unfortunately, the problems start right after he's hit by a bus driver who certainly must've seen him in the road from a mile away. The movie just goes downhill from there. This movie lacks the more gritty feeling of the original paired with dark humor. Instead, it primarily goes for humor but primarily fails. It also features entirely too much gore that it becomes unbearable after a while. Not that the original didn't feature gore but it never felt like overkill like it does in this movie. The fact a kid loses his penis to the virus says it all as to how appalling the gore is here. There are other ghastly scenes, including a man with one of those holes in his throat to breathe due to being a heavy smoker that starts gushing out blood due to the FEV. This actually happens in this movie. It's almost like the drop in quality from Return Of The Living Dead to Return Of The Living Dead Part 2.

There's a lot of blood, but no attempt whatsoever to scare the audience: the focus is on the gross out - unfortunately for anyone who has to watch even a moment of this movie.Inexplicably, almost without exception, the actors in \"Cabin Fever 2\" are both uncharismatic and unattractive. They go through the motions of every high-school movie: the main guy is a sensitive dork in love with his childhood crush but she's perilously close to being snatched away by the scheming a-hole. Meanwhile, main guy's horny, obnoxious and overweight friend is trying to get laid.In this one, he has a surprising success early in the movie, which leads to the first truly disgusting part: a more attractive girl gives him oral sex in the bathroom, and then spits a suspiciously copious amount of white fluid, languidly, into the basin.Ick.There are other weird pairings, like when a marginally more attractive male student hits on an obese girl and has her strip naked for sex in the high school pool - her body starts to bleed and deteriorate upon, ahem, entry.Later, a disgruntled groundsman urinates into the punch that will be served at the high school prom... and as he does so, his stream turns red with blood, until the punch looks like pasta sauce.They students drink it anyway.Do you see what I mean about this movie being a horror version of \"American Pie\"? These are gross-out scenes, largely to do with sex and bodily functions, but always underlined by gore tropes that ruin any chance that you might find them funny.That probably could have worked, but the problem is, among other things, the movie has no jokes. It sets up its tired teenage plot, throws the virus from the first movie in amongst it, and then just gives you clich\u00e9d scenes intermixed with inexplicable revolting moments. At least in \"American Pie\", the gross-out came with a punch-line; here it just goes through the motions, like a socially stunted child who can only do disgusting things to get attention, and doesn't care if that attention is good or bad.",

            "content": "Doing a sequel to a movie can be hard-especially if it's a sequel to a largely divisive movie. The original \"Cabin Fever\" fits roughly in two camps: Those who love it (like me) and those who think it's one of the worst horror movies of all time. So when it was announced that Ti West was directing the sequel, I was interested. I had seen his debut movie \"The Roost\" and was impressed with what I saw-a tribute to the 70's and 80's era of horror that mostly got it right. He seemed like the perfect choice.Then the news broke. Basically, Lionsgate was unsure of what to do with the movie, and West abandoned it to work on an excellent little movie called \"The House of the Devil.\" Then the producers shot new material and edited the film without West's permission. West was unhappy with this, and went on to disown the movie (even trying to give it the \"Alan Smithee\" credit.) Now, here we are, and the movie is finally on DVD. Is it the disaster West made it out to be? For the most part, it's not.The movie opens where the original ended-Paul (Rider Strong) wakes up in the creek he was dumped in, now barely recognizable due to the disease now disfiguring him. After stumbling though the woods and into the road, he's hit by a school bus, splattering him everywhere. Way to make an exit.Cut to High school, and the upcoming prom. Poor John (Noah Segan) is hopelessly in love with Liz (Regan Deal), who just happens to be dating a total asshole in Marc (Marc Senter, here slightly influenced by the villain from \"The Karate Kid.\") When his best pal Alex (Rusty Kelley) decides to go to the prom (after a girl with a suspicious bump on her lip and braces gives him a blow job-why anyone would let a girl like that give them a blow job is beyond me), John decides to go-as does Liz. Unfortunately for them (and the rest of those attending) the flesh eating bacteria from the original has made it's way into the drinking water.Oh, and let's not forget Deputy Winston (Giuseppe Andrews, who steals the show), who puts two and two together and realizes that if he doesn't find a way out fast, he's going to be in some deep s#!t.First thing's first: \"Cabin Fever 2\" is not a better movie than the original. In fact, it's a largely different beast, and at times (due to editing most likely) feels like a half finished movie. Where as Eli Roth made his movie about what would happen if five dumb College kids found themselves in an awful situation, West is more interested in paying homage to the likes of early John Waters movies, as well as several 80's teen flicks. In a lot of ways, this movie eschews much of the horror (well, save for a few scenes), instead opting for something that feels like a gory, darkly comic version of a teen comedy. And for the large part, that works, as he let's the audience get to know these characters, and what do ya know, some of them are kind of likable. It also helps that the cameo appearances (from Strong, \"30 Rock's\" Judah Friedlander, indie horror darling Larry Fessenden, and \"American Movie's\" Mark Borchardt as Winston's cousin) are fun and at times really funny.Oh, and speaking of the gore, this sucker out does the original in this department. Among the grotesqueness on display, we get: a gnarly bit with an infected penis, bloody urine in the punch bowl, a head bashed in with a fire extinguisher, loads of blood spewing forth, a hand lopped off at the wrist, a really bad miscarriage, and more. You can tell that they went all out in this department.So far, it's been a really fun time...and then the final 10 minutes takes place. This is the part of the movie in which the producers and the studios interference can be seen, and it really shows. It all takes place in a Strip Club, and it clashes with the tone of the rest of the movie, feeling incredibly out of place-and not to mention nowhere near as funny as the producers thing it is. In short, that part of the movie is a disaster.Other than that, \"Cabin Fever 2\" is a really fun (but flawed) gore-fest that should entertain some and divide others. I myself really enjoyed it-except for the lame conclusion.",

            "content": "I admit that the first film isn't great, apart from of course all the harrowing imagery and stuff, and I was certainly up for seeing this (as far as I know straight to DVD) sequel). Basically the film opens with Paul (Rider Strong, from the previous film) looking all hideous and falling apart hit by a bus, and his virus filled fluids have managed to go into the creek that goes into a brand of bottled water. This bottled water ends up in the cold storage of a high school, as you see in the animated sequence, just waiting for many innocent teachers, students and visitors to drink it and catch the deadly virus. The story sees John (Noah Segan) deciding whether or not to go to the prom where his long time crush Cassie (Alexi Wasser) is going to be, but he is afraid that her boyfriend Marc (Marc Senter) will beat him. John's friend Alex (Rusty Kelley) wasn't keen on going either, that is until he got a blow job and a yes that Liz (Regan Deal) will be going. While John and Cassie are clean, Alex is slowly succumbing to the virus-infected water affects, as are many other people going to the prom. Deputy Winston (Giuseppe Andrews, from the previous film) realises the water thing happening, and goes to warn the company not to make any more deliveries, and this forces some SWAT-type people to take action. So the prom is on, John and Cassie are having some fun, and they express their feelings for each other, only to be locked in the school with everyone else who is infected. With no escape they are trying to find a way out with the soon to die Alex, and watch in horror as all the infected people disintegrate, and before dying, Alex finds out there is no cure. In the end, John lets Cassie get away while he I guess dies, and she is picked up by Winston and Herman (Mark Borchardt) to get some help (she might be infected). Oh, but hang on, you also see what happened to Alex's date Liz, doing her thing as a stripper and disintegrating whilst performing, and you see another animated sequence showing the virus going into other things as well, e.g. office sweets (gives way to another sequel). Also starring Alexander Isaiah Thomas as Dane, Michael Bowen as Principal Sinclair, Amanda Jelks as Frederica and Angela Oberer as Ms. Hawker. I would have to say, even though it is trying to hard to be a bit bigger with death count and blood amount, this sequel is certainly much more visceral than the smaller location original, so I'd say it's worth a go.

            "content": "Cabin Fever 2 (2009) ** 1/2 (out of 4)High school loser Paul (Rider Strong) ends up at the prom with a girl (Alexi Wasser) he has liked for ages but her jerk boyfriend isn't going to be the biggest trouble of the night. Nope, the polluted water from the first film has made its way into bottles, which are being drank around town so soon more people are falling victim to the deadly virus.Ti West directs this sequel to the Eli Roth movie and I must admit that I found it to be pretty entertaining. If you're looking for a deep character study or some heavy melodrama then it's best to not even bother with this film. If you want a cheap movie with some rather outrageous gore and violence then CABIN FEVER 2 should keep you entertained.Again, if you're looking for anything other than gore it's best to stay away and I'd say this film crosses the line enough to where even some of the hardest horror fans might be looking away from the screen. The gore level is certainly over-the-top and a lot of it is sexual in nature and it was not only gross but very funny too. I'm not going to ruin these types of jokes but there are a couple moments where male and female parts are infected and it will certainly make you jump.The entire film has quite a bit of violence and gore, which will keep horror fans happy. I thought the story dealing with the two teens could have been written better to make it more interesting but we're at least given some good performances. With that said, CABIN FEVER 2 was made simply for the gore and there's plenty of it and plenty of sick humor, which makes it worth watching.",

            "content": "Ti West, one of the promising directors. I have seen The Roost (didn't do reviews then) and was pleased with it, it even won some prices. 4 years later he made two movies in one year, The House Of The Devil and Cabin Fever 2. Both an ode to the grindhouse. Especially HOTD, see review. Cabin Fever, made by Eli Roth, was his first feature in the genre. Some loved it and some hated it. But his name was made, he created Hostel and the rest was history. But Cabin Fever 2 he wasn't involved with. The only important person involved was the writer of Cabin Fever Randy Pearlstein. So came in Ti West. But look, everybody is breaking it down even with Noah Segan (Deadgirl) in it, also acclaimed as a newcomer in the genre. Is it that bad? It starts were the first part ended. Well done are the credits, and effects used like in the exploitation flicks. There is gore in it but somehow it's a bit too much the same everywhere. And by that I mean the part at the proms, it's all about vomiting and vomiting. I don't have any problems with gore or brutal scene's but here sometimes it's laughable. I even dare to say that it becomes a bit of a parody of the first part. Still, people with a weak stomach shouldn't watch it. One scene made me think of Irreversible with the fire extinguisher and one of The Nailgun Massacre. In fact it has nothing to do with a Cabin and that's a shame, they better had changed the title in something else and the fuzz about this part wouldn't be there at all. Sorry, Ti West, but this isn't what I wanted from you.",

            "content": "Torture porn has come a long way. Most notably getting a great start with the original Cabin Fever back in 2002, which was forthcoming Saw, then Hostel and The Collector, which all lead up to this mess. Cabin Fever 2 is a fast paced film on the verge of being a shock film. Originally planned distribution in 2007, it was delayed up until 2010 to be released. It goes beyond your wildest nightmare with the gore scenes, the flesh eating scenes, and the ending.The film starts out about five minutes where the originally left off. A school bus hits a man (who is mistaken for a moose) by Giuseppe Andews. Lord knows his acting is exceptionally well, but he is the only fun and enjoyable part of the film with his stereotypical 90s tone and funny approach to every character he comes in contact with.The likability of the characters, is very slim. I don't care, or like for that matter, any of the characters excluding Andrews. I just want to see fights and blood. Boy, I was barking up the wrong tree. Its no doubt that this movie would follow in the footsteps of the first film. But the gore scenes are laughably fake and unrealistic to the point its inexcusable.A flesh eating disease as spread vastly through a popular brand of bottled water. Of course, a prom is in the mix, and a big bowl of punch including the tainted water is brought to the party. When consumed by nearly every student, a certain team quarantines the school locking everyone inside leaving no escape. The two who aren't infected are John and Cassie, two high school students hiding their feelings for each other.Contemplating not going to prom, John does along with Cassie and things heat up at school. A death in the pool seems minor, but its definitely the part I experienced the most nausea in. For a Horror movie, its passable, but for the long wait this movie had me under, I expected much more. The rotten core stems from the bad acting and some unrealistic measures involving a table saw, a flame thrower, and duct tape. Barely passable Horror flick.Starring: Rider Strong, Giuseppe Andrews, Judah Friedlander, Noah Segan, and Marc Senter. Directed by: Ti West.",

It looks like whoever wrote the script for this movie just made up some weird garbage on the spot and another guy decided to make a movie out of it.

            "content": "Well as a grossout, Ti West's Cabin Fever II earns it's stripes. CF II is essentially another high school prom flick set within an epidemic of skin disease whose source is infected water. Some shadowy bio-agents later appear into the film, shooting anyone that poses a hazardous threat to the outside world, the night of the prom when all the kids and faculty begin to have very unsavory reactions to the water they have been consuming for sometime. Also divulged towards the end is the fact that this epidemic may not be contained in the little town of the film. Rider Strong is introduced first in the credits, but isn't a factor in the plot. Many horror fans might know the star of CF II from the indie cult horror item, Deadgirl, Noah Segan, as John, a nerd accepted to a prestigious medical school whose head-over-heels for Alexi Wasser's Cassie. Cassie in the pretty blonde girl, most popular of her school, dating the aggressively hostile rich jock prick, Marc(Marc Senter, most know him as Ray Pye in Jack Ketcham's The Lost). John has a plump pal, Alex(Rusty Kelley)whose always getting into trouble because of his unflappable bluntness. Giuseppe Andrews returns from the first film as dimwitted deputy Winston, hoping his hometown pal Mark Borchardt(inspired casting)will help him get out of dodge and pronto. The prom becomes a bloodbath as those infected react to what ails them. Indie director Larry Fessenden has a cameo as some blue collar worker whose body literally comes apart at the seams inside a diner. Facial mouth sores, school bathroom blow job, blistered breasts, pedophilia humor, hammer to the skull, bandsaw damage, puss-oozing penis, blood vomit spray, a schoolbus splattering a body all over a highway, and other gruesome \"highlights\" in store for those who delight in such extravagances. There's a nice homage to the original Prom Night's disco dance theme and some inspired music by The Ramones added into the big night's festivities. Heavy dependence on animated vignettes perhaps as a means for padding the film out. It shows signs of production tinkering. I can understand why Ti West wanted his name removed, CF II is a huge mess.",

            "content": "Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever starts as Paul (Rider Strong) emerges from a river, weak & bloody from the deadly virus he stumbles through the woods to a road where he is killed by a school bus running into him. The trail of bloody flesh & body parts left behind by Paul in the river makes it's way into a local water bottling plant where the deadly virus ends up in a batch of bottles of Down Town Water which are then distributed to the local high school in time for that night's annual prom. John (Noah Segan) & his best friend Alex (Rusty Kelley) decide to go to the prom that although have no dates lined up, while at the prom John is thrown out but is quickly forced back in at gunpoint by armed men who seal the school off in an attempt to contain the flesh eating virus that is now running riot through the school because of the water & punch. John grabs his best mate Alex & Cassie (Alexi Wasser) the girl he loves & together the three try to outrun the armed men & not become infected by the deadly virus...Although the director on the credits is listed as Ti West he actually tried to have his name removed from Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever & replaced with the standard Hollywood pseudonym Alan Smithee after extensive re-editing & re-shoots by the producers by his request was denied, apparently West has stated the film which was released was not the film he made & more down to the producers. The sequel to the surprise horror smash hit Cabin Fever (2002) this was made shortly after but languished on the shelf & remained unreleased for a couple of years which is never a good sign, while I have seen the original you will have to forgive me as I can't remember a single thing about it so I am not entirely sure how the two compare. The script doesn't have much going for it, if you take away the gory opening of Paul's demise then the first fifty minutes is pretty dull going with lots of annoying high school teens doing annoying things, once the virus hits things improve but for some reason doesn't feature that much & Cassie's boyfriend & the authorities become the main threat. I suppose what saves Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever are a few pleasing gore effects, some mildly amusing sex & bodily fluid gags & a short running time of about 80 minutes. Character's disappear & then the film switches to a strip club for it's final act, the isolation & despair of the original is missing here as the script opens things up to take place in an entire town rather than one cabin & with no one character to really follow through the film Cabin fever 2: Spring Fever feels bitty & edited & sort of patched together like it was.Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever features an animated introduction & an animated final few minutes in the style of The Simpsons which is sort of cool but on the other hand feel very out of place, did the production run out of money & couldn't afford to actually film those scenes? There are some good gore scenes here, there are lots of boils & a set of breasts with boils, lots of people vomit up blood or puke, people are shot, a woman is seen with half her face missing, there's a graphic scene where someone cuts off their own hand with a band-saw & then has the wound burnt closed with a blow torch, a guy's face is smashed in with a fire extinguisher & someone literally explodes when hit by a bus. There's a fairly big nudity count as well with a somewhat distasteful scene of a fat woman undressing which I am sure is there for the yuk factor but is rather disrespectful to the actress.Probably shot on a fairly low budget the production values are good, the film looks nice enough & the gory effects look great although a lot of the gore is played for slapstick. Filmed in Wilmington in North Carolina. The acting is alright, Alexi Wasser who plays Cassie is hot & nice to look at while Giuseppe Andrews & Rider Strong return from the first film.Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever is a silly comedy horror film that has little resemblance to the original Cabin Fever & apart from a short run time & some good gore effects has little going for it with a very messy story that was the obvious result of the film being taken in different directions after filming had wrapped.",

And as the movie started, I was happy to discover that unlike some horror films where the sequel uses nothing but the same main idea as the first film (like White Noise 2 or Blair Witch Project 2) or the same antagonist/s (like the Wrong Turn series, which by the way I absolutely loved), this sequel actually picked up from the same point where the first film ended. We also got to see the crazy Sheriff's Deputy from the first film in a greater role.Then, a very impressive animated opening scene (very much reminded me of Rob Zombie's art) and an amusing stereotypical teenage flick with kids getting ready for prom while the virus spreaded...Then the gore started. Personally, I'm not a gore fan, not at all. The highest level of \"gore\" I could enjoy was, for instance, the latest Saw films. The difference is, in this film the gore served absolutely no purpose. Showing an occasional vomit or skin wound caused by the virus could have been OK, as it would have contributed to the plot. The first film used just the right amount of such scenes. But this film? All hell broke loose and the director simply decided to go wild and make us all sick to our stomachs. I did not appreciate that.As the film continued, and ended, everything was left to interpretation. It simply seemed like the most work was put in to creating the gore scenes, unlike the first film that had a story and a point.I think it's a real shame. Cabin Fever was fun to watch. Cabin Fever 2 wasn't. Then again, if your fans of B-class gore films, you might enjoy it after all. Personally - I'm gonna try and forget there has ever been a sequel to Cabin Fever.",

            "content": "While attempting to sort out their own melodramas, a group of teens tries to fight for their safety after a batch of water contaminated with a flesh-eating virus is accidentally delivered to their prom and starts to violently attack the party-goers.While this one's a little bit better than the original, that's not really saying much since both aren't really all that great. One of the biggest problems here is the fact that this one focuses way too much on teen drama and the social status of the group rather than the horror and there's not a whole lot of interest here in how this plays out. How the gang's issues are brought up, from the long-pined for romantic partner dating his sworn nemesis, the completely bland and annoying whining of the best friend over not having a date and what her friends are doing to get ready for the event itself as far as preparations go and how they're going to get through the evening without a fault, and none of it does anything to brighten up the pace as this just gets old rather quickly. These are so based on the typical clich\u00e9s found in these films as well that there's a decided lack of interest here as well from this overly-familiar series of scenes as well as the fact that there's just way too much blandness about this section to make much of them. There's also the fact that the storyline required to get the virus there is just sloppy, as frankly far too much of the film feels like it's a coincidence merely to present its story that eventually, it all just gets tiresome trying to accept such gross stupidity and contrivance to make its point. This asks way too much to happen for this type of scenario to be plausible, and it finally starts getting too much for itself to handle in terms of getting the virus into the school for this to play out here. Add onto that the wrap-around with the animation is pretty lame and doesn't really do much to the film at all which lowers this enough over the few positive points. While there's a lot to like even here, this one could've been decent as its way bloodier than expected here as this one has some really great sequences here as the last half with the infected bleeding buckets around the school while they try to stay uninfected make for some good, and surprisingly suspenseful, times as there's a series of great chases around the hallways and into the different rooms of the school. The brutality of the shop-class encounter is a notable highlight as they try to deal with their attacker in a great brawl while again trying to keep those infected away from contaminating him, while the sheer fun of keeping the few stragglers loose in the hallways from getting into the library is another rather fun and enjoyable scene. The last big plus found here is that big, infected mess found in the prom sequence and the resulting cut-backs to show the aftermath of everything and how the following special forces handle it results in some great bloody times and becomes the highlight quite easily. These here give this one some great stuff here, but it's too flawed to be anything else.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity.",

Most of the gripes that I read about CABIN FEVER 2 from other reviewers are completely warranted. The virus in this film acts totally different than in the original. The ending is tacked on and provides no resolution to the previous events shown on-screen, and main characters die off or disappear with little to no fanfare. All that said-there are a few funny/clever moments and as everyone has already stated-the gore comes fast and furious and is relatively effective. The pacing is quick as well so you don't have to sit through too much of this flawed film to start getting the money-shots. Definitely a weak film in terms of storyline and continuity-but worthwhile to gore-fans to revel in the over-the-top FX. 6.5/10",

Eli Roth seems to think he's found some sort of niche, but really he just turns out torture porn that some people seem to think is \"sick\" or \"twisted\" when it's really just tired and done to death (no pun intended).But this sequel seems to be a bit more honest. It's not trying to hide the fact that it's a little bit cheesy. Plus the gore is better and the film is funnier. If you ever saw Dance Of The Dead, this should be familiar territory. Some people don't like their horror flicks to be silly or funny...those people are boring. As horror/comedy flicks go, this is pretty much par for the course. Nothing terribly new or exciting, but it's got a few laughs, a lot of over-the-top gore, and some decent (if not standout) performances.

There were some parts of this movie I enjoyed, like the fact that Spoiler: John and Cassy ended up together and the boyfriend of hers who was super mean died.However, this movie was over the top disgusting, and I have seen horror slashers but the gore was just too over the top and just verged on disgusting for even someone who has seen a lot of slashers. The ending was super lame and throughout there are older men hitting on young girls which is just lame. This movie was not original and you should definitely not pay for it and probably should not waste your 90 minutes. I have yet to see the first Cabin Fever, but know it it probably much much better.",

If you're looking for a good laugh you might like this one. In my opinion this isn't even one of those movies that it's so bad it's funny it's just terrible and stupid. If you feel like wasting your life watch this movie. I ignored all the bad reviews about this movie before I watched it and I can honestly say that was a big mistake. Furthermore the characters in this movie except for maybe two people are incredibly stupid and just degrade the human race. If anything this movie could be considered a low grade porn film in some scenes. Only if you are into the most unattractive porn films ever. Don't watch this film it's not worth your time.

It's always difficult to give a new spin to horny teenagers in peril but both CABIN FEVER and the FINAL DESTINATION franchise managed . Setting the sequel to CABIN FEVER at a high school prom should have set a few alarm bells ringing . After seeing CABIN FEVER 2 SPRING FEVER this instinctive fear has been proved to be correct You want an audience to empathise with the characters you're going to kill off ? Fine but you've got to make the characters believable . Here the characters have the depth of a puddle if not a dried up river bed . To say the characters are mere cyphers is to elevate the film as an intense cinematic character study. The only character I can remember clearly is the fat girl in the swimming pool and that's only because I thought I'd flipped the channel and was watching a Greenpeace documentary about whale hunting Another spanner in the works is the failed humour . You think characters suffering from projectile vomiting at the most inopportune moments is funny ? You might enjoy a couple of sequences first time they make an appearance but they quickly outlive their welcome . Watching these failed comedy scenes is like being handcuffed to Jim Carrey in manic mode . This completely jars with the more serious subplots one of which - a government team trying to keep a lid on things - is totally underdeveloped It's difficult to think how this movie might appeal to anyone outside the hardcore teen horror crowd but even then they might be confused to its market after all the soundtrack is painfully anachronistic with Hi- NRG disco . The gore is genuinely graphic and stomach churning which is at odds with the badly written and inappropriate humour",

            "content": "I don't usually date my reviews, but to check the date I'm writing its enough to see that the theme of this film - a global pandemic - has never seemed as actual as it has been. Of course, the current pandemic is not even similar to what this film shows, and thank goodness!This film is the sequel to \"Cabin Fever\", which showed how a carnivorous virus unexpectedly appears in a rural area and begins to make victims. This film follows that story and reveals how a mineral water brand will export the virus inside each of its bottles and spread the virus everywhere, starting with a high school prom where Paul, who was never lucky with girls, will try to get the attention of a girl he likes but who already has a boring boyfriend.I'm not a fan of gore, but this sequence seemed to me quite well articulated with the first film even though it is far from a masterpiece and is full of problems common to most films of this horror genre: focused on the most graphic scenes, uses and abuses alcohol and female nudity, so appealing to teenagers, and their characters are so one-dimensional and clich\u00e9 that we don't mind seeing them die. But this film was never even thought to be good... just to sell and please an audience that already knows what it will find: simple and light entertainment, blood and bodies falling apart. And here the movie will really know how to shock, so I strongly advise against popcorn.I don't know if the cast is really worth talking about. There are no big names here, as it is easy to imagine. Anyway... Personally I would positively highlight the return of Rider Strong to the character he had already done in the first film. The actor is not brilliant but does a satisfactory job. Alexi Wasser is good enough but it didn't catch my attention and the chemistry with Strong was poorly achieved and not very credible. The rest will dance according to the music, but it does not stand out particularly. Most are there to die.Technically, it is a low-budget film that, nonetheless, tried to make the most of the special effects involving blood and pieces of human bodies, with some good results that will surely turn many people's guts. The makeup team also deserves a praise for the good work. Cinematography fulfills its role, but without anything that seems worth noting. The sets and costumes are more or less what we could be expecting in a movie in an ordinary environment.",

            "content": "Following the events of Cabin Fever, infected blood carrying the skin disease has seeped into a local body of water which is utilized as a source for the Down Home Water bottling facility. Cases of the contaminated bottled water make their way to neighboring Springfield High School allowing the skin infection to spread during a high school prom. John (Noah Segan) an awkward high schooler gets an opportunity to date his dream girl, Cassie (Alexi Wasser) following her break-up with her abusive domineering boyfriend Marc (Marc Senter). When the virus breaks out at the prom, the tumultuous teen drama is interrupted anguished pains and rotting flesh with the added threat of a shadowy containment unit who shoots anyone on sight.Following the success of the first Cabin Fever, which at the time was Lionsgate's highest grossing release before Saw superceded it the following year, Lionsgate was keen on getting a sequel made. Two separate pitches for a follow up were crafted with one by Eli Roth and the other by Adam Green, both pitches were rejected with the most cited reason being \"studio politics\" and a different direction was pursed by the producers shepherded by Lauren Moews. Ti West was hired by Moews to direct the film who at the time had only two low budget indies to his name, The Roost (2005) and Trigger Man (2007). Cabin Fever 2 marked a departure for West who at the time had directed material he had written with story credit going partially to West while screen credit went to Joshua Malkin. Filming completed in 2007 but due to disagreements that left West walking away from the production (as well as trying to get his name taken off but refused since he wasn't a DGA member) the movie wound up in a state of post-production hell that resulted in it not being released until 2009 by which point West had filmed another movie, The House of the Devil. While the movie is supposedly 90% true to West's original vision per statements by Lauren Moews, even if West had delivered on his original cut Cabin Fever 2 probably wouldn't have worked all that well. The delayed development of the sequel meant the horror scene had started to move on from the influence of Saw and Cabin Fever with the genre moving more towards the likes of Paranormal Activity and found footage leaving the once novel bloody mayhem of Cabin Fever behind. West has made no secret this was a \"for hire\" project with producers wanting something specifically to evoke the first Cabin Fever, and that's basically where the main issue lies Ti West is effectively pigeonholed by the movie to be Eli Roth.Much like how the first Cabin Fever paid homage to backwoods \"cabin in the woods\" type horror films, Cabin Fever: Spring Fever seems like it's trying to evoke 1980s high school horror ranging from everything to Stephen King's Carrie to 80s slashers like Prom Night and Graduation Day. The movies main character's John played by Noah Segan and his friend Alex played by Rusty Kelley come off as having trying to capture a similar dynamic to Evan and Seth in Superbad, but I didn't like Alex at all in regards to his position as \"the funny one\" and like the first Cabin Fever there's really not much to these characters so they never evolve beyond the level of caricature with them being solely defined by their type (awkward lead, dreamgirl, alpha male bully, wise-ass friend, etc.) which you could probably argue as being \"the point\" maybe, but when you're stuck with these characters for such a long time you have to give the audience something to latch onto in order to care and they really don't. Much like the first film the characters are pretty rock stupid often exposing themselves to blood splatter or staying when they should leave. If taken as a horror film, it's not scary and if taken as a comedy, it's not funny. The one moment I kind of enjoyed was a pair of horror fan characters Taylor Kowalski as Darryl and Alexander Isaiah Thomas as his younger brother Dane, collectively known as D&D that I kind of liked even if they were slightly underutilized.The movie is well made and stylish, there's some creative bloodsoaked chaos once the virus breaks out at the prom and the gore work is solid and disgusting with well crafter effects conveying rotting skin, bloody piss streams, oozing penises, and even a miscarriage in a locker room triggered by the virus that doesn't spare the gory (literally) details. I was never scared or unnerved by these sequences, but if you are into gorework and viscera you'll find plenty to admire here. The movie also tries to insert the added threat of the shadowy containment team shooting the infected but it's pretty underdeveloped and doesn't really amount to much.Cabin Fever: Spring Fever isn't poorly made, but it doesn't really justify its own existence basically doing the same thing as the previous Cabin Fever only with a different location. Cabin Fever resonated because it was an off the rails Itchy & Scratchy cartoon masquerading as a horror film and love it or hate it, it showcased Roth as a filmmaker whether you loved the film or hated it. Spring Fever feels like someone with clear talent and their own voice was told to \"do what Eli Roth would do\" making something that's Roth-like but not quite, sure there's the same or similar elements in place to a Roth movie, but it feels...off. It's honestly pretty hard to decide what to rate this movie objectively because I know people who hate the first Cabin Fever but are apologists for this film and vice versa. I myself didn't like Cabin Fever per se but gave it credit for its craft and novelty, but with a six year gap between films and the post Saw/Cabin Fever intensity having waned in popularity in favor of the likes of Found Footage, I'd be hard pressed to recommend this film to anyone outside of those nostalgic for that '03-'08 era of horror films.",

Such is the case with the sequel to Eli Roth's gross-out opus, \"Cabin Fever.\" Director Ti West tried and failed to remove his name from the final product that is \"Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever\" and it's easy to see why. The film is as messy and ridiculous as it is uneven and patched together. That's not say that some enjoyment can't be milked from this unnecessarily but entertaining sequel, though. If you are of the variety who enjoys cheesy splatter flicks with a heavy dosage of gross-out humor, this might just be up your alley.Picking up where the first film left off, the virus has now spread from a cabin to a high school prom where teenagers are unknowingly knocking back tainted punch. Before long, the school is quarantined and its up to a couple of misfits to get out and warn the rest of the world. Needless to say, things get nasty rather quickly.Aside from returning actors Giuseppe Andrews and Rider Strong, \"Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever\" features an all-new cast. Andrews is thankfully given a larger role than in the first and is the saving grace of the film. He's as hilarious and off-beat as ever and is probably the best connection this movie has to its predecessor. Strong has a decidedly smaller role, however. Without giving too much away, his part is minor at best (certainly not worthy of the top-billing he receives on the film) but he was probably just happy to get work. Afterall, the residuals from \"Boy Meets World\" re-runs ain't gonna pay the bills. The rest of the cast is competent if forgettable, with a few in particular looking and sounding as if they stepped off the set of a Rob Zombie film. Judah Friedlander of \"30 Rock\" fame has a fleeting cameo, but it's really the cast of mis-matched teenagers (see: 20-30 year olds) who are left to carry the film. In spite of their lack of charisma, they certainly add some color where the film needs it.The narrative at hand isn't particularly inventive, but is a nice throwback to 80's teen splatter flicks that would likely make Roth proud. It's a shame though that the film is so uneven and comes unraveled towards the end. Director Ti West was left out of the cutting room and it shows. While it serves its purpose as a campy homage to Roth's original and the genre itself, the film can't help but succumb to its own short-comings. Just as it gets good it ends abruptly, leaving many questions looming over the viewer's head. Perhaps someday West's cut will surface, but in the meantime, warts and all, \"Cabin Fever 2\" is an acceptable if tough-to-love follow-up. Recommended for those horror fans with a sense of humor and an appreciation for b-movie slop and absolutely nobody else.",

The first was a brilliantly written and executed horror comedy, which set Eli Roth up as the heir apparent to Sam Raimi. I had never seen a movie which blended pee-your-pants hilarity with puke on your shoes gore so well since the Evil Dead films. (Well, until he went and made the ham-fisted Hostel films. But whatever.) Well. Then there is Cabin Fever 2. For one, it suffers the fate of many sequels; it takes place at a prom, not a cabin, so the title makes no sense. This will prove to be the first of many problems. The acting was ridiculous. Not over the top, intentional ridiculous. \"A very special Lifetime movie...\" ridiculous. The effects were terrible. The direction was... well, it seems like somebody just left some cameras running, and went out for a sandwich. The dialogue actually follows the pattern laid out above almost all of the time. To call the writing counter-intuitive is paying it too high a compliment. Because the word \"intuitive\" is still included in that description. And finally, a word to all those of you railing against me, shouting from your armchairs \"It's just supposed to be a stupid, entertaining movie!\" Well guess what. I love Godzilla movies. I loved and own Snakes on a Plane. Sharktopus is saved on my DVR until I physically delete it. There are plenty of movies that are so bad, they are awesome. CF2 is not. It is just crap.

Ti West walked away from the film only for lionsgate to recut his footage and cap on a jarringly out of place ending that fits so awkwardly into the film. The editing is poor and fairly sloppy in places and the pacing is passable but inconsistent. It begins quite well and it isn't until the last half hour where the quality really started to decline tremendously, reshot ending or not. This is a real shame because the footage that West shot looks great.In terms of the gore, the movie holds nothing back and displays some ultra vile material.

Cabin Fever 2 returns as the sequel to Cabin Fever one which i loved; however, this movie was a complete let down. Cabin Fever 2 takes a more comedic route which is not only funny, but dull, but also, this movie was DISGUSTTINGGG; I'm never usually the type who gets disturbed by these kinds of things but this movie just took it one step too far.The plot is interesting at first, but they wrecked what could've been a great idea: the water bottles (which are contaminated from the first movie) are sent to a high school which is having a prom. Blah blah blah, random stuff happens in the high school which takes up around 30 minutes of the movie then you get to where the officer from the first movie figures out the water is contaminated. After that, the movie goes to the prom which I expected to be not only longer, but more excited but this was a kind of blaaahhh. Eventually, all these 'bacteria cops', or whatever you want to call them quarantine the building so the two students who aren't contaminated try to escape. To cut to the chase, people die, guy gets caught by the police, but the girl escapes. THE END.Not only that, but the movie had some moments when I was just 'really?' For instance: 1) The EPA or 'bacteria cops' just start randomly shooting people despite the fact they don't know whether they're contaminated or not. 2) There are stupid cartoons which I thought were lame and pointless. 3) So many thins aren't explained in the movie so you're just left with a ? 4) The movie was aiming to be funny, but it was stupid and lame. HOWEVER, the movie is very disgusting! Unlike the first, you have MUCH MOREE gore which grossed me out but I'm not gonna spoil the grossness for you. :)So basically, Cabin Fever 2 is a disappointing sequel to a great movie since it was wasted on lame jokes and a stupid plot. The movie IS watchable, so if you have absolutely no movie to choose from, like actually NONE AT ALL, then be my guest and get this movie. This movie is also for you if you're into all that gory crap.I give it a 3/10.",

It is funny, offensively disgusting and well paced. I actually think that it is better than the first film as it is so crazy. Controversially I actually think this is my favourite Ti West film. Possibly because the Producers took his distinctive style and changed his film to be entertaining so you get the best of both worlds, style and entertainment. Ti on his own is often style and no entertainment. This has the bloodiest and most memorable cinematic prom since Carrie (1976). On second thoughts, it has to be the bloodiest cinematic prom ever!

Also, there was no story & the acting was horrific. I wasn't expecting a rehash of the first movie, but I was at least expecting a halfway decent movie.Rider Strong was smart by having his character covered in make-up & killed off in the first few minutes. I am sure that was the only way they could get him to do the movie. If I were him, I would beg them to remove my name from the credits. I wouldn't want to be associated with a piece of crap like this.",

However I can say that this movie is really weak in story line, terrible in acting, no point at all...The movie starts off with mutated guy, I think he's from Cabin fever 1 or I could be wrong, and get's smashed by a school bus. Then it leads on to the story of high school students and their prom night.Movie started very interesting and different to other gore movies. But rest of the story line falls into a deep trench where it can't save or redeem itself. Where to begin talking about all the bad sequence in this movie First of let's talk about the actors. Policemen, can't remember his name, his voice is very high and weird. He is one of those dumbass cops you see in movies. He comes out viewing the accident and tells the driver that he hit a moose. Dude come on... when this line was said I thought the policemen was up to something, since I didn't watch Cabin fever 1 all sorts of thoughts passed through my mind. But no I just find out that he's a dumbass. Also other actors that I won't go deeply into, the principal with his gay bald friend and his attitude towards the main character, the karate guy whom is terrible at acting and is just good at shouting, the biology teacher who has the face of weird mutated animal, I thought she was infected as the movie started xD, main characters fat friend who acts like an emo and acts unnecessary in the film.This is all I would talk about, the acting, because if I talk about all the bad parts about this film, I would complete writing a speech for the nation",

Don't get me wrong its watchable in a kind of tongue in cheeky way but you wouldn't really have thought it was a sequel and it certainly didn't seem to follow on from the first film. The only thing that does follow on really is the disease and even then its not the same as in the first film. It starts of in the woodlands where it left off in Cabin Fever and seems to start off really well, until the credits roll, then omg, wait until you see the credits you will know what i mean. Rider Strong takes the first bill and believe me you wont realise where or who he is in the film unless you read some of the other reviews, blink and you miss him. You also have the dumb copper in this film too from the first one. But thats it, thats where the similarity stops. So basically if you wanting a continuation of the first film, with the same disease and atmosphere,or even answers or a cure forget it as this film is just so different. Its one of them films that is only good for a Friday night when your drunk.",

            "content": "You know, Eli Roth made something really special out of Cabin Fever 1, it was horrific and scary, and also funny at times, creating really special characters, and the movie itself was a ride that really built up slowly, in a very good way.Now, with Cabin Fever 2, Eli Roth didn't come back to have any part in it (sad, because you'd have thought he have planned out a series), but surprisingly, it's not that bad. It really starts off mimicking a teen, high school movie, and uses the school as the entire setting. The only returning character is the \"Yeah, man!\" cop from the first one, and he really is enjoyable as always. The other characters are brand new, though, and while they aren't really special at all, you want to see them live.Now, the best thing about this movie is it's gross imagery that happens to have nothing to do with the virus. This movie is the type to focus on fat lunchroom ladies with moles, cleft lipped teachers, acne proned school girls putting on makeup, a naked obese girl in a pool. These are the things that really give the movie such a different type of gross humor, and it actually overshines any of the gore or injuries. It overall is a completely different movie than Cabin Fever 1, which really is a shame, there's actually not even any scary or jump out parts in this movie, it's more of a campy comedy! But this movie is worth renting when you're getting drunk with some buddies. It's not too long, and it gets a little random and sloppy at the end, but there's no doubt there'll be another, so I say they might as well bring it on!",

Sure it was entertaining enough, but that can't make it good. The characters were pretty much the same as any other movie about teenagers, the nerd, the jock bully, so on and so forth. The lead actress was horrible, and a bad casting choice by the director, then again that doesn't surprise me. The police officer from the first film is back, and is the best character.

OK, it was cheap, sticky-taped together then chucked lovelessly aside by the director, but it's a fun, and funny, camp, cheesy comedy-horror. It isn't intended to be the next blockbuster, never was, and most certainly never will be, but the acting was believable, the story was entertaining, the effects were fun, and the lead actor is very cute!

Sadly what I got was a rushed, unimaginative mess. So why is it that I can't stop watching it? Well... allow me to elaborate using simple Pros and Cons.CONS: This movie has no plot, no meaning, no premise, no story, no script. It's tacked on as by means to gross a few critics and cash in on the first film's name. Within the first hour of the film I am treated to an angsty teenage 'geek' and his chunky, horny, filthy-mouth friend. Their Highschool years are almost over, the main character wants to be loved, and the fat kid wants to get laid. Sound familiar? Yeah, I was under the impression that I was watching 'Superbad' too. Toss in a bully and a school Prom and you have yourself another teenage drama. We've seen this Highschool teenage drama in far too many films, and it's unfortunate this film is plagued with the same treatment. Luckily the last 0:30:00 of the film changes everything, and this is where the PROS begin.PROS: Gorehounds, you will love this film. This film is 'Carrie' with blood, guts, infections, breasts, genitals, infected breast/genitals, vomit, feces, glued finger-nails, urine flavored punch, smashed faces, and the list goes on. The shock factor is RED HIGH in this film. While the gore isn't necessarily the strong point, it's all the other creative methods of shock value that will have even the grotesque veterans cringing. It's not necessarily the shock itself that had me hooked, but the creative methods invested in the shocks. As the movie progresses you start to think about different ways the infection can actually spread when you have a school full of vulnerable teenagers. The possibilities are endless! CONCLUSION: I gave this film a 4/10. It's riddled with plot holes, shallow characters, overused plot, and horrible dialogue. BUT, if you've come to expect a Cabin Fever film, then you'll be happy to know the shock value is abundant. It's that reason alone that I gave this film a 4. Gorehounds will be ecstatic at the film's creative direction to an infectious genocide. While I was still slightly disappointed with its departure from the woods and into the realm of Highschool, I still managed to leave the film with a slight grin on my face.Give it a chance. Wait until a DVD release and rent it if you still feel indecisive. By no means is it better than the first film, but it's still a worthy mention. Slightly below mediocre, it has its moments...",

Instead, it focuses having extensive scenery of extremely grotesque nonsense that doesn't add any positive energy or excitement from beginning to end.It's not just too foolishly gruesome to watch, it's too grueling to experience in the worst imaginable expectation that engraves scars. It takes more risks with its material to raise the level of shock value than give audiences a meaningful horror experience.
