            "content": "I was about as excited about watching The Squeakquel as Marie Antoinette was about walking to the guillotine. From the trailer alone, you can tell this was made with the hope of making a quick buck with as little quality as possible. It succeeded, as it made millions of quick bucks at the box office and it just made another when my mother decided to buy the DVD. We decided to spend quality time together watching this thing, and after wasting precious minutes of my life with bad jokes and a stale plot, I have decided to review it.The chipmunk trio is sent to high school, where they deal with stereotypical high school problems and have a rivalry with a female group of chipmunks, The Chipettes. The Chipette's manager is the greedy manager of the Chipmunks from the last movie, seeking to reclaim his former glory by making millions off of the female group's talent. Then, there's a plot where the Chipmunks sign up for a talent show in order to win money for the school's music program, which is losing funding, a plot I'm sure has never before been used.The story is about as interesting as the synopsis. You could make a drinking game based off of how often you can predict what's going to happen next. None of the characters besides the main trio are interesting, the jokes fall flat, and all the high school \"trauma\" the chipmunks deal with is about as real as an episode of Saved By the Bell.Now, I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane or some grade A masterpiece with complex themes and characters. I knew perfectly well this is a kids film and not one of excellent quality at that. It fails nonetheless. Just because a movie is for kids doesn't mean you have to reach for the lowest common denominator in order to entertain them, it doesn't mean you have to give them a thin plot with the freshness of a rotten apple core, it doesn't mean you have to reach for teenage stereotypes that should have been out with big hair, and it doesn't mean you shouldn't at least TRY to put a decent amount of effort into the final product! 3/10.",

This is a PG film that as close to being family friendly than I have seen. I can only imagine the PG rating was due to the fact that the chipettes were darn right sexy - I didn't hear any vulgarity, see any nudity, violence or adult situations.It is really getting hard to find a film where I can take my 9 year old daughter to. With battling giant robots, vampires, and giant smurfs lurking in 3D, this movie was a relief to see.The plot is paper thin - though in its defense it did have an ethical base of family, friendship, and responsibility.The effects were top notch, and there were a few times I even laughed (which was a few more times than I expected).In one word it was - 'Cute' - which is exactly what I think it sought out to be. Nothing more.. Nothing less. Harmless fluff.My 9 year old enjoyed it. And at the end of the day, that's all that mattered to me.This is a film for children. Taken on it's level, I give it a 7. if you want to rate it as art or entertainment for adults? Yeah, mebbe a 2 or 3. But you know what? Some kids were clapping at parts in the theater. To me, that was pretty cool knowing that a film can get kids in a theater clapping for the characters on the screen.So relax. chill.. bring your little ones... and enjoy...",

            "review_title": "Should be renamed, Alvin & yip schmucks! This movie was awful.",
            "content": "In 1958, struggling songwriter Ross Bagdasarian found himself a hit by increasing the speed of the recording, making his voice sound funny. With this, he create three cartoon characters to fit the high pitch: Alvin, Simon and Theodore, The Chipmunks. They were a big hit in the '50s, and once again, a big hit in the 1980s with a TV cartoon series. In 2007, the series once again got remade. This time live-action with some CGI effects. Although the first movie did re-spark an interest in the Chipmunks franchise, many fans weren't exactly impressed with the movie and its 2009 & 2011 sequels. As much as I hate the 2007 remake of 'Alvin and Chipmunks', this Squeakquel was downright insufferable. In the movie, Alvin (Voiced by Justin Long) is downright more sociopathic in his behavior, while Simon (Voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler) is a dumb down and Theodore (Voiced by Jesse McCartney) is just a stupid punchline to be abused and made fun of. The first movie has a story/moral in which the three chipmunks realize that fame and fortune is not all it is cracked out to be, and leave the seemingly superficial lifestyle, and the money, behind to enjoy an apparently better down-to-earth life. Yet, it's forgotten here, because the movie starts off, how very self-centered, they became. The whole plot feels rushed because there are so many plot elements to throw into the mix here that it never falls into a cohesive storyline. It's a plot that make little to no sense, as the Chipmunks are forced to go to school. I understand, the writers were trying to adapt the old cartoon, but the thing you have to remember is that in the cartoon, the anthropomorphic chipmunks there, were as tall as most human children their age and look more human that its couther parts here. That allowed the show to get away with having singing anthropomorphic chipmunks live like normal children. Here they are regular sized chipmunks so that same idea simply doesn't work. If they were to go to school, wouldn't it be for anthropomorphic animals. Another thing, if they were allow to join a human school; I really doubt their age in chipmunks years match that of a human high school student. Wouldn't they be in middle school? Another thing about the weak plot, is the premise of saving the school music program. The whole music program is barely establish and we never get the why it will be shut down, unless the school wins a music competition. We, the audience, never know why it's important to the school. It's not like the Chipmunks are helping or training any of the students in the music program to win the competition. When you think about it, there isn't any music students established at all. Who knows, if there were a music program in the first place, before the Chipmunks arrived. Added to this stupid premise is the presence of the previous film villain, Ian Hawke (David Cross) whom plans to use a female version of the Chipmucks to steal the Chipmunks' fame by entering the singing group into the same school music competition. The Chipettes made out of Eleanor (Voiced by Amy Poehler), Jeanette (Voiced by Anna Faris), and Brittany (Voiced by Christina Applegate) really come out of nowhere in the film, and serve nothing, but love interested. They are so hit by the pitch shifting you can't even tell them apart. I don't even, know why they couldn't use voice actors for them. In the cartoon series, they are supposed to rivals to the Chipmunks, but you never see them go one on one, here. The Chippettes in real life were created for the sole purpose of allowing Ross Bagdasarian to make covers of popular girls' songs in addition to the guys' songs covered by the Chipmunks. So the Chippettes are, in essence, the Chipmunks with girl parts. Very hollow characters. There barely any good female leads here. Despite being Dave's love interest, and a key character in the first film, Claire is nowhere to be found here. This is mainly because Cameron Richardson refused to reprise the role, as she strongly disliked being in the first film. The supporting characters that did show up in the film are just awful. Jason Lee is barely in the film as Dave Seville. Zachary Levi as Toby was awful as a Dave's replacement. His sub-plot romantic with the teacher was just not needed, and doesn't help move the plot. Everything about his performance was underwhelming. You really don't get to see the great conflict that Alvin has with Dave in Toby. It was one of the things that made the series stand out! The jokes are mostly misses than hits. The obligatory fart joke, the embarrassingly inaccurate racial stereotypes, and slapstick humor were all badly delivered. Even the cultural pop references don't even make much sense, because the film references a lots of nearly unknown shows that children probably don't watch, like Meerkat Manor or NASCAR on FOX, with the cameo Digger the NASCAR gopher. The film is disturbing, as it already portray pedophilia and bestiality like themes with human beings lusting for naked under aged chipmunks. Add, references to 1991's Silent of the Lambs and 1976's Taxi Driver, and you got a movie that makes you wonder if this movie is truly a kid movie. Depending who you are, the pop songs used in the film could seem brutally murder or watered down. It didn't bug me, too much. The 3D gimmick kinda did its job, but the whole CG & the unrealistic speed it's moving at, makes it hard to watch in 3D at times. Overall: It's nearly unwatchable, even for kids. Instead of watching this movie, go back and re-watched the 1980s cartoons. You'll get more fun out of that, than this.",

Almost none of the kids laughed out loud during the matin\u00e9e viewing (the showing with the most kids in attendance). Some take away comments from the mouth of babes: \"Is it over YET?\" \"I'm bored\" and my personal favorite \"That wasn't so funny at all.\" (poor kid said it over and over again with the \"big\" jokes.) Plus, I had never seen so many kids ready to leave after the first 15 minutes. It didn't get better over the course of the evening.",

            "content": "Saw an early screening. I never saw the first one, but within the context of it being a kids' movie, it was actually quite well made. I actually laughed at the jokes, and I'm 33 and educated. If I were a young kid, I'd love this movie a lot, but I'm way past that and am often quite critical of children's genre films these days. The plot was coherent and the moral issues were clear. The characters stay true to themselves, much to anyone who is a fan of the original cartoon characters, and the dynamic of character triads works well for moral storytelling.The moral lesson to be taught is about learning to be selfless and considerate of others. This is explored through Alvin and his ego problem, and the consequences it has on his friends and family. Other characters have their own arcs as well, and they read clear and convincingly.On the downside, I think there are some choices that hurt the quality. Dave, the most famous human character in the franchise is probably in the film for about 5 minutes total, however the human characters we're left with are good performers with decent subplots. I did not care for the clich\u00e9 use of a fart joke, but I forgive it because there was only one, and it was used in a way that's actually still funny to adults.Sure, it's not the most intellectual film for an adult audience, but it serves its purpose and achieves its goals, despite being the result of commercialism. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to take their small kids out to a movie.",

            "content": "This movie just fails on so many levels. It is terrible, I couldn't even sit through it. Don't watch it, ever, don't even show it to your kids, because they might like it at the time, but they'll get brain damage or something. So just don't check it out, definitely not, if you have to pay for it.Okay, let's start with the title. Squeakquel? Really? What the hell is that? Squeaking sequel? Did the producers think this was a funny and clever title? Let me tell you something: IT'S NOT! Moving on. The jokes. They're not funny. A poor old lady in a wheelchair falling down the stairs? Come on! Who wrote this crap? Stephen Hawking? (You see, that's an example of a bad, tasteless, offensive joke. The movie is full of them.)One big problem in the film is, that the supporting characters tend to forget that the Chipmunks are, well\u0085 damn chipmunks and not kids! Squirrels (even if they talk) are allowed to go to school? They need someone to babysit them? They're rock stars for god's sake? Gosh\u0085 Another thing that caught my attention: when those kids put the squirrels into the toilet, isn't that animal cruelty? Shouldn't they go to prison for that or something?All in all, this film is really stupid, badly written and annoying. The studio must be thinking that kids are stupid and all kinds of crap is good for them. Sorry if I cursed a lot, but this movie offended me by how bad it was. It's not the case where something is so bad it's good, it's just very bad.I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. Maybe those who're blind and their hearing is impaired (ba-damm-tss).",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squekquel",
            "content": "I will not deny that I've grown up with the Alvin and the Chipmunks cartoon series on television, and had unabashedly enjoyed their very first cinematic outing way back in the year 2007, formulaic the storyline may be like an extended cartoon episode. That it had raked in enough cash meant a sequel wouldn't be far away, and the logical progression in terms of the introduction of new characters, translated to the ushering of The Chipettes, voiced by Christina Applegate, Amy Poehler and Anna Faris as Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette respectively.But the sequel suffered from having a rather half baked plot in trying to pit one set of chipmunks over the other, and complicated itself by trying to do too much in too little, having to write off their human guardian Dave (Jason Lee) to replace him with nephew Toby (Zachary Levi) who's about as plain as a piece of cardboard, and the very tired Alvin versus his brothers in an all for one and one for none subplot involving his association with the football jocks in search for a higher popularity.Even the villain too was a repeat in having Ian (David Cross) make a comeback, in trying to exploit the Chipettes for his comeback after falling from grace in the first film, without the clunky corporate executive being corrupted by greed and money stemming from good intentions. Here he's manipulative in a child-like fashion through and through, and you can see his grand plot from a mile away when he tries to isolate one of the Chipettes whom he thinks will be a better solo artist at the expense of the rest. So it's a revisit of the same old themes of family togetherness over friends, or over careers, which got repeated twice for the different triplets. And it's either me, or somehow having the chipmunks all sounding alike (despite having a different voice cast) got to me this time round. The redeeming grace of having them sing and dance to contemporary pop tunes also took a nose dive here, having the number of performances got reduced, and of course the novelty of having such songs \"munked\" have lost their lustre.However, having it released during this festive period would mean that all will get forgiven, and children will once again be thrilled by the all singing, all dancing chipmunks welcoming the festive cheer. There's a coda at the end of the film as well, so don't just head out the cinema once the credits start to roll.",

            "review_title": "Decent. movie, could have been better...",
            "content": "I can honestly say the movie itself was only decent, I did expect better and this is coming from a huge fan of the chipmunks, dating back to the early 80's when the cartoon series reined. I enjoyed the first 3D chipmunk movie, I watched it a few times and there wasn't too much with it that I did not like. But this movie... it had me smile a few times, other times it kinda let me down because it did not live up to my expectations.One of the BIGGEST disappointments to me was the limited interaction the chipmunks and chipettes had with each other throughout the movie. It certainly wasn't like the old cartoons where they were all together getting into mischief, competing with each other, or just plain having fun doing whatever it was they did. It was always enjoyable watching Alvin and Britney going at it, while the other 4 tried to keep them out of trouble. In this movie their interaction with each other is very limited, and when they do interact, it's mostly in depressing or angry situations. In the old cartoons, sure they squabbled, especially Alvin and Britney... but it was in a fashion that left you smile cause you know deep down they all cared. In this movie they seemed.. cold to each other, especially Alvin vs. Simon.Examples are when Alvin tries to warn Britney about Ian Hawk, Britney turns a cold shoulder to Alvin's advice and ends up on the floor covered in food, angry at Alvin. Another example is a scene showing a depressed Theodore because of his brothers fought for a good portion of the movie, Eleanore comes over to talk to him. Just when you think she's gonna cheer him up, the scene ends abruptly in my opinion. Last example is when Alvin misses the music competition and shows up late, Britney just looks at him all sad and says \"BTW, I didn't want to win this way\" then walks away.. what the heck is that? There's also the constant arguing and fighting going on with Alvin and Simon, and Theodore spends a good amount of his time being sad. I was not expecting some chipmunk love story where they all fall for each other and live happily ever after, but I did expect to see them all get along for more of the movie. The majority of the movie was about them fighting and distrusting each other, it's not the image I remember from my youth.I understand that the storyline was that Ian wanted revenge on the chipmunks, and didn't want the chipettes to trust the chipmunks so they couldn't warn them about who he really was. Simon and Alvin we're fighting because Alvin was being his egotistical self, and Theodore didn't like it. The storyline in theory was good; it's the way it was executed that kinda killed it. It felt like they tried to do too much, and accomplished so little. It's like the movie was just a bunch of short random scenes that eventually came together in some fashion, but never felt entirely complete. Again, I think I feel this way because you never really see ALL of the chipmunks together in this one, and it seems to focus on Alvin and Simon a lot more than the other four. Because this Squeakuel introduces the chipettes, by the end of the movie you feel like the chipmunks and chipettes never really got to know each other, then they all end up living together in the end?Besides the limited interaction with the chipmunks and chipettes as a whole, where was Dave? In a hospital bed almost the entire movie. Don't get me wrong I'm not a huge fan of Jason Lee, but jeez why cut Dave out of almost the entire movie? He's part of the Chipmunks franchise, and he made very limited appearances. Instead they put in some nerd cousin of David's who wants to take no responsibility and play video games. Who is this guy? I don't ever remember seeing him before, why take out Dave? I did start to kind of like him by the end, but still.. he was no replacement for Dave.So there's that, those are my biggest disappointments about the movie. Besides the flawed execution of the story, the limited interaction of the munks, and the lack of Dave.. it was enjoyable to watch. I can honestly say unless you are a chipmunk fan from the past, you probably will not like this movie. I am personally hoping for a 3rd movie just to correct the mistakes of this one, and carry on this wonderful legacy. I want to see all 6 munks running around, laughing and playing, and getting into trouble like the good old days.",

While performing on stage, however, Alvin accidentally causes his \"dad\", David Seville (Jason Lee) to have a major accident. Soon Dave is in traction at the local hospital and has called his aunt to care for A, Simon, and Theodore. But, she, too, has a pratfall at the airport and so her grandson, Toby (Zachary Levi), ends up watching the singing rodents. Toby, however, is very young and although he tries hard, keeping up with the chipmunks is difficult. For starters, the chipmunks now attend the local high school, where the girls are gaga for them and the boys are miffed that they aren't getting as much attention. Most importantly, the school's music department needs money so the principal (Wendie Malick) has signed the performing chipmunks up for a \"battle of the high school bands\". Meanwhile, former manager Ian (David Cross) is near-homeless and living next to the music studio where he was once employed. One day, three little GAL chipmunks (voiced by Christina Applegate, Amy Poehler, and Anna Faris) arrive especially to see him, for they can sing and they are hoping to be his new act. Ho, ho, perhaps this is the way for Ian to get back to the top of the biz. Learning about the band battle, he enrolls the female chipmunks at the same high school and insists on that they join the musical competition. What will be the result? This is another winner in the family flick category. The chipmunks are darling and, what a nice turn, we now have the Chipettes, too, those lovable female chipmunks. All of the actors voicing the cute critters do a very nice job. Lee, unfortunately, has very little screen time but Cross, Malick, and all of the others do a fine job. The story, musical numbers, and direction are all great while the wonderful animation is a huge asset, for the chipmunks really are something special to behold. One minor criticism, however, is that the high school students practice \"swirlies\", that is, dunking kids and chipmunks, headfirst, into the toilet. This cruel practice could have been left out. But, all in all, do seek out the Squeakquel, it is fun, fun, and more fun.",

To curb their time, the chipmunks have to go to school. they find their place in school with the singing competition. if they fail, the school's music classes and club will no longer exist.Meanwhile, the arsehole Ian wants vengeance. He finds it in the form of 3 girl chipmunks, called the chipettes. but the chipettes are perfect matches for the chipmunks. this is shown when they meet, along to the song \"I wanna know what love is\" (rock on).The only memorable funny part at which i really didn't have to try to laugh at was when one of the chipmunks broke the TV with the Wii remote. That has become an internet sensation, when some idiot kid doesn't put on the remote strap and throws the remote into the TV.If you hadn't guessed already, the soundtrack is the only good thing about the movie. but anyone can make a good soundtrack.I recommend that you don't watch this movie....at all.

The plot is full of stupid and crazy clich\u00e9s, in every imaginably contrived manner. And the voices of the chipmunks are so high pitched that they hurt my ears and annoy me so much. Even putting my enraged emotions aside, I often could not hear what the chipmunks say, which made me like the film even less.

I really liked \"You Really Got Me,\" \"You Spin Me 'Round (Like A Record),\" and \"Stayin' Alive\" a lot. I hated Ian (David Cross), though. The reason for this is that because he was pure evil! However, all of the mischief that occurred was funny. The romance and competition was nice, too. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved did a good job.

So this movie's straight-line, A to B to C story is a serious drawback.Director Betty Thomas doesn't get a whole lot out of the cast (although, to be honest, I don't expect much in the way of high-caliber acting in movies like this), and the whole thing has a bit of a TV-movie feel, but the animation is rather good, and the film moves moves along at a pretty good clip, so even adults won't get too bored.Certainly, for some reviewers, a film like this, in the final analysis, is perfectly acceptable, since it's \"for kids,\" and thus the only thing that counts is whether it's \"entertaining\" on some basic level, regardless of its actual quality. That's a pretty common attitude toward kids' films, and one that really sells children short, as if they have no interest in character or story. They do, just like anyone else, albeit on a less sophisticated level than (most) adults. For example, I know that a lot of reviewers hated \"Hotel for Dogs\" but that film had an engaging story, well-drawn characters and a story that, while ultimately predictable, still held a few twists and turns.

Now the chipmunks are with the babysiter's lazy grandson, Toby. Oh yes, at school The Chipmunks met \"The Chippets\". The Chippets are the girl version of The Chipmunks, and now somehow go to the same school now! Ian Hawk was homeless one day and found The Chippets and started to become rich again. Meanwhile, The Chipmunks were losing popularity so they wanted The Chippets to join them instead of being with Ian since he was being so bossy. Towards the end of the movie, there's a talent show for $25,000. The Chipmunks wanted the Chippets to preform with them. But, Ian was gettng ready to take the Chippets to the airport, Alvin drives a toy motercycle to save the girls. After Alvin gets the girls, Ian finds them and drives a toy helecopter. Somehow, they got the remote to the helecopter and was able to drive back to the high school and won the talent show. Dave returns during the talent show and decides to keep The Chippets as 'family\". At the very end, Alvin and Dave flick on and off the lights arguing about school and that Alvin isn't tired to go to bed. Aa Dave tries to come to Alvin when he still has crouches on, Alvin switches the light off and dave slips on a random skateboard and falls. Funny, right?

They are quite literally the female version of the Chipmunks. Where's the thought in that?\"The Squeakquel\" ushered in the Chipettes and a way for Ian (David Cross), the now demoralized and homeless music exec, to get back into the limelight. When Dave (Jason Lee) was hospitalized due to Alvin's recklessness--Again!--the Chipmunks had to stay with Dave's Aunt Jackie (Kathryn Joosten). That plan never took effect because she was hospitalized as well, so her grandson Toby (Zachary Levi) ended up watching the Chipmunks at Dave's home.Another new development was Alvin (Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler), and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) being enrolled in school because that's exactly where little talking rodents should be; in a high school with people. The Chipmunks were requested to enter a music contest on behalf of the school to raise $25,000 for the school's music department. That seemed like an odd request to me. I'm thinking the principal would ask a mega-famous singing group to simply donate $25,000 to their new high school. But that's just me.On to the Chipettes. Their intrusion was as contrived as their very existence. They made their way to Hollywood where they wanted to meet the Chipmunks and launch their own singing career (I did say they were a female carbon copy of the Chipmunks right?). They were swooped up by Ian (David Cross) who hadn't learned his lesson from mistreating the Chipmunks and was going to ride his new trio back to the top.The Chipettes were probably the worst part of this movie. Besides being a knock off of Alvin and the Chipmunks, they were a sassy, gyrating, female group singing about \"all the single women\" in a kids movie. Was that really the best song you could think of for them to perform?I don't want to put this movie's failure all upon the shoulders of the Chipettes because there was plenty of lousiness to spread around to everyone.

So there is no need to squeak that a sequel was not coming because that was not going to happen. So here we have \"Alvin and The Chipmunks: The Squeakquel\". Alvin, Theodore, and Simon are back at it in creating havoc on their caretaker with their shenanigans; this time the caretaker is Toby played by Zachary Levi. Jason Lee does return in a smaller cameo role as Dave, the Chipmunks caretaker of the original. In this go-around, The Chipmunks go to school and discover the realities of campus life. Because having singing chipmunks in a high school is such a reality, right. Alvin has just slapped my face! Alviiiiiiiiiiiin!!!!!! Ian, the villainous record producer from the original, returns once more; this time around he is homeless, unemployed, and out-of-his-luck until he discovers some chipmettes (yes, female chipmunks) of the old block who also possess singing talent as the chipmunks. Ian uses the \"little ladies\" to seek revenge on the Chipmunks and then\u0085 Do I really have to elaborate more on the plot of a singing chipmunks movie? This sequel does have some pop culture originality as its predecessor, but it does run its course after the first 30 minutes of the film. There were a few guilty-pleasure laughs at sporadic times as I also got in the first one; but not too many! However, you have to take it with a grain of salt (not referring to the Chipmunks literally) on this type of genre. It is what it is! Director Betty Thomas could not have done more with this material. Even though I would of have liked to see more of the idealistic Dave and less of the moronic slacker Toby. \"Alvin and The Chipmunks: The Squeakquel\" I guess is squeaky clean for kids to enjoy but not recommended for adults who constantly squeak through children movies. *** Average",

The Squeakquel not so much. There's no effort to even mask the predictability in this one, the filmmakers just concede to the fact there are no surprises. The acting is noticeably worse, Jason Lee essentially being replaced by the far less appealing Zachary Levi is the main contributor to this problem. And worst of all the shallowness of the plot can't be redeemed by numerous hit songs getting 'munked', like achieved by its predecessor.The major upside to the movie is still the song and dance numbers, which are turned up to eleven thanks to the arrival of The Chipettes. Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor (voiced by Applegate, Faris and Poehler respectively) provide two things: firstly, a reason for more girls to watch, secondly, and most importantly, the chance for the film to include female tunes. Its these 'cute girl' routines which provide the bulk of the enjoyment as Alvin, Simon and Theodore's music acts become tired very fast.Of particular annoyance to me is something that has become increasingly popular in Hollywood: big names being vocally unrecognisable. It occurred in the first Alvin and then again most recently in Planet 51. Why oh why would you use well-known actors if you can't tell it's them? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of having them at all? Any old person can have their voice synthesised digitally to sound like a chipmunk, is it purely so their names can be included on the poster and in the trailer? Well, it is a real shame, because if I lured in talent like Long, Poehler and Faris I would make more out of it than name-dropping.2 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",

            "content": "Almost everyone knows about Alvin and the Chipmunks. The cute, furry little chipmunks that sing for a living. This film follows them good, but something could have been better. I love the first Alvin and the Chipmunks film, but I never was a fan of the series.Pop sensations Alvin, Simon and Theodore end up in the care of Dave Seville's twenty-something nephew Toby (Levi). The boys must put aside music super-stardom to return to school, and are tasked with saving the school's music program by winning the $25,000 prize in a battle of the bands. But the Chipmunks unexpectedly meet their match in three singing chipmunks known as The Chipettes -\u2013 Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette. Romantic and musical sparks are ignited when the Chipmunks and Chipettes square off.Now the CGI was very well done. The Chipmunks look even more real this time around. The interactions with them were perfect, almost as if they really are there in front of the actors. The acting was good. I wish they showed a little more of Dave Seville, as it wasn't the same without him around with the Chipmunks. The Chipettes were an good inclusion. But I felt as if there wasn't any bonding between the Chipmunks and Chipettes. It felt rushed, which is one of the problems I had with this movie, like the last. It felt like they rushed through this just to keep the kiddies awake. I felt more character development could have been shown. I was expecting something more with the ending. And expecting a little more rivalry, between the Chipmunks and Chipettes, and the Chipmunks themselves.All in all, good movie. A nice little piece of entertainment. If you are a fan of the last movie, or a fan of the Chipmunks in all, you'll enjoy it. But if you are a big movie buff who is expecting something massive, you might want to buy a ticket to another movie.",

            "review_title": "Good film for families",
            "content": "I'm puzzled by the number of poor reviews some are giving this film. It's not The Godfather, Shutter Island, or Scent of a Woman. Heck, it's not even Star Wars.This is Alvin and the Chipmunks, for crying out loud. If you want deep messages, incredible dialogue and profound story, go rent 2001: A Space Odyssey.The message of this film is plain and simple: family is your most important resource, and sacrificing it to attain your own goals will come back to bite you BIG TIME. In a day and age where family is often portrayed as being in the way of achieving your life goals, it's a big relief to see a film that gives kids a strong moral message like this.Alvin's egotistical antics and selfishness are brought out in this film. He is led on by the jocks and is allowed on the football team. The fact that he isn't even that valued by the team is evident in that he wasn't even put in the game till they were almost defeated anyway, so what did they have to lose with a (questionably legal) Hail Mary pass? This of course sails right over his head, and instead of keeping his promise to his brother, Simon, he goes out partying. Brittany hit the nail right on the head when she said, \"You don't care about anyone but yourself.\" Alvin wants to retort, but instead swallows hard. When he arrives home, he goes to the bedroom and tries to apologize to his brothers, but of course they are so deeply hurt by his selfishness that they don't even bother to reply! That's a whole new level of hurt right there, and you can tell just how down about the whole thing Alvin is by the sigh he lets out when he sinks into bed.Simon is a good role-model in this movie, because he is the most mature of the three. Dave was wise letting him be in charge, as we can see later when Simon tries (and fails) to hold the family together by making Alvin promise not to miss the sing-off. Another good character trait in Simon is his family values. He highly values his relationship with his brothers, and you can tell how deeply it cut him when Alvin let him be made a fool of with the whole 'litter monitor' joke. Yes, he is a bit anal-retentive and even has a bit of an ego, but it's clear he is the most respectable of the trio.Theodore is also a good character in this film, but not as an example kids should follow. Rather, he is the glue that holds the 'family' together in this film. It was so cool to see Alvin and Simon come to his defense so readily. I don't see too many families where older brothers (at least, more mature ones) would come to the aid of a younger brother like this. When Theodore hurts in this film, it just tears your heart out, because he's so innocent. He's the shy kid who doesn't really fit in, and his vulnerability is very endearing. His heart of gold is most apparent when he tells Eleanor how he thinks she's just fine the way she is. How many guys could be counted upon to be that honest? In the end analysis, Squeakquel isn't the most ground-breaking film of all time. It isn't world-shattering, it's not block-busting, and it's not anything more than fluff when you get right down to it. But at it's heart is a good, clean message that should be something every kid in the world needs to be reminded of every once in a while: Family is your most priceless possession. Cherish it. You'll never realize just how precious it is . . . till you lose it.",

I have a 7 year old son, and my daughter is almost 2. They both had a blast! My 2 year old had fallen asleep on the way to the theatre, but it didn't make her upset to wake up in a movie theatre minutes later, she thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie. I thought the writers did a great job at making a movie so similar to the TV show on when I was a kid, with only minor differences. It may have been obvious to me what was going to happen, but all the kids were really sitting there wondering \"what's next\". That's all we can really ask for.

            "content": "I read reviews of movies like Transformers and see people saying that Michael Bay did various bodily functions on their childhood for completely ignoring the cartoon/comics that started it all. Then I read reviews of the Chipmunk movies where people just call them garbage...and almost never mention the original cartoons. And yet I know that many of the reviewers are my age and grew up watching the cartoons in the 80's (or reruns of the originals from the 60's). The source material isn't Shakespeare...it's a cartoon about singing rodents. Don't ask for too much story.Both the original movie and the Squeakquel are, IMO, very true to the source. They've got heart, they've got slapstick, and they've got plenty of camp and stupid humor that you should really expect from a movie about talking chipmunks. I enjoyed the Squeakquel even more than the original because Jason Lee's \"Dave\" was almost completely non-existent. He's simply a terrible choice for the role. After being incapacitated in the first minutes of the Squeakquel, Zachary Levi's \"Toby\" basically fills in and does a great job. They should have just recast \"Dave\" with Zachary, instead of keeping Jason Lee but realizing that he's terrible in the role.Don't go see this and complain that it was an insult to your intelligence. Go to the movie expecting a bunch of over the top (and often totally childish) humor with some cool music and a good (albeit simple and hokey) family story. If you liked the cartoons, you'll like the first movie and the Squeakquel.",

Now that I have seen this one, I will have to eventually dig up the original Chipmunks movie to see how that one compares. A plus to watching a great animated movie like this is to compare over the years how animation has changed - to see what they are able to do now, and compare it to animation works of years past, which often for their day was groundbreaking.",

To those who refuse to see this film based on what others say I say this, the Chipmunks have been around for 50+ years, and are a world renowned group. This is coming from someone who grew up with the old cartoons, but I realize that the image needed a change if it was to catch on with today's audience, just like it had to in the 1980's.This film, while not as good as the first one, is no where near as bad as it has been rated, and to me, those who give it a 2, 3, 4, or anything less than at least a 7, obviously have been brainwashed with way too much High School Musical or too many serious films and they expect everything to be a masterpiece.To anyone who actually uses their brain, please, chill out, relax, and enjoy the film.",

Neither movie is as good as the timeless TV show or the wonderful Chipmunk Adventure, but in many ways more than one both are cute and harmless movies without trying to be 5-star masterpieces.Alvin and the Chipmunks:The Squeakquel has cons that are similar to its predecessor. As with the first, the film is very predictable with some clich\u00e9d human characters and situations, though in fairness a lot of animated/live action films do have that problem as well. Also it does have some hits and misses in the script with some jokes that parents might groan at. The film is rather short and rushed as well.Faults aside, the film does have an improvement, the performance of Jason Lee as David. In the first he was miscast and out of his depth, here he is much more comfortable and relaxed. Visually and technically, I have little to fault it either. The photography and editing is crisp without being award-worthy, the location work is quite colourful and striking and the animation on the chipmunks again is spot on being very cute. The chipmunks are adorable with voices that are thankfully not irritating, and as with the first Alvin and the Chipmunks:The Squeakquel nails the personalities of the chipmunks, Theodore again being the best realised. And the soundtrack is very catchy, with tuneful melodies and sweet lyrics, which kids will love and adults will possibly tolerate too.Overall, unexceptional but watchable family entertainment. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

Hey, you try to be a chipmunk in high school! I loved the principal in this movie, and the \"battle of the bands\" scenes were great and funny. I also like the \"chippettes.\" They were great.

The whole story outline wasn't the best but it has all the things that make the Chipmunks what they are. Little kids will love it and the adults won't mind watching it with them (though if they watch it too much it will get old).

            "content": "Clearly, most of the people who rated this movie poorly are those who are unfamiliar with the Alvin and the Chipmunks brand. The plot of the this movie wasn't great, but the film was dead on with the way the main characters were portrayed. Alvin, the mischievous, always getting into trouble... Simon, the genius, going toe to toe against Alvin's shenanigans... and Theodore, the big-hearted, trying to keep the peace between his two brothers. Even Jason Lee is dead on as Dave.Some people commented on how 'crazy' it is for chipmunks to go to school with humans, but that's the whole point! It's already crazy that they talk, sing, wear clothes, and see a human as their dad, so what's one more thing? Besides, I do believe they went to school during the series in the 80's. If you had an issue with it being HIGH school, I can see that, because the chipmunks were suppose to be, in theory, comparable to kids 8-11 years old, so elementary school would have been more appropriate, but either way, if my memory serves me correctly, the original characters did go to school with HUMANS.The bottom line is that this movie just isn't for everyone. If Alvin and the Chipmunks were before or AFTER your time, then maybe you just won't get it. As a matter of fact, if you know you didn't grow up with Alvin and the Chipmunks yourself, then don't waste your time taking your kids to see the movie either, because you will surely ruin it for them. As a kid of the 80's, I don't really need of \"thought-provoking\" Academy Award plot... I just like seeing the revamped animation of some of my old favorites on the big screen.",

It would be different if it were a chipmunk high school but no, they go to a human high school where they have to worry about not getting stepped on.

Basically after brother pop stars, the Chipmunks, Alvin (Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney), put their carer Dave Seville (Jason Lee) in the hospital, they need someone else to look after them. It appears that their Aunt Jackie (Kathryn Joosten) is the person who is going to do that, but she ends up in hospital too, and twenty-something games nerd, Dave's nephew Toby (Zachary Levi) is the only one left. Arrangements are made for the Chipmunks to put aside their stardom and go to school, tasked by super fan principal to help save the music program with the upcoming battle of the bands competition with a funding prize of $25,000. Meanwhile, the Chipmunks old meanie Ian Hawke (David Cross) is living in the basement of JETT records on scraps from dumpsters having lost his reputation, but his luck changes when he finds three female chipmunks, the Miller sisters Brittany (Christina Applegate), Eleanor (Amy Poehler) and Jeanette (Anna Faris). The Chipettes as they call themselves turned up in a parcel to find Ian, and after proving themselves to be good singers, he hires them and with some lies to convince them he still has a career, he starts scheming his way back into business. The Chipmunks are having a hard time getting on in school with bullies and jocks bringing them down, but they are perked up when the Chipettes turn up to put themselves forward to represent the school. The principal decides the only way to settle which of the two furry bands should represent the school in the competition is to have a sing off contest, and the winner will do it. Alvin is neglecting his brothers, trying to fit in with the guys who were originally picking on him, and Ian is forcing the Chipettes to change the way they are, by having Brittany as the lead singer and the other two just back up. The Chipettes know that Ian is nasty when he locks them in a cage, and Alvin goes to rescue them just before the singing competition, and they arrive just in time for both the Chipmunks and Chipettes to perform. In the end, all the apologies are made, Ian loses his career again, Dave, out of hospital watches the six furry friends perform, and allows the three newbies to stay with them. Also starring Kevin G. Schmidt as Ryan, Chris Warren Jr. as Xander and Bridgit Mendler as Becca. The choice of songs with the helium voices, including \"You Really Got Me\", \"You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)\", \"Put Your Records On\", \"Hot N Cold\", \"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\" and \"We Are Family\" are certainly more fun to hear. The squeaky voices are still a little annoying, the live actors are cheesy, and the story is patchy and could have used a little work, but I suppose it is a tiny bit better than the predecessor, an alright part-animated comedy adventure.

On top of all that, Alvin, Theodore and Simon are joined by the slick high-pitched harmonies of the Chipettes, an equally talented trio of female chipmunks\u2014bookish Jeanette, big-boned Eleanor, and sexy Brittany (errr... did I say sexy?

As lame as it is, it certainly surpasses anything the screenplay possessed. After Dave has an accident, the three singing chipmunks are sent to live with an aunt and go to school. Then she has an accident due too Dave's idiotic nephew. After a bout with bullies they are set to help the school win a talent contest. Directed by Betty Thomas with Alvin, Simon and Theodore looking fantastic but the story is lame. Thomas has directed a broad range of films from the excellent Howard Stern bio-comedy Private Parts to the Sandra Bullock rehab 28 Days. This is hardly one of her superior projects. Jason Lee as Dave spends the whole film laid up, which is probably for the better seeing that he is second to CGI chipmunks. David Cross plays an idiotic villain out to exploit a female chipmunk band. He must endure the embarrassment of dressing up as a female chipmunk that looks straight out of Donnie Darko's worst nightmares. Zachary Levi plays Dave's lazy nephew who sleeps and plays video games. One supposes that anything is better than being part of this film. Terrible family entertainment that should squeak underneath one's tires as the car backs out of the driveway. Score: 2 / 10",

Of course I saw the movie a few years ago and was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a bad film. I was worried about the CGI and thought it would be cheesy, but it wasn't all that bad. There were even some great catchy songs that you found yourself singing too as well. So the now we have the sequel, this is where I was starting to wonder if this was more meant for money. We have some pretty well known actors playing the chipmunks and the chipettes, which I thought was a bit silly since their voices are put through a synthesizer anyways, so what's the point of having a big name when you already have Jason Lee? This played just like a typical chipmunk episode and I wasn't that impressed with it. Not as bad as you'd think, but still this movie needed some major work, even if it is meant for the kids, which we know this was more for the fans.During the Chipmunks' benefit concert David is injured. Dave must recuperate and is forced to leave his aunt to look after the Chipmunks. Arrangements are also made for them to go to school. After another accident, the Chipmunks are left in the care of Toby. Meanwhile, Ian Hawke lives in the basement of JETT Records. Three singing female chipmunks, also known as the Chipettes, emerge and Ian hires them as plot to get back at the Chipmunks and revive his career. While at school, the Chipmunks are bullied by jocks and visit the principal's office. They discover that the principal is a huge fan and wants them to help raise money for the music program by participating in a contest. Meanwhile, when Ian receives his daily newspaper, he is shocked to find the Chipmunks on the front page. After he reads the story, he quickly sends the Chipettes to school. The Chipmunks and the Chipettes will compete against each other in the Battle of the Bands contest.So while the movie doesn't fall flat on it's face, it definitely was not needed. There are moments where I thought it was a little too silly and predictable, not to mention I'm confused how a high school girl finds a chipmunk to be hot? The jocks pick on the chipmunks which I thought was silly, I mean, really? Let's be serious, let's say that this is a real life situation and talking and singing chipmunks really exist, how could you possibly feel tough by picking on a chipmunk? But I do have to admit that the meeting between the chipmunks and the chipettes was pretty cute. The chipette's rendition of Single Ladies was pretty catchy. I had a couple of laughs with Ian trying to cover the concert when the girls back out. Like I said I think this was more meant for the kids than the adults and also of course more for the money, but I guess it's pretty harmless fun. Hard to hate this movie when the leading characters are singing chipmunks, they were awesome in the 80's and they're still pretty cool to this day. However I would recommend this movie more for the kids vs. the adults, at least the adults still have the cartoon with \"Alvin, Simon, Theodore! Doo Doo, Doo Doo Doo Doo, Doo Doo, Doo Doo Doo Doo!\". Well, you get the idea.5/10",

However, in this furry family film, when you put a trio of tree dwellers in a studio, you get a bunch of high-pitched cover songs.With Dave (Jason Lee) in hospital after a chipmunk related accident, the boys, Alvin, Simone and Theodore (Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney), are entrusted to his nephew, Toby (Zachary Levi). Required to attend high school, the Chipmunks make a big splash on campus when they're asked to save the school's music program. But before the boys can collect the prize money, they must best an all-female chipmunk group (Amy Poehler, Anna Faris and Christina Applegate).A perfunctory sequel to the 2007 original, The Squeakquel maintains the same low expectations as its predecessor: the story is sorry, the songs are boring, and the star- studded vocal cast is superfluous.Besides, the only time you're libel to find chipmunks inside of a high school is when the cafeteria is serving mystery meat for lunch.

Even my three kids with me did not react too much to the supposedly \"funny\" scenes. I was positively bored silly for most of the movie. Alvin's naughtiness is very nasty here in this movie, and unfunny for me.The only time my attention perked up was that first song number by the Chippettes. Their harmonized version of \"Put Your Records On\" was very cute. Their take on \"Single Ladies\" is also quite fine. In contrast, all the songs by the Chipmunks sounded very old and dated. The Chippettes are the only positive aspect of this movie. The special cameo of young Filipina singer Charice singing Alicia Keys' \"No One\" merits an additional star.After the movie, my kids only remembered a scene about underwear wedgies, and a part where a grown man wears a dress while doing hand puppets. I only remember laughing once, and that was a scene with Wendie Malick (Nina Van Horn of TV's \"Just Shoot Me\") as the school principal jumping up and down with glee (yeah, stupid scene, hehe). If you think those memorable scenes sound bad, you can imagine what more the rest of this film!",

            "content": "I really like how the surprise introduction of the Chipettes saves this film from being too boring as the beginning just shows the chipmunks wrecking havoc and causing trouble, this time, Toby (unlike Dave) rarely cares about their mischief but later on he does become protective and caring and starts taking on some responsibility. The Locker Reveal scene in the film was probably the most heartwarming and romantic part, when the Chipmunks and Chipettes meet each other in the school hallway for the first time, they both are love struck upon seeing each other (look at their faces, they flash toothy smiles at each other) but it is ruined when Ian manipulates the Chipettes into making them not trust the Chipmunks and make them think they are evil. Ian's role is quite evil ad I think this will terrify the kids. Jason Lee's role was reduced significantly here, he barely appears but I'm glad Mike Mitchell expanded his role in the third film. Overall, this film may be flawed but it's freshly squeezed comedic energy and great family fun.",

The colors are soothing, and the comedy is mild.The script provided nice time. I loved smartly written moments like how the nerd boy, played by Levi, had to supersede the chipmunks at the party with his singing, so his old flame got the chance to hear his feelings for her rightly. Plus smartly made moments, like the mission of rescuing the she chipmunks with a motorcycle chase.So, eventually, what on earth the haters was yakking about??!!You know what are the real problems of this movie? I'll tell. Not having Jason Lee as the co-lead; which was done for never-understood reason. One fart joke I hated. And the fact of the movie as short.However, it does satisfy me the way it is, and clearly for the aforementioned reasons. Therefore, some reviewers made me angry with remarks like: \"Terrible Movie\". Well, I think the approach, that these reviewers use to evaluate such a movie, is the real \"Terrible\"!This is light fun, as non fat cake. It worked / works / will work for me.

            "content": "With a plot that's ore pointless one second to the next and its irritable stars being more irritable than ever, Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel certainly never improves upon its counterpart and instead makes for a film that only feels fun to watch in an ironic sense. When it comes to these films, it's hard not to comment on the use of the CGI chipmunks throughout the film- and somehow the CGI this time around ended up getting both better and worse. It feels like video game level graphics at times, never blending in with its surroundings and clunking around at almost laughable levels. Other times the CGI is so detailed and in depth it feels like a joke, as if these were completely different characters than what we just saw 10 seconds ago. As with before, the acting is pretty bad this time around, although Zachary Levi is thankfully a lot more tolerable than Jason Lee's overdone performance in the last film. The plot in this film is also absolutely ridiculous, pointless, and quite honestly full of plotholes- not that any younger viewers would care- but you can't help but wonder towards the end why the hell any of this had to happen in the first place. The establishment of highschool characters make the film feel even more joke like- its characters soon being made of a cast of incredibly obvious stereotypes that can just prove to be hard to watch at times. The only thing I can comment on positively in this film is that, again, a few of the songs are catchy and the film is rather entertaining throughout. But as mindlessly entertaining as it may be, it still can't get the thoughts out of my head about interspecies relationships of chipmunks and high schoolers- and the several R-rated movie references that Alvin makes for some unknown reason. In the end, Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel is a sequel best left ignored and offers nothing to the subpar original than the addition of a wacky title.My Rating: 3.7/10.",

We find The Chipmunks now at school, and due to some embarrassment it seems as though Jason Lee found a loophole in his contract to be mostly absent. Considering the chipmunks became superstars at the end of the first film, it was strange to see them settling in at a school and auditioning for a school competition. It also gave a good message about sometimes helping others. Alvin is an annoying prick for most of it, but Theodore is just insanely cute. David Cross puts in the exact same performance as last time. Although it is harmless family fun, the stupidly dated movie references and same story mean that the only reason to see this is if you are a huge Chippettes fan.",

Nobody is endearing when they get entangled with the trappings of fame - not even chipmunks.It seems like whenever a writing team runs out of ideas, the easiest thing to do is go bigger. Then unfortunately, the sense of brotherhood and camaraderie gets lost.Don't make fun of me for talking about 'brotherhood' and 'camaraderie' in relation to chipmunks!

I am probably one of the last people to see this film in a theatre, I saw it at a very cheap theatre that shows second run movies. I see that viewers only gave it a 3.5 rating and almost a third rated it a one on a scale of 1 to 10! Come on people it isn't that bad. Its a cute film you can take your kids to see, how often does that come along? I was shocked that there wasn't one curse word in it. I can almost picture the script conferences when they were making this film. They said hey if three cute chipmunks are good, lets add three more and make them female! What a novel concept.My main complain is that Jason Lee's character (Dave) was offscreen so much of the time and I thought Toby was a poor substitute. Lets face it, Alvin, Simon and Theodore need a more positive role model. I had almost forgotten what a pathetic loser Ian was until I watched this. When I first saw The Chipmunks in 2007, I thought he was one of the creepiest looking bad guys I've ever seen in a kid's movie. SPOILER ALERT, he even locks those three cute girl chipmunks in a cage just like he did in the first film. He gets a great comeuppance in the end, it involves his groin.

Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakwuel is a very unpleasant sequel that would much rather rely on being a jukebox musical and feature goofy gags instead of telling a good story and show its purpose of its existence in the first place. And I would like to state that as a school movie, it barely has any story to it. All the chipmunks have ever done is go through exactly the scenarios in many of school movies before. They meet the girls (which would be the Chipettes in this case), one of them ditches the trio to play sports, and they struggle with a music competition to win the money for the school. That's all we ever gotten, it wouldn't have much of a purpose for the sequel. The same can be said for the characters that are either pointless or completely selfish. And even the direction made the movie seem more of a dance party with a bunch of slapstick instead of a legit movie. I'll give that at least it's not the worst movie based on a cartoon (since Dragonball Evolution came out the same year), but it won't help that this is a painfully average sequel. I would simply recommend to not watch it for how a bland school film it is, but I can only recommend this for those that actually like the first film. I'm saying this since I know there probably may be some people that are nostalgic for this. But for someone as myself that has grown out the entire movie franchise, the thing to describe is pointless and average. This is the kind of school I would drop out.",

They are there to sing and that is by far the best thing about the movie. I couldn't help but tap my feet a little bit. The CGI on the Chipmunks is not good, but the CGI on the Chipettes I found a lot better. The movie also moves very slow. I found myself almost falling asleep a few times.

So thiz \"Squeakquel\" is only a repetition of what we have seen before. The movie is still played by Jason Lee and David Cross. The Alvin Character is voiced by Justin Long. The former Director Tim Hill who also directed \"Garfield\" (2004) now is replaced by Betty Thomas. It's very obvious that the moviemaker's intention is to refresh things up by the appearance of new characters, the Chippetes (the girl's version of the Chipmunks). Members of the Chippetes are Brittany (Christina Applegate), Jeanette (Anna Faris), Eleanor (Amy Poehler). We certainly recognize the trio as creditable Comediennes. I think in some ways, the movie is less musical than the first one. It looks like the Chippetes performance is based on the nowadays hip hop's style. If we look at the human characters, Zachary Levi seems to have more proportion than Jason Lee, both of them don't make us stunned by their performances. Their roles can be replaced easily by other Actors. In the end, I have to say that thiz kind of movie is definitely just for fun.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

Do most sequels ever? The story was below mediocre and basically goes over old ground with a couple of things added to it, one being the Chipettes which is basically a female version of Alvin and the Chipmunks. The acting was below average, I remember it being much better in the first movie and the characters can be annoying at times but there were a couple of scenes when they were funny. The one person who extremely annoyed me constantly was the villain of the movie, all I wanted to do was put a sock in his mouth to shut him up. The animation was done very well and the way they mixed live-action with CGI was done great.There were a couple of funny moments in the movie but other than that, it felt like it was trying too hard. This will definitely entertain children but adults may find this an irritating bore in some parts. It depends on if you liked the Alvin and the Chipmunk cartoons. I used to love watching the cartoons when I was a kid and when the first movie was released, I watched and enjoyed it but watching the second one, I felt that the sequel was pointless. It's been done before but this time, there's the Chipettes. They didn't really add much to the movie in my opinion, it was just a basic repeat of the first movie with females (they're looking for stardom, finds manager, blah blah blah\u0085). There were one or two funny scenes but other than that, instantly forgettable as soon as the movie ends.Read more reviews on: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Drawing near to the pointy, frayed nerved end of these particularly scorching summer school holidays, parents begin the search for anything to entertain and cool down their bored wards. \n\nProviding this single elusive moment of quiet relief is the local fully air-conditioned cinema.  With a seemingly endless stream of children's entertainment the only need greater than the parents to entertain children is Hollywood studio's insatiable passion to regurgitate old themes in vain attempts to satisfy both parents and children alike. \n\nRavishing the treasured childhood archives of Generation X and Y this year alone we have re-imagings of Transformers, Fame, Footloose, Where the wild things are, Nightmare on Elm Street, the list just keeps going.  Safe to say, however, hands down, this has to be the worst and if it wasn't bad enough to breathe CGI life into a trio of singing rodents once, they have added insult to injury and do it twice and made it a sextet.\n\nFor most readers an intro into the concept of the chipmunks is not required, but for those of you doing slightly more interesting things than watching Saturday morning cartons between 1985 and 1989, the chipmunks consist of three preteen squirrel-like rodent brothers who become international singing sensations and torment their adoptive human father Dave on a regular basis.\n\nThe story for this chapter ; After a chipmunk-induced accident leaves Dave (Jason Lee) in traction, chipmunks Alvin (the brash one), Simon (the brainy one) and Theodore (the chubby one) are placed in the unwilling care of a half witted twenty-something family screw-up Toby (Zachary Levi). \n\nForced to return to school (surprisingly, high school) the boys reluctantly put aside there musical superstardom, until amazingly enough, the new principle Dr. Rubin (wonderfully played by Wendie Malick) recognises the boys, and quickly bribes them with the task of saving the school's suffering music program by winning a local Battle-of-the-Bands competition. \n\nWith the grand prize being $25,000 (the exact amount needed), news circulates reaching their ridiculously destitute scheming ex-agent and nemesis from the first film, Ian Hawke (David Cross). Determined to exact revenge on the chipmunks, Ian enrols a rival girl-rodent trio of counterparts known as The Chipettes - Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette into the same school, pitting the groups against eachother.\n\n \nRomantic and musical sparks are ignited when the Chipmunks and Chipettes square off. Will the boys learn their lessons about family and friends and figure out that there is more to life than playing Wii and performing at the Staples Centre?\n\nThe slapstick middle-brow mayhem is well animated for the majority but distinctly goofy. The always charmingly mediocre concept of whiny, serenading rodents found its place on the 80's small screen and that is where the fuzzy pawed heroes should have remained. \n\nBattering viewers with good morals like; beating someone is not the same as winning, self-absorption cause's pain and family comes first, the dramatic contrast to the overly sexualised female Chipettes and overt product placements is a complete turn off.\n\nNot content with just patronising children, the film becomes simply unbearable for parents when the stereotyped, helium voiced, trash-talking fur-balls rattle off a barrage of rip-off quotes from highly inappropriate adult films like Silence of the lambs and Taxi driver.  \n\nA prerequisite for those over the age of 12, earplugs should be sold at the door and warnings should be plastered across the trailers regarding hearing loss and headaches. Still unclear to me is how its 2007 predecessor \"Alvin\" cleared a cool $217 million at the US box office alone, a sheer mystery. \n\nThe surprising array of stars is a definite plus but their talents were dreadfully unrealised. Jason Lee obviously only appeared for one day of shooting due to contractual obligation and was quickly replaced on-screen by comedian Zachary Levi. Levi delivers a plausible but connection-lacking performance as the likeable Toby character.\n\nThe chipmunks voiced by Justin Long, Jesse McCartney and Matthew Gray Gubler and the Chipettes voiced by comedians Christina Applegate, Amy Poehler and Anna Faris were unrecognisable under the computer augmentation. Why pay the money for decent actors if you can't tell it's them?\n\nThe Verdict: Falling far short of filling children's insatiable appetite for talking animals, this careless low-budget enterprise trades in weak reiterations of subplots past. The Squeakquel is as entertaining as your standard breakfast cereal commercial and is as easily forgettable.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 15/01/2010",

The main problem is all the chipmunks and chipettes(I understand introduction of  as they where in cartoon in late 80's till early 90's) but see in the cartoon Theadore and Elanor where 5 yrs old chubby kindergartens. Alvin and Brittany where 7-8 yr olds with bossy tendency and got into loads of trouble. Simon and Jeanette where smart and shy 9-10 yr olds. Still grade school rock/pop star children it wasn't exactly rock or pop music somewhere inbetween weird but worked in show. Though Simon and Jenette who behaved best as makes sense might have utaken some hs classes. They where all still young children. Putting them all in same grade in hs made 0 sense. I only watched this movie out of boredom when it was free on tv for some reason I stumbled upon it and watched it cause it was a train wreck. \n\nsometimes you watch something to see how bad it is. Their would have been less issue if they had all been in grade school fluff it would have been ok if Simon and Jeantte where in middle school and younger four in grade school. with grade or two separating them. would it have fixed movie completely no would it have been better yes. \n\nHollywood failed to know source material so hard.  Their where many little flaws but to do my own history with chipmunks the fact their was no age difference in the live action movies.\n\nI probably would have been ok with it if like Simon and Jeanette where Sr in hs and Alivin and Brittney sophomores in hs and like maybe they go to combined middle school and hs and Theodore and Elanor where in 8th grade.  \n\nSorry for harping on one issue. I just know I could so made movie better. adds another fanfiction to list of things I am working on. The other big issue is why cgi live action mashup they never turn out well all cgi would have been ok as their where cartoon children with chipmunk children in original cartoon of course I prefer pure cartoon style but cgi is better then combining it with unecessary live action.",

            "content": "But the sequel suffered from having a rather half baked plot in trying to pit one set of chipmunks over the other, and complicated itself by trying to do too much in too little, having to write off their human guardian Dave (Jason Lee) to replace him with nephew Toby (Zachary Levi) who's about as plain as a piece of cardboard, and the very tired Alvin versus his brothers in an all for one and one for none subplot involving his association with the football jocks in search for a higher popularity.Even the villain too was a repeat in having Ian (David Cross) make a comeback, in trying to exploit the Chipettes for his comeback after falling from grace in the first film, without the clunky corporate executive being corrupted by greed and money stemming from good intentions. Here he's manipulative in a child-like fashion through and through, and you can see his grand plot from a mile away when he tries to isolate one of the Chipettes whom he thinks will be a better solo artist at the expense of the rest. So it's a revisit of the same old themes of family togetherness over friends, or over careers, which got repeated twice for the different triplets. And it's either me, or somehow having the chipmunks all sounding alike (despite having a different voice cast) got to me this time round. The redeeming grace of having them sing and dance to contemporary pop tunes also took a nose dive here, having the number of performances got reduced, and of course the novelty of having such songs \"munked\" have lost their lustre.\nHowever, having it released during this festive period would mean that all will get forgiven, and children will once again be thrilled by the all singing, all dancing chipmunks welcoming the festive cheer. There's a coda at the end of the film as well, so don't just head out the cinema once the credits start to roll.",

Neither movie is as good as the timeless TV show or the wonderful Chipmunk Adventure, but in many ways more than one both are cute and harmless movies without trying to be 5-star masterpieces.\nAlvin and the Chipmunks:The Squeakquel has cons that are similar to its predecessor. As with the first, the film is very predictable with some clich\u00c3 (C)d human characters and situations, though in fairness a lot of animated/live action films do have that problem as well. Also it does have some hits and misses in the script with some jokes that parents might groan at. The film is rather short and rushed as well.\nFaults aside, the film does have an improvement, the performance of Jason Lee as David. In the first he was miscast and out of his depth, here he is much more comfortable and relaxed. Visually and technically, I have little to fault it either. The photography and editing is crisp without being award-worthy, the location work is quite colourful and striking and the animation on the chipmunks again is spot on being very cute. The chipmunks are adorable with voices that are thankfully not irritating, and as with the first Alvin and the Chipmunks:The Squeakquel nails the personalities of the chipmunks, Theodore again being the best realised. And the soundtrack is very catchy, with tuneful melodies and sweet lyrics, which kids will love and adults will possibly tolerate too.\n6/10",
