            "content": "In the fact-based film The Blind Side, a burly homeless black teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is taken in by the family of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a spunky white Christian mother of two and assisted through school until he achieves success as a football player in high school and college, eventually being drafted in the first round by the professional Baltimore Ravens. The film, written and directed by John Lee Hancock and adapted from a book by Michael Lewis, is undemanding entertainment that lacks a great deal of subtlety but is continuously entertaining and emotionally involving and redefines the true meaning of family values.Michael who is known initially as \"Big Mike\" has been abandoned by his drug-addicted mother and survives in the slums of Memphis, Tennessee only by his wits. He sleeps where he can find a warm place -- a friend's couch, a Laundromat, a school gym -- when a family friend intervenes and helps him enroll in a private Christian high school. Sensing the boys' potential, football coach Cotton (Ray McKinnon) convinces the administrators of the school to admit him although he knows that he will not be eligible to play football unless he can keep up his grades. Seeing Michael alone wandering the streets, he is given a lift and taken home and made a member of the family by Leigh Anne, an interior designer who lives with her husband Sean (Tim McGraw), teenage daughter Collins (Lily Collins), and SJ (Jae Head) an expressive little boy who provides most of the film's comic moments.Living with the Tuohy family allows Michael to learn to trust and to begin to express some of his feelings from a life of poverty and neglect. Michael who is so big that Leigh Anne can hardly find any clothes to buy for him is also gentle and lacks the killer instinct required of a football tackle. Tutored by the adorable SJ and counseled by Leigh Anne to view the team as a family he has to protect, Michael begins to develop his aggressiveness as a left tackle and develops his skills, eventually turning the team into winners. To raise his grades to be eligible for a college scholarship, the Tuohys hire Miss Sue, remarkably performed by Kathy Bates, who admits to the Republican family that she is a Democrat, prompting Sean to remark that he \"never thought they would have a black son before they met a Democrat.\" Besides his grades, however, Michael must overcome several more obstacles that stand in his way before he can enter college.The Blind Side shows Michael Oher achieving a transformation in his life based on his relationship with the family who took him and nurtured him to independence and self-respect. Sandra Bullock delivers an emotionally resonant performance as a woman whose life is enriched by her simple act of kindness and courage to act from her values. While the film breaks no new ground stylistically, it also resists genre clich\u00e9s, has no movie villains, avoids cheap sentiment, and, in spite of patronizing images in its trailers and advertising posters, is a humorous, heartwarming, and satisfying experience. Ultimately, The Blind Side is not a film about sports but about the rewards of showing love and support when it is not always accepted or understood by the community.",

            "review_title": "I can see why Michael Oher was unhappy with this film",
            "content": "First of all, Quinton did a fine job in the lead role. Let's get that out of the way. Great acting job. He took the material he was given and played the role very well.However, this film is pure Hollywood sap, a \"feel good\" movie that picks and chooses factual elements and builds a fictional tale around them. The film loves the character of Leigh Ann (who is really not that interesting, although she is kind hearted and generous), and as a result, Oher is relegated to a shy over-sized charity case with no clue and no skills of any sort, other than his natural kindness and resilient character. That strengthens the focus on Leigh Ann's rescue actions, how she \"saved\" this poor aimless kid and gave him all the life skills he needed to succeed on and off the football field. It resonates with white suburban do-gooder audiences, but it's just not accurate.In truth, Michael Oher was already a very good football player when the Tuohy family took him in. And he had a bold, confident personality that rubbed off on everyone and made him a natural leader. He was a motivated, focused kid who knew what he wanted, but came from an environment where no one really cared or provided support. He was NOT a shy, introverted pathetic case. He just came from a terrible domestic environment and found stability with a nice rich family. The real story of Michael Oher is how he caught the luckiest of breaks and escaped the ghetto jungle and was able to leave all that soul crushing crap behind, and focus on academics and athletics in a completely different upper middle class environment. It's a study in how important environment is in the life of kids and teenagers, and how it can make a huge difference.But what we, the audience, receive is a Hallmark channel film that is nothing more than a lazy, formulaic, fictionalized \"warm your heart\" chick flick couched in a football world. Sassy dialogue, woman-takes-charge scenes, tender moments, etc -- all the usual stuff is there. The film would have been FAR better had it focused on Oher as the lead character, instead of Bullock. No offense to Bullock, who is a fine actor.It is well known that real life Michael Oher was very displeased with this film, and how it portrayed him.",

This was a well made film, perfectly filmed,and great performances by everybody.Leigh Ann Tuohy(Sandra Bullock), seems to have the life most women would envy, a wonderful supporting husband(Tim Mcgraw), and two great kids(Lily Collins and Jae Head). But one day while driving home, she sees, a larger then life teenager which everybody calls Big Mike(Quinton Aaron), when she tries to talk to him, he comes across as a little withdrawn, and is nearly homeless, she decides to take him in, with her supporting family behind her. Leigh finds out his name is Michael Oher, and tries to dig up things about his past, in hopes of helping him, but the question is will she? I really liked this film, it manages to balance humor and drama perfectly. Sandra Bullock gave quite a strong performance, so Quinton Aaron, Lyn Collin, but Jae Head is quite the scene stealer. It also has a good football scene as well. And Kathy Bates is good in her supporting role also. I say see The Blind Side.",

I wasn't excited to see this movie, I'm not interested in sports at all. The movie kept my attention though and well. It moved along quickly and pulled me into the story and left me feeling inspired. I wasn't excited to see a blonde sandy bullock in a sports movie, I think that's what might have turned me off the most, but she did really good job! It's rare to see a movie where there's a really strong lead female character. Whether you like Leigh Anne Touhy or not in the end, she is certainly entertaining and Sandra Bullock does a great job of bringing her onto the screen. The youngest son did an amazing job! So much talent in him. The character of Mike I think could have used a few more lines, even if he's supposed to be shy and reserved. All the actors really did a great job though for the most part. No it's not an epic Oscar winning film, although I wouldn't be surprised if Bullock got nominated for something for her acting. It is NOT loaded with propaganda as the other reviews might suggest. It's a light entertaining pick me up film that would be an excellent choice to bring the family to, most likely the reason why they released it over the Holidays.",

I went in expecting more football, more hits & highlights & as a huge football fan that was one of the main draws of the movie. The football actually takes a back seat to a wonderful story that is well executed by everyone involved. I've always thought Sandra Bulluck has been over-rated, but she nails this role & deserves some recognition down the road. The movie is so fantastic that anyone and everyone can relate and feel connected to the characters. The ideal target audience for this movie is children and adults alike. This movie should be an Oscar contender but I know these types of movies rarely ever win. Definitely deserves my vote!",

When watching the film, one should say this story is about Michael Oher, a man who, with the help of a supportive, slightly wealthy family, was able to overcome his hardships of homelessness and loneliness through perseverance and friendship. But the reality of this film is far from that description. It is more about the stupid sport of football and the rich family taking in Michael. I felt that the film did not put enough into the character of Michael Oher, they instead took away from him. I can see the potential of the character, but the story of the film limits him of almost everything except for being a mindless brute on a field. I know for a fact that the real life Michael Oher is nothing like this, nor ever really was. This film was to shine on the rich family, and the goodness they implanted on the world. In a way, it was selfish to put them above Michael in his own story. Sure Sandra has good acting qualities, but that should not be the basis of the film. Anyway, it was still a movie of an intermediate standard. It lacks in many departments, but the worst is the conversion from the novel to the film. If they had focused more on Michael and not the family, then maybe it would have been a better flick, but alas.",

However, the outcast Michael has serious trauma with his abused childhood and his grades are not enough to join the Crusaders football team of the school. When the wealthy Caucasian Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) sees the youngster walking alone of the cold road, she easily convinces her husband Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) to lodge him home. The Tuohy family welcomes Michael that becomes part of the family and close to the boy S.J. (Jae Head) and his teenage sister Collins (Lily Collins) that helps him against the prejudice and intolerance of their mates in the private school. Leigh Anne and her family adopt Michael and help him to improve his education and their lives change for better. Michael joins the Crusaders and distinguishes in the championship, being invited to join several universities. However he needs get better grades to join Ole Miss where Leigh Anne and Sean had studied and are sponsors. Leigh Anne hires Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) to work as tutor, giving private classes to Michael to improve his grades and be successful in life.\"The Blind Side\" is the wonderful heartwarming true story of a lonely homeless teenager that moves to the house of a Caucasion Christian family that follows the principles of their religion helping the others. The screenplay is magnificent and the top-notch performance of Sandra Bullock is helped by the powerful and enlightened character Leigh Anne and the stunning chemistry with Tim McGraw. This uplifting movie is highly recommended to make the viewer believe that still there are good people in this wild world and a great family entertainment. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Um Sonho Poss\u00edvel\" (\"A Possible Dream\")",

            "review_title": "My take on the Michael Oher story",
            "content": "I'm a sports snob. I strongly believe there's only a handful of truly great sports movies. It's just too difficult for filmmakers to recreate the drama that takes place on the field. So when the Creative Loafers at sportschump.net asked me to review The Blind Side, a sports movie I would never see,starring an actress I really don't like, I was skeptical. But they promised me Jujubees, so I agreed to attend the premiere.I fell into my comfy leather chair at the Cobb Theater Cinebistro in Wesley Chapel, fully expecting to pan everything about the movie. Then a strange thing happened. The film turned out to be pretty good.Blind Side is adapted from Michael Lewis' novel of the same name. Just like the book, the film begins with a narrative of the game in which Lawrence Taylor broke Joe Theismann's leg. According to Lewis, that hit more than any other moment in football history, heightened the need for a strong, left tackle to protect the quarterback's blind side.Enter the Michael Oher story.Oher (Quinton Aaron) is an over-sized, high school kid from Memphis' inner city with no academic records and a crack addict for a mother. He is accepted into a local Christian high school when the football coach recognizes his potential.Early scenes at Wingate Christian High School depict Oher as uncomfortable and intimidated in his new, mostly white surroundings. One teacher describes him as 'a fly in the milk.' Oher never says much, most of his expressions portrayed through mopey, facial gestures. Aaron's performance isn't groundbreaking, unless of course Oher didn't say much in real life. If that's the case, his performance is dead on.After their youngest son (Jae Head) befriends Oher, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw), stumble upon Oher one afternoon roaming the streets, avoiding return to his crime-ridden projects. They welcome him into their home to sleep on their sofa for a night, which becomes a week, which ultimately becomes a legal adoption.Despite Oher's poor grades, school administrators find that he excels in one capacity. He scores a 98% in protective instincts on a high school aptitude test.The Tuohy's, a well-to-do, Southern Republican family with a strong allegiance to Ole Miss, hire a private tutor (Kathy Bates) to help Oher with his academic troubles. Once getting good enough grades to make the football team, Oher has trouble adjusting to the brutality of the sport. It's not until Bullock compares protecting his quarterback to the affection he feels for his new family that Oher finally understands his purpose on the field.The word gets out about Oher eventually when a top scout is sent a DVD of his skills. Suddenly, major college coaches flock to recruit him. Sports fans will enjoy cameos from Nick Saban, Tommy Tuberville, Phillip Fulmer, Lou Holtz and Houston Nutt, although LSU fans will cringe seeing Saban wearing purple once again.The only problem is Oher is failing English, which makes him academically ineligible to receive a football scholarship. It's not until McGraw recites \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" that Oher learns about courage, honor and ultimately passes another difficult test: his final English essay.Oher decides to enroll at Ole Miss, which draws an NCAA investigation to ensure the Tuohy family did not tamper with his decision. Oher buys into it, then lashes out at Bullock, accusing her of taking him in just to get him to go to their alma mater. A resentful and confused Oher returns to the projects in search of his real mom, then busts up the local gangster's home, a scene which probably warrants the film's PG-13 rating.Little by little, the audience is allowed a peek into Oher's upbringing, not a pretty picture, probably less so in real life. The film features several touching moments such as when the Tuohy's drop Oher off at college or when Bullock confronts Oher's real mother, who can barely remember which man was his biological father.The film has its share of trite, Hollywood moments including McGraw and Bullock's designer marriage in which they never argue, Bullock telling off her country club friends in a moment of racial enlightenment, phoning the football coach from the sidelines to call in plays and Oher getting flagged in his opening game for 'excessive blocking.' Blind Side also glosses over several racial and class stereotypes, careful to equally bash Democrats, rednecks and Southerners. The film also provides several moments of comic relief in the form of McGraw's occasional one-liners that help to break up the film's drama.Without reading Lewis' book or knowing the complete Oher history, one might think the film is overdramatized, until the closing credits which show a sequence of real pictures of Oher being raised by Tuohy family. They remind us that Blind Side is not only based on a true story, it is a true story.Blind Side won't go down in the annals as the greatest sports movie ever made but it does have its moments. It's a touching depiction of what can result when some, give others, a fighting chance.Mo",

            "content": "This relentlessly feel good movie strives and succeeds in all it sets out to do. It reassures us all that not only is all well with the world, it really is a pretty wonderful place. Walt Disney would be proud.Disney's family fare of the sixties portrayed characters as totally one dimensional. The mean were mean, the kind were kind, etc. etc. Characters simply had no inner conflicts or doubts. Audiences, particularly children, found this spoon fed story telling very enjoyable. If only life were that simple.Well in \"The Blind Side\" life is that simple. The characters in the movie are unashamedly one dimensional. This good natured family doesn't bat an eyelid about taking in an underprivileged over-sized young black teenager into their smart home. They might as well have picked up a stray pet. Those squeaky clean smiling children take to Big Mike from the projects without a hint of hesitation. There is nothing wrong with movies reaffirming the basic goodness of mankind. God knows there are enough that have succeeded in proving the opposite. But pandering to the need to believe in such goodness in such a simplistic, needless to say, unrealistic manner is misguided. It's making us feel good at the cost of integrity - and succeeding.Sandra Bullock does with the role exactly what she's demanded to do and that really is not very much in the way of an acting stretch. We've seen her good nature shine numerous times before. Why this time it garnered her an Oscar is very probably as she herself put it, she simply wore them down.",

            "content": "I have just returned from seeing the blind side. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, particularly it's more poignant moments. Yes, this is a sports story, yes this is a biopic, but it is also in large part an interpersonal drama. It is rare to see a movie these days that relies on drama to carry it-not special effects, lush historically accurate wardrobe, or astounding make up- just a story that resonates with the viewer. That this story is based on contemporary facts makes it all the more resonant. Events that might have been handled superficially, predictably or exploited for dramatic purposes were instead presented in a nuanced and profound manner. Michael's biological mother was portrayed with dignity and compassion. In short, the aspects of Michael's story that make it moving and inspiring were captured with skill and integrity. As for the negative feedback regarding this movie that began when the only the trailers were available - I think the comments might be more a reflection of the world view of the authors rather than a reflection of the quality of the movie or the reality of Michael's story. Some people think the movie \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" was a story about racism in the south, or that \"The Crying Game\" was a movie about the IRA - to me those were the settings for the drama, and not the drama itself. John Lee Hancock really bit off a lot when he took on this project-but as it turned out, it was not more than he could chew. Remember when Attorney General Eric Holder commented on how we were a nation of cowards when it came to openly discussing race? With this movie, Hancock has demonstrated he is not one of those cowards. He did not ignore the racial or class differences of the characters in this movie, and he avoided using the movie to make a social statement with the movie. He allowed these character attributes to be what they were in reality, and told the human drama in an effective and sensitive manner.",

            "content": "I'm sure Michael Oher is an inspiring sort of story. In fact his real story, the one glossed over in the film version The Blind Side, is kind of fascinating (unlike in the film, Oher was taken by several families over the years, some black, until winding up with the Twohey's as seen here). That he could make a difference, if only for himself, is a fine feat. But there's something about the movie that is sanitized, kept in the Hollywood bakery to make it fresh for a G-rated mass consumption. It's not even offensive to any great degree, except for the fact that the filmmakers relegate the main character to a secondary kind of role (rather, if he does have any real personality in real life, it's whittled down to make him a cypher, a character that does what he's told and never questions anything - not even why he becomes a football star).Oh, it has its moments. And Sandra Bullock has that feisty kind of 'All-American-Woman' spirit, the kind that wins Oscars (you know the kind, re: Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich). And her acclaim for the role isn't unearned as she puts a lot of passion and personality into the part, at least as much as the script allows. And Kathy Bates has an amusing if bizarre cameo as the lone DEMOCRAT of the piece (something she mentions like she's sad to be Satan coming through the door). But it's the character of Oher, and the actor playing him, that brings the film down. The film itself has its conventional pleasures and beats, but I couldn't help but feeling they left Oher out to dry, like a symbol of something for white people to rally around. Again, it's never too offensive, and its heart is in the right place (think of it, perhaps, as a sign of burgeoning White Conservative Guilt peeking out as opposed to garden-variety liberal kind).Yet characters outside of Oher don't bring much to the table either. I would've liked to have seen some other personality come out from, say, the high school football coach, or understand more about where Oher came from aside from the usual 'oh, it's a bad ghetto' thing. It's ultimately neither too stirring as a human saga nor as a sports triumph, but just run of the mill. And yet for another audience, children, it's a fine little piece of fluff (tell me the director wasn't thinking of a children audience during those plucky scenes where the little boy acts like an agent for Oher in front of the college recruiters).",

But all he needed was a helping hand and he gets one from country singer Tim McGraw and Sandra Bullock and now Michael Oher is one of the top defensive players of the National Football League.Quinton Aaron plays Oher and for most of the film he's pretty mute, almost catatonic answering in monosyllables. He's brought out of the Memphis ghetto by a man who would like to get him just off his couch. Aaron's mother is a crackhead and she's long abandoned him. McGraw is a football coach at a private Christian High School and Bullock is his wife. The story here is how Bullock proves to be the mother figure this young man needs badly in his life. He becomes a member of the family as much as her two natural children with McGraw are. As for Tim McGraw he shows some acting chops and holds his own with Bullock and the rest of the cast.Aaron is a catatonic gentle giant, big enough for defense on any team, but lacking in aggression. Best scene in the film is when Bullock teaches him the necessary aggression needed for that sport.Rivaling that is a voice over narration of a composition that Aaron writes interpreting The Charge Of The Light Brigade. Aaron in the voice over proves to be quite articulate and definitely not stupid as was thought by many. I'd give the paper an A.The Blind Side is a wonderful family film for which Sandra Bullock copped a Best Actress Oscar. The Blind Side was also in the running for Best Picture of 2009.

            "content": "\"The Blind Side\" finds a wealthy, white and paternalistic Christian family deciding to civilise a helpless, slow-witted, African American kid. The kid doesn't speak, is a kind, gentle bear, and spends the film literally doing whatever the white characters tell him to do, never once expression an opinion, thought or exhibiting any agency or free will. As the film unfolds, we are shown black people who are unable to help themselves, learn that the white man's way is best, that blacks should be grateful of white aid and that success comes to those who \"are good\" and \"don't do drugs\". The film tries to say that privileged whites should help downtrodden blacks, but of course this is easy to say when the black kid being helped turns out to be a star sportsman who effortlessly succeeds on the field. Strangely, \"The Blind Side's\" central character - Big Mike (Quinton Aaron) - is largely a non-entity. A giant mute kid, passive but obedient, Mike bumbles about like a tamed grizzly bear in a polo shirt. Elsewhere the film employs racist stereotypes, is condescending and has absolutely no concern for its black character, who plays second fiddle to actress Sandra Bullock, who plays a kindly matriarch with a hot-line to God. Through Bullock, white audiences pat themselves on the back, able to do what's right and decent by proxy.During flashbacks, Big Mike is shown to have come from a supremely depressing black community. Drug addicts, prostitutes, gangsters, junkies with hopeless lives....the kid's past is but an amalgamation of clich\u00e9s, a one-dimensional horror-show cynically designed to make his transition into white-hood smooth and frictionless. A better film would have perhaps shown the troubles the kid has fitting into his new white life. Would have really examined the causes of poverty and abandonment. Would show how Bullock's very privilege relies on an unspoken social agreement which essentially perpetuates and sanctions an underclass. Would show how Big Mike feels being the only black kid in school. Would have given him a personality. Would have examined the way sports exploits impoverished black kids. Would have examined the downsides of the white family's Christian fundamentalism. Would have portrayed its characters in a less one-dimensional light (though the Aryan Brotherhood must be pleased to see the black mute gentle giant stereotype making a return).But perhaps such a film would have made no money. Afterall, \"Blind\" made a staggering 400 million dollars and counting at the box office, proving that people love its very Christian world-view. This is the wholesome view of smiley-faced missionaries who go out to Africa to help god's impoverished children with an open heart. A view which ignores the church's brutal history, its continuing negative effect on the continent (see the rise of brutal church sanctioned homophobia), ignores that for every dollar of western \"aid\" sent to Africa a dollar fifty and more comes back in debt repayment, ignores the way western \"Christian\" nations control trade policies and the lives of peoples in the developing world, never-mind how privilege at home in America relies upon a class system. And all the while, with demented irony, Jesus Christ's supposed home land of Israel, the site every crazy politician believes the Second Coming will occur, receives more western aid than all of Latin America, Africa and the West Indies combined. Hooray for a little Christian compassion.A more moral film would have probably had Big Mike beat the crap out of Bullock, embrace every racist clich\u00e9, get their daughter pregnant, rob their house and steal their car. I'm sure there's something in the Bible which advocates that. Thou shall enact vengeance on hypocritical women or something. Proverbs 21:19 I think. Or maybe not.7/10 \u2013 The always likable Sandra Bullock would win an Oscar for her performance in this film.",

            "content": "There's a word that I learned listening to smart people talk about issues and subtext and social justice and post-modernism: \"problematic\". When a person has a problem with something like a video game or capitalism or the way coffee gets to my house, when they think it's bad or wrong or unfair but don't actually have a solution or better, correct, more fair idea in mind, things are \"problematic\". They have the aura of a problem. There's a whiff of trouble, a little stinky hint.John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side is problematic. The film stars Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw as the Tuohys, and Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher, their leviathan adopted son. The film is based on the book of the same name, which details in part the story of how Oher, abandoned by a crack-addict mother and homeless as a high-school sophomore, came to live with and be adopted by the blindingly white, incredibly rich Republican Tuohy family, who helped him eventually make it to the NFL as an offensive linesman.In the film as in reality, the NCAA had legitimate concerns about the Tuohy's actions re: Oher, suggesting that perhaps they, as massive boosters for Ole Miss football had taken him in and hired him a professional tutor in the hopes that they could convince him, prodigiously gifted as he was athletically, to play for their alma mater, which he eventually did. The film handles this question as if it were a legitimate puzzle, as if the actions of the Tuohys are beyond their own ken \u2013 Bullock's Leigh Ann asks her husband at one point, \"Am I a good person?\" Oher in the film is just as puzzled. He has no idea of their motivations, because he is an inarticulate mass, a giant silent looming prop, the obelisk against which the Tuohys can attempt to effect their idea of Christian charity. He's not quite Michael Clark Duncan's obsequious blubbering Magic Black Man from The Green Mile, but he's close enough. To the white, southern Tuohys, to his white coaches and teammates, he's an unfathomable, totemic, black force that might have been dredged up from the bottom of the ocean. What everyone does see, instantaneously, is that he is large, strong and fast, so they without even bothering to ask turn him into a football player. Leigh Ann is asked at one point in the film if what she's doing is out of white guilt, and it's clearly not. The film, though, is going to make a lot of guilty-feeling white people very happy. That's problematic.What rescues the film from complete collapse is the performance of Sandra Bullock. It's a rare gift for an actor to be able to do work that seems to be a conscious decision on the part of the performer to work to make the film better. Bullock's performance is not just razor-sharp and subtle, it seems calculated, it seems like she as an actress recognized the inherent problems in her character and in the way the film is put together and worked in her performance to correct those problems. Her performance is superb. In every scene in which the film could or would dip into maudlin sentimentality and pathetic white-people-saving-black-people (as long as they're athletic and will help the team full of white people win) sludge, she's a little frosted-haired scalpel, cutting through the dross. Unfortunately the film has scenes without her in it, and those are often terrible.Ultimately, the film does to Oher what the Tuohys did to him. He never speaks about his relationship with the family outside of a few pithy one-liners and smiles. He's never allowed to be articulate about his background, or goals, or disappointments. He's a prop moved around at will by people motivated by a weird combination of religious and athletic morality, a giant instinctual force, aimed by anyone but himself and unleashed. It's not quite offensive, I don't think, but it certainly is problematic. 4/10",

Yet the messages of the movie still stay true and the performances are finely tuned, especially Bullock's. The racism displayed is reflective and correct.

            "content": "Boy, The Blind Side tried. It really did attempt to be a tear jerker.If it weren't for an interview I heard/saw from the real-life Michael Oher (played here by Aaron) who said barely a scene actually happened \u2013 stating most were for, well, dramatic effect, it still would fail at being 100% interesting.Oher's homeless after his druggie mother (of, like 15 kids she may/may not remember giving birth to) doesn't want anything to do with him, as are the other caretakers, he runs into stuck-up rich wife gal Leigh Anne (Bullock) and she takes him in. Showing she's not perfect, even she admits the first night, she worries a person of color will steal from (or harm) her family. Guess what? Oher ends up being someone decent, albeit reclusive and attaches himself to the rich family's kindness.Eventually he opens up, feels more safe and proves that football's his thing. So much, that the coincidentally ex-cheerleader mom encourages him further and then into a college scholarship. Throw in some outrageously Lifetime drama of a conflict on which school he chooses and you'll get the \"exciting\" climax of him making it big on his own terms.These all sound like complaints. And they're really not. This movie wasn't bad, per se, but not great. It tried too hard, way too hard for tears of the audience. I'll admit: it nearly got me in a few scenes.Unfortunately, before I could fully get emotional, the movie shifts gears and I'm back to watching a movie that should have, in fact, ended on the Lifetime Channel verses the big screen.The more I heard about Bullock's performance \u2013 Oscar worthy, they say, I had to see this movie. She was really good, I will say. The best? No. Great, even? Again, no. But really good. I believed every scene she was in as mother-of-the-week Leigh Anne Touhy. Was this her best performance? Or the best she could be? By no means, that's a negative. Heck, not only was she better in Speed, her absolute best job was in 2005's Crash, in which, she wasn't even nominated. Like Pacino, who only\u0085ONLY for the love of Pete\u0085won an Oscar for one role (Scent of a Woman), Bullock will probably be recognized for The Blind Side, despite her being so much better in Crash. It's those old Oscar cronies way of making up for past mistakes, as they generally do.Was the movie worth watching? Sure. For the (waaay over used) great (based on, inspired by, etc) true FOOTBALL movies? Not really. If you're looking for that, look elsewhere. And having literally hundreds of the \"true\" football films come out in the past two+ decades, it shouldn't be hard to find. This one has basically one real football game scene and a few practices. It's more about overcoming prejudices, charity, the 'hood and, of course, Bullock's Oscar chances. See it, if everything else is sold out.SIDE NOTE: Like many other \"TRUE STORIES\" that use a tremendous amount of unrealistic but dramatic scenes that, for the most part, are entered in to move the story along to fit in years of lives in mere hours, The Blind Side hit a nerve with me. In one of the key plot points, the young boy of the Touhy family (Head) films all of Oher's football practices and games. He eventually sends a copy to the recruiter's office and from there, every single, and I mean EVERYONE of the, recruiting colleges/universities want this rather large soon-to-be football player. Here's my petpeeve: Though I know, once again, these types of movies thrive on the heavy drama (to make us weep!) and have to get the job done in under 3 hours (short attention span, audience, eh?) they cut corners with extreme amateur videos (the boy was about 10) that are professionally made. For example, he's completely stationary yet, the film follows the action on the field, namely Oher. Not only did this type of filming never occur, it was extremely hard to buy the recruiters sitting back, laughing, high-fiving their way to dollar-signs in their eyes due to the \"excellent footage\" they're witnessing on their monitors. Give me a freaking break.",

            "content": "The only thing separating \"The Blind Side\" from a made-for-TV movie on the Hallmark channel is the fact that Sandra Bullock is probably too expensive for Hallmark.I know this film is based on the true story about an affluent white family who take in a homeless black youth and raise him as their own. But even though its origins are grounded in fact, the film felt like a congratulatory fantasy conjured out of white guilt. The film is so anxious to be family-friendly and palatable to the least sophisticated film goer that it almost avoids dramatic conflict altogether. Conflicts are there, but most of them are resolved within the next scene or two, never building to any kind of suspense or emotional payoff.Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for the same reason Julia Roberts did -- Hollywood loves to recognize appealing actresses for being sharp and sassy. But Roberts had much better material to work with in \"Erin Brockovich.\" The material in \"The Blind Side\" is usually just shy of gag-inducing, and at one point -- when Bullock's character confronts a group of gang-bangers with a \"you go girl\" attitude and actually succeeds in intimidating them -- downright ludicrous. At the very least, she would have been laughed at in that situation, and quite possibly would have been lucky to escape without physical harm.The film also stars Kathy Bates as a sassy tutor, and uses the character of Bullock's younger son for...you guessed it...sassy and damn near intolerable \"comic\" relief.The success of \"The Blind Side\" with middle America is clearly attributed to its religious and wholesome message and values. Fair enough. But it's precisely simplistic and dumbed down movies like \"The Blind Side\" that make me leery of anything geared toward the Christian community. However, I will say that it's refreshing for once for a film to have actually been seen by the audience who needs to hear its message. And it's also nice, in the wake of \"The Passion of the Christ\" and other movies embraced by the religious community, to see Christianity associated with productivity and goodness rather than with pain and guilt.

While it was a good performance by Bullock who had a fine southern accent for her character, we decided that she probably was given the Oscar for \"her body of work\". The movie was a predictable \"feel good\" story that in our opinion was not in the same league as the other nominees for best picture. It is based on a true story of Michael Oher, an over-sized black teenager from the wrong side of the tracks ( Quinton Aaron), who gets \"adopted\" by a rich Memphis couple ( Sandra Bullock and country music star Tim McGraw) with two kids of their own. The school football coach drools over his potential as a offensive lineman but it is not until his new Mother knowing that he has tested to have high aptitude in the \"protectiveness\" scale encourages him to \"protect\" the quarterback or the running back as he would protect his own new found family does he show his stuff. He now is able to use his size and power and become a great football player who is recruited by many colleges including his new parents alma mater \"Ole Miss\". In order to play football and stay in the game he had to be tutored by a teacher who also went to Ole Missplayed by Kathy Bates. There are a few mild twists and subplots in the story line but no big surprises. You come away from the movie with a warm feeling, especially as you look at the closing credits interspersed with photos of the real Michael Oher and the family that adopted him, as well as confirmation that he eventually made the NFL.",

While movies will understandably take certain liberties for the sake of telling a story fit for the theaters, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth knowing that Oher's own hard work is minimized in this movie. After all, this is based on Oher's life, and those who watch this movie will likely believe the story is as close to reality as the filmmakers could get.When you look at how near impossible it is for most people to become a pro athlete, and when you start to under the intense training, dieting, and studying of the game an athlete will have undergone to even be noticed by a league like the nfl, then taking that accomplishment away from the athlete is a tragedy.

All the same, this feel-good movie is the type of Hollywood production that blacks have justifiably railed against since \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner\", and rightfully so.Here we have a privileged pretty princess (Bullock) and her pretty McMansion-ensconced family bestowing not just aid but outright salvation itself on a poor and essentially homeless black \"child\". Aside from some blips generated by the skeptical raised eyebrows of the NCAA, all the future is happiness for everyone involved....The End. I freely admit I possess a low threshold for \"cute\", and the family's precocious wise-beyond-his-years young son seemed to single-handedly tip this film into the Oh-Give-Me-A-Break ditch. He seemed to be a character lifted out of a laugh-tracked cookie-cutter '80's family sitcom. Is this how far we've come?

We get to meet them, or at least become aware of them. But it seems the message we're left to assume is that, since they don't have their own Nice White Lady to rescue them, they don't have any real chance at redemption, so there's really no point in hearing from them again.

Though I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommended to anyone, it focuses much more on the \"human drama\" angle and very little on the actual football.For a basic plot summary, \"The Blind Side\" tells the story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), who is adopted by Leigh Anne & Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock; Tim McGraw) and given a respite from life in \"the projects\". A giant of a boy, Michael shows an aptitude for football, learning, and family values under the guidance of the Tuohys, and eventually obtains both a college education and a shot at football's biggest stage--the NFL.Because this is a movie based on a true story, it is tough to know how much of it is actually true. As a sports fan who closely follows the NFL, I know that Mr. Oher himself is uncomfortable talking about the film (or, more specifically, his portrayal in it), so perhaps some liberties were indeed taken to make for a juicier storyline.That being said, this production (for better or worse) is a strong, emotional, human-interest drama that will both warm your heart and make you think. Though the basic concepts and characters are \"vanilla\" enough for even younger children to grasp, the more over-arching themes can easily be picked out by adults and thought upon. The acting also helps accomplish this goal, as the entire cast shines in their respective roles.About the only thing that prevents me from giving this film the full five stars is that I felt it could have devoted a bit more time to the \"football side\" of things (ala the Michael Lewis book). If done correctly, this movie could have been a sort of \"Social Network\", but for the NFL. Instead, to create a more family-friendly film, the production eschews all but a few mentions of actual football.Overall, this is a charming film that is appropriate for anyone. Though not quite \"gritty\" enough to be an outright classic, there is something to be said for its saccharine approach to film- making.

And, not surprisingly, I had a thoroughly good time watching it--though I do recommend you see it with a box of Kleenex nearby.The film is about a young man named Michael Oher--an extremely large black teenager who has bounced from home to home in the foster care system. Currently, he's in a new school and no one realizes that he has no place to live. Yet in spite of having a crack-addicted mother, a father who was killed in prison and every other reason to be an angry powder keg, he's a very gentle and sad soul---who is also enormous and has amazing potential to play football.A nosy but very nice lady (Sandra Bullock) convinces her husband (Tim McGraw) to bring Michael home...at least for the night. But this one night turns into a permanent living situation and he becomes an important part of the family. However, despite this new living arrangement working out well, Michael is so far behind in school and his GPA so low that he hasn't a prayer to play football in college. That's because although many schools are now offering him athletic scholarships, his GPA is too low to allow him to accept these offers. So, with his new family's help, perhaps he can pull up those grades and have a future.This film is super-inspirational and sweet--mostly because it's true. I am sure that some poetic license was taken when making the film (I especially wonder if the little brother could be THIS precocious and adorable), but overall they did a good job of sticking reasonably close the facts. While I loved Sandra Bullock's performance (she's great as usual), I was a bit surprised that she received Oscar for it--I did see a few performances in other films that year that I thought were a bit better (such as the leading young lady in \"Precious\").

Based on the true story, this tells the story of Michael 'Big Mike' Oher (Be Kind Rewind's Quinton Aaron), the neglected African American teenager, who with little education grew up to become a football star. So the film starts when he was young and homeless, and he seems quiet with hardly anyone to rely on, until he is taken in by the Tuohy family: wife/mother Leigh Anne (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Sandra Bullock), husband/father Sean (Tim McGraw), son S.J. (Jae Head) and daughter Collins (Lily Collins). Leigh Anne, after adopting Michael to be part of the family, encourages Michael assuring him that anyone given a chance can accomplish what they want, and his passion for American football is quite significant. As he practises for his big chance, she gives him an idea of how to play the game, knowing he got a high grade in protection, she tells him to think of the opposition as people threatening her family, and it works. Soon enough he is gaining much attention by American football coaches, seeing his footage, of course there is a low point when his education is getting him down, but with the help of home school teacher Miss Sue (Kathy Bates), he does improve. He is also questioned about why he wants to go the same school as the Tuohy family, but he gets through this, and Leigh Anne and the whole family can be proud of him when he reaches great heights. Also starring Ray McKinnon as Coach Burt Cotton, Kim Dickens as Mrs. Boswell, Adriane Lenox as Michael's mother - Denise Oher and Catherine Dyer as Mrs. Smith. Aaron makes a good not very talkative and sensitive soul, the supporting cast all get their moments too, but the film is of course taken over by the award winning Bullock, who did deserve the Oscar out of the five nominated actresses.

The film is just one of those rare but powerful life stories where we see the good in humanity.The film has strong and powerful performances by Sandra and Quinton, Tim McGraw also did a strong acting job as Sean Tuohy, Leigh's husband.It shows that the film is about Football but it also shows the good in helping others who with a little direction and hope any thing can happen.If you want a strong drama film and one that really can make you appreciate the good in all of us then The Blind Side is a must see I give The Blind Side an 9 out of 10Well All Right Then",

Even when you wonder how much of a story it can strain out of the actual events it's based on it continues to suprisingly do so. And while it's the most Disney movie Disney never made, The Blind Side seizes your attention and holds it through the entire movie with sound movie and of course Sandra Bullock's Academy Award winning performance.I might also add that though I can understand Michael Oher's criticism about the movie making him come across like a dunce, The Blind Side has also raised his story to much higher prominence and the movie has only garnered respect and affection for him.",

            "content": "This is based upon a true story.Leigh Anne Tuohy (Bullock) and husband Sean (McGraw) take in Big Mike Oher (Aaron) and help develop his potential. Since I knew I was going to watch the DVD and saw what the promos promised, I went and bought a box of Kleenex. Good move. What a wonderful story and true too. If more people were like the Tuohys, the world would be a better place. But, just think about it for a minute, the high risk they took taking in a kid from the streets. However, if Big Mike's real mother Denise (Lenox) didn't instill in him his good character, maybe we would never have heard of him and his place in sports and, of course, the Tuohys.Yes, some will say that much of the movie is sappy, maybe corny, but when you know this is a true story, and you like and believe the characters and the dialogue because you want to, then it's not sappy and corny. It's just right. See?The thing that impressed the most was the understatement of all on the screen. That had the most impact for me. And, in a true story the little things like the looks, subtle comments, and some good comedic lines go a long way to making this most enjoyable. Also, the support the entire family gave Big Mike. In the beginning, the Tuohy's son SJ (Head) was kind of annoying, but he grew on me and helped the comic relief along. Good job. I do have one complaint. In the High School games some of the camera angles could have been better showing how Big Mike protected the Quarterback's blind side. To be fair, there were a couple one-on-one scenes with Big Mike and the Defensive End where Big Mike pulverized that player. All in all a very good movie for all the family. And, it was nice to see Sandra Bullock deserve and win the Best Actress award. Most of us, by now, know that Big Mike wants to be called Michael and that he went to the Baltimore Ravens of the NFL where he is today. It almost makes me want to root for the Ravens, however my loyalty lies elsewhere, but I will keep an eye on Michael and wish him well. Hey, I invested in a box of Kleenex on his behalf. I now know I should have bought 2-boxes. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",

            "review_title": "Dreadfully slow propaganda",
            "content": "Some have described this as a sports film. It's not. Only the last half of the film has any sport in it, and it's really not about that. Overall the film is about a family helping another child. The sport could have been anything, and was irrelevant to the film.I found the pace of the film to be dreadfully slow. Probably 30 minutes could have been cut from it, without losing anything. Part of the problem can't be solved by editing. The leaden acting, from everyone including the two leads, and boring directing even make necessary scenes drag on and on. The writing is that of an after-school special or TV movie of the week.The film is also presented as a true story. But key parts of the film are fabrications.The presentation of how Oher learned football is false. Oher did not need to be taught football by his mom or brother. He was an aggressive player. Still, he did not throw an opposing player over a fence. The film was not improved by these fabrications, so you have to wonder why they are in the film.The film notably omits the facts that Oher didn't raise his GPA through normal means, but instead took 10-day internet courses from BYU. All that each course required students to do was to read a few brief passages from famous works or speeches and then answer five questions. These courses provided the A's to replace his F's in English. I know this makes people seem less angelic and heroic, but this is what was reported elsewhere, and should have been in the film. Complex characters and stories make film interesting.Regarding the airbag scene, I believe the film depicts it as the family does in real life, however it simply isn't credible. Sure, it's a nice explanation to make everyone feel better about what happened, but come on. Most likely Oher was instinctively bracing for impact, or to try to restrain SJ from hitting the dashboard from the impact he saw coming, and his arm happened to be where the airbag later deployed. If you see any video (slowed-down or not) of an airbag deployment, you know how ludicrous the claim is that Oher (a) knew it might deploy on this low speed impact, (b) knew airbag deployment would be dangerous for someone of SJ's size, (c) had time to decide to stop it rather than stopping the vehicle, and (d) was able to move in any way in time to deflect the airbag's deployment. Those bags are only inflated for a fraction of a second, and then deflate to provide cushioning, so hitting it even slightly before or after deployment is just pushing air around. I think hitting an airbag may increase or decrease the pressure in the bag at the time the protected person's face hits it, resulting in more injury to the person. It would be interesting to get Mythbusters' take on it.Now let's talk bias. Once again, we have a movie where a white family saves a black child. This story has been told to death. There are other families in the US, and their stories need to be told, for once. But if we insist on these stories, can't we at least tell them from the child's point of view? Instead, they make this one about about Leigh Anne. The story by itself is not racist, but when you consider the context of Hollywood film over the years, things start to look pretty bad.Last, the propaganda angle. This is quite overtly a Christian propaganda film, as opposed to a film with Christian characters. I found the repeated use of the phrase \"good Christian\" to be particularly offensive because it's designed to suggest that being good equals or requires being Christian, or that there is something somehow uniquely Christian about the behaviour shown. These are people who have done a good thing. Maybe they even had ulterior motives, but they did it. That's good enough without the propaganda. Similarly, the repeated focus on the phrase \"with men this is possible, but with god all things are possible\". This is a mis-quote of the actual phrase from Matthew 19:26 \"With man this is impossible ...\". It's just more propaganda, not to mention provably false. Humans deserve credit for what we do, even when we do the right thing. Last, the film ends with Leigh Anne thanking her god that some other kid died instead of hers. It's a line clearly meant to inspire, but when you think about it, is actually pretty revolting. A god that permits these deaths is not deserving of thanks.I do give filmmakers credit for correctly quoting the oft-mis-quoted line from Charge of the Light Brigade (\"do and die\").",

            "content": "Only a public that has been spoon-fed sugar-coated realities for many years could possibly find anything of merit in this incredibly insipid Disney tale for (white) adults. The horror, the horror, indeed (to quote a previous reviewer, who I believe was quoting a far better film).I usually tend to review here only when I feel compelled to warn others of the pitfall into which I have fallen, or to cast my vote on a site I frequently use for its prognostic value. This was never truer than with this film (as of this review, 7.7 stars?!?!) I confess that I watched this pap even despite grave misgivings, and I can assure you that all my worst doubts were quickly confirmed! I happen to love underdog sports films - a plentiful genre - so I had to see why this one had become so popular - what hidden nuggets of wisdom were missing from the previews? The answer: no nuggets, no history lesson, no novelty, no great acting (in fact, rather bad acting on the part of the husband and son), no insight - just the most insanely offensive and nauseating drivel I have seen in a very long time. And somehow people love it and call it \"feel-good!\" I call it feel-bad, because I felt very uncomfortable, and my discomfort was not temporarily relieved with the distraction of great action sequences, such as with the similarly white-savior themed Avatar (as if seeing a soldier betray and kill his own species in his own unit was not disturbing enough).So what is so great about The Blind Side? Are there deeper meanings I am not understanding? If you want to truly understand how the legacy of slavery still plays out in the lives of modern day black Americans, get to know one! Or to better understand race relations in the U.S., read Obama's book \"Dreams of My Father.\" Sure, it's nice that this lady and her family were so generous to a strange black kid, but why make a movie out of it? (Or even a book?) I hazard to say that this kind of story has countless permutations in the black community, where father-less or mother-less kids get taken in by an often equally disadvantaged family that does not happen to live in a mansion and purchase all their meals pre-cooked because they are too busy out shopping for the perfect window valance. So what makes this story so special? Because it resulted in a college scholarship? Or because it was a white family that adopted Big John? For me the only truly poignant moment in the whole film is the scene with John's biological mother - a central moment in the film that is, sadly, all too brief. Here we see a woman who has survived unknown myriad personal and societal obstacles, but who can still show the strength and grace enough to be polite to this unfriendly, pushy white woman sitting in her living room and demanding answers. Other than this scene I cringed and groaned the whole way through - something that I'd probably do while viewing any schmalz of this type, but there's something more egregious about this particular schmalz being sold. Maybe I just can't stand having my intelligence insulted by cute one-liners and happy endings about what are really important and serious issues our nation should confront. Maybe Hollywood is dumbing down movies more than ever to reach the widest possible audience and bring in more revenue - I don't know, but whatever the reason for its creation or success, this film has no social value in my view whatsoever.So if you are a fan of good films and good film-making, you'll no doubt already have known better and avoided this film - despite the bizarre accolades from the Academy and the public. Likewise, if you understand that racism and addiction, poverty and capitalism are all pieces of the same puzzle, you'll definitely want to steer clear of this. I would personally prefer to watch Brian's Song (maybe even the remake of Brian's Song) a thousand times over.",

But it works and at the end of the day, after paying the prices one pays at the box office, it's almost enough. Why they had to ruin it with an Oscar nomination?

Even though these miracles only happen in life rarely it did in this case with Michael Oher an orphaned teen who goes on to athletic stardom by getting drafted to the NFL. Yet \"The Blind Side\" is more than a story of a down on his luck kid that rises to fame, it's main showcase is the tough love of Leigh Anne Tuohy(played to perfection by Sandra Bullock her best performance ever)Sandy really steals the show.Based on the true story of Michael Oher(Quinton Aaron)who's orphaned from a young age by having a runaway day and a drug addicted mother. He's grown up in a life of the hood and projects his only hope and escape is that a family member has contacted and wedged a local Memphis, TN high school(Wingate)to see his potential as this kid is big as a mountain he certainly has the size to be a powerful lineman. Oher enrolls yet he's awkward not well educated in the books and still homeless only by happens chance while walking along a road one night he's spotted by a family. This family happens to be the Tuohys a well to do wealthy conservative republican family who rank as the class of Memphis, TN. It's when the backbone of the clan Leigh Anne(Bullock) says right in front of her two children and husband Sean(nice appearance by Tim McGraw)to pull over and take the boy home as her children have noticed him from school.The adaptation is tough at first only to narrowly grow as one by one they get to know Michael and Leigh Anne with her good Christian heart decides that the Tuohys will become his newly legally adopted family. Along the way growing pains are expected but never fear with this families resources Michael is educated and learns a lot as his book skills improve. Still Michael is odd showing no interest in girls yet his one to be discovered talent is playing left tackle on the football team. As his power and god given ability is well showcased in the film. Yet all along his desire to do well comes from his new loving family the Tuohys who give him inspiration mostly Leigh Anne who struts her stuff in memorable scenes by telling Michael on the scrimmage field how to block by giving him words of encouragement. Plus Leigh stands up to her elegant and rich snob female friends at dinner who make fun of her for adopting a black boy.All of this standing tall love and support lead to Michael getting recruited to play college ball at Ole Miss(where the Tuohys went to school). Then after that journey Michael is drafted by The NFL's Baltimore Ravens and he's currently their starting rookie left tackle. Really this film does have a little to much hyperbole and even though it's real and compelling it's a fairy tale story that's slim even though these stories happen they are far and few in between. Still the wild card and film backbone is Sandra Bullock(Sandy is so good with the southern accent) who's near perfect in her portrayal of Mrs. Tuohy who's such a good hearted and nice Christian southern woman. It proves with a strong mother figure who gives tough love, caring, and support a young man can be molded into not only something great but something special and become a grown man. \"The Blind Side\" is hyperbole and a real fairy tale type that showcases a feel good story of a man coming of age by finding out what a loving family brings. And most important It doesn't blind our feelings of tough love as Sandra Bullock's strong and direct southern belle performance proves a mother figure is so important.",

And, when everything was said and done I would come home and write a review using the words \"tear jerker\" or \"uplifting\" or \"scores a touchdown.\" Then I started to write this review and realized that it was all of those things plus a lot more.\"The Blind Side\" is the story of Michael Oher, (played by Quinton Aaron), a teenager from a broken home with a troubled past who goes onto become an NFL draft pick. His story, as portrayed in this particular film, is not about how he laid awake every night dreaming of someday playing in the NFL. In fact, the NFL was only mentioned at the end of the movie where it actually showed the real Michael Oher being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens. This movie was all about the journey.It starts with Sandra Bullock's character, Leigh Anne Touhy, narrating and describing the importance of an offensive tackle (something I knew very little about) and moves into Michael being allowed a shot to go to a private school in Memphis. The young man does have a rough life, pretty much homeless, no family, no friends and extremely introverted. By fate, Leigh and her family take Michael in for a night and they become his surrogate parents for a while. They clothe him and shelter him and help him bring his grades up in school.All along, Michael isn't saying more than a few words at a time. I think this was the strong area of the movie. This gentle giant brought out the best intentions around a lot of the characters in the story. We've all seen the football movies where the gifted athlete comes in and says a lot of smart-ass lines then butts heads with the coach and realizes he needs to listen in order to learn. Well, this movie takes a different approach (and since it was based on a true story I think this was the only approach he had to work with). Michael kept quiet most of the time and the people around him learned a lot about helping another human being.Should you see this movie? Definitely. Yes. Even if you think you have seen this football formula before, you haven't. The movie used comedy to bring it to life. It used Michael's silence at the right times to make it stick. They thought this movie through before they started filming. Why else should you see it? Because it was an uplifting, tearjerker that will score a touchdown.

We could have viewed his struggles up close, seen accounts of his rough past, and caught deep insight into his personality for an intimate portrait of the obstacles that too many American children face.Instead, the plot of \"The Blind Side\" went something like this: Lee Ann Tuohy is a wonderful person who does wonderful things. And some more wonderful things. And continues to do nothing but wonderful, wonderful things without any sort of real conflict, internal or otherwise. As a commenter on the message boards brilliantly put it, Michael Oher was a supporting character in his own damn story. \"The Blind Side\" was so self-righteous and self-congratulatory, it made me nauseous.I could probably type forever about the problems I had with this movie, but for the sake of brevity, here are some points: Why didn't the screenwriter take advantage of the MYRIAD of engaging topics that could have been explored in this movie? And I don't just mean race (although I was quite disappointed by it not actually being addressed). What about the kinds of psychological issues that adopted kids face all the time? Abandonment issues? Problems adjusting to the family dynamic? Survivor's Guilt? And did anyone in the rest of the Tuohey family experience apprehension about having a complete stranger stay in their house? Was there jealousy? Sibling rivalry? Oh wait, exploring those kinds of issues would have taken time away from showcasing what a wonderful, wonderful person Leigh Ann was.There's a very brief part in the film where Michael runs into his estranged brother. They embrace for a long time, but we don't hear anything they say to each other. Then he disappears, never to be mentioned again for the rest of the movie. What gives? What was his story? Why hadn't Michael seen him in so long? Where was he living? Would they ever see each other again? And what about the rest of Michael's background? We're only given vague details and momentary flashes. Why don't we actually get to learn about him, his past and his personality? Oh wait, that would have taken time away from showcasing what a wonderful, wonderful person Leigh Ann was.Okay, one of my biggest pet peeves in film is when little kids talk like adults. As far as I'm concerned, S.J. gets the brass ring in that department. He was seriously one of the most annoying creatures I've ever, ever seen on a movie screen. I wanted to punch him in the throat the second he delivered his first spoken line.I understand the concept of suspended disbelief. And if this movie had been a bit better, I would have been able to do just that. But come on, do they expect me to believe that Michael's poverty-stricken drug-addicted mother was not only lucid and coherent, but had perfect alabaster-white teeth? And really, a bunch of armed-to-the-teeth gang members living in the projects were intimidated into silence by a rich white lady? Are you kidding me? And since it's fresh in my mind...When compared to the caliber of performances of the other actresses, I can't believe the academy gave Sandra Bullock the Best Actress Oscar.

I love sports movies as well as movies based on true stories, so this film hit multiple buttons for me personally, but reactions of others leaving the theater seemed equally positive.As with any sports movie, you must have an underdog to cheer for, and Michael Oher is that underdog. Having been removed by CPS from his crack-addicted mother's home as a child and bounced from foster home to foster home, Oher has been staying on a friend's couch. He is reluctantly accepted to a private school when the football coach sees potential in him and pressures the school's admissions board to give him a chance.Unfortunately, being an undereducated black youth in a predominantly white private school doesn't magically turn his life around, and in addition to struggling to understand his classes, he finds himself sleeping in an all night laundromat after the stay at the friend's house ends. While walking on a cold, rainy night , Oher is offered a ride and then a place to sleep for the night by the Leigh Anne Tuohy, whose children attend the same school Michael does. It's this single act of kindness that begins a chain of events that will change this underdog's life, eventually resulting in his being a top 2009 NFL draft pick and signing with the Baltimore Ravens.The actors brought plenty of life to the characters they were playing. It was a pleasure to watch Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, making a somewhat minor character in the film memorable. Sandra Bullock's portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy was fascinating--I'd really love to meet Mrs. Tuohy in person. Jae Head as SJ became my favorite character in the movie, practically stealing the show as it were. Quinton Aaron's portrayal of Oher leans heavily to the strong, silent type, but there is a quiet grace and gentleness that comes through.Obviously, nothing is quite as slick and clean as Hollywood plays it in movies like this, and there were issues and controversies surrounding the Tuohy family and the assistance they offered Michael Oher. Some of it is depicted in the movie, though not all, and there are many who will decry this film for that. It's a given that there is more to a story than what you see on the screen...condensing years into a two hour presentation requires some compromise...and it is meant to be entertainment after all.I only had a couple criticisms. One, at 126 minutes, the movie was a little too long. I think 8-10 minutes of editing would have really tightened it up and eliminated a couple slower moments. Second, Sandra Bullock's accent seemed a little too forced at times. And finally, what happened to Steve Hamilton, the boy whose family Michael was staying with when he started attending Briarwood? Once introduced as his father pressures the coach for scholarships for Steve and Michael, he disappears from the movie. Minor issues that didn't keep this from being an extremely enjoyable movie, but did help keep it from being a perfect 10.",

You know, the kind who cry when Glenn Beck tells them to and who think Jesus carried a .22 and shot the poor lepers and prostitutes off his doorstep while shouting that NRA membership and his gun are GOD GIVEN RIGHTS and ain't no n----r in the WHITE House gunna take 'em.The Michael Oher in the movie has no voice and soul, he's just a empty vessel for a rich white family to project their fantasies upon. He's a stray they the found shivering in the cold and the rain and decided to keep instead taking to the pound the next day.They found a big, dumb black kid and decided he should play football despite the fact he didn't like playing and wasn't very good at it besides his size. They use sick psychology to trick him into wanting to play and trick him into wanting to play for the family's Alma mater too. When college recruiters come to woo the family and beg to borrow their prized horse to put their jockey on, the family realizes that their dumb pet better study up because he won't be able to play unless he has a 2.5 GPA. His academics don't mater until his low grades mean he can't play college ball. So, they hire Kathy Bates who is, regrettably, a baby-killing, God-less democrat (but is still a graduate of the family's Alma mater) to teach Hans to be clever and count enough apples to be allowed to play.But, the evil NCAA hears of their plan and calls them out on it. Nothing comes of the investigation though, because Michael decides that he'd rather be a pet of a rich family that be no one's pet at all and covers for them.And, they all live happily ever after. The rich white family who had everything now have everything and fame and the big black kid gets to play football for his sponsors' Alma mater. The movie ends saying: You know, lots of black kids get killed in ghettos everyday. Why can't they play sports instead? The movie is racist and disgusting. it's a movie that says, loudly, \"Hey! Look! I'm a rich white woman who taught this dumb, poor black kid to play sports! Ain't I good person?\" And the crowds respond in kind, \"Yes, you are a good person. Black people are poor, dumb and naturally good at sports. You gave him what he needed. Good for you!\" It's sick.",

As a football player and student, Oher works hard and, with the help of his coaches and adopted family, becomes an All-American offensive left tackle. The story is very interesting, the plot is convincing enough, it is a drama but it has its very good moments of humor. The cast is wonderful and their performances are excellent. Sandra Bullock giving the performance of her life, no wonder why she took the Oscar home, Quinton Aaron in the role of Michael Oher was a really pleasant surprise, Kathy Bates in a short appearance as Oher's professor was quite convincing and Jae Head, the kid that performs as Bullock's son was and excellent comic relief for the movie. In conclusion, The Blind Side is a inspiring and heart breaking movie worthy to watch and very recommendable",

Leigh Anne arranges tuition for him and tries to steer him to join 'ol mis' team. At one stage Oher has doubts. Are the Tuohys helping him for himself? Or because they want him to join their chosen team? He runsaway and Leigh Ann finds him and tells him, it's his choice, who he plays for.

I like how Sandra Bullock acted out here, just the right level of accent, facial expressions and body gestures to get into her character. We can see her portraying moments of being affected without having to shed any tear. Tim McGraw and Jae Head gives the needed depth in building the story's crucial points.

            "content": "This film was nominated for the best picture Oscar in 2010, it didn't win, but Sandra Bullock did pick up the Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role. Given all this recognition I decided I'd better see what all the fuss was about. I have to say that, as a Brit, I and don't really follow any American sports which it made it a little hard to follow in places, but I expected that. I've seen the Super Bowl on TV and have seen films such as 'Any Given Sunday' which have given me a bit of an insight into the game and the attention it gets over there. Having said that, the film isn't all about American Football, it's more about relationships and how helping out a fellow human being can bring something good. Oh, and it's based on a true story. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please block that guy trying to sneak around the sideline while I write the next paragraph).Michael 'Big Mike' Oher has had it rough all his life, his mother is a crack addict, his father has disappeared, but he has one thing in his favour, he's big\u0085 really big. More by luck than design, he gets enrolled into a predominantly white Christian school. His teachers don't really hold out much hope for him since he seems disinterested in classes, but one teacher, Mrs. Boswell, discovers he is maybe not as dumb as they first thought. He is befriended by young S.J. Tuohy, the son of Leigh Ann and Sean Tuohy. Recognising that Michael has nobody to look after him, Leigh Ann decides to take him in. Eventually his grades improve and he is allowed to play sports. He is, not surprisingly chosen for the Football team. After a stuttering start, and a bit of coaching from Leigh Ann and S.J., he finally gets the hang of the game and from here, as they say, the rest is history. I'll leave my summary here so as not to infringe those NFL Spoiler Police.This is a very heart-warming film that will appeal to the North American audience more than most of the rest of the world. I found it to be very well made with a few good performances. As far as that goes, I thought Sandra Bullock was good as Leigh Ann Tuohy, but Oscar worthy? I'll let you decide. Tim McGraw did a fair job as Sean Tuohy and I thought Quinton Aaron played the understated Michael Oher very well. Jae Head reminded me a little of a young Macaulay Culkin as S.J. Tuohy and Lily Collins was OK as Collins Tuohy (the daughter). Honourable mentions go to Ray McKinnon as Coach Burt Cotton, Kim Dickens as Mrs. Boswell and there was a nice cameo from Kathy Bates as Miss Sue.So we have a very rich family taking in a young black boy who happens to be an athlete. The cynical among us would instantly put this back on the shelf and leave it there, but I found it surprisingly better than I first thought it would be. Mainly due to the understated performance of Quinton Aaron, his performance really made the story work (for me). Contrast that with the outgoing and boisterous S.J. and it's a combination that really works. The scenes where this pair is on screen really stand out. Over all, I found it a little too long and a little too schmaltzy for my taste, but worth one viewing\u0085 Recommended, for the one viewing only\u0085 then you can move on.My Score: 6.4/10",

            "review_title": "A cheap small movie not really doing anything much",
            "content": "I rewatched it as I read the book days ago.It's pretty watchable a single time. I watched it again and man it hasn't aged well whatsoever. This is such a \"cheap\" movie. Everything feels melodramatic and lazy. The scenes are all set up as in any Christian B tier movie. Just direct camera work. Not bad at all. It's just... boring. I'm glad it's not shaky-cam, but at least add creativity and some shots from the air. Here we just see faces. It's people talking and the director is not focused enough to make it visually engaging. It feels like watching a cheap documentary.The acting is overall good. The small son is a horrible actor here. A damn shame. His scenes are very cringe. Overall the scenes are cringe as they always try to play up any conflict to level 9000. Even small conflicts are in your face. Compare this to The Wire that also had similar scenes in the ghetto. There we see the culture and the dangers. Here everything is a movie scene made to shock and awe and all scenes end the same way: people being overly emotional. Nothing is calm. The first 15 minutes were actually great as we didn't get flat characters. Then after that it became lazy filmmaking. They really didn't care about this story whatsoever. They just wanted to make a movie to earn some quick bucks.Now, I also do see some great issues about the story not really being the real story. The book has quite a few differences. The overall storyline is similar, but some changes are so Hollywood that it's cringe. Also, the book overall is likely 25% spin too so the movie just adds on top of that.In the book Michael visits his mom regularly. Here we don't see him visit her a single time. The whole point is that he ran away from foster care as a kid to return to his mom to sleep in a bed with 6-8 other siblings while his mom spent all her welfare on drugs the first few days. She didn't give them food or clothes and often didn't come home. But foster care was not great either as you have a bunch of violent kids, cheap beds, cheap houses, people who just want to make state money by taking in kids. So overall the situation was bad. In such families the dad goes away right as the child is born or you don't even know who the dad is. It's crime and drugs. This movie used the scene where the children were taken from their druggie mom. But it's a flashback scene we see about 5 times. It's never clearly explained. His mom looks healthy and young here. That's not really how a drug abuser lives or acts. She also says she doesn't want to see her son in her condition and that she used to do drugs. In real life she wasn't really clean. And here they should have showed that a bit more clearly. Also, in real life his mom and family members were extremely eager to see him as often as possible. He was on the way to making millions. What do you think happens in such a case? The brothers and mom just stay away? In the book his step-parents even talk about how it's a good thing that his dad died as that means he won't be coming after him for money. And his mom calls him SO MUCH that he stops taking the phone. Obviously they wanted his money. Here he's just by himself.We also didn't meet his Black friend here. We didn't see him talk about how he would send money to his family in the ghetto as the first thing and get them out of there. NFL players make millions a year and plan for all of this.How he was discovered was also changed. It's made into a gag where 2 different events are combined. That's actually done a lot in this movie. 2 different events are combined so that one causes the other while in real life there could even be a year between the events. In reality people just saw he was a huge guy and therefore considered him a gigantic talent even before he started playing football. NFL is eager to get big dudes. Even athletes who, like Michael, are terrible at football initially. The size will do the talking. Here we didn't even see how he played basketball regularly. Here he sorta just starts playing football later on while being extremely out of shape. He moves like a fat guy not an athlete and he barely trains for anything here. In real life he always wanted to be a professional basketball player and get to NBA. He is actually quite arrogant that way. When he made it big he proclaimed that he just worked his way up and that he wouldn't give money to others like him as they should just work their way up too. I'm not saying it's morally wrong. I'm just saying the movie doesn't show that. Here he's acting like a little kid. In real life he was quite focused on athletics and arrogant about his abilities. He is just very low IQ, like many Black people and Black athletes, so he didn't really talk much when teachers talked about complicated matters. And as his mom was a drug addict there is not much he wants to say about his personal life either. He didn't speak much at all, true, but the movie totally missed the arrogance aspect that was his personality once you uncover his true character. It's not a bad personality as such. It would be interesting to see it.We also don't learn about his great memory that made him pass exams. It's not \"love and care\" or whatever that made him pass them. It's a great memory while having low IQ - and then tricks and cheats. His family in the movie talks about \"doing something\" to make him pass his exams so that he could get to college and then NFL. But in the movie they don't do anything close to cheating. We just see his teachers give him verbal exams as he can't read or write well. In real life his new family paid for a new IQ test that put his IQ at a White person's level. Which is quite clearly a fake result. That way they could claim he had a learning disability and not low IQ. And hence just needed extra tools in college instead of not being allowed in. They also gave him a ton of substitute exams to replace his low school grades. For example, you can take a new language exam to replace some Spanish exam you studied a year for. These were the exams done verbally 1-to-1 where one assumes adults could \"help him\" get to the answer like in the IQ test. Hence we don't know how much he actually knew or passed. They had money to make it all work. In the movie all of that is replaced with teachers just claiming that \"he is actually smart we just need to teach him a different way!\". Riiiiiight. He raised his IQ 20 points and just needed \"a new way\" to become really smart. It's a movie I guess. It's curious they have Sandra Bullock allude to something only found in the book. I guess it's a way for the director to claim it's a true story.The fight in college where he by accident made a small child bleed from his head here happens in his ghetto before he attends college. With all the other changes this smaller stuff adds up even though it's quite similar to what happened in real life. The lesson was that if you as a Black man break the law in a White setting you will be kicked out. This lesson disappears when you just making him act like a small puppy among White people. In reality it's a learning experience. He's a huge talent so he wasn't kicked out from college. And he wasn't kicked out for being too stupid. It's money privilege, but also talent privilege. A regular Black kid who didn't pass any exams and got into a fight would not really get all these passes. Which the movie also doesn't illustrate in any way. He just is this good guy with a talent. The book expands on all of this.It's also a shame we don't see a bit more about the Black coach who helped him at the start and let him stay over. I feel like these good Black guys helping out in the community need more recognition. Reminds me of the Black boxing coach from The Wire. This movie is 50% about Sandra Bullock. She's in most scenes and doing most of the work so they couldn't fit in much other stuff. The White dad was actually the one who got Michael close to the family. He gave him free stuff, paid for his food, helped out athletes overall. Here there is a scene where he sees Michael scavenge food yet does nothing. The guy in real life walked up to Michael and then, without even telling him anything about it, paid for his school lunches. Before his wife even knew about Michael. They totally erase his story to make Sandra Bullock do 80% of what he did in the book. I get why, it's her movie. But it just feels wrong. These 2 men in his life made a huge difference and became his father figures to make it all work for him in the sport. They cared. They are nice guys here too, but Sandra Bullock does the coaching and gets him to NFL here. Keep in mind she's just a former cheerleader. Her husband was a basketball player who is a booster for kids, meaning he helps young kids get into sports. So it's weird his role is removed here. But he's still a nice guy in the movie.Overall it's not quite the real story. But it's fairly close. The movie is just lazy. The emotional scenes are so extremely in your face that I couldn't handle it. Like, there are maybe 3 scenes where his step-sister high fives him and says \"good job bro\". The scenes are clearly added to illustrate that Michael is not sexually attracted to her. They have a goal, it's still bad film making. We also linger on people for too long. They want us to reaaaaaally feel what they are feeling. So when someone says something offensive the camera will linger on the person who heard it. We have a close up of a face for 4 seconds. It's unbearable. The lazy camera work makes everything linger seconds too long in an unnatural way where everyone looks like they are about to cry or kiss. It's creepy. You are supposed to make it feel like real social interactions not some extremely emotional stuff where you feel like everyone is constantly ready for hugs every second scene. It's so much feel good that it's fake. So eh, fine enough movie I guess. Something interesting scenes. It's just so lazy that I'm offended.",

Of course, it is about the rise of sports star Michael Oher, but in that story we see a lot of social commentary, and two really fantastic acting performances. Quinton Aaron is great as Oher, but it is Sandra Bullock who rightly got the attention of the Oscars committee for her role as well-to-do teacher and mother Leigh Anne Tuohy, who takes in a vulnerable black boy and then realizes his potential.The American football scenes are actually remarkably sparse, which is good, because I know very little about handegg. There is also a very good voice-over explanation by Bullock at the very beginning, which told me pretty much everything you need to know for the purposes of the story. There is more a bit later, and I have to admit that I wasn't following the subtleties, but I got more than enough to go forward with.The film does rather lead you by the hand emotionally, but I am happy to accept that from a film as long as it is done well. The social commentary, illustrated in the contrast between 'Big Mike's lack of ambition and the Tuohy family's assumption that the best is available to them, is nothing new either, but the point here is empathy, and the film delivers that in spades.The pace is fairly gentle throughout, which I think is director John Lee Hancock's forte. When he tried thrills and action in The Alamo, he came badly unstuck and ended up with an expensive, boring flop. He excels in writing, and slowly developing themes.The subtext is not perfect, certainly. I detected a couple of missteps, or at least sidesteps, but crucially, I could see mitigating circumstances for each decision the screenwriters made. All round, it doesn't put a foot far wrong.If you are a bloke, and doubt you would like a film this soppy, or you are a woman and doubt you would be too interested in a sports film, I suggest you give this movie a try. I think it will surprise you.",

I guess it never occurred to some of these folks that this was a true story, and one that occurred not that long ago.

She has a compelling if not amazing support cast, appropriately maybe, for this is a kind of finely tuned television scenario, made to Hollywood standards (in the best sense). But I say this because it's true enough to help understand the feel of the film: mainstream, feelgood, well-paced, well-written.

It's all pretty fun and at times funny and even at times tearjerky. Not bad for an everyday so-so movie.The plot is the other lynchpin holding the movie up, but also holding it back. All the personal bravery (however clich\u00e9d it looks on the screen), and the crossing of class and race lines, make for good American fodder. I bought into it for two hours. In the long run, it shines light on two pillars of mainstream American society: sports and Christianity, and both glare a little in the light. A little. The big money that drives college sports (and taints it, we presume) and the hypocrisy of ordinary folk who espouse some Christian values and not others (an old theme) are given an honest but very shallow look.There are scenes that are stretched thin, like the depictions of the projects and poor African-Americans bad mouthing Leigh Anne. But there are other scenes to balance this off that might be just as thin, but which are funny, as when Leigh Anne tells off some of her so-called friends at a restaurant. Low key, acerbic, and justified. Most of all, over and over, however improbable, Leigh Anne Tuohy \"does the right thing.\" A curious (and probably painful) counterbalance to Spike Lee's idea of right.The vibe in the movie review world is that this is a core values, conservative, even (slightly) evangelical film (at least compared to some of the competition). And that's unfair to conservatives, who can't be painted or tarred too easily, and to liberals, who have big hearts of their own now and then. That is: Leigh Anne is a paradigm of someone who is both supremely comfortable, her husband dripping in new wealth, and sharply moral. Her position is not simple. She not just someone who just does good (pulling a black homeless high schooler out of the street and into her white home). She does so with subtle, cunning, unflagging compassion. Yes, she is in a position to do that more easily than most, but she does do it. She is a role model.And there are those out there who don't like to see role models come from the other side of the aisle, and so a left-leaning saint is a bleeding heart liberal and a conservative saint is a do-gooder. Shame on everyone. See this movie and flinch at its clich\u00e9s if you want, but settle in to see one performance, by Bullock, that hits just the right notes. She was surprised at how well it has been received, so you may as well be, too.",

It was an overused premise, but the trailers looked kind of promise. Unfortunately, the film is an uninvolving, soggy mess from start to finish. The main problem is that they did not focus on the character of Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron, who's good in the little screen time he gets.) Instead, they focus on the character of Leigh Anne Tuohy (played by Sandra Bullock, who's annoying in the ludicrous amount of screen time she gets.) The film felt like it was a good star vehicle for Sandra Bullock, but they're dead wrong. The film should of been the Michael Oher story, not the Leigh Anne Tuohy story. The film also feels too old-fashioned for its own good. It feels like I was watching stock footage from the 1930s. The cast, besides Aaron, doesn't feel like they're trying at all. The character of S.J., the son of Leigh Anne and new found friend of Michael is a good character, but newcomer Jae Head who plays him feels like he knows he's in a bad movie, so he stopped trying. As for Tim McGraw and Lily Collins as Leanne's husband and daughter Sean and Collins, they're both seemingly talented people stuck in lame roles in a lame movie. On second thought, that's everyone in the movie.",

The fact the Sandra Bullock has been lauded for her role in the movie is no surprise given that she is basically the only character with more that a few lines in the movie, she does do a good job, but it wasn't 'outstanding'. Another reason to question the script is the lack of dialogue of the main protagonist - Michael. He is written into the movie as a chap with low IQ and almost mute - now, given that the actual young man is intelligent and a fantastic sportsman, I don't understand why he is portrayed in such a dim light - it actually comes across as racially condescending. On this note, we almost turned the movie off due to it's many cringeworthy moments such as the portrayal of racial differences (the 'oh-my god it's s bunch of black guys smoking pot' scene, stepford wives lunches- so perfectly perfect it is hideous-they even bicker perfectly, the fact that the house is portrayed as being HUGE but they only had room enough for Michael to sleep on the $10,000 sofa, (I could go on...) Though is was so cringy - it bought us much mirth after the movie in acting-out these ridiculous scenes again. Watch the movie if you like to be taken to lala land and enjoy life as fakery. Avoid like the plague if you prefer the scratched, worn, real-spirited portrayal of authenticity. (why oh why did Kathy Bates act in this two bit role?)",

Granted it doesn't help that the ultimate ending has been touted in all of the press for the film (Oher was recruited by the NFL) but at the same time it leaves little in the way of discovery for the audience except those who want to be lead by the nose to a conclusion they know going in.Don't get me wrong, its not a bad movie, its actually quite good, its just emotionally suspect with any feeling coming from the buttons it clearly is pushing.(I know old Hollywood used to do the same thing but they could at least trick you into not seeing the buttons) Much better than the 6 out of 10 I've rated it, I simply can't rate it higher because its too manipulative.",

One part that I liked involved the college coaches trying to get Michael to sign with their school saying lines somewhat like the oft-seen Big Ten commercial with all of their coaches.One reviewer found fault with Michael returning to his old neighborhood when he questioned if he had been used. I think that is what anyone in his position would do. As shown, he wasn't abandoning everything he had achieved, but wanted to talk to his mother.We thought the role played by Quinton Aaron was played magnificently. It is difficult to act while saying few words and he seemed most believable.The Tuohy family wasn't doing this as part of some crusade. They sort of fell into helping the young man for one night, and then continued. It wasn't all planned and, although he seemed trustworthy, they did take a risk.It was refreshing to see a lack of racism on display.

It's a mediocre movie with moments of greatness.As a Baltimore resident, I love to see the Ravens logo emblazoned on screen. Michael Ohers strikes me as both a respectable player and a respectable man. His story is an inspiring one; Ohers rose from poor circumstances and became a national figure. But this isn't the story you get when you put your $10 in the ticket slot, buy your buttery popcorn, and sit down in your sticky seat at the local cinema.\"The Blind Side\" is essentially about a dumb, poor, black man who finds salvation at the hands of a sassy white woman. Clearly, this is not the story of Michael Ohers. I'm not accusing the Hollywood producers responsible for the film of racism, but rather of opportunism. They obviously decided that this sports story would be best served as a Sandra Bullock movie, complete with \"comedic\" stock characters and \"humorously\" ironic situations.These Bullock-pampering comic scenes are then juxtaposed with clearly exaggerated and dramatized serious scenes. The effect is an uneven dramedy with some thudding jokes and some unintentional laughs. Toby Keith and Kathy Bates don't bring much to the table as Bullock's husband and Michael's teacher. However, the film doesn't completely collapse.Sandra Bullock gives one of the best performances of her career. With a game Southern accent and a tough-as-nails attitude, she turns a stereotype into a flesh-and-blood character. Her comedic timing has always been good, and it works especially well here. At the same time, she brings gravitas to her character's more trying moments. Bullock carries the film. While her character's role in Ohers' life is overplayed, her work saves the film from the \"DUD\" label.Some of the comedy falls flat, Ohers comes off as a wholly dependent idiot, and the film's realism is shaky at times. Still, it's worth seeing the film for Bullock's performance.",

            "content": "'The Blind Side' is a feel-good movie about a rich white Nashville, Tennessee family (the husband is a former athletic star and restaurant magnate, the wife an interior decorator with posh city contacts) that rescues a poor orphaned black boy and nurtures him into becoming a great football player. Based on a book by Michael Lewis, the story is substantially true: Michael Oher is a real person who had a crack addict mom and no dad, went through a series of foster homes, had a miserable young life and lousy school record. When the Twohy family took him up, he had gotten into a fancy school by a fluke when the coach saw his athletic potential and got him admitted. It's not just because of his athletic potential, the coach (Ray McKinnon) argued, in the scene of the movie, but just the good thing to do. 'The Blind Side' talks a lot about the good thing to do. The family and a friendly teacher saw he wasn't dumb, and he gradually improved his initially terrible grades and academic performance so he could play. The real life Michael Oher lived more or less this experience, got good grades after being tutored, went to the University of Mississippi. The NCAA was indeed suspicious, as in the movie, of Michael's choice of Ole Miss, since both his adoptive parents and his tutor were graduates and huge supporters of its football team. That was forgiven and he had a stunning college athletic career paved with trophies and recently got a five-year, $13.8 million contract to play for the Baltimore Ravens.The movie is about the miraculous blooming of a humble ghetto boy who learned to repress bad experiences and instead of being angry, is protective -- so he eventually becomes great at playing defense. As \"Big Mike\" actor Quinton Aaron is so quiet and recessive even S.J. (Jae Head), the pint-sized, hyper-active \"brother\" in his white adoptive family, runs circles around him as a personality. But the dominant figure is Sandra Bullock as the wife, Leigh Anne Tuohy. Bullock gives a suave performance: she's a walking clich\u00e9 yet manages to be quite winning. Leigh Anne not only initiates the adoption when the family observes \"Big Mike\" walking along the road from the school in the rain on a cold day with nothing but a shirt on. She even steps onto the football field later to coach the coach, telling him how to marshal the youth's formidable defensive skills.Critics are much less pleased by this film than Hancock's previous sports drama, 'The Rookie', another true story from a book, that one about a baseball player, who overcomes initial disappointment to become a pro. Dennis Quaid plays the athlete in 'The Rookie,' and the focus is on him and on the game.The idea of a saintly white woman who saves a po' black boy sticks in the craw of many, whether it's true or not. Melissa Anderson of the 'Village Voice,' who was added to the New York Film Festival jury that chose Lee Daniels' explosive and lurid 'Precious' last year, complained in her review that \"unlike the howling rage of Claireece Precious Jones, Michael. . .is mute, docile, and ever-grateful to the white folks who took him in. . .'Blind Side' the movie peddles the most insidious kind of racism, one in which whiteys are virtuous saviors, coming to the rescue of African-Americans who become superfluous in narratives that are supposed to be about them.\" It's hard to deny that 'Precious' the movie certainly focuses in much more detail on Clareece's grim, abusive ghetto existence. It plunges us into that world and rubs our noses in it. Though deeply flawed, 'Precious' is vivid. 'The Blind Side' tells its story conventionally, taking few chances. But 'Precious' is deeply flawed. It's melodramatic and lurid and omits any glimpse of positive aspects of Harlem life. But it's more memorable than 'The Blind Side'.I'd like to know how the real Michael Oher feels about this movie -- and about his own story, for that matter. If his experiences turned him into a much celebrated pro footballer, how is their story \"the most insidious kind of racism\"? If the Touhy family made his success possible with their support, love, and money, are they not indeed \"virtuous saviors\"? What is the politically correct way of telling this story?The advantage of 'The Blind Side' over 'Precious' despite its risking charges of white condescension is that it provides a positive image of helping the disadvantaged in the face of peer disapproval. 'The Blind Side' is about racism: the Tuohys face it from rednecks on the football field and from Leigh Anne's well-heeled lady friends, who chide her for including a giant black youth in the family's Christmas card photo. Or course this is nothing like the danger Michael faces when he returns to his mamma's neighborhood. A prominent black movie critic, Armond White, hates 'Precious.' He calls it \"the con job of the year,\" and says Daniels, Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey, the powerful black media magnates, \"come together at some intersection of race exploitation and opportunism.\" 'Precious' is exploitive. The \"crime\" of 'The Blind Side' is that it shows white people helping a black person. However, Leigh Anne tells her bitchy luncheon pals that she's not helping Michael, he's helping her. But that too will be be debunked: the white lady is doing good so she'll feel good. The Touhys had a wonderful time helping Michael Oher become an athletic star: shame on them! In this kind of subject, you just can't do the right thing. The (predominantly white) audience likes 'The Blind Side' just fine. It plays in three times as many theaters as 'Precious' and has made five times as much money.",

I thought she'd be a White angel sent down from heaven to pluck Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron) out of the Black abyss he was in.But the movie didn't quite go like that.Yes, you can say that Leigh Ann Tuohy, with the help of her husband Sean Tuohy (played by Tim McGraw), saved Michael Oher, but it was also a case of fate putting them on a collision course. Leigh Ann wasn't perusing the ghettos of Memphis to find a large Black kid to care for, Michael attended her son's school when she saw a kid in need.Michael, like many Black athletes, came from an extremely disadvantaged background. A friend he was staying with got him into Wingate Christian School and it was there that Leigh Ann first saw him. Later, while seeing him walking in the rain under-dressed, she offered her home to him which evolved into a permanent stay.As much as I wanted to dislike Leigh Ann I couldn't. She was forward, bossy, and abrasive, but her heart was in the right place. From personal experience, I can get along with an abrasive person when I know they actually care. And it wasn't Leigh Ann alone, her entire family embraced Michael which truly melted the heart. Honestly, the whole arrangement could only work if every member of the family was behind it and they were.If there was one aspect of the movie I appreciated as much as any other it would be the NCAA investigation at the end. The NCAA investigation broached the subject of the true motivation of Leigh Ann and her husband Sean. Did they become Michael's legal guardian in order to funnel him to their alma mater, or was it two good Christians doing what they believed was their Christian duty? That was a very important question that needed to be asked because it changes the entire narrative if the answer is the former.\"The Blind Side\" was a joy of a movie. I love to see good people doing good things for other good people. It's very rare that a movie would feature so many positive characters when I'm so used to seeing movies where I don't like even one character. \"The Blind Side\" is a wonderful story made into an excellent movie.",

I just couldn't bring myself to watch her same old lame act one more time - especially since she has already been in about 12 movies this year. Wow, what a pleasant surprise this was.Based on the amazing story of Michael Oher, Bullock delivers her best work in years, maybe ever. On top of that, Quinton Aaron is terrific as Mr. Oher. The bond is uplifting and believable. Yes, it has some fluff and mass appeal formula, but it is certainly watchable and quite enjoyable.We see very little of Oher's roots and the high school football coach is miscast and tough to watch, but those are the only minor quibbles I have with an otherwise fine movie that will (and already has) appealed to a wide audience. I often worry about my film snobbishness, but I bought off on this one and thanks go to director John Lee Hancock (The Alamo) for teetering, but not falling into full blown chick flick.",

            "content": "\"The Blind Side\" is a different, and quite unusual story of one person helping another who is down and out. It's not a typical biopic about a kind person who starts an orphanage; or a saintly person who rescues the homeless on the streets; or a hero who starts a charity to build a hospital in a poor country. Rather, this is about a woman who wasn't driven for any particular charitable or humanitarian cause, who simply responded to a situation and circumstances she came across to help one person. And, in the process, she found that it filled the gap of something that was missing in the lives of her family. As the real Leigh Anne Touhy says, when Michael Oher joined their family, \"It had a far greater impact on our lives than it did on his life.\"Indeed, that is the reality that many people discover when they reach out to help someone else. For people of faith, acts of charity inevitably lead to changes in their lives that they see as blessings.This is a wonderful movie about a true story, based on a 2006 book by Michael Lewis, \"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game.\" It's a drama and sports story about a 17-year-old boy who was living on the streets in Tennessee, who was taken into a home and made part of a family, and who then became a standout football player through college and as a pro in the National Football League.Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy superbly, and won the best actress Oscar and best actress Golden Globe for her role. All of the cast are very good in this inspiring, sometimes lightly humorous, and all around uplifting story and film.",

            "content": "Sandra Bullock's Oscar was perhaps a given but the award gave this film a bump for those who have not already seen it \u2013 which is all of us in the UK as the film only came out recently. Watching it though it is hard to shake the feeling that in about 10 years (once the terrestrial premier etc has died down) this will find its rightful home on daytime television surrounded by other overly sentimental \"true-story\" movies. If you take the couple of Hollywood faces out of this film then there is very little else to it that you wouldn't get there.This is not to take away from the basic story which is engaging and quite touching when you go through it, but rather the way it is done. The material is delivered without any insight or depth and what this results in is a rather schmaltzy film that has regular musical cues to let you know how to feel and never really gets to the heart of any of the characters. In doing this it is still an OK film and the actual story is warming and solid enough to do the job \u2013 albeit even those who don't know the outcome will have that spoilt for them by the film opening with the assumption that everyone already knows who Michael Oher is. It wonders along with lots of touching moments, sad looks, cute kids and lots of \"overcoming\" but it doesn't manage to lift itself above the clich\u00e9s in any way other than how professionally made it all is.Bullock doesn't deserve her Oscar for this but who could begrudge her since she is as charming as she is profitable. She does have good moments and she does get the mix of tough exterior and inner emotions but she doesn't do more than that and it is hardly a brilliant performance. Aaron is suitably large and quiet and, from the archive footage at the end, certainly seems to capture the manner of the real person, even if there is always a sense of \"air brushing\" about his performance. Head is irritating as one would expect while McGraw and Collins are so-so. Bates adds another famous face to the mix but nobody really does more than the basics.It is not that The Blind Side is a bad film because I did actually quite like it in an obvious sort of way; it is more that the film itself is sentimental and clich\u00e9d without anything in the way of genuine grit or character to get into. The performances are solid and Bullock does her stock no end of good with an engaging \"professional conservative Mom\" turn that has sold well in the areas you would expect, but nobody can do a great deal with this material.",

            "content": "For those non-believers, naysayers and pessimists let me begin by unequivocally stating that the film The Blind Side is not a Christian based funded film, and the real Michael Oher's life has been embellished and timelines changed somewhat for the big screen. What cannot be disputed though is the fact that the Tuohy family most likely saved Michael Oher from being an impoverished youth with no bright future. Instead the Tuohy's who had the financial ability, but more importantly the willingness to bring a complete impoverished stranger into their home and blend in with their two existing children as a family unit.No doubt The Blind Side is an inspirational story that will tug at your heart strings, and you may even shed a few tears as Mrs. Shullivan and I both succumbed to, not once, but twice. Even the second time as we sat down to watch the film several years later after it was originally released. The portrayal by actor Quinton Aaron of the desperate and abandoned young Michael Oher is very real such that you wish you could help this young man yourself. Michael's relationship with the four (4) Tuohy family members especially the mother, Leigh Anne Tuohy played by Sandra Bullock was a relationship that exuded generosity, compassion and understanding. Sandra Bullock went on to win her first Oscar for her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy and I would agree with the Academy members who voted for her. I also felt that Quinto Aaron was deserving of an Oscar nomination as his role was just as difficult and effective in generating empathy for the under privileged youth and how a persons life can be turned around if only given an opportunity to succeed within a decent environment and with a families support.The Blind Side will stand the test of time and may even inspire a few more families to open their hearts and their homes to a stranger who may need a helping hand. I give the film a high 9 out of 10 rating, and maybe by the third time I watch it again my rating may increase to a perfect 10.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: The Blind Side",
            "content": "Much of the hype in this film comes from Sandra Bullock's fine performance as Leigh Ann Tuohy, a God fearing rich woman who had chosen to adopt a kid off the street out of plain human compassion, offer him a home, school, even introduced him to football, and essentially turned his life around without ever wanting anything back in return. Incredible as it may sound, it's actually based on the true story of Michael Oher's life given a new lease to stay off the streets, and the opportunities extended to him as part of the Tuohy family, to turn him into the pro-footballer he is today.And this heartwarming story reminds us that while it's easy to pay lip service to charitable organizations, or at times feel overwhelmed with the myriad of societal issues that need fixing, all it takes is that small step forward to spark a massive change for the better, especially when help comes from within and from an honest and sincere heart. We cannot change the world and cure it of all its ills, but it's the little things that we do within our capacity that will make the most difference and impact.The story may not be something new, and you've probably watched countless of films with similar themes and the fusion of inspiration and sports. Moreover, some may feel that the rich characters here have within their means to extend help, but pay no heed to that, because just how many out there would find it compelling to do something like what the Tuohys did? And I kid you not when I say the marketing of the film tried to pass this off like a clich\u00e9 rags to riches film where a character finds his true calling in American football or learn about values such as teamwork and group above self and so on. It's not exactly a sports or football movie, but one about compassion, change and the belief that with effort comes result for a fellow human being who had been tossed an unfair circumstance to cope with.Sandra Bullock's come a long way from the days of driving a bus in Speed, to various average romantic flicks, and finally settling in a role that calls for plenty of gravitas, which she pulled off wonderfully. In Erin Brockovich style complete with blonde hair, Southern drawl and Maximizer bra, she plays Leigh Anne as the tough cookie who gets her way and never takes no for an answer, which explains how what may seem like a whim, turn and become something of a crusade in genuinely fighting a prejudiced system to get others to open up to Big Mike / Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) and get to engage with the quiet boy in more meaningful ways through out of the box techniques. I have never seen Sandra Bullock come close to playing any character like Leigh Anne, and this is indeed busting any preconceived glass ceiling that dramas are not her forte.Quinton Aaron also provided that perfect pairing opposite Bullock as the lumbering giant with a heart of gold, knowing that his strength is not in the physical sense (not that he doesn't have that in abundance), but in his innate ability for ball games and protective intuition. He may be slow in learning, but he's not stupid, contrary to many especially his teachers who seem resigned to the fact that he cannot be taught subjects through the proper schooling channel. Aaron plays this role with plenty of sentimentalism and sensitivity, that it's extremely hard not to empathize, nor to feel for him when the chips are down or to cheer and root for him even when good things happen.And the rest of the cast, especially Tim McGraw, Jae Head and Lily Collins all add a little sparkle as members of the Tuohy family (who owns a chain of fast food franchises) who because of Leigh Anne, all learn to accept and embrace Michael as one of their own. Kathy Bates round off the wonderful cast when she enters the picture in the final act as Miss Sue, Michael's personal tutor engaged to ensure he passes high school with a decent GPA needed to further his studies as well as the sport of choice.The Blind Side will open up your eyes to a worthwhile \"true life\" story that you should be aware of, and be inspired from, and I'd say Sandra Bullock should be quite the shoo-in for the Golden Globe, and way overdue for an Oscar as well. Highly recommended as her performance alone is well worth the ticket price!",

That probably makes for a better world, but sadly enough adds up to a rather boring night at the movies. This film has nothing to tell, apart from how great the white American upper middle class is, and I find it surprising that even people in America should be interested in such blatant propaganda. So you might argue, that this tells a true story, but if the story had been that dull to begin with, they either should have put some excitement in it or made a film about my next door neighbor, who's done nothing out of the extraordinary, but who's life is by all accounts more interesting than that of Michael Oher, if this film is anything to go by. But what really pisses me off is the thinly disguised racism that seeps in halfway through. So this big, black kid gets adopted by these nice white folks, who never fight, never have any arguments whatsoever. The big black kid wants a driving license, he gets a driving license, and you know what, because our nice rich white family is so generous, they buy him a pick up truck to go along with it. So he takes their little white son for a drive around the block and crashes the car big time, but do our white parents so much as bat an eyelid and feel any resentment against the big black kid. On the contrary, they are apparently very grateful as he selflessly prevented the son from being injured more severely. Surprisingly enough, no one in this family has ever any issues with this traumatized, rather morose black fellow moving in on short notice. In fact, both kids are rather fond of him straight away. Whatever happened to Douglas Sirk? He could have turned this story around. With John Lee Hanncock it's utterly hopeless. There is just no conflict whatsoever. Everyone gets along like a house on fire. Wait, wait, I forgot, there is Michael's mother (black) who comes across as rather irresponsible and Michael's old buddies (black) who are portrayed as violent, lazy and rude. But as Michael doesn't feel any ties to neither of them, everything would be fine, if it wasn't for an investigator form the National Collegiate Athletic Association (black, what a surprise) who suspects that Michael has been forced to chose a certain University for his career as a football pro. Do you care? We neither do I. The more since American Football must be one of the most boring sports and I wish they would stop making films about this folly.",

They try to get his grades up at school so that he can play football and soon they discover his true talent. You know going in what to expect from this true-story but the amount of sugar really got under my skin after a while as did the fact that this thing followed every sports clich\u00e9 in the book. Every once in a while a film will come along and makes millions of dollars and I'm left there scratching my head as to why. I think I know why but this film pretty much plays to a simple crowd who probably aren't going to expect too much. I'm not sure how many times this film followed a clich\u00e9 and delivered the same type of clich\u00e9d line and I honestly couldn't help but laugh. Just like the scene where Bullock walks up to some gangsters in the ghetto and insults them. Now, this gangster just pulled a gun on her son and has probably killed a few folks in his day yet he's going to let this white woman come up on his turf and insult him? It's doubtful but it's one of those \"cheer\" moments that only take place in movies like this. If one hasn't seen a lot of sports movies then perhaps they won't get annoyed with all the stuff here but I've seen quite a few in my day and by the hour mark I was wishing I was somewhere else. The film has been getting a lot of attention for its performances and they're pretty good throughout, although I certainly attach the word Oscar to any of them. Bullock gives the Southern accent her all and delivers a fiery performance but to me the real breakthrough was Aaron. He does a pretty strong job at playing quiet and really delivering emotions without saying a word, which is a lot more impressive than just shouting out lame dialogue. Even McGraw does a nice job but I must say the real NCAA coaches don't come off as good. The subject matter has been sugar-coated to the point of being watered down but this is to be expected since this is a mainstream film trying to capture as many people as it can. It certainly worked because as I was walking out there were many people crying, myself including, but my tears were of frustration for just wasting $20.",

This is not cool. What has been created here is an insipid drama that insults audience intelligence. Not only that, it's ineffably racist and poorly dramatized.Firstly, if I was a black guy I would seriously be insulted by this movie. The character of Michael Oher is little more than a modern reworking of Uncle Tom; while the nice white middle-class suburbanite characters pity his appalling ghetto poverty and nasty urban community whom peddle drugs, take drug or vilify nice white people who are trying to protect them from fooling with drugs and guns. There is not one character of color that can be regarded as three-dimensional. For that matter, there's not even one white character in this movie that's three-dimensional. Everything about this movie: from themes, characters and politics- is lowest-denominator.The plot is totally by the numbers. I didn't know much about this film before watching it, but 5 minutes in I knew where it was going. I knew all the conflicts that were going to pop up and how effortlessly they'd be overcome. I knew there'd be no real character arc for Leigh Anne Tuohy, and the dramatic growth of Michael Oher's character was without any sort of surprise. It was simplistic in every way.I read somewhere on in the comments pages that this was Sandra Bullock's 'masterpiece'. I beg to disagree. Ms. Bullock has yet to make a masterpiece, or deliver a performance that can be deemed masterful. (That's not saying she isn't a good actress or not pretty, because she is: very much so.) For that matter, hasn't Kathy Bates played the exact same role in her last 17 movies? Talk about type casting. Furthermore, the kid playing S.J. was the most annoying child depicted in film.

It is so predictable that it would be almost impossible to include spoilers in the review, but for the benefit of the mentally deficient I'll try not to give away too much. Basically, its the story of a gentle giant who gets adopted by the most nauseatingly nice family since the Brady Bunch. Our hero, \"Big Mike\" is a misfit kid from the projects who gets accepted into a high performing high school. One night, as he's making his way to the gym, were he sleeps, the Touhey family take pity on him and take him into their perfect family home. This is were Sandra Bullock takes control of the plot and of the whole movie. There's no doubt in my mind that Director John Lee Hancock molded this movie to make Sandra Bullock look like the award winning actress she isn't. Her husband, Sean, played by Tim McGraw, is the most pointless character in movie history. Even a henpecked husband would be more humorous than the impotent piece of passivity this man represents. Son, S.J., played by Jae Head, is one of those annoying child characters who gets way too much screen time and daughter, Collins, played by Lily Collins has to be the most understanding teenage girl ever to feature in a Hollywood movie. Quinton Aaron, who plays \"Big Mike\" does as good a job as he's let, given that he dare not steal attention from Sandra Bullock's dominance. There's one good scene when he returns to the bad guys in the projects were he grew up. It's the only good scene actually, probably because Sandra Bullock is not in it. I won't bore you with the details of the whole football plot, you'll guess were its going very early on; especially when Sandra Bullock's character starts telling the coach what to do. Apart from the \"Boys in the Hood\" in Mike's old neighborhood, there's just one other bad guy, but he's just a loud mouth racist at a football game who Sandra Bullock deals with predictably. There's shades of \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" \"Good Will Hunting\" and even \"Shine\" in this movie. Sadly though, those shades are quickly obliterated by Miss Bullocks ego.",

I recommend this movie to anyone who really understands the science and true meaning of a great movie that was based on a true story like \"Men of honor\" and \"A beautiful mind \". All these movies have touched us deeply and although I was cynical about watching this movie at first I just watched it out of boredom and it was the best decision because you actually can forget about all your problems and be caught in this amazing story .

You can have courage based on a dumb idea or mistake, but you're not supposed to question adults, or your coach or your teacher, because they make the rules. Maybe they know best, but maybe they don't. It all depends on who you are, where you come from. Didn't at least one of the six hundred guys think about giving up, and joining with the other side? I mean, valley of death that's pretty salty stuff. That's why courage it's tricky. Should you always do what others tell you to do? Sometimes you might not even know why you're doing something. I mean any fool can have courage. But honor, that's the real reason for you either do something or you don't. It's who you are and maybe who you want to be. If you die trying for something important, then you have both honor and courage, and that's pretty good. I think that's what the writer was saying, that you should hope for courage and try for honor. And maybe even pray that the people telling you what to do have some, too.Based on the true story of Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sean Tuohy who take in a homeless teenage African-American, Michael Oher. Michael has no idea who his father is and his mother is a drug addict. Michael has had little formal education and few skills to help him learn. Leigh Anne soon takes charge however, as is her nature, ensuring that the young man has every opportunity to succeed. When he expresses an interest in football, she goes all out to help him, including giving the coach a few ideas on how best to use Michael's skills. They not only provide him with a loving home, but hire a tutor to help him improve his grades to the point\nSandra bullock got an Oscar did she deserve I don't know but it's a great film and made over 200million I saw this in the cinema it has a great acting in it.",

The story was utterly predictable and failed to instill any sense of surprise in any moments. From the first twenty minutes, you could predict the course of the plot if you'd seen any kind of \"inspirational\" sports movie. The characters were no better. Tim Mcgraw faded into the wallpaper about a third of the way through the movie, and I was about ready to hurl a brick at my TV just so I could pretend I was throwing a real one at SJ. The character of Michael Oher seemed like a baby made from the genes of Forrest Gump and John Coffey, with a touch of Radio, but I'll give the actor pity points for effort. My greatest contempt, however, goes towards Sandra Bullock. I honestly think she did a better job in \"All About Steve\". She seems like an amalgamation of the \"rough on the players cuz I love 'em\" coaches you see in every other generic sports movie, only with estrogen and a TERRIBLY faked southern accent. I was shocked when they chose her for the Oscar over Gabourey Sidibe, who, unlike Bullock, seems to know one or two things about ACTING. All in all, if you're going to watch this movie, I suggest you drink heavily beforehand so you don't have to comprehend the awfulness of this \"film\"",

A lot of people cried foul at the \"white woman saves the day!\" aspect, but since it's a true story I didn't mind it too much. What I did mind was the lack of realism in a lot of it. Not only did they change the facts to make it seem like Oher was this doofus nobody who was taught everything about football by Leigh Anne Tuohy, but scenes like the one where she went into the projects on her own just felt so cheap and artificial. I don't know, a lot of the scenes with Tuohy felt like the writer was just sitting behind his computer writing it thinking, \"Damn that bitch is sassy!\".Sandra Bullock doesn't really help matters, but I was surprised by her restraint in a lot of scenes. When I first heard that awful accent in the opening monologue I shuttered at the idea of spending two hours with it, but was surprised to find her not very grating. Actually, she ended up feeling more flat than anything else, as did a lot of this film. It wasn't a brutal watch by any means, but everything was really brought down to it's lowest denominator and turned into this dry, vanilla TV movie. It also features what has to be some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard. A project gangster actually says the line, \"I'll bust a cap in your fat ass.\" What.",

This current movie, though, is not about those TV families. It's really about the White, Southern, God of high-school football, and if it takes a hulking, disadvantaged black boy to keep that image of God going, then so be it.For a less romanticized, but more objective, view of disadvantaged black athletes in a white, Christian, school environment you should compare this movie with the classic movie \"Hoop Dreams\" (reviewed in IMDb at: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110057/) I'm very glad to see Sandra Bullock win awards for her performance in this film, but keep in mind the awards are for her, not for this movie.",

The film tells the true story of Michael Oher, a homeless teenager who became an NFL player and college graduate with the help of a loving family (played by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw).The story runs into the same problem as another 2009 film, Invictus, in the sense that by being true to the events as they happened, there is a lack of conflict. In the real-life counterpart Blind Side, I might have expected, due to the fact that the story takes place in Central Tennessee and a white family is taking in a black teenager that it would be story largely about racism. In real life, however, Leigh Ann Tuohy was remarkably colorblind and so was her husband and the movie doesn't dare contradict that. A couple confused relatives and a suspicious NCAA infractions investigator is about all we get for a reminder of racial tension in the deep south, but hey, it's the post-racial era, what can we expect?In spite of that, this is a picture that works. The drama is authentic but it also engages because it's centered around a struggle that takes many forms and stages: the central figure has to learn to open himself up, to trust, to succeed on the field and in the classroom, etc.As for the acting, Sandra Bullock has a strong consistency to the way she approaches the character. The real-life woman is somewhat of an enigma in her motivations and Bullock makes it believable. Quinton Aaron is amazing and had as much of a role in carrying the movie as Bullock. He has such presence (partially because of his size) but appears so uncomfortable with that presence at first and gradually transform into it.Kathy Bates shouldn't be so heavily advertised because her role basically amounts to a cameo.",

It was a roller-coaster of emotions for me, from feel-good to heartbreak to triumph to defeat, and then triumph all over again.This is 24 hours later, and I'm still thinking if there was something wrong with this movie, but I cannot find anything. Powerful story, excellent top-notch acting, believable situations, real life drama at its finest. A movie to treasure and watch again and again as time goes by.I have been reading some of the previous posters' opinions. It does not make me happy to say that I feel many did not get the message it conveyed, but rather, chose to adopt the very same stance the Social Services Dept. rep in the movie took, that of openly doubting the motives from the family of helping the boy, and sullying their reputation by slapping ulterior motives to their \"mission\" of aid. If we all thought like that, none of us would do anything for anyone. I was a recipient of similar aid myself in the past, not once, but several times. Since I have no family, I saw myself in Michael's position, and mentally, I reverted back to those days and the events that transpired then. Let me say I'd be damned if I thought or said such aid came to me with an ulterior motive in mind. Having been there, I understood Mrs. Tuohy's approach. Why would I call this an example of racism, or of a psychopathic lady with an ego problem?I guess it takes all kinds, but you just go ahead and watch the movie with an open mind without pausing on negatives, and in the end, see how it appears to you. If you think this is an example of racism and hidden interests, fine then. But if you view it like I did, you'll be glad you saw it, and after turning events over in your mind, see how it appeals to your finer senses.I wrote this, not because I'm expecting anyone to read it (I don't think anyone will go through over 60 prior posting just to get to mine), but just because I wanted to give it a 10, so well deserved, and I wanted to thank Sandra Bullock and the entire cast for such a wonderful story, the kind that can make you believe in life all over again.",

It was a bit too convenient for him, but unfortunately this is the society we live in, we are getting harder and harder to believe in such stories, in such people who really want to help without reasons, selfless. Besides this, it was a warm and uplifting movie, giving a little bit of hope, even being tried by some tears, not gonna' lie. I expected, as I was seeing in the poster, a football story, more games to be played, like in all the other movies, but it's a good thing, I liked this story how was told behind the games with all the aspects and feelings of the player in the non game time. The cast was great and all played well their part. Sandra's performance was interesting, different, but not her best. The win is justified more because the other nominees weren't as good as her, but the nomination, no doubt was deserved, as well as the best motion picture nomination.

There's a certain charm within ladies for big over-sized guys who have a heat of gold and that is exactly what he has portrayed here. Some excellent scenes where he's shown to be emotionally brittle and vulnerable and his guardian (Sandra Bullock) makes him walk through safe. Being an adopted child, there is that inevitable moment of doubt where he tends to break away but the story culminates in the most appropriate and happy way expected.

Most kids born and raised in an environment such as Hurt Village would have gave in to the idea that they are destined to do drugs and live the life they were born and raised in. Some feel as though they have no choice or that there is no hope for them to make something more of themselves or their life I should say. Michael was not one to let that environment shape who he is. He didn't like the idea of drugs and violence. He did what he could to take care of himself and he truly had a good heart. He wasn't one to be rude or talk down to others. He had a great personality and longed for the support of a family that he could love and be loved by. My favorite part that shows an example of prejudice comments was when Mrs. Tuohy tells her selfish, rude, stuck up friends or sisters or whatever they were to her at lunch... \"Shame on you.\" for their comments about a big black boy staying in their home and assuming right away that he was a danger to Collins. Mrs. Tuohy didn't let peer pressure get the best of her and she didn't care what the other's thought about her taking in Michael. If those ladies would have taken the time to get to know Michael, they would see how important it is to not judge people so quickly. There were several other times when the Tuohy family restored my faith in humanity and I have respect for all that they did to support and care for Michael. The movie was entertaining and meaningful. It displays an important outlook on life and the people you encounter. It was inspiring and uplifting. The actors played their role perfectly and I enjoyed every minute of it!",

When the movie first came to theatres I was really intrigued by the story because I've been a huge NFL Fan most of my life. I didn't know who Michael Oher was though going into the movie but that probably was because he was part of the 2009 NFL Draft which was the same year the movie came out... Anyways I was very excited to see it. Now the only thing I wasn't sure on is if Tim McGraw would do right by such a Interesting and intriguing story because I thought he might ruin it since he was a country singer and not an actor but I was so wrong! Tim McGraw was Fantastic as Sean Tuohy. He played such a fantastic father who was super nice and very easy going, he was great! The Movie was so upsetting in many ways but overall it was such a motivating and positive story! At the end you can't help but have a huge smile on your face. What makes it so spectacular to me anyways was that it's a true story. This huge but very shy and kind young man who seems to have no hope in life randomly runs into these kind strangers who are the parents of some kids that go to the school he was attending. They take him in for the night realizing he has no place to sleep. Leigh Anne Tuohy sees that he is such a kind young man that she asks him to stay for Thanksgiving and from there starts to love him like her own child. They let him live with them and from there amazing things start to happen for Michael Oher. I can't Say enough about how much I love this film it's just amazing. I recommend it to anyone who feels lost in life or for anyone who needs a little motivation. It shows us that no matter what hand we are dealt in life we have the opportunity to come out on top!! :)",

            "content": "The Blind Side directed by John Lee Hancock is a film based off of a true story of the famous NFL football player Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron. The plot of this film is about a young underprivileged black boy that has an amazing talent playing football, but is extremely uneducated. He ends up going to a school where, the Tuohy's, a wealthy white Christian family take him in and become his legal guardians. Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) her husband Sean (Tim McGraw) and their family face many challenges with adopting Michael. Throughout this movie Michael and the Tuohy's are faced with many different obstacles, from social acceptance to overcoming emotional hardships. From watching this film a common theme has presented itself through the storyline. The main theme in this movie would be to not judge a book by its cover. The first major indicator of the theme in this film would be Michael being judged from his appearance that he is good at sports. Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon) pushes for Michael's application to be accepted into Wingate Christian School because he assumes because of Michael's appearance he will be good at sports. While Michael has the physical ability to play the sports, he lacks the emotional and mental ability. Throughout this film Michael is coached to become a better football player. A second indicator of the theme in this film would be Michael being judged from all of his teachers in the school. They assume that he is worthless and unable to learn because he hasn't had a stable upbringing to where he had the opportunity to become educated. One of the instructors Mrs. Boswell (Kim Dickens) can see the potential in him, so she works closely with him to get his grades up to be able to play sports in school. Lastly Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy being accused of taking Michael in for their own benefits. On the outside it may seem like they took him in to build him up to be a good football player to benefit their college, but throughout the film it shows the emotional bond that the Tuohy's and Michael have created. From an outside perspective it may look like the Touhy's adopted Michael for their personal gain, but the film shows the whole story of the emotional bond that they have created. In this film there are a few techniques that contribute to the theme. The first being when Burt is talking to the man that brought Michael to the school there are parallel cuts between that conversation and Michael playing basketball. This gives the viewer the indication that Michael is good at sports and that he will fit in at Wingate. Going back to the theme this scene strongly identifies with the theme that you can't judge a book by its cover. A second indication of the theme through techniques would be in the scene that Michael is being interrogated by Investigator Granger (Sharon Morris). The technique that is being used in this scene would be the high angle shots and low angle shots. In the clips with Michael it was filmed with high angle shots and Investigator Granger was filmed with low angle shots. The high angle shot dwarfs Michael and makes him appear smaller and more like a victim, while the low angle shot makes Investigator Granger seem larger and extremely intimidating. In this scene she is trying to bully Michael into saying that the Tuohy's adopted him for their benefits, which ties back into the theme that you can't judge a book by its cover. Overall this movie is a good film with a strong theme. I would recommend to watch if you like sports movies with a little more emotion behind them, such as Remember the Titans. Judging a book by its cover is very strong in both of these films and it is prominent throughout the films.",

(Jae Head), the Tuohy's invite Michael into their lives and household equally as their own. Michael comes from a drug-addict mother and no recognized dad. Bounced around from numerous foster care homes, Michael kept running away searching for what he was missing, a home. Mrs. Tuohy recognizes Michael has no place to call home, therefore inviting him into their home. Although the Tuohy's are assisting Michael, Michael is in turn preparing them for their own changes. The Blind Side shows the theme within this film is that people are able to exceed circumstances amongst them. Upon expressing an interest in football, Mrs. Tuohy exerts her every being to see he is on the field and given the opportunity to learn and play the game. During a scene of the film, Leigh Anne gives pointers to the coach about Michael scoring high in protective instincts, which causes him to protect his team, as well as his family. Not only did the Tuohy's provide Michael with a devoted home, they also employed a tutor to aid the improvement of his grades. With help and encouragement from Leigh Anne and family, Michael overcomes the economic challenges he had faced. Leigh Anne ensures Michael has a chance for a brighter future and the opportunity to succeed in all his endeavors. The motif of the film is the scenes concluding thru black and white calms. The scene when Michael is dispirited while trying to make friends with two little girls that ran away from him. Another when Leigh Anne's torn once Michael questions her about why she helped him. The close-up angles used in the film, with a focus on the face, shows the definition of hurt and sadness in their eyes. The movie Miracle has a relevant theme as The Blind Side. Michael holds true to the morals and beliefs that are effective and profound of a perceptive individual. All through the movie, Michael exceeds the circumstances once against him. Equally, on and off the football field the environments that envelop him no longer surround him. The ability to exceed negative environments proves that people do not have to be restricted by the settings that frame them.",

Michael is a seventeen year old, with a drug addicted mom and no known father, therefore he was in foster care, however he kept running away with nowhere to call home. Leigh Anne finds Michael and realizes he has no place to call home, she takes him in to become a part of her family which consists of Leigh Ann and Sean's children, Collins (Lily Collins) and SJ (Jae Head). While the Tuohy's are helping Michael is in turn helping them make transformations of their own. As Michael, becomes a part of the family, he runs into new obstacles. Michael struggles in his new school, with grades and on the field. Michael struggles with his grades, having a low grade point average, however Coach Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon) know Michael is an asset on the field. Leigh Anne learns Michael has low grades scores, however he is 98th percentile for his protective instincts and she decides to use this to help him on the field. However in order to be able to play for the school, the Tuohy's hire Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) to tutor Michael in his studies, to bring his grade point up to at least a 2.5. Miss Sue gives Michael a pep talk to help him understand she will get him to the grades he needs to play. During this scene, you see the close-ups on Miss Sue and Michael as they are talking, with darker lighting to make the scene more dramatic. It comes time for Michael to decide on the college he wants to attend, while it seems, many including Miss Sue are trying to influence him on what college to attend, with Miss Sue and the Tuohy's Alma mater, Ole Miss. Michael decides Ole Miss and then the investigation ensues about the Tuohy's motives to influence Michael. Michael is called in to talk to the investigators and defends the Tuohy's without question, while Leigh Anne is waiting outside. Michael is finished with his interview and walks outside to Leigh Ann. In this scene, you will see they are using the two person camera angle to bring dramatics to the scene, where you see Leigh Anne asking Michael, what school he wanted to go as she realized no one had actually asked him. Michael went from being a homeless teen, to having a family who cared as much about Michael as he did them. He struggled through his studies to go to Ole Miss and becoming a professional football player being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens as a first round pick in 2009.",

For those with any intelligence then read further. The blind side is simply a development of the hit series \"the O.C\" . A child from a poor family gets adopted from a rich family who seem to have tones of money without showing any proof of actually working for their wealth. This is all very well but the problem with this scenario is that children from bad backgrounds are not friendly bears: This child \"Friendly Mike\" has no aggressive personality and is simply a really nice kid who happens to have grown up in the wrong part of town. A good film would have examined the difficulties of adopting a child from a poor background and would have the problems that develop with this situation. Instead the rich white family happen to have a perfect child who displays no negative attributes. The question that you need to ask yourself is: what would have happened if the child had robbed the family after his first opportunity to live with them? would they have given up on them or tried to teach him the ways of a better life? The blind side doesn't address any of these issues and simply deals with adopting a child from an underprivileged background who just happens to be perfect already. An unrealistic story line which would never happen. Nice for those with an unrealistic perspective on life. Would possible have been fine 20 years ago but films have come along way since then and Hollywood needs to address realistic issues.",

            "content": "The Blind Side Movie ReviewThe story of Michael Oher and his adoptive family led to one of the greatest movies of the decade, and one of the best I have ever seen. Between the phenomenal true story, the emotion, and the amazing cast, it was almost impossible to not fall in love with this movie.Michael is a poor black boy from the hood, while the Touhy's are a rich white family from the suburbs of Memphis. The Touhy family is driving home one night and see Michael walking around with nowhere to go. They generously give up their home for the night but little do they know they will instantly fall in love with this boy and take him in as one of their own kids. Throughout the movie the Touhy's give Michael a home, and education, and a love for football. Michael's life is changed instantly for the better. All because one family forgot about race and took in a boy in need. The story line is the most important part in any movie, and in \"The Blind Side\", the story is everything. The fact that this is a true story is what really makes it special for me. The director John Lee Hancock did an outstanding job of recreating Michael Oher's life and making such an emotional movie out of it. Seeing Michael's transition academically and athletically all because the Touhy family gave him a home is truly inspirational.To go with the great story, John Lee Hancock needed an excellent cast to help sell the story, and he got that with award winning actress in Sandra Bullock. Sandra Bullock is arguably the heart and soul of this movie. She plays her role with such a passion that it is hard to believe that she isn't actually the mother of Michael Oher. This is one of the key reasons the story is so believable. Sandra Bullock did an amazing job being a mother in this movie and showing true compassion for Michael's Character. The whole supporting cast was great, and showed a true family bond, but Sandra Bullock is really the main factor in the movie that makes the love so believable. This movie is very diverse in emotion. From the first moment Mrs. Touhy meets Michael we can feel the love and compassion she has for him. But at the same time the opposing football players have so much hate for Michael just because of the color of his skin. The fact that the Touhy's were the only ones who accepted Michael is very inspiring. They never thought twice about what they were doing, they just did what they hoped anybody else would do. It is nearly impossible to not be moved by this movie and its emotion. The way Mrs. Touhy treated Michael like one of her own kids made me fall in love with the story the first time I watched it. \"The Blind Side\" is a great movie that is perfect for those of all ages. John Lee Hancock did an amazing job turning this true story into a masterpiece. This is not only a heartwarming story about a family who took in a child in need, it is a story about a family that changed a man's life.",

When the local high school football coach is not able to provoke sufficient violence from his players, who steps in? -- White Woman! When this same coach stupidly calls sophisticated passing plays when he should be calling jam-it-down-their-throats running plays, who steps in? -- White Woman!

Suffice to say the longer you sit through this mess (and long you will sit through many sports montages which would have felt clich\u00e9d back in the late 80s) the more offended you should be no matter what your demographic categories you mark on your U.S. Census form. Professional football where careers last approximately 3 or 4 seasons on average and only lucky players are able to walk without pain between their \"retirement\" and their often premature deaths is held out as the only form of success for African-Americans born on the wrong side of Memphis. The white men in the film played with that \"yes, of course, honey\" slack-jawed sitcom Dad cowering perpetuates a burgeoning stereotype of its own. Finally, white woman should be offended that the comely Sandra Bullock won the Academy Award for dressing up and doing something of a southern accent over the less attractive but exceedingly more difficult role of Julia Child that Meryl Streep absolutely nailed in \"Julie & Julia\".

Bullock commands the screen in \"The Blind Side\". She is smart, sassy, and strong\u2014brilliantly deflecting a gentle soul not easily moved. My friend Robert told me, \"Sandra Bullock rocks!\" That says it all. I also think that Bullock gets an Oscar nod for her heart felt and powerful performance. Director and Writer John Lee Hancock's \"The Blind Side\" is based on the book by Michael Lewis which tells the inspiring true story of Michael Oher. Oher was a homeless black kid, taken in by the Tuohy family, who became an All-American Football Player drafted in the first round by the Baltimore Ravens. Oher is now starting left offensive lineman\u2014protecting the quarterback's blind side. \"The Blind Side\" celebrates the decency in all people. I was touched by and enjoyed \"The Blind Side\". And much like the title, one is blind sided by the decency of people. I love this movie.Leigh Anne (Bullock) is married to Taco Bell franchise king Sean Tuohy (solid Tim McGraw). She has two kids, daughter Collins (smart and pretty Lily Collins) and son S.J. (scene stealing Jae Head). Collins is a volleyball star and cheerleader. S.J. is the precocious kid with his finger in everything. Leigh Anne is an interior designer, who often lunches on $18 salads with her lady friends. Her life changes when she chooses to take hulking Big Mike (Aaron) into the family. Director Hancock punctuates family throughout the movie. Early on Big Mike tells Leigh Anne that he doesn't like being called \"Big Mike\". Leigh Anne obliges, \"I'll call you Michael.\" And when they shop for clothes in his old neighborhood, Michael reminds Leigh Anne, \"I got your back.\" This is the amazing and endearing thread of \"The Blind Side\"\u2014it's about protecting your own, protecting family. At the narrative arc Bullock fearlessly stares down a street thug, \"You threaten my son! You threaten me!\" In another great scene, Leigh Anne storms onto the football practice field, and instructs Michael how to play the game. She says, \"This team is your family\u0085 Are you going to protect the family, Michael?\" The soul of \"The Blind Side\" is Bullock and her touching relationship with Michael authentically played by Quinton Aaron. Aaron is deceptively expressive and strong. He movingly narrates his essay that the only thing that matters is honor. At the story arc, Michael tells Leigh Anne, \"Don't you dare lie to me!\" Really this is Bullock's movie. She amazes throughout with her spirit, compassion, and her powerful silence. When Leigh Anne makes up Michael's room, he tells her that he never had a bed before. Bullock walks to her room, and sits on her bed in solace. When Michael's crack addicted Mother tells Leigh Anne that she doesn't want Michael to see her the way she is, Bullock sits next to her and holds her hand in silence. And we are in awe as well.Everyone is amazing in \"The Blind Side\". Lily Collins as Collins ditches her girlfriends to keep company with Michael in the school library. She confides, \"It's like were studying together at home.\" Jae Head S.J. is simply awesome when he asks the recruiting Coaches, \"So what's in it for me?\" Tim McGraw is solidly understated when Leigh Anne asks him, \"Am I a good person?\" Kathy Bates rules as Michael's tutor Miss Sue.The only goofy narrative twist involves NCAA Investigator Granger (in your face Sharon Morris). Granted this seems like a plot device, because we kind of know how this true story goes. This is a minor distraction, because at the core of \"The Blind Side\" is family, honor, and unconditional love. There is such a great moment when Michael tells Leigh Anne, \"You need to give me a proper hug.\" \"The Blind Side\" just touches your soul.",

            "content": "This empathetic 2009 sports-oriented drama is what professional critics would call an uplift film, unabashed in pulling all the necessary emotional cords with an undemanding audience. Screenwriter/director John Lee Hancock is no stranger to the genre since his last two films reflected similar against-all-odds story lines, the Texan band of brothers in \"The Alamo\" and the over-the-hill pitcher in \"The Rookie\". However, there are two key factors that transcend the potentially manipulative structure of Hancock's adaptation of Michael Lewis' intriguing 2006 fact-based book about the evolution of the left tackle in pro football. The first is the irresistible pull of the true-life story of six-foot-six, 345-pound Michael Oher, plucked out of destitution in the Memphis projects by a well-to-do white family to become the starting left tackle at Ole Miss and now with the Baltimore Ravens. The second is Sandra Bullock, bleached blonde, immensely likable, and heavily into no-bull \"Erin Brockovich\" terrain, in a solid performance as Leigh Ann Touhy, the feisty decorator wife and mother who takes Oher into her family home.The film begins when the coach of a private religious school sees the otherwise lumbering Michael display natural athletic ability on the basketball court. The coach sees untapped potential in Michael as a football player because of his huge size, so much so that he gets accepted despite his poor academic record. It also turns out that the taciturn Michael, referred to by everyone as \"Big Mike\", is homeless, sleeping wherever he can since the state took him away as a child from his crack-addicted mother. The upscale Touhys have noticed him before since he goes to school with their children, S.J. and Collins, but it isn't until they see Michael wandering in the freezing cold that Leigh Anne impulsively takes him in. Despite some initial hesitation, he quickly becomes a part of the family, and his performance at school improves enough for him to show what he can do on the football field. Once Leigh Ann crystallizes the team-as-family metaphor for Michael, the 345-pound behemoth starts to realize his talent for smashing the defensive line. College football coaches from throughout the South come to the Touhy home to recruit Michael aggressively to play for them. Ole Miss is the Touhys' alma mater, which leads to an unexpected but inevitable dramatic turn.It's not that Bullock does anything all that new in the movie. Rather, it's that she leverages her winning, every-person screen persona so very well within a character that would seem antithetical to her sensibilities as an actress. While it's true that the story probably puts too much emphasis on her character's role in Michael's ascent, Bullock is one of the few film stars today that can generate such an instant rapport with her audience, and she carries the emotional weight of the story with grit and dexterity. As Michael, Quinton Aaron has to be such an impassive presence at the beginning that when he starts to form into his own person, the actor brings a gentle, palpable force to his character's evolution. It's really the scenes between Bullock and Aaron that tug most at the heartstrings (I welled up at least three times during those shrewdly engineered moments). On the sidelines, country singer Tim McGraw plays supportive husband Sean credibly, and there are scene-stealing turns from towheaded Jae Head as the indefatigable S.J. and Kathy Bates in her usual gutsy-broad form as Michael's tutor, Miss Sue. Broadway actress Adriane Lenox - who originated the role of Mrs. Miller in \"Doubt\" - provides the film's most heartbreaking moments as Michael's haunted mother. This is far less a sports movie and more of a story of individual need and the power of family. The film is powerful in that respect.",

I know, I'm a sucker for an underdog movie, but I think I was welling up because I knew Sandra Bullock was going to kick major ass in this movie and I was right. (Oh, and she looked hot as hell too!) Let's not beat around the bush, I loved this movie. I had no idea that it was based on a true story until the end when I saw footage of the real Michael Oher. I don't really like sports movies and I am not a huge football fan, but that's not what this movie is about. This movie is about doing what is right even if it's the harder thing to do.This is the real-life story of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), her husband Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) and their unlikely new \"son\" Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). Leigh Anne is a wealthy southern spit-fire who speaks her mind and knows what she wants. One night when she spots Michael walking in the cold rain without a coat, that's it, from that moment on, Michael's life would never be the same.Michael's father left when he was just a baby and his mother is a drug addict. Even though he is homeless and wanders from couch to couch, his spirit is never broken. He has the body of a giant and the heart of a lamb. He just needs a chance and thanks to Leigh Anne, he gets it.The love that Leigh Anne and her family show Michael is honest and real. I especially found the relationship of the children and Michael to be unique. I kept waiting for the clich\u00e9 scene where the \"legitimate\" children are jealous of Michael and all of the attention that he's getting. Thankfully, that never happened. I think that speaks volumes to what great parents Leigh Anne and Sean were. Their children learned by their example and did not pass judgment on Michael just because he was poor and from the projects.For me, the major theme in this movie was: What does being a Christian mean? How many good Southern Christians passed by Michael that night when he was walking in the cold? How many people go to church every week and give to the local food banks but would never pull the car over and invite a huge African-American boy into their car and, eventually, into their life? Leigh Anne Tuohy didn't even stop to think that she might be making a mistake until long after she took the young man into her home and tucked him into bed. That's a Christian who talks the talk and walks the walk.Oh, and who knew the movie would be so funny?! Tim McGraw (who was so believable as the husband that I didn't even recognize him) has some of the funniest lines in the movie. His performance is rock solid and he holds his own next to Bullock's fast and feisty Leigh Anne. Jae Head, who plays the Tuohy's son, steals scenes with his quick wit and enthusiasm. He's a perfect match to Michael's quiet, Ferdinand The Bull energy.So, could this finally be Sandra's ticket to the Oscars? I can't be sure of that. But I can be sure that this movie was pretty great, even without Bill Murray in it. (Who knew that was possible).",

Micheal Oher is able to block three hundred mile an hour airbags, beat up \"hood rats\" and win our hearts, all under the supervision of his very rich white family which has no ulterior motives than making him play football.

The rest of the characters, including Tim McGraw's, are decent additions to the story.Overall, \"The Blind Side\" seemed like a mass produced, over hyped, rags-to-riches story in a genre that has been overdone (especially recently). If you're looking for a good movie to pass the time on a bored Saturday night, I suggest you pick up the film. But if you're looking for a stellar story with plenty to love, don't even bother.",

            "content": "I'm no sports fan, so I suppose \"The Blind Side\" was already fighting an uphill battle for my praise. I dislike the film, but not because the characters are interested in things like high school football, college football, and video game football, but because they exist in a world without lasting consequence. That John Lee Hancock, the writer and director, wants to deliver an upbeat, entertaining film proves his Achilles' heel; he omits clear dramatic potential in favor of sitcomy euphemism.His breezy plot, based on the true story of a Baltimore Ravens defensive lineman, whisks conflict aside for \"Big Mike\" Oher (Quentin Aaron), who lumbers his way from kindly mentor to kindly mentor, without any indication or expression of the hard life he's led. The film unfolds almost serendipitously for the teen, who is enrolled in private schooling, gets taken in by a wealthy southern family, gradually wins over his teachers, receives a brand new truck as a birthday gift, and is on the fast track to play football for \"Ole Miss\" University. In short, it's hard to feel bad for a guy that has so much going for him.I don't mean to undermine the personal tragedies that the real life Michael Oher endured, but we really never get a visceral sense of that reality in the film. We meet Big Mike well after the majority of his neglect and trauma has occurred, and he really hits a terrific string of luck. He isn't the victim of any direct prejudice in his seemingly all-white southern suburb, and the kindly family that takes him in, led by headstrong matriarch Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), seems to adapt to his disruption of their family dynamic instantaneously. The tiresome thesis of the film is that the Tuohys are just really great people.This makes for a surface-level heartwarmer, and I suppose audiences shouldn't be ridiculed for appreciating the film on that criteria, but to me, what's missing underneath is all the more apparent for it. Hancock would have done well to introduce us to Big Mike at the gritty bottom: one of twelve children of a crack-addicted mother, in turns homeless, under foster care, and a struggling student in a revolving door of unsupportive schools. Being taken in by the Tuohys would make a better midpoint for Michael's story, and provide a better sense of the dichotomy of his two lives.If only by narrative necessity, Hancock eventually throws in isolated sequences of hard drama, but which have almost uniformly negligible impact on the story. For example, Big Mike totals his new truck with Leigh Anne's son in the passenger seat--the paramedics show up, they wheel out the stretcher, and it turns out everybody's fine. The following scene plays out as though the crash didn't even happen. Or later on, the NCAA suspects the Tuohys of forcing Ole Miss on Mike after a heated vetting, which leads him to a brief identity crisis (even though he's always been fiercely loyal to his foster parents)--after which he decides he wanted to play there all along.These internally-resolved conflict blips are so lonely in the cheerful world of the film that they draw attention to themselves by sheer contrast. Admittedly, I prefer Hancock's optimistic storytelling to an excess in melodrama, but it leaves \"The Blind Side\" starkly overlong and unsatisfying. The film depicts the great things that happen to Michael Oher without providing the context that makes them meaningful. Hancock is under the bizarre assumption that Leigh Anne Tuohy is his protagonist, and the film is more a tribute to the family that hosted Big Mike than the man himself.I'm no sports fan, but you don't need to be one to call Hancock out. \"The Blind Side\" is a bust.",

            "content": "Whenever my movie theatre working friend sees a trailer of an upcoming film and likes what he sees, he always says, \"That's going to be good.\" He said that when we watched the preview ad for this one and when he does that, I sometimes have a skeptical mind about it since I don't always share his tastes in entertainment (his favorite form of such is pro wrestling of which I can do without). Such it was for this movie especially when the new critics of \"At the Movies\", Michael Phillips and A. O. Scott, both gave good reasons for saying, \"Skip it.\" But while it seemed to be more about Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her family than it seemed to be about Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) and his background, that's only because we don't find out about his past until later on. And I did disagree a bit with Phillips and Scott about not seeing Ms. Tuohy actually mean it when she says to her lady friends, \"I'm learning from him.\" She seems to be the smartest one in the whole picture with the way she convinces nearly everyone to her point of view. Oh, and as an Independent, I can appreciate the different ways a conservative, religious, and wealthy family can seem so compassionate toward both a poor, seemingly mentally slow, African-American teenager and a Democratic, possibly liberal, tutor (Kathy Bates). In fact, there was quite a funny line about that and one toward former president George W. Bush at a motor vehicle place where Michael was trying to get a driver's license. It wasn't a nasty one though, so I don't think anyone should be offended. What really impressed me, however, was Michael's turning point after having doubts about his choice of college seemingly based on his adopted family's history there-not to mention his trip back to his former neighborhood in which he sees how wasted his former \"friends\" truly are-and really sticking up for himself about why he made that choice. So, fine performances on both Ms. Bullock and Mr. Aaron's behalf, and good ones on the rest of the cast's especially that of Ms. Bates. Okay, maybe not so much on the actual university coaches' scenes especially that of former LSU coach Nick Saban who's on the longest (though if he was still with the Tigers and not at rival Alabama, I might be a little more lenient, LOL). But with all that I've said, I highly recommend The Blind Side.",

Unfortunately, The Blind Side fails to compete with any of these films, despite being based on true events and receiving two (undeserved) Oscar nominations. Following the journey of a neglected teenager who learns the true values of friendship and family, whilst playing some American Football on the way, this is a film riddled with clich\u00e9s and fairly average performances - I cannot comprehend how Sandra Bullock won the Best Actress nomination - that somehow manages to entertain despite these problems.We have all seen film like these before, and The Blind Side brings nothing new to the table. Michael Oher, the young boy in question, is a homeless teenager with a troubled past who is kindly taken in by the Touhy family, where he soon becomes one of the family. Although he shows no talent for football, his size means that Michael is soon singled out to be the team's blocker, and eventually learns that his team are his family and he must care for them just like he cares for the Touhy family.I can see many people enjoying this film; it's an easy watch, suitable for all ages and delivers a message, but to me, this is its downfall. My favourite movies tend to be edgy, controversial films that offer something original whereas the only positive way I can describe The Blind Side is to say that it was pleasant.I wasn't bored, but I certainly wasn't entertained either. No doubt the huge publicity surrounding the film since the Oscar winners were announced will guarantee its success but I still can't imagine that it will inspire British children to grab an American football and hit the fields when its released on March 26th.6/10If you liked this film you will also enjoy these:Invictus, Dead Poet's Society, The Pursuit Of Happiness, Stand And Deliver",

Or did they pretty much accept the fact that football requires them to put up or shut up. It's still a great story, as is this one. The real story is the fact that a wealthy white woman who actually exists brought Michael Oher into her home. All the details surrounding this may have been brushed over a bit.

It just happens to be based on a book by Michael Lewis who in turn based his writing on a true story 'the story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy ho became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family.' John Lee Hancock adapted the novel for the screen and directed it. He scored a hit when he decided to cast Sandra Bullock as the brave society no nonsense mother Leigh Anne Tuohy, giving Bullock the opportunity to polish her acting chops to a fare-thee-well. Tim McGraw is very strong as the husband/father Sean Tuohy and the two young actors who play the biological Tuohy children - Jae Head and Lily Collins - are equal to their 'parents' performances. Quinton Aaron is the quiet pacifist Michael Oher who is taken into the household of a Southern family as an equal in Memphis Tennessee where racial bias still exists. It is the transformation of Michael as well as the florid transformation of the Tuohy family (especially the brilliantly realized Leigh Anne) that makes this little film glow. Kathy Bates makes a brief cameo as a tutor for Michael and Ray McKinnon makes his role as the coach credible. And the rest of the cast offer of a very high quality of support. BLIND SIDE is not a great movie, just as 'PRECIOUS etc etc etc' is not a great movie: at the core of both of these films are the moments of light that enter the lives a unfortunate youngsters who then radiate the lives of those who have the courage to believe in the equality of mankind.

Yes, it would be easy to do that, but the fact that it is based on a true story - that of Michael Oher who went on to play in the NFL - goes a long way towards nipping at least some of that cynicism in the bud.Based on the book \"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game\" by Michael Lewis, \"The Blind Side\" is what \"Precious\" might have been had it been designed with a mass-audience in mind - a lump-in-the-throat, feel-good crowd-pleaser about a generally inarticulate, plus-size black youngster who's falling through the cracks big time due to poverty and wretched parenting. Only, in Michael's case, he's \"rescued\" by the Tuohy family - primarily the feisty, socialite mom, Leigh Anne - who not only provides him with a beautiful home and a loving environment but lessons on how to be a world-class football player as well. A behemoth of a kid who's as shy and reticent off the field as he is aggressive and domineering on - at least once Leigh Anne has given him a good talking to - Michael doesn't seem nearly as scarred by his upbringing or as embittered towards humanity as one might expect given all he's been through as a child (he's certainly miles ahead of Precious in the coping department).True story or not, none of this comes across as all that convincing, and there are times when \"The Blind Side\" threatens to drown itself and us in a sea of sanctimony and almost constant sentimental uplift. But it also manages to pull itself back from the precipice, at least periodically, thanks to the performances by Sandra Bullock - pushy and aggressive without being off-putting - and Quinton Aaron, who turns Michael into a sweet, likable kid. And little Jae Head (\"Hancock\") steals every scene he's in as Michael's wise-beyond-his-years little \"brother,\" S.J. Writer/director John Lee Hancock doesn't bring a whole lot of ingenuity to the plotting or depth to the characters, but he gets the job done, which, I suppose, is all one can really ask for from a film in this genre.As a drama centered around high school football in the South (in this case, Memphis), \"The Blind Side\" can't hold a candle to the magnificent TV version of \"Friday Night Lights,\" but its inspirational story may get to you anyway - whether you choose to give yourself over to it or not.",

He has been in and out of foster homes for years, after the authorities discovered his mother's drug habit and his father's absence. At the present, he is living at the all-night laundromat, where each night he washes out his two shirts. The teachers at the school learn Michael is bright but can not read or write well. Alas, too, the other pupils don't extend the hand of friendship. One day, however, an elementary student named SJ strikes up a conversation with Michael that makes the big guy smile. Later that night, SJ and his parents, Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) are driving home from a school event when they spy Mike, coat-less, walking out in the cold. When Leigh Anne learns SJ knows the teen, she insists on asking Michael to come home with them for the night. Learning a few necessary facts, Leigh Anne and Sean soon invite Michael to stay with them as long as he wants. Before many weeks have passed, Michael is a part of the family and has his own room and some new clothes. The Tuohys also help Michael with his school work so that he will be able to make the football team. But, will Michael's past come back to haunt his relationship with his new, loving family?

Yes, this rich Memphis couple deserve much praise, also, for their efforts to turn Michael's existence in a new direction. But, only Michael could have made the extreme changes and dedication that allowed him to flourish, on the football field and in school. Bravo, Michael, bravo and more. As the principal characters, Bullock, McGraw, Kathy Bates and especially Aaron are most wonderful. All of the lesser actors are very fine, too. The setting in Memphis is authentic, from the worst side of town, where Michael was born, to the best, where the Tuohys reside.

Quinton Aaron's portrayal of Michael Oher is absolutely terrific. You are able to feel the pain with him, because he does not know how to learn properly and the more harder he works at it, the more you root for him. I think the most amazing aspect about this movie is the fact that a rich Southern Family like the Tuohy's let in a poor Black man into there lives, let alone parent him it was really quite amazing and humbling to watch. One of the scenes that truly hit me the most had to be when Leigh Anne|Bullock| goes and visit's Michael's mom|Aaron| at her place, even though she's as high as a kite, it was emotional and well done. The Blind Side isn't an overly complicated movie, in fact it's rather simple, but in the end it's a touching film that is mostly worthy of all the acclaim it's received.Performances. Sandra Bullock gives a career defining performance here, and believe me it is worth the hype. I've always adored Sandra Bullock but here she takes her game to the next level. She deserved her Oscar completely, because she put her all into the role, and she completely resembled the real Leigh Anne, it was quite remarkable. Quinton Aaron is brilliant as Michael. His facial expressions told all a lot of the times, and in the end I loved his performance. Tim McGraw surprised me with his excellent performance here, and his chemistry with Sandra was fantastic. Jae Head gives a sly and wonderful performance as the kid S.J. I don't like kid actors, but he was terrific, I especially loved his scenes with Quntion Aaron. Kathy Bates has a small but very important role in the movie, and once again brought some class.Bottom line. The Blind Side is one Of the best movies 0f 2009 by far, and thankfully lives up to the hype for the most part. It's just a movie that truly warms your heart in every way, and I'm thankful I viewed it. An absolute must see.9/10",

            "content": "OKAY, WE HEAR you! ROCKY was a fictional character in a make believe story about imaginary events, bouts and Boxers. In this we heartily concur; but with this one caveat. While ROCKY Star Sly Stallone's screen play is a work conjured up the characters and events from an obviously deep and fertile imagination. The work reflected a keen intellect; far from being that of a real life Rocky Balboa.IN SHORT, we hold that there is real life inspiration here; that being to a 1975 Heavyweight Bout between Champ Mohamed Ali with an unranked and lesser-known non-contender in Chuck Wepner. There were many elements in the real life fight that were replicated in the ROCKY storyline; including the Challanger knocking the Champ off his feet, the fight's going the full distance of 15 Rounds, the Bigger Than Life Personality of both Ali and 'Appollo Creed', etc.AS FOR OUR second compare-a-movie subject, we all know that RUDY is based on the real life story of one Andrew 'Rudy' Ruettiger, the kid who wanted more than anything to grow up and to play Football for the University of Notre Dame; eventually doing that thing in spite of being \"5 feet nothing', 100 nothing' pounds\", etc.ALTHOUGH THE TWO films both involve the stories of young boys growing up to be apart of Major College Football programs, that's where the similarities between RUDY and today's sacrificial offering,THE BLIND SIDE, end.WE MUST CONFESS to having a large dose of ignorance operating in our household; being at least in the knowledge of the 'Man of the House'(Me!). The 'Little Woman' (my long-suffering Wife, Deanna) suggested that the two of us sneak off early last Saturday for a 'Matinee'. (Now Schultz, we mean at the nearby Quarry 14 Multiplex in Hodgkins, not any sort of 'Romantic' getaway!) VERY MUCH TO my surprise, the film was very, very good-on all fronts. It has a great and true story, told in a most enjoyable manner. The casting was excellent with young Quinton Aaron turning in a masterful performance as the abused and neglected young Michael Oher. He at once gave us a main character who was intelligent & deep, yet isolated, under taught, emotionally scarred, lonely and affection starved. He also is discovered to have a great deal of untapped potential in scholastics as well as some obvious potential in athletics. (Can you say Football & Basketball? Can you, Schultz?) AS HIS ADOPTED family, Tim McGraw does an excellent job of the bread winner (Sean Tuohy) who has the means to financially take on the responsibility of another 'family' member, without there being an immediate strain on the old budget. Mr. Tuohy, you see, owns a string of drive-in fast food restaurants; as it is explained in the movie.AS FOR THE performance of Miss Sandra Bullock as the Mrs., Leigh Anne Tuohy, we believe that she brought a lot of depth and understanding to the role; being a part that really gave her a chance to show off some very skilled Thespian-type skills! So much of the story turns on the realizations and subsequent actions taken by the one in the role of Mother. The scene where the Tuohy Family encounters 'Big Mike' alone, cold and hungry on a rainy evening in Autumn, is powerfully and realistically rendered. It was truly pivotal to the story. It is at this point where they ponder if their adhering to a Christian way of life was just a matter of words or would they take a real life stance and make their actions speak for them.ALTHOUGH WHAT WE see is a movie, the story that unfolded to us should make us aware that we all can do even a small act of Chrustian love and kindness toward those in need; not necessarily as great and complex an effort as did the Tuohy Family. Who knows how much human talent and abilities are wasting right now. That's ability and talent that would make the world just a little better place.AND IN CLOSING, let us try to remember a quote from the Good Book, that goes something like:\"What so ever you do for the Least of My Brethern, you do for me!\"WHAT'S OUR RECOMMENDATION? Well, see it and buy the DVD when it comes out! It's bound to be an Oscar Nominee, at least!",

            "review_title": "Top-notch melodrama-rendering of a true story of inspiration",
            "content": "When people say \"real life is stranger than fiction\" they can't be talking about making a motion picture from a true story. What usually happens there is that \"artistic touches\" have to be applied to give the audience what they usually expect from a movie \u2013 suspense, explosive conflicts, convoluted plot twists, tragic turn of events and such (within limits, not over-fictionalizing). In short, people want melodrama. Some movies overdo it. \"The blind side\" has just the right, sensible touch.The same thing can be said from the angle of a football (this is not soccer, sorry) fan. The exciting positions in an offensive team are the quarterback (leadership, impeccable combination of intelligence and skill), running backs (bread-and-butter action), wide receivers (spectacular feat and punishing price to be paid \u2013 a rock-hard helmet ramming at the unprotected ribs) and tight-end (versatility). Less exciting are the five guys at the line of scrimmage \u2013 centre, guards and offensive tackles (Michael Oher, our protagonist, is one). Throwing a block can be exciting to watch, but not quite as much as what these other guys do. Again, \"The blind side\" has the right touch in extracting the excitement out of this aspect of the game without overdoing it.As mentioned above, this is a true story, quite a simple one: an upper-middle class Republican family bringing a depraved and deprived black kid into their home, first out of charity, then eventually making him truly a part of the family. This is a feel-good, heart-warming story but being a true story, limits the cinematic elements mentioned above. What makes it work is a good, solid, unpretentious script that moves the story along with good humour and not overwrought sentimentality. Almost overused is the technique of \"echoing\" a line spoken earlier in the movie, for comic or poignant effect. It works every time. Doubtlessly, some would allude to such things as manipulation of the audience's emotion. If you think about it, this is like going to a health spa and then criticising the masseur for manipulating your muscle! The audience do go into the cinema to have their emotions manipulated. The point is how it is done \u2013 tastefully or clumsily. With \"The blind line\" it's obviously the former.But most importantly, it's the two protagonists, played admirably by Quinton Aaron and Sandra Bullock.The key to the character of all star defence tackle Michael Oher, as portrayed in this movie anyway, is one particular aspect of his psychological profile \u2013 the near perfect (98%) score in protective instincts. This has double meanings, as the movie sensibly makes no mystery about. The first is self-preservation. Childhood trauma taught Michael to hide in a shell and reveal as little as possible about himself. The other is the more literal, application \u2013 the essence of the job of an offensive tackle. Aaron plays his role well, taciturn (but not sullen, as there is always a barely discernible suppressed smile when something good happens) at first, then gradually opening up and all the time portraying also the impeccable decency of his character.This movie, however, is Sandra Bullock's show. Leigh Anne Tuohy should be pleased of Bullock's portrayal of her, Memphis southern accent and all. Happy also are Bullock's fans, for her first major award, the Golden Globe. Her achievement in this film has also been recognized by her peers, in the Screen Actors' Guild award. It's most interesting to compare the two top rom-com stars in the last two decades \u2013 Bullock and Meg Ryan \u2013 their transition to a more \"mature\" phase of their screen persona. At one point, it seems that neither is getting anywhere, especially Ryan, with the failed attempt in \"In the cut\" (2003). Bullock tried with \"Murder by number\" (2002) without much success. Now, with \"The blind side\", she has served notice, loud and clear, that she has landed. The reason seems clear. Ryan's sweetness cannot be carried over to the next phase of her cinematic progression while Bullock's rough edge becomes her as a mother with a teenage kid. As a woman who knows exactly what she wants and dares to stare down any adversary, trash-mouth red neck white coach and threatening-talking black drug dealer alike, Bullock shines, helped also by her cryptic, punchy lines in the script. The additional edge that wins her Golden Globe is her ability to add a touch of the tenderness in her heart \"underneath the layers of onion\".The rest of the cast radiates warm alike: Tim MaGraw as the perfect husband, Lily Collins as the sweetness personified teenage daughter and, best of all, Jae Head as the know-it-all little brother with one tenth of Michael's size and a larger-than-life screen presence. Deservedly, he won a couple of \"young actor\" awards. Finally, in a small role as Miss Sue, Michael's private tutor (and heavens forbid, a Democrat), Kathy Bates is simply wonderful, as always.",

            "review_title": "Average Hollywood treatment of true life tale of Christian charity",
            "content": "The Blind Side is one of those movies that manages to evoke a huge difference in opinion as to whether the film works or not. I'm somewhere in the middle. Certainly the saga of the White Republican Tuohy family who takes in Michael Oher, a black kid from the 'other side of the tracks' and then helps him to become what he has become today, a very successful NFL star football player, is an inspirational tale of true Christian charity. On the other hand, the story is riddled with so many clich\u00e9s that ultimately the film devolves into a predictable Hollywood tale of an underprivileged youth making it in the sports world.Some posters argue that the white characters in the film, particularly the Tuohy family themselves, come off as saintly and the black characters are all presented as negative stereotypes. I don't see that at all. For starters, the first black character we meet, 'Big Tony' Hamilton, is a self-sufficient and kindly man who ends up being responsible for getting Big Mike into the Wingate Christian school where he eventually thrives. Leigh Anne Tuohy is hardly a saint as she is depicted as sensitive but also a thoroughly pushy and sometimes obnoxious woman who is capable at times, of putting her foot in her mouth. While Michael Oher is a slow learner, the film makes it quite clear that he has street smarts and inherently is a lot smarter than what the teachers at the Wingate school pegged him to be. Unfortunately, the film's scenarists know a lot more about Leigh Anne Tuohy's personality than Michael Oher's. This is perhaps the major shortcoming of the film as the warm, winning ways of Oher are not shown here; rather, he's depicted as thoroughly introverted and socially inept and rookie actor Quinton Aaron is unable to make much of a part that is quite thin to begin with.The first third of the movie is perhaps the most moving as it shows Leigh Anne's Tuohy's growing realization that she has led an isolated life. In a most poignant scene, Tuohy is startled when Michael reveals that he's never slept in a bed before. Leigh Anne's willingness to take Michael in is tested in the scene involving the car accident. After Sean Tuohy Sr. buys Michael a new car, he gets into a car accident while the the young SJ is in the passenger seat. Somehow all is forgiven when it's revealed that Michael prevents the full force of the air bag from hitting SJ. Never discussed are the events preceding the crash\u2014Michael and SJ are engaged in singing a rap song without Michael paying attention to the traffic ahead of them. I also wondered if Leigh Anne would have forgiven Michael so easily had SJ actually been seriously injured in the accident or even killed. Christian charity I suppose has its limits! Once Oher is acclimated to his new family, 'The Blind Side' picks up the Hollywood mantle and offers up another tired and long-winded high school football scene, replete with the young SJ obnoxiously 'coaching' Oher before the big game along with Leigh Anne later fending off the token white racist in the stands. Oher not only gains confidence as a defensive tackle but the big teddy bear flips an opposing player over a fence after the bully has been mocking him before every play (how cute!).Again, the second half of 'The Bind Side' ends up with mixed results. There's more 'cute' stuff when Leigh Anne hires a tutor (Kathy Bates) who tutors Michael to get his grade point average high enough to qualify for college. Liberal Hollywood needs to let us know that the tutor is a Democrat so that both conservative Republicans (the Tuohy family) and a Democrat both have a hand in helping Michael reach his goal. There's a stab at comedy when all the college recruiters start courting Michael and again the obnoxious child actor who plays SJ attempts to get the 'best deal' for himself in the event that Michael is recruited (stuff like walking out on the field at the beginning of the college football season).When an NCAA Investigator questions the Tuohy family's motives in 'adopting' Michael after he accepts an invitation to attend Ole Miss, Michael impulsively returns to his old ghetto haunts. There he's taunted by Alton, the head gang member, brilliantly played by IronE Singleton (this actor has the potential to be a major star!) Michael gets into a fight with Alton and gets the better of him and then disappears. Leigh Anne looks high and low for Michael and confronts Alton. Some posters say the scene is implausible since the gang member would have retaliated when Leigh Anne challenged him. I'm not so sure\u2014when she claims that she's friends with the DA, that in itself might have given Alton pause to take revenge. After all, he's a drug dealer who doesn't want any outsiders calling attention to his business. Finally Leigh Anne finds Michael after he calls her. There's a reconciliation and Michael of course goes on to graduate from high school and is drafted by the NFL.Sandra Bullock does an excellent job of conveying the brash personality of Leigh Anne Tuohy. Tim McGraw as Sean Sr. and Lily Collins as Collins Tuohy have little to do during the film. As previously mentioned, the youngster SJ (played by Jae Head) is simply obnoxious and Quinton Aaron does not know how to make Michael Oher into an engaging character. As 'The Blind Side' is based on a true story, it certainly is worth watching. Just don't expect much complexity when it comes to the majority of its characters.",

            "content": "Sometimes all it takes to make a movie is a good story with a director and a cast capable of seeing it for what it is. \"The Blind Side\" is an excellent example of why our interest continues to peak at the tagline \"based on a true story\" in movie trailers. You get the sense that Warner Bros, John Lee Hancock and star Sandra Bullock understand that the story they're telling is real, it's positive and it's heart-warming.\"The Blind Side\" is the story of real-life football player Michael Oher, currently a left guard with the Baltimore Ravens who went from homeless to a first-round NFL pick with them help of the Tuohy family, who took him in and gave him the confidence to succeed at football and life. Although the details of the story have been stretched to make the film more dramatic, the essence of the story and the values it preaches are the same and they're what count most.Hancock has taken necessary liberties with the story. To be truthful, there's not a lot of bad or a lot of conflict and the film might have been too fluffy without exaggerations. The Tuohy's took Michael, a boy from a bad neighborhood who was enrolled in their school with some convincing from the football coach, and they helped him attain the grades to not only stay eligible in high school but also earn a scholarship to play football in college. Hancock resorts to a lot of dramatic conventions to keep the story engaging and the audience feeling sympathy for Michael but also excited to see him succeed. They all work, even if they're a bit cheap at times.The cast, however, really brings it all together. Everyone in this film natural and relatable. No one is written as or behaves like a stereotype or fit a specific mold -- at least none of the main characters. They realize they're playing real people leading normal lives. Only Jae Head as the little brother, S.J., tries hard to create humor where it doesn't come naturally but he gets away with being cute. The standout example of this is the hiring of all the real-life coaches to act as if they were in their former jobs and recruiting Michael. It seems gimmicky, but it's fun and it shows the effort to honor the truth of the story.As for Bullock, I've finally seen a film where she has really impressed me. I'm not sure about the Oscar talk, but I can't say a bad thing about her portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy. She creates such definitive portrait of Leigh Anne as tough, loving, selfless and even a bit abrasive. She plays her as sensitive and well-meaning where she could have just gone overboard with southern bell housewife stereotypes (considering we all know she's done plenty of over-the-top characters), but she realizes this is a real woman she's playing and gives Leigh Anne the dimension she deserves. Most importantly, she is naturally funny and doesn't shove humor down our throats like in her ditzy romantic comedy roles.\"The Blind Side\" is a likable film, one way more about family and achieving ones goals than it is about football. This is not a cheesy, football-focused sports drama with typical sports themes and dramatizations of football games. Hancock understands the importance here is not football. This does make Bullock's bookend narration about how former football pro Lawrence Taylor changed the game of football for left tackles a bit irrelevant, but it serves as another reminder of how Michael Oher's story is real and it's an interesting and important one.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",

            "content": "\"The Blind Side\" is a typical \"feel good\" movie with moderately strong religious overtones and very little conflict. There is so little conflict, in fact, that it's hard for the abundance of warm, happy moments to have very much effect. In short, the movie to come off as cheesy and insignificant.\"The Blind Side\" opens with the climax of the movie, which is probably the moment with the most conflict; the only one to piqu\u00e9 my interest to any degree. The opening is vague and makes things seem much more serious than they really are. Then the movie flashes back to the beginning of the story it has to tell.Michael Oher is a bastard son, born to a crack-addicted mother, living with the father of his friend. He sleeps on the couch and has never had a bed to himself. Sounds tragic, but don't expect the filmmakers to really show you this. Michael's caretaker is a mechanic and convinces a Christian private school to accept Michael and his son into the school. He talks to the coach and convinces him to push for Michael's acceptance based on a one on one game of basketball that he was playing with the mechanic's son. And for some reason this game convinced the coach that Michael would be good for the football team. I never got that.After this no more is really heard of the mechanic or his son. The son gets accepted but not even Michael is seen socializing with him. They both just disappear. This is so that Michael Oher seems to be the only black student at the school, but it left me with a lot of questions. Michael's crack-head mother lives in a ghetto run by gangs in middle Tennessee. Very little is shown of this ghetto and the gang and of Michael's mother. These were some of the moments where there was a lot of potential for strong and meaningful content but everything was glossed over. There could not have been four or five scenes in the ghetto and all of them were less than 5 minutes in length. The focus if the entire movie was the warm happy-go-lucky family moments where the good-Christian white family accepts a poor, uneducated black kid into their home and as a member of the family. Why should I care about this un-dynamic and trite situation. Even if it is based on a true story, it's all been seen before.The acting ranged from terrible to mediocre to decent. The worst was Sandra Bullock's son and the best was her husband (sorry I'm terrible with names) who felt the most natural. The film focused on Sandra Bullock, but I wasn't convinced by her character as a southern, high-energy republican. The actor who played Michael Oher was flat, but at least it was hard to tell because he had very few lines.The Christian over-tones at the start of the film urged the most resistance from me, but I realized that just because I'm atheist, does not mean the director and writers are too and eventually grew used to it, even though I'll still always find it cheesy. I could have liked this movie, if it was more dynamic, but this lacking element caused the story telling to be weak and left little room for any of the actors to shine. It was \"meh\".",

His poor background makes for his less than average grades in the classroom and the family also get him a tutor and help him with that as well.

I kept hearing about this movie and just had to see it. It wasn't perfect but it was a nice moving story that showed the innocence of a young man and how he had been neglected and had a troubled youth, yet he didn't have any hate or animosity in his body. He was one to protect and although quite and reserved he was very full of love.My problems with this movie was race. I understand they had to show the ghetto and lay it on thick as to how his bad upbringing made him this way, but there should have been balance. His black neighborhood was filled with crack-heads and gangsters, but thats the only Africa Americans shown in this film. It was really sad that they shined such a negative shadow over the black community and made the white people out to be saints for saving this kid...I just would have loved some balance, even in the ghetto not all blacks are trash, so don't show it one sided.I don't like movies that have anything to do with sports either and this movie was football, football, football... I know it had to be, but I am only saying, it's one reason I can't love this film.The direction was okay but nothing too great, its funny this guy directed other sports film but I found his sports action scenes to be the worst direction of the film.

However, from time to time, I watch some sports movies, usually if the persons I admire are involved.As for The Blind Side, the plot based on real persons and events provides a strong additional value, otherwise it could have become a moralizing story about racial tensions, wealth vs. poverty, naive attitudes on helping and alike, quite often present in Western movies aimed at as wide audience as possible. Here, it all makes sense, and we can follow a story of a young Afro-American lad from his scanty upbringing, through his years at Christian school and his adoption, to his position as one of the most appreciated prospects in college football, then finally becoming a first-round pick in the NFL. All the performances are at least good, but my favorites are Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy and Jae Head as Sean \"SJ\" Tuohy, Jr., whose roles distinguish from all the others, including Quinton Aaron as Michael \"Big Mike\" Oher who apparently was rather dull in real life. In addition, it was pleasant to notice \"Cinematography by Alar Kivilo\", probably the most known Estonian in Hollywood.All in all, a good movie, although the start was protracted (plus without Bullock), and sports scenes covered quite a big share of the total length.

Of course a few Erin Brocken. strategic moves succeed with flying colors. \"If you want to make fun of me, I can buy an overpriced lunch salad much closer to home\" she tells her weekly bridge group at lunch. Why would anyone want to be friends with this self righteous woman? And she brings an over-sized street kid into her home on a whim not knowing if he is a gang banger, perhaps a threat to her cheerleader daughter or perhaps endangering herself, her meek hub and her dwarf son. Van Jones would be proud of this, even if this wasn't an interracial story. Of course the obstacles are few and good in this movie triumphs over the \"It's a small world after all\" good in this film. She lives in a mansion, never seems to have a job except for being Mr. Blind Side's personal assistant and everybody loves her. She's like \"The New Kid In Town\" of Don Henley fame. Ladeda, Obla De Obla Da life goes on Blah, life is a \"bed of roses\". Success without hard work just find some rich lady who is bored and you won't even need Simon Cowell. Parents please tell your kids this movie is all a Hollywood Fantasy, and read with them for the 2 hours and 8 minutes you will waste on this bad use of silver oxide! Save your money, you will need it to pay for Obamacare or your next hybrid \"green\" vehicle. Don't support nonsense preachy garbage like this. Sandra Bullock get a new Agent!",

            "content": "Actress Sandra Bullock is on the top of her game in the sports drama \"The Blind Side\". The movie is based on the real life story of a wealthy southern socialite's caretaking of an underprivileged inner city teen who turned out to be NFL Rookie Left Tackle Michael Oher. His childhood was not too different than other young black boys living in the inner city. His father had mental issues, and his mother was a crack addict trying to raise a handful of children. Young Oher traveled from foster home to foster home during this time. As a teen, Oher was reserved, isolated, and near mute. But one could not be blinded to his enormous body frame and athletic talent. A catholic high school coach gets introduced to Oher and convinces school administration to bring that Oher on board even though he does not have the academic aptitude required in such a school. But here enters Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wealthy wife of a restaurant franchise owner, who takes in the solitaire teen Oher into their home. Leigh Anne has two kids of her own in the sweet teenage girl Collins and the charismatic young boy S.J.; Collins is a bit more reserved at first in welcoming Michael while S.J. adores him from the start. Like S.J., Leigh Anne's husband Sean (played by Tim McGraw, yes that one country boys & girls) is also very supportive of Michael from its huddling beginning. Eventually, the Tuohys become the left and right guards of Michael by becoming his legal guardians. Writer-Director John Lee Hancock does not block the formulaic inspirational & sentimentality themes of most sports films but in \"The Blind Side\" but he presents it with goodwill tones instead of salvation armies rah-rah's as most other sports narratives; so kudos to Hancock for his superpower donations in quarterbacking \"The Blind Side\". Hancock's screenplay is a bit clich\u00e9 filled but he did open up the lines for some touching messages on caring for others. But what will sweep you away the most of \"The Blind Side\" is the commanding performance of Sandra Bullock as the vigorous but yet endearing Leigh Anne Tuohy. All the supporting acting performances follow her lead; but not even in the same \"pro acting bowl\" category as hers. Even the great master Bates, (Kathy that is) playing Michaels's tutor could not compare to Bullock's tour-de-force work. It would be complete bullocks if Sandra is not handed off a Best Actress Academy Award. I think I have tackled my viewpoints on \"The Blind Side\" so now it is your turn to call your plays on this non-offensive movie which I am sure will open your hearts. ***** Excellent",

            "content": "I have enjoyed Bullock's work for the last two decades, even since her fresh face showed up in \"Speed\". She was the perfect damsel in distress in \"The Net\", and she has shown a comedic side more than once, most recently with good results in \"The Proposal\". Her latest entry is mind blowing, as she takes on a real life inspirational icon and walks away a winner.What this film gives is more than an inspirational tale and a positive message, one that one rarely hears in a crowd-pleasing movie. It's a proved formula, but one that is botched more often than one would expect. Here we have the underdog and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a story that we know will usually result in a few tears and quite a thrilling conclusion. This time out, the formula veers a bit and it works well, as the focus is not placed on our underdog but on the forces that shape him and help him succeed. There is also plenty of love thrown around, and the most interesting thing is how sincere the whole mix feels.Bullock plays a wealthy southerner who takes it upon herself to rescue a most unlikely prospect; with her tough love and support, he eventually reaches his goal, not without giving us plenty of opportunity to see that her road will be a little bumpy. What is most satisfying about Bullock's performance is how deep and complex her approach is. She conveys several emotions simultaneously as we listen to her deliver lines that are close to a bit overdone, but take on interesting tones with her looks and gestures. In one of my favourite scenes she must face a group of thugs and the steely delivery is as much as crowd pleaser as Dirty Harry's \"Make my day\".There is a lot to like in \"The Blind Side\", with strong support by the secondary characters, and the way the story is kept from becoming over-sentimental. It moves well, and it does give you a refreshing twist on something we have seen before. Here it all depends on how it is executed and much of the strength lies in Bullock's inspiration both on and off the screen.",

            "content": "he Blind Side is the 2009 biographical drama that examines the relationship between a wealthy socialite named Leigh Ann Tuohy and a homeless teenager named Michael Oher, who would eventually go on to a successful career in college football and eventually would be the 2009 round one draft pick by the Baltimore Ravens. The film is supposed to be about the relationship between these two central characters; however, their relationship is not the primary focus of the film, as it should be, which is the main reason the film doesn't really work as it should.Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for Outstanding Lead Actress for her performance as Leigh Ann, a strong-willed matriarch with a heart as big as all outdoors who sees Michael walking on a deserted road in the rain one night and, upon learning he has no place to stay, decides to take him in and it is the slow burn of the relationship between Leigh Ann and Michael that is supposed to be the heart of this story; unfortunately, I found the relationship that develops between Michael and Leigh Ann's son, SJ, a lot more compelling than his relationship with Leigh Ann.I also think the film loses points for trying to encompass a little too much. The film begins to veer off track as we watch Leigh Ann being mocked by her high society girlfriends and watch Michael being tracked down by the NAACP when Leigh Ann's motives for helping Michael come into question. Writer director John Lee Hancock should have kept the focus of his screenplay where it seems to belong...on Leigh Ann's dedication to helping Michael carve out a new life for himself via a career in college football. Despite the fact that the basis of her inspiration for him lies in some kind of test he took where he allegedly made high scores in the category of \"protective instincts.\" I went to high school and college and don't remember ever having taken any kind of test regarding \"protective instincts\", though it does provide the impetus for one of Bullock's best moments in the film, where she interrupts Michael's troublesome football practice by offering familial analogies to help Michael do what he has to do on that field.The fact that this story is based on real people and events also had me questioning certain parts of the story and their credibility, which easily could have been glossed over or altered for the sake of a more entertaining story. I find it a little hard to believe that Leigh Ann's husband and family were so immediately accepting of Leigh Ann's decision to bring this stranger into their home. I also found it troubling that before beginning proceedings to become Michael's legal guardian that Leigh Ann actually went to Michael's crack-addicted mother to let the woman know what her plans were and the fact that Leigh Ann wasn't troubled by the fact that the woman wasn't terribly upset by the news was also troubling.Sandra Bullock gives a solid performance as Leigh Ann and I understand to a point why she won the Oscar...it was her turn I guess, but personally, I think Bullock has done better work. For the record though, I LOVE Bullock as a blonde. Country singer Tim McGraw charms as Leigh Ann's wealthy husband, who just seems to go along with everything Leigh Ann wants a little too easily and I find it hard to believe that the real Sean Tuohy was as easy going about this whole thing as the character in the movie is. Quinton Aaron is refreshingly natural as Michael as is Jae Head as young SJ. Mention should also be made of a very entertaining performance by Ray McKinnon as Michael's high school football coach, who is initially baffled by Michael but loved taking credit for everything he did.John Lee Hancock had a very Oscar-baity story here that he is only partially successful in presenting. Despite problems in story construction and improper focus on character relationships, the film is worth checking out, but it is not everything that it has been made out to be.",

            "content": "One of my favorite actresses finally gets a Golden Globe Best Actress award, and most likely an Oscar nomination will follow, with a role in this movie. So with that incentive, I went and sought out to watch Sandra Bullock in \"The Blind Side.\" This movie is a true story about an abandoned black gentle-giant teenager Michael Oher adopted by a wealthy white Southern family, the Tuohys. It is a story that is pushing the boundaries of racial relations. It is amazing in that this unlikely story actually happened in real life. A fictional story like this could potentially be offensive. However, with genial storytelling and the general good will of the stars, a warm feel-good message is sent across to the audience. I personally felt that this movie is like \"Precious\", in an infinitely more positive and watchable, albeit somewhat sugar-coated, light.Sandra Bullock is very much herself here in the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy. I do not really see anything special that she did to merit awards consideration. She is her reliable good-natured persona that made her star since \"Speed\". But that said, I am glad that she is recognized for her fine work. The other members of the cast were also very good. I did not recognize country star Tim McGraw without his hat, but he held his own against Sandra. The youngest Touhy kid is scene-stealing cute without verging into annoying. The actor who played Michael is well-cast, a charming embodiment of the meek yet tough character.For the general local audience unfamiliar with American football, these scenes may be lost on most of us. They did try to explain in layman's terms what the left offensive tackle (Michael's position on the football team) does. The actual cameo appearances of real American college football coaches will certainly be lost to us as well. However, the very heart and soul message of the movie, that of helping out the less fortunate among us despite social repercussions, will surely reverberate.",

I have to get if off my chest and, maybe, I can push some other latecomer off the tracks and out of the way of this runaway train of a movie (must be my \"protective instincts\" <- in joke for those who've seen the flick). I honestly don't think I've ever been more mystified about why a movie received so much praise; and a 'Best Picture' nomination, to boot! \"Mystified\" isn't even right the word. More like 'astounded', 'flabbergasted', 'dumbfounded', or whatever the right synonym is for the combination of puzzlement and outrage I have after watching it. I mean this movie is BAD! ROTTEN to the core! LOUSY in every way! What absolute and utter dreck! WHO could have possibly thought this travesty of a movie was one of the ten best of the year? Did they think they were nominating for the Razzies?What's that you say? What about Sandra Bullock? Exactly! WHAT about Sandra Bullock!? That she can take on a role requiring the most meagre of ranges and stay with it for two hours of screen time? Heck, if this had been a play and not a movie, then instead of an Oscar she could have gotten a Tony - a one schtick Tony!If Sandra Bullock's performance is the apex of one-dimensional acting (I guess that would give her at least one 'point' in her favor - ha ha!), the script must be the highest (and never before climbed) peak in the range of movies that have used back to back to back and back again clich\u00e9s. As I watched it, I found myself repeatedly saying, \"Oh no, there not going really use that trope, are they?\" But, oh yes, they sure did! And then another. And another . . . Still, I suppose the screenwriters did show some restraint in this respect. I mean they did, after all, manage to resist using the old trick of showing newspaper headlines to announce Michael's initial successes to the audience. Yup, I didn't see one spinning 50-point font headline screaming, \"Big MIke does it again!!\". Not even an \"Oher leads to team to championship!\". But, please note that I said I \"didn't SEE\" anything like that. Full disclosure - it may have happened while I had my eyes closed in an effort to stem another wave of nausea.And don't even let me get me started on its race, prejudice, and sensitivity 'aspects'. Like I said, this is a movie where each scene is a clich\u00e9 about to unfold, dissolving into a clich\u00e9, and fading out to, guess what. Oh yeah.Looking for the bottom line? Okay. Remember Battlefield Earth? (I hope not). Well, Battlefield Earth is to The Blind SIde as Citizen Kane is to Manos: The Hands of Fate (and Torgo was no Orson Welles!)",

            "content": "This might seem to be just a movie that aims to be heart warming and make you feel good about life, but there is achingly more behind the victorious conclusion of this movie and little of it is heart warming. Since the days when men were judged to be good or of little use based on their size, there has been an undercurrent of thinking that sees bigger males as better males, i.e. 5-7 is dumb and 6-5 is smart. It probably comes from when there was little medicine in the past and bigger people were considered better breeding material. If modern Universities promote dumb guys as normal guys when they are really not, we are back in the stone age again. It is already happening, and many Universities are nothing more than conduits for athletes to go pro after graduation and academia counts for little. Some Universities will engage in little smear campaigns against students who are not into things like football and who see through this stuff, down to the hard core it is. Hooray for Sandra Bullock, she has a big heart and no clue about Universities, in that are often very bad paces to be in if you have any brains and don't stand eight feet tall and weigh a thousand pounds. I liked that the young black dude in this film got his life together. Great for him. Given that he could barely read, I think its wonderful that several Universities wanted him so badly. I think maybe Sandra Bullock is not aware of what damage promoting large not bright guys as University material has done to Universities. Football doesn't last forever. This policy in effect sends these guys on a collision course with humanity when they stop playing ball. Great stuff. I never met a large guy with much in the way of brains. And I think there is nothing worse than trying to turn back the clock on more brainy students at University by playing games with them as if it was grade three and Tommy can't throw a football right.

            "content": "The opening scene of The Blind Side successfully establishes a football analogy that, for someone unlearned in the game (like me), helps to explain the game from the coach's point of view. Over real-life footage of Joe Theissman's gruesome 1985 career-ending compound fracture, the narration tells us that \"The first check you write is for the mortgage, and the second is for the insurance. The left tackle's job is to protect the quarterback from what he can't see coming. To protect his blind side.\" That analogy comes from Leigh Ann Tohey, who is our guide for the rest of the film. Her explanation had me nodding my head. Something of the strength of the game is held in that tiny moment. Unfortunately this is the only scene in the movie that works.The Blind Side is based on a true story, yet it has all the dramatic subtlety of a chainsaw. Every moment feels manipulated for our enjoyment, with no thought to the free-flow of real life. Heroic characters and their naysayers are set up like pins in a bowling alley. The good guys bowl down the naysayers and that's that. Here is a movie that has the potential to tell a great story, but avoids challenging us with hard truths by burying reality in a vat of pitiful easy clich\u00e9s and over melodramatic punches. This is melodrama at about a 4th grade level.Bullock plays Leigh Ann Tohey, one of those southern women who always gets her way by talking sassy and making big speeches. She has one of those beautiful, smiling families that you usually see in coffee commercials. By her side is husband Sean (Tim McGraw) who has the sole function of reminding others that this little Philly always gets her way. Their daughter is pretty teenaged Collins (Lily Collins) whose sole function is to be pretty and teenaged. And there's little S.J. (Jae Head), a freckle-faced kid who is so precocious and irritating that he brings the whole movie to a screeching halt. Imagine the early years of Jar Jar Binks and you've got the idea. They live in one of those grand estates where everything is sunlit like a magazine cover.The story kicks off when Leigh Ann and Sean notice a sad-eyed black kid walking home in the rain. Leigh Ann takes pity on this poor kid and offers him a room in their home. He is Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), the son of a crack addict whose sad life has been a rotating series foster homes throughout Memphis, nearly all of which he has run away from. Before his solemn stroll in the rain, he got help to get into Wingate Christian School despite a disastrous academic record. He got in because the coaches at the school were convinced that he could revive their sorry excuse for a football team. Mike accepts Leigh Ann's offer and is soon living at the Tohey house where the family adopts him as one of their own. Leigh Ann notices that he has protective instincts and decides that his wide girth might make him a great defensive tackle. No points for guessing that he is a natural on the football field.The scenes on the football field should be the center of the film. Unfortunately, very little of what happens on the field is of any interest. Those scenes never have any tension or dramatic impact. We never feel as if we're watching a team. The scenes are set up as if Michael is the center and the other guys (who we never see in the cold light of day) are there to support him. Football scenes in the movies are among the most difficult to get right. Like battle scenes, there needs to be strategy, placement, logic so that we can follow the action in order to get a sense of the dramatic tension. Here, director John Lee Hancock takes the easy way out. He focuses on squarely on Michael as a way of avoiding dealing with anyone else. In one scene he sets up a night game with Michael on one team and a loud-mouthed racist kid on the other (who has an equally loud-mouthed racist father in the stands). The scene is set up so that Michael can knock he kid over the fence. Why was that necessary? Why create such an offensive and clich\u00e9d character that is set up for a cheap and easy payoff? The reason, I'm afraid, is that the movie wants to get the audience on its side. Instead of trusting their intelligence, it manufactures phony situations for an easy pay off. The good characters in the movie are saintly, while the negative characters are hateful scorns or one-dimensional dummies. Take, for example, the coach at Wingate. His name is Cotton (Ray McKinnon) and his sole function in the film is to say and do the wrong thing so that Leigh Anne can prove him wrong. He stands at the sidelines looking perplexed. After a while you wonder how he ever became a coach in the first place.The one saving grace in the film is Sandra Bullock who maintains her dignity in the midst of terminal dreck. She looks great, she photographs just right but her character in this movie is given scenes that make no sense or are outside the boundaries of reality. One unbelievable moment has her marching down the projects and getting in the face of a gangbanger who has threatened Michael. She's allowed to walk away from that situation, get in her car and drive home. Yeah, not gonna happen.The basic problem with The Blind Side is that it is so sanctimonious. Every single emotional high point is rung like the bell at the strength-tester at the county fair. The fact that this is based on a true story means nothing because the screenwriters haven't been honest with us. It deteriorates under the weight of its own good-heartedness.",

This family should be praised for the generosity that the showed, Sandra Bullocks character LeighAnn, in my opinion truly displayed a sincere love for this boy. And no this film is not about stereo types but it is how things really are in the world today. There is no reason for anyone to have had 13 children that the state has to support.

As a homeless teenager he is taken in by a woman and her family who help him to succeed both academically and on the football field.The story as presented in the film is compelling but it also bears the unmistakable imprint of Hollywood at every turn. The feel-good, inspirational plot points often seem too good to be true and, from what I've read, many (unsurprisingly) aren't true. Moreover, the Tuohy family life is portrayed as little short of idyllic and their clan even includes a precocious youngster. More troubling than these manufactured elements, though, is the fact that the script seems to treat Oher as little more than a prop, never giving us much of a glimpse into his personality.As for the acting, Sandra Bullock was rewarded with an Oscar for her performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the woman who takes Oher under her wing. As always, she's a likable presence and this is probably her best performance to date. Quinton Aaron plays Michael Oher, giving what I suppose is a decent performance, though it's hard to say since the character is pretty flat. The rest of the cast, which includes Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates, is up to par.On the technical side of things, the film shows polish but not much character. The direction and score are both solid but forgettable.In the end, the appeal of the \"The Blind Side\" is somewhat paradoxical. The film has all the hallmarks of a cookie-cutter Hollywood production yet it hits its targets so accurately that one can't help but get caught up in the story.

If it had simply told the story without injecting artificial Hollywood gloss and melodrama, maybe it would have been. Instead, 'The Blind Side' plays more like a fictional drama filled with clich\u00e9s and exaggerated scenes designed to manipulate the audience.I'm not too familiar with Michael Oher's story, but I'm pretty sure he didn't used to walk round with a gigantic sulk on his face 24/7 like is portrayed in the film. It's almost as if the film feels the need to constantly remind us of Oher's unhappiness - we get it. Fortunately, the story alone is good enough to pull this film through and it is somewhat rewarding in the end, despite all the melodrama along the way.",

From the opening voice-over scene to the real-life pictures in the credits, I thought the movie was extremely well-made and true to the story. I knew bits and pieces of the Michael Oher story, knew about \"The Play\" from the beginning that changed people's views of left tackles, and recognized every real-life coach in the film, and all of them were extremely true-to-life. I've lived in Arkansas my whole life, so Houston Nutt's small part as Razorbacks coach was especially hilarious and spot-on to me, even given his unfriendly departure. I've seen many sports movies in my life, so quite a few times I thought a corny moment was going to happen, but they never happened. More importantly, it was a great movie about a family who did the right thing and a man who devoted himself to being the best he could be, despite his past.On the same note, my female non-football-loving friend sitting beside me agreed on the greatness of the movie. It's moving, no matter who you are. Black or white, rich or poor, this movie shows you that love and determination can go a long way.",

            "content": "I went into The Blind Side knowing little about the film, and less about its back story. Color me surprised to learn that the film depicts 'a remarkable true story', because until the final credit crawl I was convinced I was watching a skillfully made racial fantasy designed to assuage some serious liberal white guilt. In fact, until the crawl I was convinced the film had seriously overdone matters: who could possibly believe not only that an upper-class white family would take in an impoverished African-American youngster, pay his way through private school, and even buy him a truck? Misgivings aside, The Blind Side is an emotionally satisfying drama featuring a bravura performance by Sandra Bullock as Mama Tuohy and an excellent script by director John Lee Hancock. Quinton Aaron isn't much of an actor (though I should probably watch Be Kind Rewind again before jumping to conclusions), but he brings a degree of mystery to the character of Michael Oher that offers intrigue for the first half of the film--intrigue that isn't very satisfactorily resolved by an awkward sub-plot involving his birth mother. I still think The Blind Side was mostly made to make white people feel good and virtuous--perhaps I need to read Michael Lewis' book to convince myself otherwise--but that doesn't mean it isn't a good film. If the story is true, then the worst it's done is humanize rich Republicans--and if it isn't, it still appeals to the better nature in all of us. If we all acted on the kindness exemplified in The Blind Side, the world might just be a little bit better.",

Instead we get Tim McGraw hiding under a wig and delivering a fairly decent performance as the successful hen-pecked husband of Sandra Bullock. The Blind Side is the mostly true story of Michael Oher, a disadvantaged Memphis teen who is taken in by a wealthy family and turned into a good student and a great offensive tackle. I just watched Oher and his Baltimore teammates run wild over Tom Brady's Patriots today, as a matter of fact.Obviously when you go to see a movie like this, you already know the ending. Unless you don't watch football or have no idea who Micheal Oher is. So the challenge for the filmmakers is to construct a compelling story of how he got to where he is today. And for the most part John Lee Hancock and company make it worthwhile. Not only do we come away understanding Oher's very difficult childhood, be we also get a feel for just how big a risk the Touhy family is potentially taking by inviting him into their home. Though it is suggested at one point that they are only grooming a great athlete for service at their alma mater, we can clearly see that the Touhys care about Michael as a student and a person as well.The cast is generally up to the task at hand. Bullock is fairly convincing as an attractive southern belle whose idea it originally is to offer Michael a place to stay. Will she get any Oscar consideration? Probably not, but who knows. Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher might have been a bit too pudgy for the role but his portrayal will make you care about the man's plight. There are also quite a few real-life coaches playing themselves to varying degrees of success. None of these men currently hold the coaching positions they did when this movie takes place. Congrats to Tommy Tuberville on his getting the Texas Tech job this weekend. He's a good man who won't be locking any players in closets like someone we know. Football fans more than anyone else will like this movie best of course. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",

I thought Sandra Bullock was a phenomenal actress, and I was glad she won the Best Actress Academy Award. I really thought that this should have won the Best Picture Oscar rather than \"The Hurt Locker\", and I additionally think that this movie really deserves a higher Metascore because it was really good. I even remember getting this movie on Netflix when I was a sophomore in high school, and my family and I watched it together on a day that school was canceled, because we got heavy snow. In short, all I can say about this movie is that I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes to watch sports, and is interested in learning about current NFL players like Oher.",

            "content": "The Blind Side was an enjoyable movie. Although, the movie was based on a true story it was delivered in a very appealing manner. The movie cast really brought the movie to life. Sandra Bullock played the role of Leigh Ann Tuoly, Quinton Aaron played the role of Michael Oher also known as Big Mike and Jay Head played the role of Sean Jr. Tuoly also known as S.J. The cast made me forget I was watching a film that was based on a true story. It was as if the storyline was playing out for the very first time. Big Mike was a high-school age teen, who played football. He lives in poverty, going home to home, school to school, without much family support or stability. Big Mike, is ultimately befriended by S.J. who is much younger than he and they develop of friendship. The interactions of Big Mike and S.J. caught the attention of S.J's mom, Leigh Ann Tuoly; Big Mike, did not go unnoticed from Leigh Ann from that point on.The complexity of Human relationships and Coming of Age were two of the most prevalent themes throughout the movie. Most people that came in contact with Big Mike, were intimidated by him because of his size. No one took the time to get to know him or understand his plight; until Leigh Ann did. Even when Leigh Ann, decided she wanted to take Big Mike in, her family and people around her weren't very supportive initially. People simply did not understand and most people are afraid of what they don't know. Big Mike dealt with the complexity of human relationships in several facets. Once Leigh Ann, took him in, he went from living in poverty to living very comfortably. It wasn't until he began living with Leigh Ann, did he have a bed of his own for the very first time; which was a big difference from how he was accustomed to living. Big Mike was also as a large black man, now living in a community that was primarily white. He had to adapt to the stares, glares and some people just not liking him.Another film that comes to mind with a similar theme is Precious, only it's more intensified. While the main character Precious played by Gabourey Sidibe, also dealt with the complexity of human relationships; the complexity was with someone really close to her; her mother. The person we seek love from the most, naturally. Fortunately for Precious, she encountered someone at school who saw past her flaws; her teacher; Ms. Rain played by Paula Patton. Ms. Rain, seen something good in Precious, just as Leigh Ann, seen in Big Mike.The techniques in \"The Blind Side\" seemed to be the coolest at night, on the football field. The view of the stadium lights gave for such a great illusion, gearing our attention to the football field and the football players. There were many other people and objects in those scenes but we were drawn to the football field. I also really appreciated the slow motion effects, it made you anticipate what was going to happen next. It really pulled you into the scene, you felt as if you were there.The movie was definitely one that dealt with the complexity of Human Relationships and it was interesting to see some of the complexities overcome the throughout the movie. By the end of the movie Big Mike did not deal with as many complexities, nor conflicts, which made for a great movie.",

            "content": "The movie Blind Side is a non-fiction story about the life of Michael Oher and his struggles to overcome life's obstacles such as social problems, the struggle for human dignity, human relationships and coming of age. The plot of the film is that a teenager Michael Oher (played by Qinton Aaron) has been surviving on the streets with little closing and no place to live. He is spotted by Leigh Anne Touhy (played by Sandra Bullock) and as she questions her children she learns that Michael, commonly called Big Mike by other kids, is a classmate of her kids at Wingate School a school predominately for those with social status. On that first meeting she insists that Michael, who is scantily dressed for the winter, get into the car and takes him home for the night. Once there she is a little scared that he will do something, but in the morning finds all the covers neatly folded on the end of the couch and Michael gone. This first moment of kindness on Leigh Anne's part, and the unfamiliar behavior expected by Michael, to later draw the family to make Michael a member of the Touhy family. Although there are extreme differences in background, Michael accepts to live with the Touhy's an in turn undergoes a entirely new set of challenges. Some of those challenges include, fitting into the school, trying to pass classes to be able to play football, and making friends. SJ Touhy (played by Jae Head) becomes Michael's closest friend and helps him to overcome many of the social obstacles. At one point Sean Touhy (played by Tim McGray) mentions that Michael is \"basically a fly in a bowl of milk at Wingate\". As the story goes on Michael eventually begins to change the lives of the Touhy's as they make discoveries into their own lives and how they have grown accustom to having money and overlooked those who don't. An example of this is when Michael questions what happens to all the uneaten food at the restaurants the Touhy's own. Leigh Anne even stands up to her lifelong friends as they question her intention with having Michael around all the time and admits that Michael is changing her life. This film gives you the sense of caring and makes one take a look at their own life and how one might overcome adversity to become something much greater in life. The background in which you come from does not make the person. It is how the person treats the world that makes a difference. Yes Michael becomes a football player (high school, college & later NFL), but at one point they had to ask him if he even wanted to play football. It's a great real life success story, but one has to look past the achievements of Michael Oher at the real meaning of what the Touhy family did. It a movie about the best in humanity and how, if those who are blessed with financial and spiritual resources reach out and share those blessings, they can change the course of someone's life for the good.",

            "content": "A Touchdown for AllWhether or not you have ever watched a football game, this movie will tug at your heart and have you rooting for Michael Oher right from the start. Through the use of it's dynamic actors, Michael Lewis' The Blind Side shows the importance of family and compassion which grabs the attention of both sports and non sports enthusiasts. The Blind Side tells the true story of Michael Oher's life. At the start of the movie Michael doesn't have a home and is staying at a friend's house in a little part of Tennessee called \"Hurt Village. I'll let the name of the village speak for itself. Both he and his friend are able to begin attending a Christian school on the other side of town with the help of his friend's desperate father. Michael feels out of place right from the start. He is referred to as \"Big Mike\", and is treated as an outcast by not only students but by the teachers as well. It isn't until he runs into Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) that things start turning around for him. Leigh Anne immediately reaches out to Michael and invites him to stay for the night. One night turns into a few more nights and pretty soon Michael has his own room in the Tuohy household. A lot changes during his time starts at the Tuohy's and he goes from being a reserved, \"Big Mike\" to a confident, \"Michael\". The acting in this movie is altogether fantastic. From Tim McGraw who plays Sean Tuohy, to Michael's tutor, Miss Sue played by Kathy Bates, everyone of the actors and actresses deserve a standing ovation. In my opinion, Leigh Anne Tuohy who is played by Sandra Bullock steals the show. The audience can really connect to her empathetic character. Sandra Bullock gives all women a sense of empowerment and shows people that a little compassion can go a long way. Both Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron, who plays Michael in the movie help one another to realize how much they need each other. One of the things I love about this movie is that it is not only about how The Tuohy family took Michael in and completely turned his life around, but how Michael became a member of the Tuohy family and gives them all a whole new outlook on life. After seeing this movie, there is one actor who cannot go unnoticed. That would be Jae Head, who plays the role of S.J. Tuohy, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy's (Tim McGraw) youngest child. Jae has such a big role for such a young child and does it in a way that makes you wonder how someone so young could be so wise. He gives the movie a very lighthearted feel, and keeps people sitting on the edge of their seat wondering \"what will he say next\" whenever he is in a scene. It is clear right away that he and Michael will be close. They hit it off right away when S.J. gives Michael a little advice to \"Smile at them. It will let them know you're their friend\" after he watches Michael scare away two little girls from the swing at the park. It's very heartwarming to see how much Michael listens to what advice S.J. has for him throughout the movie. The Blind Side has something for everyone. This may seem like another clich\u00e9 sports movie, but it has so much more within it. The fact that it is a true story makes it one that has and will inspire many. The Blind Side is one for all to see and will leave you with a feeling of the utmost compassion towards the people in this movie.",

The Blind Side is a very good movie starring Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy, Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher, and Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy. Michael Oher is a black kid who was raised very poor and his mother was a drug addict. He was not attending school and was homeless. Michael Crosses paths with Leigh Anne Tuohy. She takes him to her home and they all started bonding. Eventually, the Tuohy's adopted Michael, he started doing well in school from all of the help he was receiving. He also excelled very well in football. Michael has the natural instinct of protection so this served him well as an offensive lineman. The Tuohy's saved Michael and he turned his life completely around. He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens and is currently the starting left tackle for the Carolina Panthers.The theme of this movie is overcoming the odds. Michael was setup to fail his entire life until the Tuohy's gave him a reason to fight and stand up for himself. They gave him the drive and the confidence to be better, to overcome the terrible situation that his mom put him in. A good example of this is when Michael is struggling at football practice and Leigh Anne explains to him how to use his protective instinct and that the other football players are his family. Another film that has a similar theme would be We are Marshal. They are overcoming to odds after a horrific plane crash.The film angle ties in with the theme. Often times, at the beginning of the film, the angle is focused down onto Michael as to portray how low Michael's life is at that moment. By the end of the film you see that the angle is more looking up to him. This is a testament to what Michael has accomplished and overcome. Another aspect that helps with the theme throughout the movie is lighting. You will notice that in the darkest of times of Michael's life that the scenes are much more dark and dull. On the contrary, when everything is going right and Michael is happy, the color and lighting is brighter. It is all about overcoming the odds for Michael Oher and he overcame his terrible odds in a very big way.",

            "content": "The Blind Side is a film about a young homeless man named Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), who is eventually taken in by a caring woman Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). This might be considered a sports story because it revolves around a young man becoming an All-American and NFL player. However, this story is really about a man's fortune being turned around by a loving woman and family, and in turn, he also changing their lives forever for the better.\nThe theme of this film is that we can never judge a book by its cover. In this film we see Leigh Anne's compassion and Michael's true character turning into a lifelong bond between the Tuohy family and Michael Oher.\nMichael is a very large African American man, and many people may be afraid of him just by looking at him. Leigh Anne meets him, and quickly they begin to bond. She looks past his physical traits and she can see the man that he truly is. In the film, she invites him to stay for a night. That turns into him staying every other night; at first, her husband, Sean, seems to be a little hesitant. However, she is a very strong-willed woman and convinces him that it is the right thing to do.\nThroughout the film, we see Michael's fortune completely turned around, but we also see the Tuohy family's lives changed for the better because of Michael. We see at the beginning of the film that Leigh Anne's daughter is not on board with bringing him in. She is very skeptical, and I believe afraid of him. Once she realizes the person that he is, you see a bond grow between them and a brother-sister bond form.\nThis film reminded me of watching Coach Carter. Another sports film, but it was about a person who cared more than just what happened on the court, or in the case of The Blind Side, on the field. Coach Carter and Leigh Anne Tuohy's compassion for the people in their lives and not caring as much about what they do in sports, but what impact they could have on a young person's life in directing them in the right direction.\nWhen watching this film, I thought the filmmakers did a great job of using different film angles to show how big Michael was, compared to other people. He is a very large man and the filmmakers used camera angles to enhance his size and spotlight his overall size compared to others. The filmmakers also kept using the motif of lower-class vs. the upper class in this film. We repeatedly see people questions Leigh Anne and her motives. We see them make it obvious to see who the upper class was and who was a lower class by clothing, homes, vehicles, etc. Showing was important because Michael was a homeless man, and the Touhy family were very wealthy.\nThe Blind Side is a heart-warming film about how compassion towards other lives can be changed forever. Michael and Leigh Anne show us that you can't judge a book by its cover. Both characters come with their own biases based on their social statuses. However, in this film both people show their true character, and they both benefited from a lifelong bond.",

Not a big fan of Sandra Bullock and kind of thought this might be a maudlin, sentimental, schmaltzy Disney kind of flick. Okay it was not overly maudlin or sentimental but the schmaltz came out and a Disney kind of flick it was.So what was wrong. First what was right. Yes the story was uplifting. Never knew about Michael Oher but his story was an inspiration. But so was the film Precious where while Precious wasn't homeless her story was just as uplifting and her background just as difficult. And Quinton Aaron did a good job with the part. May have even got it right.But folks come on. This ain't Father Knows Best or Leave it to Beaver. But it felt like it. We felt like we had been dumped into some 60's sitcom where all the family was just perfect. There was no tension, no grit to this film. Everyone was darned near just nice. Even the daughter who clearly was a bit out of joint acted as if she was just in a nice sitcom where everyone makes nice. And the younger brother - well he just became annoying. The father played by C&W star Tim McGraw - this guy is clearly a lightweight. The love scene between McGraw and Sandra was laughable. Even the tension scenes such as when Sandra had to confront her Republican matron lunch-mates and their racism was like something - well we don't want to make this real serious or anything. Closest otherwise we came to tension was just after Michael left the NCAA lady and confronted with Sandra and during his visit back to the projects and wound up smashing a few heads. Even Kathy Bates was just too nice (I am a Democrat she says). Wow these Republicans live in a Disney world. They really do.Finally Sandra Bullock. Okay Sandra you weren't bad - but Best Actress? The Razzies probably got it right the night before when they gave her a Razzie for \"All about Steve\". What an accomplishment - a Razzie and an Oscar all in the same year. I guess the other nominees couldn't cut it. But I gave high marks to the girl that played Precious but I guess giving it to a 200 pound plus black girl who actually played a gritty role wasn't on the agenda when you could give it to Sandra who I suspect played herself. Tough Republican Mom with a heart of Gold.And Best Picture??? Well I guess they needed a feel good filler. And feel good filler is about all this was. 6 out of 10 which is probably about right.Dchap",

            "content": "When Lawrence Taylor broke Joe Theismann leg, the football world realized how important a left tackle is a quarterback. Then the story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) comes into the play. By providing, one act of kindness in someone's life forever. In the movie, he's an oversized teenager from the inner city of Memphis. With his potential in football, an upscale private Christian school football coach (Ray McKinnon) took a leap of faith and was able to get into the school. There were many doubts from teachers in the school due to his grade point average, which was a dreadful 0.6. Michael was very intimidated by his new surroundings, majority white and wealthy students S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head) befriends Michael at school, and Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw) see his roaming the streets on a cold and rainy night. They take him in for the night, which turns in a week then finally, adoption. By living with the Tuohy's, gives a sense of comfort and trust away from crime and poverty. With help from S.J. and Leigh Anne, they help him find his killer instinct in football. Before then, he was just a gentle giant and lacked the football skills. Tuohy's hire Miss Sue, (Kathy Bates) to help Michael with his school work. Leigh Anne tells the coach about Michael scoring high in protective instincts, which causes him to protect his team, as well as his family. Leigh Ann helps Michael by providing a mental picture that his quarterback and running back are his family and must protect them. Michael surpasses any struggles that are against him, in the classroom and on the football field. By breaking free from the environment that surrounded him early in the film, he can exceed in life. The close- up angles in some of the scenes, want to show the anger or happiness depending on the part of the film. I like how the movie focuses on the relationship between humans and look beyond the color of skin. Lighting throughout the movie was great, especially on the football field. It shows depth in the movie and helps provide focus on the main character of the movie. I believe protective instincts is a continuous them throughout the film. An example of the protective instincts is when Michael and S.J. were riding in the truck and the big truck backed out inform of them. Michael first instinct was to protect his family before himself. Everyone needs protection in life, not just a quarterback but even the biggest of giants. This in the case of Michael.",

            "content": "So today I watch The Blindside and it was bad.Let's start with the positives, Sandra Bullock was OK. She did pretty good, and I actually think this might be the best performance that I have seen from her and(though I haven't seen speed). I still have criticisms with her performance, but I could tell that she was actually trying in this film and I think it did show in the final product. I still definitely don't think this was Oscar worthy, but it was good. 6/10 :)If I'm being brutally realistic, that's really the only thing positive about the film. Everything else is rather average or bad. The film almost comes off as a Hallmark movie with its overly-sappy manipulative constantly playing unimaginative soundtrack, over abundance of editing that makes it feel almost like an action film, cheesy and terrible writing, and at best average acting from the rest of the cast.The music is really really REALLY annoying holy moly, it's completely bland, simultaneously annoying and forgettable, and formulaic. It sounds like it's straight out of an off brand sims soundtrack or ANY HALLMARK MOVIE . It's also just constantly playing in every scene and is trying it's absolute hardest to manipulate your emotions. It is very very annoying and has 0 restraint.The story structure for this film is very slow and several scenes linger for an unnecessary amount of time for no reason, there's a scene when Sandra bullock and a character are talking and the scene dragged on for SOOO long and then I realized I could speed up the movie and it's still so long even when sped up like there's so much empty space between when people speak it's very unnatural. There are scenes that have literally no impact on the movie at all that almost feel like they're from a separate script. Like seriously there was a scene with 2 main characters that seemed really crucial and then it was literally resolved the next scene and then they brought it up one time in the scene right after and it was never brought up again and had literally 0 effect on the story.The acting is all very average, kids did slightly above Disney channel acting but had terrible writing that made me feel like I was listening to the actor read the script to me. There's very little standouts in the crowd and everyone did rather average. It's very difficult to distinguish if it's terrible awful writing or bad performances for some characters. The 3 women Sandra bullock goes to food or whatever she was doing with all sucked and they had some really bad incredibly tone deaf one note dialogue. One of the lines in this film \"who would have thought we'd have a black son before meeting a democrat\" so yeahSandra bullock did mostly good but there were a few times when she would overact some of her lines and it was really distracting, but she did good for most of the film. Also she could not cry to save her life till she went off screen. Seriously she sat there blinking over and over and not crying then she goes to the car where the camera obviously does another take and then she's crying. It was kinda embarrassingIn general, this film on so many levels is just viscerally offensive and tone deaf with its portrayal of African Americans and feels like a total white savior film. Like the only black person in the film who likes Sandra bullock and the white peoples is the main character and I guess one other person who says Sandra bullock is nice(who also does drugs btw), but every black character in this movie is just shown as a thug or a gangster who are predatory towards white people??? The main character is portrayed as significantly unintelligent but very strong African American in the beginning of the film and with the help a white rich super multitasking housewife becomes smart enough to play football yay. It's literally the Uncle Tom stereotype and the film fails to be self aware at all in any way towards this. There is many instances when the films implies that it is trying to tackle a big issue and it just seems comedic given all the garbage that is riddled within it. Like you'll have characters saying things like hes black he can't pass a quiz or how something was implied to another character near the end of the movie which was really forced.The editing is garbage and does like a trillion cuts in certain scenes that makes it really difficult to soak in any of the scenes. The cinematography was also below average and I didn't really get anything visually appealing. It wasn't that bad, but it sure was underwhelming and dull.Also there is a lot of cliches that I've seen a billion times. Wow this guys getting bullied I'm gonna leave my popular table to go sit with him. We're gonna have a fight right now cause the movie says so and then immediately resolve it literally 2 scenes later. Theres a few more but you can look those upThis film sucks. 3/10.",

The first half of this film is actually good although a very over simplified covering of the subject matter.Character development is minimal, we know nothing of the motivations of the wife or her reasoning only that she has an answer for everything, nothing about the husband other than he is rich and he does whatever his wife says, and the rest of the family is made up of a pretty girl whose unlike 95% of normal teens in the fact that she doesn't question her mother bringing home a strange kid from her school to live with them, and the son is just another Hollywood wise cracking 8 yr old who speaks way above his age level and somehow has the ability to coach a football player even though his only experience has been watching it on TV. The mother is a football expert too who calls the coaches cell phone to tell him how to run the game and mouths off to racist redneck fans without any consequences. The coach is just a horrible caricature with the worst lines in the movie.We get all the typical black/white and football clich\u00e9s and from there it just goes into this boring montage of ridiculously overacting college coaches promising him the world if he plays for them and of course his little brother unrealistically is in on every meeting demanding things for himself by pushing around grown men. This is interspersed with shots of his tutor (a dull Katy Bates) and teachers all seemingly on the verge of tears because they are so inspired by this kid who barely speaks. Then Michael Oher briefly turns into to a action hero and the mother into Dirty Harry who threatens drug gangs and they don't even respond because she's packing heat but so are they. Then suddenly hot young white chicks are attracted to this dorky overweight guy during his college orientation.The oddest thing is the end where they show the real Michael Oher and family simply proving to us that movies are mostly made up as the actors portraying them are twice as good looking as the real folks.I wanted to like this movie but it was so meandering and silly that it failed me early on and from there on I just wanted it to end.",

Oscar, not too convinced.The Blind Side is incredibly enjoyable and a pleasure to watch. It is heartwarming, and quite inspiring, but, I feel that it really could've been more - still remain what it is, but more. The editing and direction was somewhat uneven... The pace, a tad bit unstable, but again, enjoyable.My biggest problem with The Blind Side though, was Quinton Aaron. This role proved too big and too heavy for him to carry. Outright, Quinton Aaron was unsatisfactory. He just, couldn't deliver, and the film suffered greatly because of it, given his role. It's obvious almost, that a limited amount of actors could play the role of \"Big Mike\", considering the age and size combo, and that worked well for Quinton, but, I feel, at the demise of Michael Oher's story.Tim McGraw and Jae Head were awesome and their characters were somehow the glue that put this story together very well. They may not have had big roles, but, they played extremely necessary parts.The Blind Side could've easily been a 7+/10, but the editing, direction and Quinton's woeful outing, compromised what was an absolute joy to watch otherwise.6.4/10.",

            "content": "2.5/4There is something so undeniably inept about the way The Blind Side is presented. It's an entertaining movie, but it seems to dispel any hard facts, and glide thoughtlessly over big issues. This gives way to a movie that feels like it was carried by its many embellishments and heavily watered-down.This is based on the true story is of a 17-year-old names Michael Oher. He lives a life devoid of any opportunities. One day, a family takes him in, sends him to a prestigious private school, teaches him how to play football, and ultimately lands him on the Baltimore Ravens. It's a truly great story, but it was told in a very glib manner. It was also told in an arguably degrading way towards its real-life counterpart. In case you didn't know, Michael Oher himself has been vocal about that.The acting and character interactions were quality, and probably the best aspect of this movie. Sandra Bullock gives a powerful, if not over-acted, female lead. When the characters don't feel like they're putting on an act, they're actually quite charming.What is left of the movie runs together much in the manner of a train crash for me. The story seems to rushed to give its own merits any attention. The movie glides in-and-out of focus of what it needs to do: shed light on the issues it introduced. While it told a story well, it didn't leave you thinking about the movie.Overall, The Blind Side is extraordinarily average. It's neither memorable for its football, nor its drama, and it doesn't give a true story a good movie-screen experience. Remember The Titans? I wish.",

Certainly not a pure football movie, this film delivers an emotional punch and a great message. I've read invalid criticism of this movie that tries to say that the main characters aren't fleshed out enough. I couldn't disagree more. When Sandra Bullock's character says, \"I'm not changing him, he's changing me\" you clearly see why. Experiencing life through Oher's eyes is like re-experiencing everything for the first time. You appreciate EVERYTHING and learn that there really are no \"little things\" in life. Simple things taken for granted like food and a bed are to be savored and never overlooked. This movie manages to remind us all of that while delivering great entertainment. The performances are outstanding. Sure, it's predictable and there are some clich\u00e9s ranging from inner city portrayal to a dufus high school football coach but those things are easily forgiven in my book.

I am not crazy about football movies, or feel-good holiday movies where everyone is without a mean bone in his or her body (except some clich\u00e9d curmudgeon who has a Scroogian change of heart in the end whether he/she be a major or minor character). Nor for the emotional manipulations and simplifications that go on when a movie is based on a true story and the filmmakers melodramatize it and dumb it down for the audience. In \"The Blind Side\", if these people were half as good in real life as they are made out to be in this picture, there probably never was any conflict that amounted to anything as melodramatic as the climax here. All that being said, I must give this movie a positive review.\"The Blind Side\" also had a strike against it because it reminds me of the cynical joke in \"The Hollywood Shuffle\" about a TV sitcom where a white person takes in a bat played by a black actor and the name of the sitcom is \"There's a Bat in My House\", which is clearly meant to parody every clich\u00e9d sitcom about a black person living with a white host.\"The Blind Side\" overcomes an awful lot of the strikes against it by being well written, directed and acted. They don't seem as much like clich\u00e9s while you're watching them. Yet the clich\u00e9s are all there. That is an amazing achievement. I wouldn't go to a sequel or a remake or other attempt to recapture the magic of this movie because nobody could do it without turning it into utter schmaltz.Sandra Bullock is at the top of her game as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the real-life Memphis woman who decided to take Michael Oher, a good-natured sixteen-year-old underachiever (played sensitively by Quinton Aaron) into her home one Thanksgiving Eve and never let him leave until she and her husband sent him off to college two years later, in the mean time having become his legal guardians, hired a tutor so that he could improve his grades and seen him become sought after by dozens of college football coaches.The only major conflicts in the plot (there are minor conflicts, of course, but we are never really afraid of them) stem from the appearance of impropriety in that the Tuohys and Michael's tutor are all alumni of the University of Mississippi and they all are seen encouraging Michael to accept a football scholarship to \"Ole Miss\". As the investigator from the NCAA suggests, it looks as if the Tuohys did everything that they did for Michael just so that they could boost the football fortunes of their alma mater. In the movie, Michael, who has never considered this possibility until the investigator spells it out, suddenly considers it seriously, and runs away from Leigh Anne and goes back to the projects where he spent part of his childhood. There he nearly gets killed. I smell an injection of melodrama into a more placid real life story where the dramatic conflicts were more mundane if not absent. If the Tuohys are half as good in real life as they are made out to be in this movie, I suspect that Michael would never have believed for a second that they were that nice to him just so that they could exploit him. Human beings are capable of great deviousness, but nobody can sustain an uncrackable facade of faux affection toward someone they do not really love for two whole years, especially if that someone is a teenager.As is often the case in these sorts of movies when they are done well, the pathos is judiciously mixed with gentle humor. I laughed, I cried, goes the clich\u00e9 and here it was true. I actually enjoyed being manipulated by this movie, and that says a lot considering that it had so many strikes against it going in.Disclaimor: One thing \"The Blind Side\" had in its favor from the get-go is that it stars Sandra Bullock whom I absolutely adore.",

The movie follows the story of Micheal Oher before and (mostly) after he is adopted by the well to do Tuhoy family where after staying with the family for some time, he magically becomes one of the best football defenders in the college division.Beyond that, there's nothing more to it. Once again, we are given yet another inspirational sports movie with the same plot seen in other films; the underdog guy/ team is helped/ coached by the compassionate but unexpected coach and they all live happily ever after as \"better people\" (similar films include \"Glory Road,\" \"Gridiron Gang\" and \"Pride\"). There; that pretty much sums up the entire movie. If they're going to make another sports movie in the future, at least bring something new to the genre; I've had it with sports movie being too predictable just like this one.Massive lack of originality and overused story aside, the one shining point of the movie was Sandra Bullock's performance (which was a big improvement compared to her other movies of the year, which include the okay \"The Proposal\" and the better forgotten \"All About Steve\") but I don't see why she deserved the Best Actress award in this year's Oscars. Compared to her fellow nominees for the same award (especially Gabourey Sidibe for \"Precious\"), her performance was really weak. She may have done a good job in an otherwise mediocre film, but giving her the Oscar just doesn't make any sense.",

The movie, however uplifting and celebratory it is, seems to miss the mark in a few places. It has come to light that Michael Oher is not as dumb as the film makes him out to be. It appears that the filmmakers took some liberty here in order to make the transformation of Oher look more astounding. Also, much of the writing is classic \"feel-good movie\" writing. There are certain lines and plot points that you just know are going to come back around in the story, making it somewhat predictable.

It is an unusual story and is told without the usual lorry load of sugar coated schmaltz. There is some - it's Hollywood so you can expect some but there was less than I thought there would be. ***SPOILER*** A few moments do jar, particularly with the Role of Bullock calling in plays for the football team (up tot his point she has displayed little knowledge or interest in the game), calling out her lunch friends on a racial slur or the 'share the credit' ending with the poem inspiring his English essay and the 98 percentile in protective instincts - he sounds like a guard dog.",

Why are people saying that they laughed in this movie? I REALLY do not know. The plot follows the \"true\" story of Michael Oher (in the film played by Quinton Aaron) who is adopted by a white southern family at the request of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). I am not denying that it isn't a powerful story, and not taking away anything from the Tuohy family, because what they did was very kind. I just wish it could have made a better movie.The problems with the film start with Sandra Bullock, who does a reasonable job given that she has to play a PSYCHOPATHIC mother! Seriously, the actions of Bullock in this movie made me want to cringe. Things like calling the coach during a football game and threatening to cut off your adopted son's penis does not make you endearing and likable. It makes you a psychopath. Another annoyance that pops up way to often in the movie comes in the form of S.J Tuohy (Jae Head). At first he seems innocent and sweet and then he just started to annoy me to no end. I mean the kid gets into a car crash, is covered in blood and then he gets up to ask his mom if she thinks the blood will wash out of his clothes (?). And his Mom instead of being worried about her son, just shrugs it off saying that he enjoys the attention. Another scene that annoyed me with the kid was when he tried to mooch off of ALL of Michael's college offers. Jesus Christ does this kid have an off switch?The thing that annoyed me the most about these characters is that the film seems to say that all of their actions are justified because of what they are doing for Michael. Sure, what your doing for Michael is nice, but that doesn't give you permission to be snobby and holier than thou. Quinton Aaron was the only person in the movie that I felt something for...Mainly because he doesn't really speak until the very end. When the end comes however and he does have to act, he doesn't impress me. Aside from that minor characters like the father (Tim McGraw) the tutor (Kathy Bates) and the teacher \"with a heart\" (Kim Dickens) seem like good people. Maybe because the camera doesn't spend too much time with any of them. Although the tutors line \"I'm a democrat\" (?) REALLY got under my skin. (Not because of the politics; mainly because it comes out of nowhere.)And looking upon this review you might be saying, \"This was based on a true story, there's nothing you can fix about it.\" And to that I say, just make something up! Take the inspirational story of the Tuohy's and loosely base it off of their story. But I guess I'm in the minority here. *1/2 out of *****",

Maybe not the ultimate masterpiece, but it is one that I would recommend. Criticism that I read about the movie is that it depicts a white family heroically helping an African-American. Well, even if that is the case, it's still an important story.Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) grew up in foster homes in Memphis, always running away. When he got sent to a Christian school, he met Sean, whose mother Leigh Anne allowed him to stay in the house. On the tests, Michael scores in the 98th percentile in protective instincts, and it's clear that football is his talent. But both Michael and Leigh Anne still have issues to deal with on both their sides of the tracks.While the film does have its weaknesses, I still wish to assert that everyone should see this. Not just because it's a true story. Hell, I'm not even going for the whole \"triumph of the human spirit\" routine. I think that the most important thing portrayed in \"The Blind Side\" is the current state of race relations in the United States, and how each side has to deal with its own stereotypes. So definitely see it.Also starring Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates.",

I don't think Sandra Bullock deserved Best Actress. She didn't seem to add any depth or emotion to her character. SJ was played by a cute kid, but he needed to act more like a kid. The daughter and the husband were complete cyphers; walking scenery.The scene where Michael is tormented by gang members while sitting in their apartment in the projects was played out very well. It was very realistic when Michael snapped. Very good acting. All in all, I would recommend this movie. Good entertainment.

The director certainly maintains the neutrality of the movie very well; he did not eliminate the stereotype issues like racism but instead embrace them just enough to be undetectable.However, this comes at its own costs of deterring from reality to a slightly more fairy tale-like sequence of events. For instance, the encounter of Leanne with the drug dealers, and the encounter with the real mother who, surprisingly, is much more stable and receptive of the situation than what I would expect (considering the actual timeline where the racial tension is supposed to be more vile?).Otherwise, this movie succeeded in draining a large water amount from me. And, yes, I think Bullock does deserve her Oscars, even though there may be other nominees more deserving. From her interview it was clear how much effort she put in to portray as close to the real person as possible but admitted that it is 'impossible because Leanne is simply original'.",

This movie is the story of a lost oversize boy who became a left tackle.Quinton Aaron, a young 6-8 actor from the Bronx, is Michael Oher, a gentle giant of a boy whose mother and father were always in trouble and he finds himself homeless. The Tuohy family notices that he attends school basketball games and stays to pick up food, uneaten popcorn etc so that he can survive. Leigh Ann is a generous person and, with two school children already, decides to give Michael a couch for the night, then eventually a shopping trip for clothes and his own bedroom. The Tuohys eventually also become his legal guardian.Factually Michael became an all-star high school football tackle, and played at Ole Miss, the alma mater of the Tuohys. And now he has become a first-round pick in the NFL draft. But the story isn't about football, it is about how much can be done when we allow ourselves to look beyond ethnic, racial, and economic differences to actually help others and make a difference.Tim McGraw is very effective as the dad, Sean Tuohy, former star Ole Miss basketball player and now the owner of a large number of fast-food outlets. His son SJ is Jae Head. Brit Lily Collins (daughter of singer Phil Collins) is good as the daughter Collins Tuohy.Part of the story is the task of getting Michael's grades up to a 2.5 average so that he would be eligible for division 1 sports, and Kathy Bates is excellent in the role of Miss Sue who the Tuohys hire to be Michael's personal tutor.Excellent, touching story.",

            "content": "The Blind Side is written and directed by John Lee Hancock. It stars Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron, Tim McGraw, Jae Head, Lily Collins and Kathy Bates. Music is scored by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Alar Kivilo.17 year old Michael Oher (Aaron) has been denied a stable upbringing in a loving family, wandering the streets devoid of an education of note and perhaps one step away from falling in with the wrong crowd? Big Mike is taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Bullock) and her family. Motives and means will be questioned elsewhere, but Leigh Anne taps into Big Mike's psyche and unearths a potential football star, but he, and the Tuhoy family, must overcome obstacles first.A big hit at the box office whilst garnering Bullock the Academy award for Best Actress, The Blind Side is proof positive that in a world that is often crappy, a simple button pushing movie can soar high and provide airy relief. Based on a true story, the film never lacks for emotional thrust, it is undeniably a sweet, and at times, uplifting picture, yet it lacks a dramatic edge, a boldness to really make the story grab you around the throat, forcing us to gasp for the emotional air floating up there in the sky. There's a tangible feeling of manipulation, a good ole whitey saves the down on his luck black fella narrative, where regardless of truth, it's a bit annoying to see Michael Oher (you know, the guy who the story is about) playing second fiddle throughout.With scenes involving Oher's mother (Adriane Lenox) lacking any emotional gravitas and the trips to the Ghetto devoid of genuine grit, Hancock is fortunate that the audience reaching out for some uplift was prepared to forgive these errors. That he had Bullock on top form also helps considerably. He should be commended for getting a performance of such unswerving charisma from her, even if it relegates everyone else around her to the sidelines. It was a role Bullock kept turning down (it had been offered to Julia Roberts first), she wasn't sure she could portray well enough such as strong religious lady as Leigh Anne Tuhoy, but eventually she signed on and etched her name into the annals of Academy Award winners.If it's the best actress performance of 2009 is up for much debate, as is if it is even Bullock's best career performance in fact? But undeniably it's a star turn that manages to hide the failings lurking under the sweetly stitched quilt pieced together by Hancock. In Bullock's hands the Tuhoy character holds our attention throughout with a mixture of strength, spunk and unflinching beliefs. If she's shouting down a redneck idiot, correcting a football coach or fronting up to a big mouth Ghetto leader, she has us firmly on side and eating out of her hands. She's the main draw card here, which is both a blessing and a hindrance. Best to roll up for this one expecting to be moved and cheered, but be prepared for a lack of complexity and guts. 7/10",

Michael is poorly educated and he finds himself at rock bottom until one day when wealthy family the Tuohys take Michael in and help him turn his life around and help him achieve his ultimate ambition and become an all American football player...Whilst there's no denying that the story behind Michael Oher's journey is inspiring and the Tuohy's assistance in helping achieve his goal is honourable it's actually the way everything is presented here which I took issue with...For a start I found a lot of things happened very conveniently; Michael agreeing to stay with the rich white family without much in the way of resistance. The family (more particularly the kids) being so readily accepting of someone so different to themselves without so much as batting an eyelid. I agree that this is the way someone from a different social background should be accepted, but given the fact that Michael was one of the only 'black' kids in the school it seemed very strange how 'nice' everyone was with Michael at the start given how practically everyone else showed prejudice towards him.The convenience and simplistic nature of the narrative doesn't end there either though; once Michael starts his home-tutoring and starts to train as an American football player I just found that everything came together far too easily meaning that I never once felt that I was watching an individual actually progressing. This caused a problem for me as I really wanted to feel a sense of struggle for Michael; I'm aware that the Blind Side is based on a true story and has been adapted from a book so I'm not sure how accurate a reflection this is of Michael's journey, but I really struggled with how simplistically this film was presented as whole. For me I found the film slightly lacking from an emotional perspective which unfortunately meant that I couldn't enjoy the film as much as I'd have hoped.The acting is OK with Quintin Aaron being quite good in some scenes, but unfortunately most of what is asked of him is surly silences and long stares. Sandra Bullock is good and gives a fairly passionate performance and did a good job in making me believe that she genuinely cared. Tim McGraw is not given much to do and Lily Collins felt more like window-dressing (she's very pretty though which was a plus at least). As the son Joe Head was the 'fun' character and his scenes where he effectively becomes Michael's broker when Michael starts to get 'head-hunted' were amusing.The Blind Side is watchable in the sense that it moves along without ever really being boring, but at the same time I just didn't find it to be a particularly emotionally involving film due to the convenient and simplistic way that the whole film was presented which meant that it didn't quite resonate with me in the same way that other sports drama films have done.",

At this point I was under the assumption that this story might lead up to Michael killing somebody through protection of his family or something; however, this scenario never plays out. Instead, he comes to be questioned for an entirely different reason. I like that it is not the tired murder scenario, that has been done to death. It was nice to see something different.The characters are all very likable in this film. I am not normally much of a fan of Sandra Bullock, but I think she did quite well with this role. Quintin Aaron did great playing Michael, and it was always suspenseful to see how Michael would react to each situation. What would he do when offered to sleep on the couch the first night? Or how would he react to the family's thanksgiving traditions?The ending was nice as well. I really liked how it synched up to actual footage of the Real Michael Oher at the NFL Draft.

Surely enjoy the whole process of watching this film, but if one has time to reflect his mind, what's under its superficial surface is that the film proposes an important question, how to balance the pity and conscience. As nowadays \"selfless\" good deeds are covered with some opaque disguises which makes people question the original intention, and I do believe every single action and word all has its own intention, ever subconsciously to the person himself. So Lynn selflessly takes care of Michael, behind which hides her own intention like Sean (her husband) mentions in the film because it gives you satisfaction. Sometimes maybe the answer is that simple, which I admire a lot from this film. The film is based a true story and considered a mainstream film aiming to all different levels of audiences and it succeeded it box office as a sleeper hit last year (earned more than 200 millions dollars domestically alone) and even nominated for 2 Oscars including BEST PICTURE and won the BEST ACTRESS award for Sandra Bullock. (One year before, who could imagine Sandra won an Oscar?), it truly shows that Jennifer Aniston, Cameron Diaz or even Demi Moore and Meg Ryan will have their chances in the future! I will talk a little bit more about Sandra's Oscar winning for her role in this film. It is very tricky because some say it is a brave decision and others say it is a shame even worse than Gwyneth's winning in 1999. Five nominees, Sandra, Meryl Streep (Julie & Julia), Helen Mirren (The Last Station), Gabourey Sidibe (Precious) and Carey Mulligan (An Education). I haven't watch \"The Last Station\", but just several years after \"The Queen\", Helen needs to be more patient to gain her second Oscar, so this nomination actually is more suitable to be considered as a warm-up for this year (who has 3 Oscar-baiting films at hand). Gabourey and Carey are both wonderful in their roles but as both are new-comers, their votes is definitely split which makes them difficult to win. So my original prediction was going to favor Meryl, who totally would deserve her third win. But generally speaking I didn't have too much confidence in Julie & Julia, firstly Meryl don't own much screen time (she is the co- leader with Amy Adams) and I think there is a thin-line of difference between acting and imitation. I did fear that the only surprising nominee could beat Meryl was Sandra, which actually happened. So, let's take a look at her performance here, Sandra is the sole focus of this film, I think the director even sacrifices the deeper depictions of Michael (who should have been the obvious main character of the story). Actually Sandra's role is a little bit plain but she manages to carry the whole film and creates an unexpected chemistry with her comedically deadpan acting which surprisingly saves the film's tame storyline, and makes the film much more watchable and enjoyable. Thus in all respects, chooses Sandra is a more reasonable choice as Oscar still a local film awards anyway and most Americans love Sandra Bullock.http://xingshizuomeng.blogspot.com/",

For me, she pales all those screen sirens through the ages into insignificance and \"The Blind Side\" expresses her unequaled talent and natural beauty superbly! As an Aussie, I know nothing at all about American Football (and, from what I have seen on movies and TV, I don't particularly want to!). That's not to knock it though - I just don't understand it and, since it is pretty well exclusive to the USA, I have no real need to. However, that's not the point of this review. In actual fact, the game doesn't matter. The point is that the Tuohy family - and Leigh-Anne (Bullock) in particular see the potential and the need in a young man who couldn't be much more different from their own lifestyle and they give helping him their everything (and MORE).Bearing in mind that \"The Blind Side\" is based on a true story, all I can say is that I would have loved to have known the Tuohy family. What awesome Christians from Dad to the young son. Actually, all the time I watched this film, I couldn't help seeing a family that attends my own church here in Queensland. The total absence of any sort of jealousy and the genuine love that emanated from every member of that family was just SO like my friends. (Actually, my friends here would make great subjects for a similar biographical drama - but I know their modesty would never let that happen! Pity really!) When the pictures came on with the credits at the end I was amazed at how well all five actors portrayed the real Tuohys and Michael. (Didn't Sandra look gorgeous as a blonde too! - I'm not biased!!) So this is the second time in as many weeks that I have sat through a movie centred around American Football and loved every minute of them (the other one was \"The Grid Iron Gang\"). I don't mind admitting that I had to wipe the occasional tear from my eye during this one too. How refreshingly pleasant to watch a movie where the predominance is on decent, loving and caring people rather than an over-abundance of violence, profanity and unpleasantness - especially when it's a true story. If I could, I'd give this 11 out of 10 and, if it doesn't win some major awards, the judges are all dormant!",

            "content": "Going into this moderate expectations, I came out astonished. The Blind Side is more than a documentary. But a tear-jerking true story of now Baltimore Raven's player Michael Oher. How a nice family takes in a poor, homeless kid who is nearly starving. And how a homeless boy's life is now an inspiring football player in the NFL.I'm not into football too much. I'm a Bears fan seeing as I settle in Illinois. I occasionally watch their games, though with disappointing years occurring frequently I found myself skipping most of this season.In The Blind Side, Sandra Bullock is a typical mother living in Tennessee with a husband, a teenage daughter named Collins, a younger son named SJ, and soon to be, adopted eighteen-year-old Michael Oher. Oher was taken from his mother at a young age after she was on a drug arrest and his dad was killed and thrown off of a bridge. Michael Oher goes to live with the family, showing beautiful manners (like eating at the table when everyone eats in the living room) and other acts.Oher often flashes back to when he was evicted from his home. When that happens, he closes his eyes because when his mom would do drugs that is what she would tell him to do. Bullock tries to help him get his life back on track, when she learns that Michael has a talent in protection. Seeing that, Bullock persuades him to go out for football as a defense player.Lots of sad moments and reflections take place in this movie. The dark satire for the film works well and flows along with the movie. Sandra Bullock deserves an Academy Award for Best Dama (which I believe she is nominated for anyway). I didn't know what to expect with this. Bullock has done good things and bad things. But this will go down has one of her best.Starring: Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, Quinton Aaron, and Kathy Bates. Directed by: John Lee Hancock.",

            "review_title": "Heart Warming Story Strangely Politicized",
            "content": "Director John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) makes his first major film outside of the Disney Company. It is based upon the true story of Michael Oher, an Offensive lineman for the Baltimore Ravens. The story features a group of football coaches playing themselves during the recruiting segment. It is based upon Michael Lewis 2006 novel. It is interesting that this story uses politics to base most of its humor. The humor stereotypes the no-no topic of black men with white women & then adds a social comment about the kids at school making fun of the white Republican family with the adopted black son. It is necessary to do this because of the way the true story happened though it is treated like this is still a social taboo? That might be true in the area this movie takes place, but that taboo has been shattered in many areas of this country many years ago now. Still, I guess it enhances the story because it helps provide a more vivid image to the background Michael Oher grew up in. It makes it easier for Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) to look like someone above the fray, willing to bring a disadvantaged young black man into her family & come off looking better than others. Since it appears the real Tuohy family is Republican, this is a great way to attempt too poke fun at both parties on this issue. One thing it does do real well, it shows how Football Coaches are sometimes out of touch with their players.The movie comes off though I think the viewer might be better off taking time too read the Michael Lewis book in order to get a better perspective on what the reality of the story is. This one is obviously cleaned up from the reality in order to keep a moderate PG-13 rating. This reflects Hancocks Disney roots. This keeps it close to a warm fuzzy family film.Still, the movie preserves the message of creating hope for those with out it. Bullock's character dominates the film, hence the academy award. Everyone in the cast does well with the script they are given & Quinton Aaron deserves a lot of credit in how he plays Oher. He portrays a troubled & despaired young man very well. You can almost see his inner struggles in the performance.",

            "review_title": "Good Story, But Not Worth 2+ Hours Of Your Life",
            "content": "I haven't seen this movie in 4 years. The last time I remember seeing this movie was when I was on a Cross Country team at college before a Cross Country race, just watching a motivational movie. I saw the whole movie one other time at the movie theater earlier and while my parents own a copy, it's not a movie I'd put on if I wanted a movie night. I think this movie is way too overrated. Before I talk about the cons for this movie, I'll talk about the pros. It's by all means a good story, I mean it would be somewhat interesting to read an article about the true story from the movie. It's interesting to think of the real story of Michael Oher, now a professional football player. I hope this doesn't count as a spoiler, but since it's based on a true story and we frequently hear this movie being referenced in pop culture, I'm sure almost all of us are aware that this movie is about, A black guy who went from being homeless, to being adopted by a rich Christian Caucasian family, and with his football skills, Oher eventually becomes a famous football player. Other pros for this movie, is it is somewhat nice to see a normal looking community and normal family activities. Bullock also did a great job playing Leigh Anne Tuohy. It's also a great Christian story, seeing how Oher goes into a Christian Private School, and how a Christian family welcomes him over. So, a very positive act done by a Christian family. But, here are some of the cons from this movie. A lot of the story has to do with what I wrote above, and while there is more to it than what I mentioned and could be summarized, the movie is a little over 2 hours long. It would have been better if it were just cut down to an hour and a half to explain Michael Oher's story. From what I remember, a lot of the scenes in the movie are slow showing how a family accepts Oher into their family, just showing typical family life and football games/practices where not many interesting things happen, at a slow pace. What else is also annoying about this movie, is it seems like the characters in this movie are obsessed with Michael Oher. I mean in almost every scene Oher isn't in, the characters from the school administrators to Sandra Bullock are basically just talking about Oher as if they had nothing else or nothing better to talk about. Now to mention a few other cons, a lot of us agree that S.J. is an annoying kid which is true. SJ really seems to look up to his adopted brother Oher, we could have gotten to know S.J. a little better other than those details, like school. Let's talk about S.J.'s sister, Collins. She's a character we hardly get to know. She doesn't seem to care at all or mind how the mom just invites some random guy over at their house too live with them and eventually adopt him, like she wouldn't care if her mom did or didn't do what she did. From what I remember, we did not get to know the Dad, Sean Tuohy too well either. The movie seemed mostly about Leigh Anne Tuohy and Michael Oher, and then the next main character S.J. So, the movie shows typical slow family activities of the life of a guy who became a great football player. It's not something that I'd think most people would want to spend two hours of their life watching. There's a 2+ hour movie that came out months later that is also a more motivational movie, a movie with more motivational action scenes, a more funny movie, and not to mention the main character in that movie is black like in this movie. The movie I'm referring to is Karate Kid. I feel like Karate Kid is a much better film and should have earned more money than The Blind Side as I feel like there's a lot more interesting things to Karate Kid from the scenes in China, to showing Martial Arts. However, that movie did do really well in the cinemas, but not as well as Blind Side as Blind Side made over $250 Million. There was even a good inspirational story which I feel like is a better story than this that also shows a Christian's faith which came out a little over a year later called, Soul Surfer. I feel like that story is more motivational and inspirational. One other movie I once saw with my Cross Country team is Cool Runnings. The main characters in that movie are Jamaican and it's a great story showing Jamaican guys making the first Jamaican bobsled team, it's also more funny too and fast paced to watch. So, I'm just saying that a lot of these things in this movie aren't worth so much of your time and Hollywood seems to make a big deal about Bullock's performance and of this inspirational true story. I give this movie a 4/10.",

            "review_title": "The Blind Side is how Political Correctness can blind one's judgment...",
            "content": "Wow, can you imagine the nerve of John lee Hancock! How dare he portrays a family of good Christians, of wealthy people without any problems and expressing a strange and mutual feeling called love! Can you believe there's also a big African-American kid from an impoverished neighborhood, abandoned by a drug-addicted mother... only to be saved by the knights in white shining armor! And don't get me started on the sappy, schmaltzy, happy ending where they're all celebrating his entry In National Football League.\nWell, it's all based on a true story! But still, to pile up so many insults to political correctness and combine them into one movie!!! Now, I'll stop the rant. In case you hadn't noticed, I was being sarcastic. Now, let's be serious and consider what \"The Blind Side\" is truly about.There are two ways to look at the sports biopic: a succession of clich\u00e9s serving the images of good white savior, and giving a subtle unnoticeable flavor to the infamous \"Uncle Tom\" (some even felt Magical White Negro vibes in the performance of Quinton Arron as Michael Oher) OR you can just enjoy it as a touching movie praising values like love and family, and showing that sometimes, it's not about the ethnic background but the level of violence you've been raised within and that inevitably condition your chances of a successful life. In other words, the rich socialite Leigh Anne Tuohydidn't adopt Mike because he was black, but because he was cold, hungry and in clear need for help. His ethnic race had no more relevance than his size.Speaking of his size, many viewers have criticized the prospect of making him play football, but this isn't an aspect where the Tuohy family had a role to play. The football premise is set-up when one of his friend's father introduces him to the football coach of Wingate Christian school Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon), the coach is impressed by his size but \"Big Mike\" can't enter the team without good semesters' grades. It's during his struggle to find a way with studies that his life path leads to an encounter with Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). She didn't use him to satisfy some football- related ambitions but let's just be fair and accept that the guy was also born to play football, if not for his size, but for his wonderful protective instinct. Not to mention that he found something to do with his life and that brought joy to thousands of fans.So give the film a break, it's just about the way loving and caring determine one's path. Take two singers with equal talents, Celine Dion and Whitney Houston, look at the two men of their lives and how each singer ended, it has nothing to do with race, Houston might have had more talent than Dion but her life partner was trash and look how it ended up affecting her, Dion could count on the indivisible love of her husband Ren\u00e9.That's all. The whole \"Blind Side\" story revolves around the importance of family and love as drivers, even religion is as secondary as race, it is cleverly used as the \"marketing\" asset behind Mike's recruiting but the film doesn't try to make 'market' it. I'm not surprised by the critics though but they should really pass over people's heads. Quinton Aaron was also criticized but he stroke me more as someone with a capability to listen and whose first reaction after a gesture of love was to be surprised by it because he's not used to. But he doesn't refuse a gesture of love, he smiles and nods. Many times, I expect the film to play the cynical card or inject some conflict but I loved how smoothly it went, how everyone in that family respected and loved Mike, even Lily Collins didn't play the awkward or jealous teenager but was rather sweet and open-minded. Well, little SJ (Jea Head) got on my nerves a few times, but I loved how he negotiated with all the football coaches, the kid meant business! And finally, there's Sandra Bullock in her Oscar-winning role.What I liked about her performance is the way she never overplays it, it could almost pass as a one-note performance until you get the idea that this is woman who must maintain a facade of cold formality and yet finds the proper way to communicate her feelings toward a kid with a totally opposite background, but that's her power, she knows exactly what language to speak and put some people in their place, she's really one cool mom.It's a good comedic role and very entertaining, which makes the more dramatic moments powerfully resonant.There comes a point where the film questions the motives of Leigh Anna and allows Mike to have a rebellious moment, but if you know the real history, you won't be surprised that it's a feel-good movie, which is quite rare from movies that are not comedies. It's a good old traditional family picture that can be enjoyed on a second watching and a third, it it somewhat superficial but not in a bad away, the film doesn't just try to be some grandstanding hymn to tolerance but keeps it simple and straight and humorous.The film was also nominated for Best picture, its second nomination, forcing the Academy to revise their criteria, it was in 2009 and I still remember how surprising the line up was, but retrospectively, there's something Best Picturesque about \"The Blind Side\", once you decide to cut the PC vision and look at it for what is is, a nice and tender family movie, touching, heart-warming and funny.So let's not be blinded by the whole PC conspiracy agenda.",

The plot is basically about this big black guy named Micheal Oher who had no future in life, getting a second chance when he get adopted into a rich white family. And he is like a big harmless teddy bear and he takes advantage of his size to get accepted into good schools and making a career out of playing football.

            "content": "No one seems to make mention of the fact that Ms. Sandra Bullock, former America's sweetheart has been in a slump...a major slump going back as far as 2000 when Miss Congeniality tore up the screen. 2009 was absolutely her glorious comeback with the clever and fun \"The Proposal\" and this, which will likely be considered her greatest role of her career. This film is her Eric Brockovich. Is that an overstatement? Yes. Is the film brilliant? No. Its not even particularly unique but what it is is fun, heart warming, touching, fun, entertaining, sad and based on a truth...all making it incredibly popular and it would seem as though it has caught on like wildfire. I think the true charm of The Blind Side is that it can appeal to absolutely everyone. Male and female, young and old, children, families and adults. Everyone will find something to relate to in this film. It touches all the right chords and has a really great and charismatic cast that all work wonderful together. If you walk out of this film with dry eyes I doubt you have a heart. Its a rarity for critics and the film viewing public to both see eye to eye when it comes to an emotional sweet film so all power goes to The Blind Side.As mentioned Sandra Bullock leads the cast as headstrong southern woman Leigh Anne Tuohy. Having seen the real Leigh Anne in interviews I can say that Bullock nails the character. She is an outspoken and strong and you just can't take your eyes off this performance, precisely why she is now looking at an Oscar nomination. Honestly I think that the Academy felt nominating a people's favorite would make the awards popular again but either way Bullock deserves praise for a solid role. If I hadn't seen Tim McGraw in an interview I would condemn him slightly for taking a back seat compared to everyone else in the cast. McGraw is a good actor and could easily hold his own in the film and he's a pleasure to watch but he just isn't front and center but as he said that was exactly the intention because the forefront characters need to be Bullock and Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher. Aaron gives a powerful performance. He's quiet and somber and his entire character is just incredibly touching. If anyone could bring this story to life with emotion Aaron has done it. Jae Head and Lily Collins are terrific supporting members of the cast as the Tuohy children. I think this will do some amazing things for both of their young careers.Director and writer John Lee Hancock hasn't really had enormous success but having seen a couple of his previous films he has a passion and perhaps this is finally reflective of that passion. He clearly got an incredible cast to work with. On the surface the film really isn't anything groundbreaking. An inspirational sports story? A story about a loving family that takes in a troubled youth? A strong woman fighting for what she believes in? You could likely name a few dozen films easily that encompass this plot. But the heart within the film shines through. The true story will melt your heart and if you get the opportunity to see any of the real people from this story you'll understand just where all that heart comes from. Some critics and reviewers and things you will hear will make The Blind Side sound like the most brilliant film of the year and I would never go that far but it is incredibly entertaining and just very lovely. Definitely worthwhile and sure to please millions and millions of fans as it has already done. A must see!! The perfect family film or for anyone and everyone who likes to be moved by a movie. 9/10",

To me this is the only reason she won so big name studios made her a cash cow, no matter what she dose she will fill their pockets, and honestly this movie is no different.If you saw the trailer you seen the movie...at least an hour into it I mean there are no surprises in it, it's not that interesting either. Being honest almost no one knows who Michael Oher is, this movie is focused to make Sandra Bullock look good, besides her real life counter part looks nothing like Bullock in real life she is not near as attractive as Sandra is in the movie. What I can say good about it is that Bullock plays a genuine Christian who actually dose what the bible says we should do, and if the undertone of this movie is we should help other well I'm cool with that, but the problem with this movie is there is no real conflict other that having this kid get good grades so he can play football, if you think it was when he was applying for collage and he was interrogated on why this people were helping him and influence him to go to this particular collage and by that point the movie is almost over...SO WHAT nobody watching this movie is convince on that fact it's not like we get the ACTUAL story anyways, you can ask if he was skinny and weak would Bullock would pick him up...don't know and probably will never get the straight answer.I don't think she deserves the Oscar well maybe just maybe for Gravity but not for this movie.",

Being based on fact helped even less, as I expected a tedious sports movie. The only draw card for me - sort of - was Sandra Bullock.Well, 'The Blind Side' proved me wrong! I ended up loving this movie! I was never bored, and the film had my full attention from beginning to end. It was also a lot funnier than expected. (No, it's not a comedy but there are a few very funny moments).Sandra Bullock stars as Leigh Anne Tuohy, a successful interior designer. Her husband is Sean Tuohy, who owns a few restaurant franchises. Their children are Collins and S. J (or Sean jr.), who go to Briarcrest Christian School, where Michael Oher (or Big Mike) has just been enrolled - against the better judgment of the school staff, believing him to be academically challenged.Michael is a gentle giant who doesn't talk much, and doesn't mingle with the other students - or rather, they have no interest in mingling with him. One night Leigh Anne takes pity on Michael when she sees him walking in the cold and rain. The family takes him to their home, and having nowhere else to go, Michael soon becomes a part of the family. Michael would eventually find his love for football - in part also thanks to Leigh Anne, who motivated him.'The Blind Side' is an inspirational, uplifting, compassionate and humanitarian film with a strong message. I never thought I would enjoy the movie as much as I did. The performances from the entire cast was very good. 13-Year old Jae Head was awesome as S. J. Quinton Aaron also delivered a moving performance as Michael. I thought Sandra Bullock also did a fantastic job in a serious role. 'The Blind Side' was a pleasant surprise.",

(So why spend $10 on it?)The actor cast as Oher did not look intimidating enough (as he is initially portrayed in the book) to pull off the unlikely transition that is the key to this true story so I thought this would be Leigh Anne Touhy's story due to all the press about Sandra Bullock's performance in it.I was wrong. Oher is the main character & Quinton Aaron proved more than capable of portraying this complex young man as I remember him in Michael Lewis's excellent prose. BUT it is also the Touhys' family story as well & Bullock well deserves the Oscar nom she is likely to get. Unfortunately for her & the movie it may too down-home-value oriented for her to get the statue.The movie is schmaltzy, a bit corny & pushes some obvious emotional buttons (things I typically hate in a movie) but John Lee Hancock & his players never push too hard. The true story itself is incredible. The movie's makers know this & are smart enough not to over sell it --in fact they actually pull back from a scene on the football field that Lewis described in further detail when Oher finally decides enough is enough.If you liked REMEMBER THE TITANS (which pushed buttons much further & got away with it) then you'll love this movie.

While it is true that The Blind Side does exactly that at times, it was still a film that did not need to be as good as it was. The writing and directing for the most part was bearable, and actually some lines were very well written, as well as some scenes. I though the film was actually not as melodramatic as others of this type are, and actually funnier and more entertaining than I would have thought. This is not an incredible film, but it does tell the incredible journey of Michael Oher very well. It was actually very moving at times, and for that, props since that is it's job. I actually thought the film had a lot in common with another Oscar-nominated film, Precious. The performances in this film are good, and this IS Sandra Bullock's film. I doubt she thought she would get any awards or an Oscar nomination for her role when she did it, and that is a good thing because sometimes some performances are just screaming 'OSCAR'!. While I would like it if Meryl Streep won her 3rd Oscar already, and while I do think she is the best of the nominees, Sandra Bullock would actually be a close second because she brings to life the incredible presence and personality of Leigh Anne Tuohy. I really did think she was remarkable, and I would not be angry at all if she won the Oscar for this. Overall, this is a moving, very entertaining and very likable film, and better and not as over-the-top or melodramatic as you would expect.",

            "content": "'The Blind Side' is a wonderful portrayal of a heartwarming true story about football player Michael Oher and his family, especially his mother. At first glance it might look like one of those underdog makes it big type stories but this movie is just so much more. We are shown step by step the difference that the kindness Leigh Ann and her family contribute to Mike's growth and success. This is a family who selflessly took a child into their home to provide him shelter for one night. That night stretched into two and then three and then he was living with them.What Leigh Anne Touhy and her family did was admirable to say the least and Sandra Bullock does a phenomenal job portraying her. I've often thought that Hollywood wasn't giving her enough roles to prove that she's a versatile actress. With films like 'Crash', 'Infamous' and 'The Blind Side' she has shown that she can do both comedic and intense roles excellently. Quinton Aaron is impressive as Oher while Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates are superb. I also liked child actor Jae Head's acting as the slightly mischievous, funny and friendly S.J. Lily Collins's Collins is far from the clich\u00e9d jealous daughter.John Lee Hancock cleverly downplays many elements such as using dialogues with less words and yet they speak volumes. He avoids syrupy moments and clich\u00e9s. He does bring up issues like racial and class differences but the film doesn't dwell on those nor does it attempt to makes a social commentary.This inspirational film is first and foremost about kindness. 'The Blind Side' shows how an act of kindness can change someone's life and even turn it upside down. If others followed Leigh Ann's footsteps this world would become a much better place.",

I never really thought much about this until I saw that this was nominated for Best Picture and Best Actress. I wish I saw this film back in theaters, because this film is so good.This is the true, inspirational story based on the life of first-round NFL draft pick Michael Oher. This film tells the story of how he was living on the streets and a kind, Christian family let him into their family.Sandra Bullock give is one heck of a performance. This film is definitely her best film. She gives substance to her character and also portrays her as fearless. I just loved that scene where she is talking to the gangsters as if she is the boss. The other actors such as Tim McGraw, the young Lily Collins, and Quinton Aaron all did a fantastic job.Overall, this is a very powerful, inspirational drama. I seen critics blast this film because it is too racist or too religious. I would throw that out the window and watch this film if you haven't. It's very good. I rate this film 9/10.",

            "content": "If you love inspirational plot lines, small but important twists, innocent humor and elements of racial prejudice, then this is the film for you. However, if you do not tolerate small amounts of tasteful violence, are a young child, or just don't have much of a heart, then this movie probably isn't your cup of tea. So my opinion of this film is that it's a perfect balance of happy and serious to make for a remarkable re-enactment of a true story. Sandra Bullock shows a whole new side to her acting abilities with her spot on southern accent, and heartwarming punctuality. Behind her at first seemingly hard and cold front, you quickly come to realize, is a sweet Christian lady, who has much more empathy than she would ever let on. This film is made even better with the well known faces of Lily Collins and Tim McGraw as part of the Tuohy family. The inspirational variation of social economic status and racial prejudice adds diversity and relatability to the film. Michael Oher's sad and dangerous past really touches you, and makes LeAnne Tuohy realize that there is a large social gap, and the impacts it can have. Some might say that the film had too much violence, and may have been too intense at parts. But, these scenes were very necessary to feel empathy and emotion towards Michael and others like him, that lived like that. The beautifully placed humor, and Sandra Bullock and Jae Head's personalities, really made the film. It lightened the mood of the seriousness of many situations, and just made you feel good about what was going on. The look into different social economic situations gives you a feeling of gratitude and privilege, that really makes you feel compassion towards Michael. Others might feel that the background and buildup to Michael and his football career is slow, and uneventful. But these events build a story in your mind to how Michael lives. It gives you a strong impression of what his life was like, and why his life is like the way it is now. It's an important part of understanding Michael Oher and his sad story. So I urge you, if you love inspirational stories of football and breaking the social economic status, then you will love this movie. If you like seeing how someone so broken can accomplish so much, then this is for you. Don't waste your time with made up films about aliens, enjoy a very touching and remarkable re-enactment of an edifying true story.",

IMO that gives the Oscar Award a complete different value: Sandra Bullock played her role just like any other before! There was really nothing new, Special or extraordinary. Please think of Leonardo DiCaprio, it took him Ages to win an Oscar and he did so many different roles with a much wider Performance.Anyway, as a European this movie shocked me to be honest.\nThe movie started so nice, everyone was nice, everything turned out good, no arguements fell, no agression, no doubts or rethinking of decisions. I waited the whole movie to the Point where the Boy hits someone, steals or something dramatic would happen. It just didn't. Well yeah, when he went back in his Hood - this was quite realisitc. More of this needed to happen, to make this movie into something that has to do with real human Feelings.This movies had 2 sides: Fantasy and reality.\nThe Fantasy side was obviously the White Family, living the dream, picking up a stray black Boy from the street, try to adopt him, making him into whatever they think is good for him without asking. Leigh Ann was a saint, she was beautiful and had perfect Kids. She managed everything so stepford wifish, it was creepy.\nThe Reality side was Michael. I work with drug addicted children who already have lived on the streets. How they descibed his life, losing his home, brother and mother and father, everything that happened to him, beeing in High School but not able to read and write correctly - yes! That is absolutly possible and happens often. Could have been a White Kid also.\nNon realitstic however was his behaviour. Having experienced so much pain, loss and bonding issues this kid is unlikely to just be Kind and nice.Now let me rant: Oh Gosh! What was it with this stupid Thing about his intelligence: he has no IQ but his skills in protecting are at 95% - lets make him a Football Player. What?\nAlso, the husband? Please - he owns Tacco Bell, KFC and I dunno what, brings home millions of Money but the wife just decides everything. This men has no rights whatsover in this Family. I feels it is all about Leigh Ann and showing how good she is. It really made me cringe so often. I just could not enjoy this cool Story made so stereotypically.\nThe worst really was one of the last Scenes. Leigh Ann read out some newspaper Storys about missing children or a child beeing killed on the streets. She was greatful to god that is wasn't her child, she smiled and thanked god.\nLord! It still was someones child! That left me really angry when the cedits rolled.",

            "content": "The Blind Side is an excellent drama based on a true story with exceptional performances by the cast. This film is about Michael Oher a homeless teenager who went on to become a first round NFL draft pick of the Baltimore Ravens for left tackle in 2009. Writer/Director John Lee Hancock is admirable in bringing Michael's true story to the big screen that was much better than expected and it left me feeling entertained from beginning to end. It has a compelling coming of age story with a nice balance between drama and humor. Sandra Bullock turns in one of her best performances as Leigh Ann Tuohy and I for one believe she deserved the Oscar she won for the role. She's proved in every movie despite it's flaws her talent as an actress and this one is no different. Bullock plays Leigh Ann who through an act of kindness takes in a homeless teenage African-American, named Michael \"Big Mike\" Oher played effectively by Quinton Aaron. I haven't seen him anything before but I thought Aaron was equally impressive as Michael a poor teenager looking for something he's never had before; a family. Bullock, Aaron, and the rest of the cast had nice chemistry with each other on screen making their growing friendships believable. Tim McGraw turned in a solid performance as Leigh's husband Sean who becomes a surrogate father to Michael. I haven't seen McGraw in too many movies either but he still gives a good performance none the less. The rest of the cast including Lily Collins as Leigh's daughter Collins, Ray McKinnon, and Kim Dickens are effective as the supporting characters. Jae Head as Leighs son S.J. was the stand out who like the rest of his family forms an unbreakable bond with Michael. Jae Head impressed me with his performance whether it was acting like a drill sergeant while training Michael or demanding full access to him while he's in college. He provides the film with some great comic relief and his dialog delivery makes it that much funnier. He also had genuine chemistry with Aaron (Bullock, McGraw, and Collins) in their scenes together. Well done. Kathy Bates shows up in a small role as Mike's tutor Miss Sue and she does what her brief part requires. I heard this film was good but it surpassed by expectations. Besides some characters who aren't really developed (Bates) and a few predictable moments. Overall the good more than outweighed the bad because I enjoyed The Blind Side. I became invested in the main characters and the story which made the 128 minutes running time move at a steady pace. The moments of humor are executed perfectly mostly from Jae Head's great comic timing. I'll admit I wasn't expecting much but after watching this I can see why many people including critics liked it. If you're in the mood for an inspirational true to life story with drama, humor, and solid performances by the cast (Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron, and especially Jae Head), you can't go wrong with the Blind Side. It has everything you could ever want and expect from one of this films. Give the Blind Side a chance. It was much better than anticipated.",

They have a beautiful daughter named Collins played by Lily Collins at the age of 20. The character is younger. Collins is on the volleyball team and her outfit is cute. The mother played by Sandra Bullock has distinguishing and beautiful recognizable features. I know it is Sandra in films without much time needed to look. The mom was a cheerleader back in high school. Collins also later is shown cheerleading in a pretty outfit.She has a younger brother and the boy is very cute and funny. After the volleyball game the mother instructs the daughter on what to do for showering. The mom warns her son not to go into the girls' locker room again. There is also a cute moment when he begs his mom to let Michael and him go buy a game. He insists that Michael can drive and he does it in such an adorable manner, gesturing towards Mike.The mom played by Sandra Bullock walks up to the coach and when she is walking back, all the males gaze at her figure. Considering they are in high school and the mom is way older than them, I found that interesting.There is this scene when the mother is out with her three girlfriends, eating expensive salad. The women laugh over the Christmas card because there is a coloured person on it. The family is Irish and they point out Mike's big body that towers over them. The mom is firm that she will not allow them to look down on Michael.One of the women asks the mom if she is worried about her daughter as there is a big, black male in her home. This makes me so angry because first of all...what does him being black have to do with anything?! Also it is not just females who could get assaulted, males can as well. Females can also be assaulters.Mike has very strong protectionist skills as shown on his test results. Movies tend to use consistent language or terms and for this movie it was \"tits\". The coach tells Mike where to grab and uses the word and the mom tells how Mike was taken to a titty bar. He did not like it and he does not like scary movies either.When Mike goes back to his mom's home area with his adopted mom, the black men all stare at the mom. I find this so relatable and awkward. I really hate it. They make comments about her appearance. The mom looks uncomfortable to be walking in the area and she has never been there before. Her holding her purse and walking confidently is very brave.Mike goes back to his mom's home later alone. He meets a black man who persuades him to go down and chill where there is music playing in a basement. Black people are all having a small party where they are sitting and enjoying themselves. One of the black men ask him about his new mom and sister. He makes degrading comments and asks if he has tapped the daughter yet. Mike stays quiet and they laugh, saying Mike got a piece. Mike gets angry and tells him to shut up.Off to college Mike goes after deciding to choose the college his adopted family has all gone to. The mom tells Mike how there will always be that one person who is on the Internet all night and others he will come across who have annoying habits. He smiles and checks out two girls walking by. The dad says he is going to definitely have a fun time. The dad, Mike and son check out the girls. The mom tells Mike she wants him to have fun but she will be upset if he gets a girl pregnant. Mike and Collins laugh without other expressions.",

            "content": "This is an excellent film to watch with the whole family, as it conveys a very pertinent and edifying message of integration and overcoming. Based on real facts, it tells the story of Michael Oher, a young black teenager, of enormous stature, who has a big heart and a great dose of kindness and patience. However, he lacks a family: he came from humble beginnings, from a broken family and from a problematic neighborhood, and life did not allow him to study and, therefore, he has no education. Thanks to his potential for rugby, he is admitted to a school for the rich and receives a scholarship. There he will meet a very wealthy family, with whom he will have a friendship, remarkable for him and for everyone in that house.The film is so tender and full of goodness that it sometimes sounds almost like a fairy tale. It is not easy, nowadays, to find people as well-intentioned as that family, nor to see young people who have Oher's life path and have never felt revolt or suffered with the temptation of a life of marginality. It is truly touching, and the story told wins our hearts quickly. Technically, it is a discreet film, which leaves all the space for the story told and for the good interpretation of the cast. However, we can admire the excellent cinematography, a very well done edition and good visual and sound effects.The cast, in fact, is an essential part of the charm of this film. First of all, for the superb performance of Sandra Bullock in the role of Leigh Anne, the matriarch of the family. With a willful, strong and energetic spirit, she is a woman of fiber and courage who defends her family and what she has faith with all her energy, and Bullock is perfect for playing women with such a dose of personality. She won, with this film, the Oscar for Best Actress, and deserved it with all the merits. Quinton Aaron was also quite good in the role of the gigantic Michael Oher, however Bullock robs him of all the role whenever she appears on the scene. Jae Head is a good addition and brings an additional dose of tenderness to the film. Tim McGraw and Lily Collins do what is necessary, but they do not stand out much more than what is required.",

            "content": "From 2009 to the present day, I wrote off The Blind Side like it was nothing. I've never been a big football fan even though it is the most popular sport in the United States and I just got tired of all the praise that this film got. As with any film though, The Blind Side can't be judged until it's watched. It offers like a dozen things that seems to come out of nowhere and it's very likable indeed. An overall great film.Based on a true story, The Blind Side follows around homeless teen Micheal Orr (Quinton Aaron) who never grew up with parents who were there for him and who's really got nothing going for him. Like a billet family, Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) take Micheal in and raise him in a proper home that he never had. They show him the ways of life and Michael ends up turning into a football star through it all.It sounds exactly like a football film but it also has the elements of family, how to do well in school and also how to channel violence in the right way. Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw play perfect parents and Bullock's work here won her the Best Supporting Actress Oscar Award in 2010. Collins (Lily Collins) and S.J. (Jae Head) play the kids of the family and both come off as unexpectedly good and add fun and humor to the film.Another reason this cannot be considered just a full football film is the racial issues touched on here. This part of the story is of a African-American teenager trying to live in the South where we know it can be hard and the film tries to deliver the message that everybody is the same regardless of the color of your skin. I think this is one of the important messages in this world today and it is always nice when a film touches on this.Once we get to the football scenes, we can't stay it's bad either. It's typical in the sense that it shows the character Michael Orr developing a toughness that wasn't there before. It also adds a football flavor to an already packed film and it is fun to watch cameos from college football coaches Nick Saban to Lou Holtz. Don't expect any good acting from these coaches but that is to be expected and the quality of the acting by the cameos is kind of beside the point anyway.The Blind Side is a majestic, heartfelt and insightful film that would work perfectly for the Relationship classes that are now taught in High School and College. The film is mostly for teenagers but also for the whole family too. Expect a tearjerker though.",

Winner of Best Actress at the Oscars back in 2009 the movie is based on a true story about a man named Micheal Oar who was later brought off by Social Workers from his cracked addict mother along with his brother as it was unsafe for himself and his brother to stay their with her.Fast forward a few years later and Micheal has moved on with his troubled past and is living with a man who helped him get into some sort of Catholic school,but he later tragically died and Micheal has no where else to go as he always runs away from his foster family. Enter Leanne Tuohy played by the brilliant Sandra Bullock who's children Collins and her son Sean Jr attend the same school as Micheal goes to.Micheal of course is struggling with his homework and the teachers sorta give him a hard time as they think that's dumb but his actually not dumb at all. Being such a headstrong housewife she stumbles across him walking in the rain and heading back to the Gym,she demands Micheal where his going and he says to the Gym,but she refuses a No from him and decides for him to stay with her and her doting husband Sean played by former Country Western Singer Tim Mcgraw who I must admit was barely recognizable without his hat and his beard.With Leanne's help Micheal soon becomes an international American Football Player for his school and fights for winning.SO why is this my all time favourite live action movie,well its because of the story I absolutely love the story to this as it moves you and you can sorta root for the charcthers. Sandra Bullock was brilliant as Leanne Tuohy even though she looked hardly noticeable because of her blonde hair which sorta looks alright on her,as for the rest of the cast there brilliant too including Quinton Aaron who is a newcomer as he plays the American Football Player Micheal Oar. The editing was great I see absolutely nothing wrong with this film its one of those movies where you can watch over and over again. Tangled,and A Walk To Remember are also my all time favourite movies so its a privilege to add The Blind Side to my list of all time favourite movies. A lot of people love that film The Shawshank Redemption but for me nah its not my cup of tea but The Blind Side is a brilliant movie.10/10",

She is so consistently good in her movies, even if some of the movies are poor, that it's time she had an Oscar anyway. It was amusing she had a Raspberry at the same time but so what? I'm looking forward to seeing All About Steve too - our local cinema pulled it because they had \"too many other movies to show and it was a turkey,\" they said. I said I'd have liked the chance to find out, thanks, and I don't believe anything Bullock does can be that bad....She took that Raspberry with her usual good humour and charm, what could do better than that to promote it? I don't have a lot to say about the story of Blind Side because everyone's said it already. It's a wonderful, heartwarming, feel-good movie. So nice to see Bullock in a \"normal marriage situation\" instead of struggling with a nasty husband/partner who doesn't appreciate her or treats her like dirt as is the case in some of her movies. Beyond that, it's all about the talented but neglected boy who needs love and help and my how he repays it big time. So good to hear this was based on a true story, I'd like to read the book sometime. A movie to savour and see again. I can't comment on the football, it isn't what we play over here in England and anyway I don't like football at the best of times, but each to their own, it's clearly a popular and lively game and you don't really need to know how it works to enjoy the movie.

Sandra Bullock, while strong, does not have a single Oscar moment in this film that blew me away. The first half is very well-executed, the second to a lesser extent. I do not think this deserved its Best Picture nomination over (500) Days of Summer, Star Trek, or Crazy Heart, but it is an uplifting tale about the fascinating sport of football.

            "content": "Everyone involved in this film's production must have been at the very peak of their game- no pun intended- because the movie fires on all cylinders and continues to do so after every genuinely earned laugh, genuinely earned tear, and genuinely earned ear-to-ear smile. In fact, that is a better \"Summary\" for this film- genuine. The adjective works. I found myself entranced by the humor the writer injected into the dialogue and banter interspersed between a poignant biographical drama. I found myself astounded at what great cinema can achieve- a panoramic, lyrical look at race at an individual level, and what one individual's kindness and love can transform in another's life. All in all, a film that reminds you how the truest stories are the ones that leave you speechless, with eyes watering.Above all, Bullock absolutely won me over. She takes the film not only to another level, but to a Best Actress nomination for herself, and perhaps even a Best Picture nod. Her acting is subtle, understated brilliance, yet hard and powerful when she needs to be. Actresses like Kate Winslet and Julianne Moore could even- WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT!?- take a lesson here- in places where Bullock could have cried, could have shouted, could have done any number of Hollywoodized set pieces, she restrains herself and lets the story, and the life of her character, tell this story. I will be very surprised if she doesn't get, at the very least, a nomination. She certainly deserves it. Kudos!",

You would be right, but this is a fresh or refreshing movie, if judged against that context. The film features knockout performances from it's black lead, another reason there's such a high pool of black acting talent about. Big Mike, we'll call em, though he doesn't like it, has grown up tough in his environs. Currently living on the street, at the request of a friend, where we're not really sure if he's the father, he's accepted into college. A gifted athlete, yet no intellectual, his grade point average close to nought, Big Mike,we see can shoot basketball hoops more than I can wolf down Krispy Kremes. He's taken in by a woman- a school sponsor, where he becomes part of Bullock's warm wonderful family. Bullock who's pushy character kind of irritated me a little, does shine, in her pinnacle worthy Oscar nominee moment. This inspiring film you enjoy, the more it progresses. It'll surprise you and grow on you, like Bullock's little son and very familiar Malcolm In The Middle face. Don't be blindsided and pass this one off. Film could of done with a better title and Collins, what sort of name is that for a girl, which had me initially thinking one of Bullock's too.",

            "content": "With a gross of over $290 Million, The Blind Side made 10 times it profit from it's budget $29 Million. It became one of the most successful sports films ever and appealed to new cinema crowd, the Bible-belt, middle America crowd.The Blind Side tells the story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a poor African-American teenager from Memphis whom mum was drug-addict and he slept on the sofa of a family friend. He was enrolled into a private Christian School, with the promise that he could make a good American football player, but lacks the academic ability. After being kicked out from the projects, Michael is taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her family. They give him a home and adopt the man out of Christian charity. When Michael's grades pick up and he shows his skills as a player some top universities show interest in giving him a scholarship: but he still needs to raises his grades to ensure he can get into university.The main reason why The Blind Side succeeded with the Christian crowd was because it shows a Republican, Christian family in a positive light. They were shown as a family who took in Michael because it was they Christian ideal of charity (the better aspects of Christianity). Bullock plays Leigh Anne as a hard-as-nails, tough mother, protecting her family and is shown as a more liberal minded Republican. This was a film that also shows how rich white suburban community are completely segregated from the poor inner-city, predominately black areas, with two different cultures. The acting in the film was decent, with Bullock being the stand out performers, winning herself her first Oscar. Whilst her performance is good showing herself to feisty, yet funny, it was not the best of the year: I think Saoirse Ronan was the best performer in her role in The Lovely Bones. Aaron was decent as the gently giant, a person who is shy but has an inter-depth: but his character is a clich\u00e9.John Lee Hancock writes and directs this film. Whilst the direction is decent, pretty standard with this type of film, The Blind Side follows a typical formula, with Michael improving his grades, starting out in American Football, improving at American Football, attempting to get into university and a final ordeal. There are montage scenes and some elements of the film felt similar to previous American Football films like We Are Marshall and Friday Night Lights, where the team starts out poorly but quickly improve. But Hancock knows what he is doing, he does not try to be too adventurous with his direction and works well with the standard formula.The film has been met with criticism that it took the charity of a white family to allow a black person to succeed: but that was the nature of the story, there was not a lot Hancock could have done. It should be more a commentary on the situation. There was of course the theme of Christian charity in the film, but this was done one a individual level. But a problem with the film was that Michael Oher was basically a secondary character in his own film, playing second fiddle to Sandra Bullock. Whilst the film could be seen as a criticism of the state education system, where there is a lack of funding and teachers did not care. This is of course a problem with schools that are in poor inner-city areas that affect schools in many country. And that a student could improve in a private system. The message is dodgy, but there is a valid point. But a more worrying aspect of the film is the treatment of black characters. In the film there are either gang members, drug addicts or militant activists. There is no character that would be more grounded and realistic. Even Michael was shown to be stereotypical as the gentle giant who was not very academic.Overall it is what it is and a decent film for it. But it was not worthy of a best picture nod.",

A bit pat, to say the least, and doesn't provide quite the emotional payoff it needs to really make it soar, but the acting is rock solid and the fact that it's based on a true story makes it feel all the more genuine.

I'm all for inspirational films, but this one looked like an overcooked, manipulative tearjerker with Sandra Bullock stepping way outside of her comfort zone to play a Good Samaritan Southern Belle who helps a struggling black teen with a painful past. I was afraid the film would exploit or gloss over the true pains of African-Americans struggling to escape the projects. I was afraid Sandra Bullock, whose forte is romantic comedies, would annoy with an attempt at a Southern accent. I was afraid that the power of this true story would be lost in hackneyed and trite film-making.My fears were unfounded, and one cannot, it appears, judge a film by its trailer. This is one of the best mainstream films about Christians I've ever seen, possessing charm, integrity, and honesty in spades. Bullock's stab at a Southern accent, while dubious in a two-minute trailer, is actually quite convincing when viewed in the complete film. She truly loses herself in the role, and much to my surprise, I'd like to see her win an Oscar for her tough-love portrayal of a woman whose cannot help but help others. Country- music superstar Tim McGraw, as her husband, proves himself a capable actor, Granted, he doesn't have to do any heavy emotional lifting in the film, but his ability to deliver lines of dry humor was an unexpected delight. Newcomer Quinton Aaron, as the young man helped by Bullock's family, conveys a great deal of pain, sorrow, and joy with his eyes.",

            "content": "Even before this movie, Sandra Bullock was one of my favorite actresses. And not just because she is gorgeous. She looks good enough with dark hair, but being a blonde (as Leigh Anne is) doesn't make her prettier despite what most people say about blondes. She does look good enough for me to wonder if Faith got jealous, but there's much more to her here of course.I have to disagree that Bullock was the obvious choice for best actress on all the awards shows, but she certainly deserved a nomination. Some of her best moments include teaching Michael how to play football and putting Alton from the 'hood in his place. Leigh Anne is a force to be reckoned with, and she has a sarcastic sense of humor. Of course there was more to this movie than just Bullock's performance. It's an inspiring story overall, and Quinton Aaron is a wonderful gentle giant, easy to like, friendly and intelligent with a sense of humor. For someone who has been through all he has, Michael has such a good attitude.Jae Head does a great job for such a young actor. Michael's \"little brother\" is quite a standout.Tim McGraw doesn't remind me at all of the country singer. He holds his own against a strong, intelligent wife, and he's easy to like, but he knows his place.Someone else who deserves a mention: Eric Benson, #66 on the first team Michael played against. He intends to make Michael's life miserable and found out Michael was a giant creampuff. The taunts never ended until Michael learned just how deal with him, and how he did it was memorable and humorous. Michael's teachers are quite patient with him. He just needs to be taught in the way he could learn. There are lots of good performances among the Wingate faculty.Kathy Bates does a good job as Michael's tutor, but except for her horror story about the Knoxville stadium, I have to say she did slightly better in the other movie I saw her in on the same day--a humorous version of the Jesse James story.There are issues this movie hints at but doesn't deal with fully. Michael grew up in the 'hood and has an African-American heritage, and the issue of racism is touched on briefly, but there's not a lot of real conflict. Leigh Anne's friends make some insensitive comments, but they can easily be forgiven. They do have a lesson to learn.I was surprised at the TV-14 rating ABC gave this. Only a couple of violent scenes in the 'hood would be worthy of this. This is actually a family movie. Though Michael's old friends have such dirty mouths, and one word generally edited out of movies before broadcast is not in this case. While Michael has such a calm attitude, he can only be pushed so far.The obvious Oscar winner? I don't think so, but it was well worth seeing.",

            "content": "The Blind Side is fairly unusual for an entertaining film in that it succeeds as much for what it doesn't do as for what it does. This movie could have become something truly, insultingly, patronizingly offensive. Instead, it became a wonderful tale of love and human decency.Based on a true story, it's about Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a gigantic and homeless black teenager who gets taken in by a rich white family, the Tuohy's, who turn his life around and help him become a great football player. Imagine what the old sitcom Different Strokes would have been like if little Arnold (Gary Coleman) had been 6'5'', 300 pounds and stoic and that's the basic idea of The Blind Side. Michael Oher is a good young man who is lifted out of a world of abandonment, poverty and crime. First because a football coach at a expensive private school wants Oher for the team and then because the wealthy Tuohy family opens their home and hearts to him.The primary angel in Oher's life is steely Southern belle Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), who brings him into her family. In the beginning, it's almost like Oher is a stray dog that Leigh Anne is taking pity on. She doesn't think through any of the consequences of what she's doing or where it's going to lead. Leigh Anne just sees someone in need and tries to help, never expecting it to result in her gaining a new, black and enormous son. Bullock is great here. It might be the best performance she's ever given or ever will give.Tim McGraw is also very good as Leigh Anne's husband. He's a little more practical about letting Oher into their lives, but knows he can't dissuade his fierce wife when she sets her mind on something. Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher also shines in a deceptively difficult role. Stumbling out of a world of emotional trauma, Oher is not at all an expressive or dynamic character. Quite realistically, he's impassive and somewhat willfully blank to the terrible things that have happened to him. Aaron manages to make him a genuine person and not a bad knock off of Lennie from \"Of Mice and Men\".The plot is very predictable but just manages to not insult the audience's intelligence. There's both some funny and poignant dialog and the direction has a very nice pace that neither hurries nor drags. Writer/director John Lee Hancock has taken a touching true story and made a touching motion picture out of it.However, whether it's based on real life or not, having a young black man essentially rescued from the horrors of the black underclass by some rich white folks raises a lot of uncomfortable questions. Questions about race. Questions about economics. Questions about education, opportunity, white guilt, black cultural dysfunction and the list goes on and on and on. It would have been extraordinarily easy for The Blind Side to be unwatchably smarmy, condescending, preachy, manipulative and squirmingly fake. It avoids any of that by avoiding asking any of those uncomfortable questions. Viewing this film will remind you such questions exist, but it neither offers any answers nor asks the audience to come up with any. This movie isn't trying to make any broader social point. It's just tells us about a time when some good people did the right thing because it was the right thing to do and it all worked out incredibly well.I liked The Blind Side a great deal and my mom liked it even more than I did. It'll make you glad you're a member of the human race, which is a pretty amazing thing.",

            "content": "Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is a young black teenager, much older than his peers, poor and almost illiterate. He wins a school scholarship for his greatest talent: playing football. But that doesn't stop him from suffering all kinds of prejudice. The only one who pays attention to him is a little boy who is also a student at the institution. Michael becomes friends with the boy, which catches the attention of his mother, Leigh Anne Touhy (Sandra Bullock). This, in turn, ends up being touched by the boy's story and sees in him a potential not only as an athlete, but as a human being.It is the dreams that serve as fuel to move the gears of life, both individual and collective. The Blind Side, written and directed by John Lee Hancock, is largely about that. But mainly about the desires that are developing with each new minute and that start to transform into ideals, philosophies, realizations, and eventually, into collective hysteria. We have these yearnings for ourselves, then for our family, and over time they can extend to anyone who catches our attention in a more special way. It doesn't matter their size or the degree of difficulty, the important thing is to always keep running after them. It can certainly be said that \"The Blind Side\" is a film full of good intentions, but that unfortunately enters with force in the field of superficiality. The script follows the \"feel good movie\" style, a narrative model about people in search of personal accomplishments in the midst of the oppressive and not always achievable American way of life.The Blind Side is your typical Thanksgiving family drama, but it also goes beyond the stereotype by showing the points of view of lives so far apart that collided and how that clash affected the situations around them. The narrative here prefers to stay on reliable ground, showing how even in the face of difficulties it is still possible to dream. How there are good people, and how you need to trust more and distrust less. It is a film that came at the right time, reminding us that we need to have more generosity of spirit, that we are more peaceful and open to listen, observe and absorb new experiences and emotions. You have to look at the whole and not just part of the whole.However, one of the main problems of The Blind Side is focus. Apparently, the director (who is also the screenwriter) did not know how to answer a basic question: what is this film about? Well, the answer would have to be: from the life of a guy named Michael Oher. So the attention should be focused on him and not Leigh. This even seems obvious to me, after all, the film assumes itself as a biography of the player. By making Leigh the protagonist, The Blind Side turns Michael into a supporting character in his own story. It is clear that the option for an actress of the caliber and with the box office potential of a Sandra Bullock, indicates that her character was conceived as the main one from the beginning. But in this case the error is in the proposal itself, in the very concept from which it starts. The Blind Side is a critical case of a film that suffers from an identity crisis.Leigh's election as the protagonist undermines Oher's character development. Little is known about her past. We only see - in flashes - that he was taken away from his mother as a child. From the father, we hear a brief comment about his death in a car accident. We don't have any information about his childhood, who he lived with, who raised him, who his other siblings are and how much these difficulties shaped his adolescence. In certain moments of the film, it is noticed that the script creates certain situations so that we could get to know Oher in more depth. But all of them are wasted even gratuitously. At one point, Oher finds one of his brothers working as a waiter. They warmly embrace. Haven't seen each other for years. Unfortunately, the script does not realize the potential of the scene and does not even allow us to hear the words exchanged by both. Instead, the focus of the scene is on Leigh's reaction outside the restaurant. To make matters worse, the brother does not reappear in the film and the sequence is loose and without function within the plot. Later on, Oher returns home to see his mother, but he can only find his childhood friends, always surrounded by women, drinks, guns and chains around their necks. Again, nothing so deep comes out off this.The problems aren't limited to Oher's character development. The film practically does not address the theme of racism (the only mention is in a dialogue between Leigh and her friends in a restaurant), making it clear that Michael's life, after being welcomed by the Touhy family, was relatively peaceful. In addition, the script does not explore an interesting bias opened by the story, about the conflict between the Republican Leigh (at a certain point in the film, she defends President George Bush as the only one capable of putting order in a public office) and the Democrat Miss Sue (Kathy Bates), Oher's private tutor.Finally, in a story as painful as Oher's, the script's lack of dramatic conflict is impressive and uncomfortable. The children accept the figure of a new sibling without any objection. There is no hint of jealousy or mistrust. On the contrary, they see you as a new friend and welcome you with open arms. The husband, in turn, is the ultimate example of understanding and passivity. At one point, the son suffers a car accident that was driven by Oher (the scene indicates that he was partly to blame for the event) and the couple does not even think about giving him a reprimand or applying a punishment. Even worse is the investigation scene, whose anticlimactic outcome calls into question the director's own option to make use of the flashback.Despite all these problems, not everything is wrong in The Blind Side. Sandra Bullock's interpretation deserves mention. Although the Oscar received has more to do with her moment in the film industry and also with the fragility of the competitors, the actress does well in the characterization of a character who had everything to fall into the stereotype. There are no exaggerations, no faces and mouths. Bullock opted for a very low-key performance, in which less is more. This minimalist side adapts to the personality of a confident, secure woman who knows how to achieve her goals in a serene and discreet way. And Bullock still adds many subtle comic moments, which fit perfectly with the proposal.Oher is played by the unknown Quinton Aaron, who also does very well. His character is of few words, which shifts the performance to gestures and looks. And in that respect, Aaron manages to convey the necessary vulnerability and neediness. The relationship between Bullock and Aaron, which was key to the film's success, convinces and makes us, at certain times, even root for that duo. The rest of the cast does not have an exposure time that allows them to gain greater visibility. Anyway, Kathy Bates is doing as well as ever and child actor Jae Head manages to be one of the most irritating kids in recent memory. To be fair, the fault may not even be his, but the text, which insists on making him much more adult than his chronological age (there is a regrettable line in which Sean Jr., his character, demands that the director of the University, say, a special favor).With the unoriginal direction of John Lee Hancock, who innocuously follows the rules of a Hollywood drama, the film is touching, but borders on the artificial - it is made to reach the viewer's emotions. We have a love story here. Not the romantic love experienced so many other times on the big screen, but an altruistic love, which is willing to donate to others without expecting anything in return. Thus, the success that the film had in the United States is understandable, even more so knowing that it is based on the true story of the current striker for the Baltimore Ravens, told in the book The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game. A Possible Dream found in its audience that side that believes in the Greater Good, but lacks the courage to take matters into its own hands. So, it is even easier to project onto Leigh Anne Toughy the hopes of a charitable and altruistic humanity and leave the cinema believing that it is really possible to help others.Even so, some moments are so perfectly happy that they sound corny, like the scene where the two brothers train and exercise, having fun and laughing. Practically a margarine commercial. At the same time, Hancock innovates and shows all his creativity and courage in certain situations, such as the excellent first minutes, in which, in a didactic way and explaining through real scenes of a \"football\" game, he warns that we are entering a sports world admired by its directors.In the end, it can be said that The Blind Side is the remake of a series of other titles that we've seen out there and told in a better way, including. There are works that deal with baseball (The Rookie), basketball (Hoosiers, Glory Road, Coach Carter), golf (The Greatest Game Ever Played), and American football itself (Challenging Giants, Remember the Titans, Friday Night Lights, Moneyball, We're Marshall). Perhaps precisely for this reason, this characteristic of approaching something already known, explains its enormous success with the American public, but the lack of originality makes \"The Blind Side\" a film on the verge of being dispensable. Finished in a way that has become standard for current films that re-enact true events, the closing credits are accompanied by photos and videos of the family in question. Symmetrically represented, real and fictional are confused. Nothing more common in a world where real life is too good to be true.",

It is the true story of how a tough Memphis mother in a wealthy family (Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy) befriends a huge, homeless and ill-educated black man (Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher), enabling him ultimately to become a highly successfully professional American football player. Of course, outside the USA, few people will have heard of Oher or have much interest in American football. Even the title - a footballing term - is unhelpful. Furthermore, as a narrative, it has the additional problems of being slow and lacking dramatic tension.Having said all this, it is a fine performance by Bullock who has to adopt a Southern accent for a role which sees her playing a much more assertive and less cute character than is usually her wont. It won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. And, in its own way, the tale is inspirational, showing that with some tender loving care (and in this case a lot of money) the most unlikely and ill-equipped can be enabled to succeed.",

I read a few reviews on IMDb of the film before I watched it and something someone said sort of stuck and I had an altered approach to the viewing. The Blind Side is almost relentlessly upbeat and Pollyannaish. You could say the same thing about The Beatles \"All You Need is Love\" and not many people mock that song. They director manages to be unmercifully sweet without it every being corny or maudlin. It helps when whatever message you have decided to deliver is served with a heavy dose of humor. You can get away with a lot of sermonizing if you disguise it with a few jokes.What struck me about the movie, and something I thoroughly appreciated, was that race wasn't anywhere near the biggest issue. I would also rate this film as more of a comedy than a sports movie or anything else. It was truly funny.I'm sure that this movie has zero to do with the actual events of the lives of the people it claims to represent but it's a damn movie, people.

Featuring the sweet performances of Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron, The Blind Side centres on the huge-hearted story of Michael Oher's journey from being a homeless teen to an American football offensive tackle.Families with older kids will adore the film's pleasing amount of heart. The heart mainly involves the fascinating story and absorbing characters. The story touches on engaging topics such as homelessness, adoption, family and sport. These elements alongside the unquestionably beautiful portrayal of a lovely family, as well as a kind focus on an appealing message is what makes The Blind Side such an entertaining feel-good story.However, is classing it as one of 2009's best movies reasonable? Probably, but it doesn't really deserve the top spot of the list. There are some fairly uninteresting moments, especially for young children or those who have no interest, but it will be remembered as a lovely biographical sports drama. But to those with no interest in sports, don't worry, the sports scenes add an engaging message. And the message is the film's most loveable feature.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

It did a wonderful job of show casing a blessed family, blessing someone in need and changing as people along the way. I was very pleased with how well they handled the Christian ideal throughout the film so that it was clear what the Touhys morals were, yet not being preachy. I adored Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne because when I looked at her I saw my mom in every possible way... A tough cookie on the outside, but soft as snow on the inside. The young actor that played SJ captured my heart because he was so pure and sincere about everything he did. I had just wrapped up a series at my church about how it is important to remember the ways you are blessed and find ways to bless others in need so the movie fit right in with that.

Similarly, when I heard all the buzz about papaya, I decided that I just had to try some. Both of those decisions left a bad taste in my mouth.Perhaps I will post a critique of papaya on some food review site (Rotten Kumquats?), but here I must review films.Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a plucky gun-wielding mom with a lot of spunk (remember what Lou Grant said about spunk?) One day, Leigh Anne notices a behemoth named Michael Oher (played well by Quinton Aaron) walking around shivering and homeless. She invites him to stay overnight in her upscale home.Now, I don't know about most guys, but if some rich woman that looked like Sandra Bullock invited me to stay overnight in her home, I'd be there faster than a Viagra-laden Superman flying to his date with Lois Lane. However, after a few minutes of listening to Tuohy's junior- high psychology as well as enduring her general all-around annoying personality, I'd be out of there faster than Sarah Palin's ouster from a Mensa meeting.Then there's Bullock's performance itself. I don't know if it suffered from the fact that she was portraying such an irritating person. I was hoping some hulk from the football team would mistake her for a blocking sled and... well, not really. But maybe the fact that the character got under my skin so much says something about Bullock's acting.I doubt however that this is what was intended by all those involved in making this flick. But even discounting the annoying main character, John Lee Hancock's dull and tedious direction makes this movie hard to bear.And, by the way, I'm still waiting for the first great football film to be made (the best of the bunch, Jerry Maguire and Heaven Can Wait, can only marginally be considered football films).However, I wouldn't be surprised if someone has already made a movie about papaya that is more palatable than The Blind Side.",

The 46 y.o. has had her fair share of commercial hits \u2013 Speed, Miss Congeniality, The Lake House - but none of these struck gold at the box office because of her dramatic talent; she's easy on the eye and has an endearing personality. Which is why you'll be as surprised as I was when you witness Bullock acting the house down in Blind Side. Powerful, convincing and affecting, she gives her best performance to date as Leigh Anne Tuohy, even if it's not Oscar-worthy as many would have you believe. Although with the Golden Globe already in the bag, the shiny statuette could well find its way into Bullock's hands - a damn shame for Carey Mulligan who deserves the win for An Education.Getting caught up in the hype surrounding Bullock's comeback it is easy to forget that this film has so many other things working for it, least of all that at its core is an intriguing and absorbing story. Writer-director Hancock has an obvious affinity to the material and he doesn't hold back in attempting to wring every drop of emotion from it, even if occasionally a subtler approach would have been favourable. Thankfully, Hancock has crafted some tremendously touching scenes that go a long way in glossing over the seldom spill into pensive melodrama. Those who are excited about seeing some Gridiron action, a la Remember the Titans, best lower their hopes as unfortunately the movie is strangely devoid of any hearty sporting scenes \u2013 excluding a pointless training montage that'll make you cringe \u2013 which is a severe drawback.Aged 26 in real life, relative unknown Quinton Aaron plays the 16 year old Michael with a nice balance of damage and hope. Big Mike, as he's known in the 'hood, is extremely reticent and withdrawn yet we feel a close connection to him thanks to Aaron's thoughtful portrayal. Kathy Bates continues with her underdone roles of late, here not getting the screen time she deserves as a quirky tutor. Also failing is Jae Head's gregarious S.J.; Leigh Anne's young son who loves the attention his new stepbrother gains him.The content isn't quite strong enough for a runtime of 128 minutes but you'll find it hard not to be swept away by Michael's story.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",

Sandra Bullock's stance as Leigh Anne seems so false, pretended, and \"studious\" which makes an actress, simply, a character, not a part of authenticity that audience expects. The story telling a real struggle is presented as a fine family portrait, and due to that weak description it loses its dramatic sense. Although the movie is based on a real story, the points it makes are so conventional that I thought I was watching a Boys Town type narration, roughly fictional and maybe more like a part of The Visual Bible: Acts with its excessive lines. If, again, we are to analyze the movie, as a movie, not a part of real life story, we most likely ponder on the moral values that the movie covers. Leigh Anne helps a boy, and it is a favor appearing sincere and disinterested. Yet, with a deep thinking on her change after doing this favor, one can clearly observe a sense of selfishness and egoism. As a result of this help, Leigh Anne, obviously, feel happy for herself and as for his husband's, Sean Tuohy, observation it seems like a satisfaction out of helping someone. This issue, which is perhaps something to debate philosophically, annoyed me throughout the film. Other than technical and reasonable causes for helping someone, this abstruse cause of relieving yourself with someone else's deprivation bothered me most. This is again a religious drop that can be interpreted as doing something good for the prize that relieves a vassal, heaven. Yet, with the help of Quinton Aaron's performance, movie completes its biographical theme and story. Mediocrity makes this movie's possibly extraordinary story, so banal, and naturally ordinary.",

            "content": "The Blind Side is another one of those inspirational sports movies we've seen time and again. Football is the sport of choice this time as we follow the more or less true story of Michael Oher. His story is a remarkable one, a thoroughly compelling life's journey. And this movie, while nothing spectacular, does an adequate job of telling that story. What we ultimately end up with is a movie that's just entertaining enough to get by. The best sports movies have a crackling energy to them which drives the story forward. This movie, with its leisurely pace, lacks that element. Some might say that is because it's really not a sports movie at all. It's a movie about life that just happens to have some football in it. Maybe so but the movie still cries out for some excitement along the way. You may like this movie. But it's not one of those movies that makes you want to jump out of your chair and cheer. It's inspiring but in a more subtle fashion than one might expect. The movie works but it probably could have worked better.The movie tells the by now familiar story of Michael Oher's rise from a life of poverty, neglect and misery to football stardom. The story's obvious hook is that of the troubled black teen being taken in, and ultimately adopted, by a wealthy white family. A fascinating true story, one recounted pretty faithfully here by the filmmakers. A few things from the real life story have been tweaked to give the movie a little added drama but that's the way the movie business works. And the movie could use the extra drama because if there is any one failing here it is that this great story at times comes across as being a little mundane. It's that troubling lack of energy, the movie really could use a little more pep in its step.This is the Michael Oher story but the movie's star is of course Sandra Bullock playing Michael's adopted mother Leigh Anne Tuohy. It's a very good, strong-willed performance by Bullock. Nothing about the performance which absolutely screams out Oscar but there's certainly no reason to begrudge her the award. Like the movie itself you may hesitate to label her performance great but it's more than good enough. Quinton Aaron plays Michael and you kind of wish he was given more to do. He does well with what he's given to work with but there are long stretches of the movie where his character is essentially mute and appears rather bewildered. Michael Oher is often shunted to the background in the movie which purports to tell his life story. It's Bullock as Leigh Anne who's really at the heart of everything going on.While Bullock is definitely pushed front and center there is room for some other performers to make an impression. Lily Collins and Jae Head are very good in portraying the Tuohy children, with Head in particular having some memorable moments. Tim McGraw is solid if unspectacular as Leigh Anne's husband Sean, spending most of his time reacting to or getting out of the way of Bullock. Kathy Bates, Kim Dickens and Ray McKinnon do well with their respective supporting roles. And of course there's Big Mike himself. On the rare occasions Aaron is allowed to come out of his shell he's a revelation. And he does a great job in making his character utterly sympathetic, so easy to root for. But in the end, for better or worse, it's Bullock's movie. She carries it well enough to make the movie work. But you're left with the nagging sense the movie probably should have been a little better. Ultimately you're satisfied but not thrilled. It's a sports movie which comes out a winner by the slimmest of margins.",

And the love-fest ensues.If you abhor these types of films, then you might want to avoid THE BLINDSIDE. Not because all of that is in here, but because some of it is ...but only mildly. If you despise the \"great white person saving the {insert minority here} other person from certain doom\" theme, you might want to avoid this flick, too. Yes, some of that is in here, too. So why, oh why, did I rate this film so highly. Well, it's not overly schmaltzy nor overly great-white-hope-ish either. It is a (relatively) true telling of NFL star Michael Oher's early, troubled life in Memphis, Tennessee.Homeless at 16 (and without parental guidance), \"Big Mike\" is seen wandering the streets by the affluent Leigh Tuohy (Sandra Bullock, THE LAKE HOUSE) and her family. They do \"the good Christian thing\" and offer the big guy a place to sleep for the night. But as the strong, silent Michael attempts to leave the next day, Leigh decides to have him stay another night. And so goes his induction into the Tuohy family.But before he gets into the NFL, Michael (Quinton Aaron) must first pass high school and then get into college. He must overcome the whitewashed system of academia in upscale Memphis to do it, too. He soon receives help with the arrival of a tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates, CHARLOTTE'S WEB) who toughens up Michael's mental muscle and prepares him for his college days.Most of this is just backstory, however, for the main event, which is Michael's immediate rise onto the football circuit. His size and speed shock all those who watch his games, making him a prime candidate for college scouts.The film isn't without its funny moments, though, most of which are thanks to S.J. (Jae Head, HANCOCK), the Tuohy's youngest \u2013 and very small \u2013 son who helps Michael navigate through all of the college offers that come his way. There are also some combo touchy-feely and comical moments. The one that comes to mind is when the Tuohy's ask Michael to become a member of their family and he says, \"I thought I already was.\" The main draw here is, finally, Sandra Bullock. Not known as a powerhouse actress and more as one who goes after the money, Bullock may have gotten lucky and found the part she could play so well that it grabbed her an Oscar. Her Leigh portrayal was truly excellent. But was it as good as, say, Gabourey Sidibe's PRECIOUS? Or Meryl Streep's Julia Child in JULIE AND JULIA? Some think not (Does Meryl need another Oscar? I mean, really!) Regardless, I think sports movie fans will gobble up this one just as much as HOOSIERS and ROCKY.",

Her performance is not spectacular, because her character is phenomenal, but she clearly understood the essence of Lee-Anne Twohy as described by Michael Lewis. I've enjoyed the film very much. I was expecting some dramatic Hollywood-twisted scenes without any link with the real story of Michael Oher, who is also a phenomenon by himself. But not. There are a couple of scenes when you can guess, even if you have not read the book, that are just too much. But it's made with a nice sensibility. And it's a true story, totally unbelievable. A screenwriter would have imagine this story, any producer would have dumped it. It's impossible to dislike this film. Just a small problem: for people who are not fluent in English, the Southern accent of Nashville characters is hard to catch. But it does not reduce the fun to watch it even if translated. This family is unique and their story was to be told.",

            "content": "I'm going to preface this review by saying that I did not want to see this movie. Why? Because I hate football and because I watched Michael Phillips and A.O. Scott write it off as cheap, overly sentimental Oscar bait. I ended up seeing this because my mother wanted to see it for her birthday and I planned on taking a nap it the theater.Well, Mike and Tony, you were wrong. This movie was awesome. Freaking awesome. Again, I hate football and did not want to like this movie, but I loved it. So, I no longer record At the Movies. You two are heartbroken, I know.Story: The story follows the true story of Michael Oher as he was adopted by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw. He bonds with them and comes to see them as his own family. He gets his grades up, excels at playing football, and gets to go to college on a football scholarship. Then, the family gets put under a microscope by an investigator who wants to know why Sandra Bullock adopted Michael, suspecting that she did it so that her alma mater would have a powerhouse football player rather than out of a sense of charity. It is that last part that makes this movie so good, because we live in a cynical society where we want to know what the charitable are gaining by being charitable. It doesn't dodge that question.The only possible complaint I have with the story is that, under the correct viewing, the story could come off a bit racist. It inadvertently asserts that white culture is superior to black culture. The generous white people save one poor black kid from the horrors of living in a black world. This could have been subverted some by having the ghetto not be uniformly black and the white world being so uniformly white. However, being a true story, maybe that's how it happened. In fact, it does sort of come up as a plot point when Michael writes in his journal about feeling isolated by being the only black kid in the school. So, I don't think the movie was trying to be racist, but I do think some people will be offended. B Acting: Sandra Bullock's character came under fire by Scott and Phillips as a one dimensional idealized characterture that didn't grow throughout the story. They were particularly harsh on the line where Sandra said that Michael was changing her life, arguing that she showed no signs of that. I disagree. She was growing, but very subtly. Yes, she was headstrong and stubborn and changed very little, but she did grow, and if she hadn't been so persistent then this story never would have happened.Quinton Aaron also fell under fire, saying that his portrayal of Michael Oher was reduced to reaction shots and that he became an ancillary character in his own movie. Again, wrong! Yes, Michael doesn't say much, but he said everything that he needed to say through those subtle looks. Quinton did a fabulous job.Jae Head made this movie a lot of fun with his enthusiasm through playing SJ, Sandra Bullock's biological son who immediately bonds with Mike. Even the most jaded cynic will be smiling during SJ's scenes.Lastly, I knew Tim McGraw was in this movie and I kept wondering which character he was playing. I was shocked, absolutely shocked to learn that he had been playing Sean Tuohy, Sandra Bullock's husband. He disappeared into the role utterly, totally and completely. I had no idea that it was him until the end credits rolled and then I kept wanting to see his character again to see if it really was him, but instead the movie ends with photos of the real life Michael Oher and Tuohy family. Props, Tim! You were able to match energy with Sandra Bullock and were awesome! Acting gets a big fat A! Visuals: This movie did a good job (perhaps too good considering the potentially offensive racial message it sent) of making Michael's world and the Tuohy family world seem completely different. One is soft and pretty, the other is dark and gritty. The football action drew me in, an accomplishment when you consider that I don't enjoy the sport. All around, the visuals get an A.Sound: The soundtrack felt a bit southern, but it fit the movie and the mood they were trying to send. The foleys kept me believing that there really was a football game being played and didn't kick me out of the movie at any point. A Overall: This movie is really good. It's uplifting and generally gives a feeling of hope for the future. I hope no gets too terribly offended by it, but by and large I think you should see it. A",

Why was it such a blockbuster then?Honestly...? I have no idea!Yeah, the story is true, I know that, but even when the story is true you don't have to make a movie absolutely predictable - that's just bad directing. What's even worse is the screenplay - the dialogues are completely unrealistic, unbelievable and often simply trashy. Some scenes are like copied from B class trashy family movies. That's how bad it gets. As for the acting, the main character Big Mike - Quinton Aron - is just not really good, the scene when he's walking on the street 'being cold' is the best example of that and the sad facial expression gets boring pretty soon, he's still likable when he starts smiling etc. though. As for Sandra - nothing even close to being worthy for an Oscar NOMINATION, - and award is a joke. Not that I don't like her - it's just... just no.Overall, don't get me wrong, the movie is OK-made, it is enjoyable, it's a good movie for the whole family, that teaches values as... family and not only, and has got some pretty good Football scenes, but for those of you that prefer something better in the cinema, it's just not the right choice, sorry.Highly overrated!",

            "content": "This is based on the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), an enormous African American boy who was taken in by the kindness of strangers, given an education and eventually became a professional NFL player. Although he has great learning difficulties, Michael is allowed at the start of the film to enrol in a Christian school. In spite of his weaknesses, one of his teachers recognises his potential and ability to listen and she vouches for him to be able to stay. Yet when he is evicted from his home and unable to live with his crack addicted mother, he tries staying in the school gym. When that closes of a night he is spotted on the street by a wealthy white woman named Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), whose children attend the same school as Michael. Leigh Anne is a strict and forceful woman but also a deeply compassionate one who believes in giving Michael a chance at life, as much as just a bed.Despite being based on a true story, there is little doubt that director John Lee Hancock's film has been simplified for mass audiences. Rather fittingly, this is a film that could be called black and white given the simplistic nature in which a number of the characters in Hancock's screenplay have been drawn. The Tuohy family in particular is one without deep flaws or conflicts. They are effortlessly clean and unproblematic, as though they are meant to represent the most ideal Christian family. Leigh's son SJ is most obviously a work of Hollywood fiction, given the way that he talks like a fully confident adult, the equivalent of something from a Disney movie, or more recently and annoyingly, the kid sister from (500) Days of Summer. If one can accept these contrivances then they may also believe in Michael's superhero-like skills as a sportsman, capable of carrying an opposing football player across the back fence. It is with this lack of realism and grittiness in favour of a cute family-friendly vibe that ensures that any sense of conflict or tension is absent throughout the film. Even the most aggressive scenes, including a car crash and the smash-up of a slum, run without consequence. It makes The Blind Side extremely easy viewing but simultaneously it also diminishes the reality and power of the story and its subtext.Given the appraisal for Christian values in this film there is surprising amount of racism to be found in Hancock's screenplay. Some will find it particularly difficult to swallow the notion of a perfect white Christian family saving an African American from all the troubles in his life. More significantly though, there are some lines of dialogue that come across as blatantly chauvinistic and not in a self-critical or satirical way, like in films such as Crash and Gran Torino. The first night that Michael stays in the house Leigh Anne asks her husband whether he thinks that Michael will steal anything. Similarly, one of the women in the film suggests that Leigh Anne's daughter might be vulnerable because there is a black boy staying in the house. The scenes in the ghetto slum are also cringing because one can almost see the gold teeth of the African American gangsters, given that the poor blacks are represented like caricatures. At its worst, the film is almost anachronistic in its own view of racism, especially when a redneck at a sporting event begins jeering when he sees Michael on the field. It might have happened in the real story years ago, but for a film supposedly set in the present, it's simply dated.There has been no shortage of praise for Sandra Bullock's performance in recent months and like in Crash she shows here what a talented actress she can be, absent from idiotic comedies. The strength of her performance as Leigh Anne is that she believes in her character and what she says and forces the audience to do the same. Bullock is talented enough to add precisely the right amount of sincerity to the corniest of lines. When she is told that Michael is changing her life she replies with the slightest smile: \"No. He's changing mine\". Contrasting her kindness though is her toughness and the power with which she organises her family. Given she is a rich, powerful white woman it is a believable trait that Bullock inspires with a great deal of conviction. Some of the situations that demonstrate this are less credible, especially when Leigh Anne stands in front of the entire football team to tell Michael how to play the game but on a surface level she at least makes the film mostly watchable. Quinton Aaron does not have a lot of dialogue in the film, which frustratingly disempowers his character, reducing him to facial expressions. This is meant to be about an African American finding his place in the world but because he is never given the time to verbally display his growth in intelligence; he loses his voice literally and metaphorically.It is difficult to except The Blind Side as a Best Picture nominee this year because it is such a light and unchallenging film, mildly entertaining but ultimately lacking the dramatic impact to make it both thoughtful and emotionally involving. There are a number of outdated elements in the story and some jarring changes in its tone as well. Perhaps this is a film that just does not hold to close-scrutiny and that for all its self-congratulatory Christian goodness, it is simply a parable about human decency. There is less doubt about Bullock's solid performance though, a display of strength and compassion, suggesting that she may well become one of the few actresses ever to win both an Oscar and a Razzie Award in the same year.",

I know she didn't deserve it and so did she.I mean i love her but Gabourey Sidebe was so much better.And so was that movie.I believe that she deserved the Oscar for Crash. Though she did a great job.My problems with it: I think the other actors(or some of them) don't do a very good job.Since when did Tim Mcgraw become an actor? Really? I mean I know they are supposed to rednecks. Another problem is that it felt too long for me and it was occasionally kind of cheesy. But what can you do? It's an inspirational sports drama.

The acting is spot on by all concerned with Sandra Bullock excellent as the feisty mom. The plot is fairly predictable however the performances are so natural that this film really does leave you with a warm glow.

Mainly, I questioned whether Sandra Bullock could pull off a much more serious role than what she is used too. As I watched this film I could not help but notice how many times I would catch myself smiling. The Blindside is truly an inspirational story about Family, Friendship, Faith, and Will. In most films I see now-a-days that involve Christianity, I feel they normally show a terrible portrayal of what it is about and ultimately makes Christians look very judgmental and radical when that is far from it. It brings up the question of, what would God want you to do in this situation? Sandra Bullock was excellent in the movie as Leigh Anne Tuohy, the mother of two children who go to school with Michael Oher. As I watched this movie, seeing a portrayal of a proper southern upper class woman take in a poor black teenager and embrace him with open arms as if he were her own, I could not help but question myself on what would I have done if I had been in her position. Quinton Aaron who plays Michael Oher was very good in his role. His emotions and how he acted really helped me relate too him and better understand the positions he is in. His apprehensive, shy demeanor is exactly how I would've expected anyone to act if they were in his situation. There are many scenes in the film that honestly made me wish I could just reach out and embrace this gentle giant. Another thing that I really liked about the film was the involvement in college recruitment as that is one thing that I am extremely passionate about.In conclusion, I felt that in my personal opinion, The Blindside may be one of the top 3 sports films I have seen and may top Remember the Titans as the top football movie of all time. Again, this is my personal opinion. This film will truly inspire those who watch it!",

            "content": "Oftentimes, the opportunity to change someone's life completely is disguised as an isolated random act of kindness. John Lee Hancock's 2009 feature The Blind Side starring Tim McGraw and Sandra Bullock in a career-defining role shows just how far a series of kind acts can go towards changing someone's life and giving them purpose. Seventeen-year-old Michael Oher could have been like the thousands of other disadvantaged persons of color ending up in gangs or victims of violence had it not been for the intervention of one family from Tennessee. In a world where everyone had given up on him, Michael Oher just needed one reason to shine, which he got, and it all started with a new shirt.One rainy night after a high school basketball game, Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is walking back to the gym, hoping to find some food left behind and a dry bleacher to sleep under. Also leaving the game are Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock), Sean (Tim McGraw), Collins (Lily Collins), and S.J. (Jae Head) Tuohy, an affluent family from Memphis. Seeing the cold, wet young man walking aimlessly in the rain, Leigh Anne instructs her husband to pull over and check on him. When Michael indicates that he is intending to sleep in the gymnasium Leigh Anne insists that he stay overnight with them, intending to figure out his situation in the morning. When the sun rises, it is revealed that Michael has no permanent address, and has gained entry to his exclusive high school through a favor of a friend. Leigh Anne then buys Michael some clothes and designates a room for him in her home, bringing him into their family. As their time together progresses, it is clear the impact the Tuohy family is having on Michael, but what is unexpected is the impact Michael is having on the Tuohy's. Michael is teaching the constantly busy philanthropist Tuohy family to come together more as a family and enjoy their time together, and more importantly, to rise above the societal expectations of their wealth and to always do the right thing. In the deep south, the presence of an African American teenager in a rich white family is heavily judged against and misunderstood by friends and family alike. Nothing will get in the way of Leigh Anne, however, and when Michael shows an interest in football, she stops at nothing to instruct the coach on how to motivate Michael on the playing field and goes the distance to help him qualify for play by improving his grades. When Michael proves to have a natural ability toward football, scouts instantly start noticing him and offering scholarships. After Michael plays for a Division 1 football team, he is selected in the NFL draft in 2009. None of the opportunities that befell upon Michael would have been possible without the Tuohy's, going to show just how much positive impact people can have on one another when they set their mind to it.The Blind Side wastes no time outlining its message, opening the film with video of the break heard 'round the world. The opening shot of the infamous tackle of Lawrence Taylor to Joe Theismann and the way it changed the game of football was a perfect opener to introduce the left tackle highlighted in the film. The film was also bookended well with mention of Lawrence Taylor at the end of the film as well, wrapping together the vehicle that paved the way for Michael Oher's brand of football. Sandra Bullock looks as good as I have ever seen her on-screen, completely capturing the heart and attitude of the real Leigh Anne Tuohy, more than earning her well- deserved Oscar. This film teetered the line between serious and fun in an exquisite way, never disrespecting the real family, and never being too much of a tear-jerker in the wrong places. One of the best examples of this tight-rope walk is the cameos of all the famous college football coaches that made their way into the film. The coaches were a great way to conceptualize the process and a great deal of fun for college football fans in the audience. Kathy Bates as the democrat tutor, the first democrat the Tuohy's ever knew personally to be exact, was a fun addition to the film. It was also nice to see the real Tuohy family pictures as the credits rolled on. The story of the courageous kindness of the Tuohy family is an exemplary example to all of us and a well-needed dose of goodness for the world to see. Sandra Bullock's portrayal as a protective, independent, take no nonsense mother was the shining part of The Blind Side. Her brand of ruthless kindness and an unwavering moral compass was a refreshing change on the common female character that blends into the background. There is no blending with Bullock's portrayal of Leigh Anne Tuohy, she is clearly in charge of her family and seeks to raise upstanding human beings, whether they are related or not. Her bringing in of Michael Oher into the family was a wonderful mutually beneficial gesture, and one that sticks with the audience to emulate in whatever way is feasible for them.",

            "content": "(Synopsis) \"The Blind Side\" is based on the remarkable true story of Baltimore Ravens offensive left tackle Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron. Michael grew up in the inner city housing projects with his mother in Memphis, Tennessee aptly named \"Hurt Village\". Michael's story begins with him being homeless and coming from a broken home with a drug-addicted mother, and an absentee father. Because of his family circumstances, Family Services took control of his life as he was growing up. Unfortunately, he was being bounced around in and out of foster homes, and now as a teenager he has taken it upon himself that he would rather be homeless. By a stroke of luck, and the coach's wish for a player the size of Michael, he ends up enrolling in a private Christian school where the Tuohy kids go. Michael is a quiet person who is befriended by S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head), the youngest Tuohy who's connection to Michael starts the ball rolling. One icy winter night, as Michael is walking down the road to the school gym, where he is sleeping, Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) with her husband and kids pick Michael up and take him home. Michael is taken in and is accepted by the Tuohy family who wants to help him fulfill his great potential. The teenager faces a new set of challenges that he and his newly adopted family must overcome.(My Comment) Overall, this is one very good inspirational movie that is a must see. You will learn why the left tackle is so important in preventing quarterbacks from getting hit from their blindside. You will also know that this is a success story going into the movie, but it will still be satisfying to you to see the successes that Michael discovers along the way. The movie is so incredible and charming that everyone will be able to relate and feel connected to the characters. The film has humor, heart, compassion, and reality all rolled into one. It is simply amazing how life is an unknown. Leigh Ann takes Michael home to sleep on their sofa for one night, which turns into a week, and eventually becomes a legal adoption. Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron, and the entire cast did a wonderful job of delivering a believable performance. The movie shows a touching illustration of what can happen when someone is given a chance in life by others. This movie will be recognized at Oscar time.

It's an inspirational movie; a movie about a life changing elements in a boy's life. The best thing about the movie is the screenplay. It's well written and executed piece of work. Sandra and the boy both were good in their respective roles. The fact that it's based on a true event makes us introspect and appropriate life, love and opportunities. Overall, a movie more about relationships than football\nWhat did not work:\nI would have appreciated more if the psychological transformation of the boy was more vivid and distinct even though a gradual one. Of course the movie illustrates that but I would have loved to see the boy's perceptions and his inner conversations\nFinal verdict: recommended",

            "content": "\"The Blind Side\" (2009), I remember the first time I saw this movie, I was in the tenth grade at the time. Usually, most films that they make you watch in school are mediocre at best. However, there are a few rare ones that stand out as being incredible. \"The Blind Side\" is easily one of the best movies I've seen during my high school years. On top of that, this film gives us, in my opinion, Sandra Bullock's best acting performance. I'll go into more details about her in a moment. Any way, I really love this movie, which I did not expect to happen when I first saw it! Every time I watch it, I enjoy it more and more. \"The Blind Side\" has a perfect story, perfect acting, beautiful sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it all together. The plot of this film is actually based off a true real-life story. A teenager named Michael Oher has a dream of becoming a professional football player. With the help of his new adoptive parents, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy, he works to overcome his impoverished upbringing. As most of you know, I'm always a bit iffy about movies based on real-life stories or events. If they are able to do justice to the material, then I'm game to watch it! Not only did they knock it out of the park with the storyline, it's also one of the most inspirational and heartwarming storylines, both in this film, and the real-life event it's based off of as well! I won't go into any details regarding the plot. But, I can assure you, that it's a story that you'll remember for the rest of your life. As for the acting, it's phenomenal from the entire cast. All of them nail their characters! However, the shining star in this movie, is Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy. Now, a lot of you all know that I'm not the biggest fan of Sandra Bullock as far as acting goes, she's a much better film maker overall. That being said, she does have a few decent acting performances here and there, and her performance in this film is by far her best. It wasn't until a couple of days ago that I found out she had won the Academy Award for Best Actress. After watching this movie multiple times beforehand, that doesn't surprise me. Normally, I don't like to judge movies based on accolades. But, Sandra Bullock definitely deserved to win that Academy Award, for sure! Every other cast member does such an amazing job as well. Quinton Aaron is also on-point (no pun intended) with his performance as Michael Oher. His adoptive relationship with Sandra Bullock is such a treasure to watch. And to think, this storyline actually happened in real-life! It just reminds us that there is still good left in this world. It'll always be out there to find. The rest of the cast nail their characters as well. Their chemistry on the screen is nothing short of impeccable! All of the sets/locations are fantastic and give the film a beautiful atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in Georgia, or anywhere in the southeastern United States! As far as the special effects go, they are perfect and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Carter Burwell is outstanding. His film score really helps bring this movie to life, and gives it that extra heart and soul. Props to you, Carter Burwell! \"The Blind Side\" is an amazing sports drama movie. It also found a spot on my top ten all-time favorite sports films! Yes, I do think it's that good. I can watch it over and over and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this movie, what are you waiting for? Go see it today! But, before you do, I highly recommend that you look up the actual real-life story that this film is based on. It'll make the movie that much more enjoyable to watch. Go watch \"The Blind Side\", I personally guarantee that you'll love it. If you don't see it, then prepare yourself to be tackled!",

            "content": "Sandra Bullock is a very rare kind of lady. I hope she will forgive me for saying this but when she first hit our screens I could not see her as beautiful, although pretty. However from the first time she stepped in front of a camera I knew she was an actress of undoubted talent Now as she is getting older (but still a young woman of course) she is and indeed has transformed into a beautiful woman.One thing she has a knack for is picking the right movie to appear in and every movie she has made has been at the very least excellent. The possible exception to this is Miss Congeniality 2.I have given a synopsis of the movie below so if you don't want to read it simply skip over it.The Blind Side is one of those movies which I feel is flawless in both the dialogue, directing and of course the acting.Michael Oher is played by Quinton Aaron, a relative newcomer to the silver screen and in his first starring role. Although he played his part to perfection and I feel choosing him for this role was inspired by the Director John Lee Hancock I am wondering if he is likely to become typecast due to his size and will end up playing bully boy roles. I really do hope not as the way he portrayed Michael Oher tells me he deserves a lot more than that.He was nominated for four awards for his acting in The Blind Side and I am surprised he did not win even one. Morgan Freeman beat him for two of the awards for his role as Nelson Mandela in Invictus. If Aaron is up there with the mighties like Freeman it shows that he is an actor of enormous potential.14 year old Jae Head played the role of SJ Tuohy and the many scenes he played with Aaron were marvellously played and I certainly got the impression that both Arron and Jae developed an affinity with each other. Jae won a PFCS Award for Best Performance by a Male Youth and was nominated for Best Young Actor by Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards. He certainly deserved this.Sandra Bullock played her part of Leigh Anne Tuohy as usual to perfection and I feel she portrayed her role as a combination of Mother Teresa and Deloris Van Cartier (Whoopi Goldberg, Sister Habit). As wonderful and caring as Leigh Anne was she certainly knew how to take care of herself and did not suffer fools at all. Poor Coach Burt Cotton, played by Ray McKinnon found that out.Did you know that Sandra turned the part of Leigh Anne down three times because she was concerned about playing the part of a devout Christian? Sandra won several awards for her role as Leigh Anne Tuohy including her first Oscar and a Golden Globe Award. There has been quite a few excellent contenders for Oscar's this year and for her to scoop this for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role is praise indeed. Sandra has been nominated for 37 awards and won 36 of them which is a record many actors will be extremely envious of.There is not a lot we can say about Kathy Bates who portrayed Missy Sue (Michael's tutor) except that when she appears on the screen you know she is going to give an excellent performance, as she always does, and she did not disappoint us this time.I feel that every aspect of this fact based movie, the script, direction and acting was superb. Although Aaron and Sandra were the stars each and every other actor played their parts admirably and it was coup being able to get all of them together to make a very memorable and touching movie.My advice is either get it out on DVD rental or get to the cinema and watch this movie. You won't be disappointed.SPOILER BEGINS: The Blind Side is the fact based story of Michael Oher, a black young man, who in his young life had been shunted from pillar to post. Although he was a giant of a lad he was and I am sure still is as gentle as a lamb.Michael was eventually taken in by a white family from Tennessee where he was nurtured and loved by the whole family.Although he was an extremely intelligent adolescent he found it difficult communicating with anyone and learning.With the love and help of both Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), the wife of the family and her son SJ. Tuohy (Jae Head) Michael gained in confidence and managed to get high enough grades to play in his college football team.It took him a while to 'fit' into the team but once he had he took his team to the championship title where he was seen by several high ranking universities including Mississippi. These universities wanted him because of his immense talent on the football field.Because his grades were not good enough he could not join any of these universities, so Leigh Anne engaged a private tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) in the hope that she could get him up to the required grades.All those who have heard of Michael Oher will know that the rest is history.SPOILER ENDS:",

            "content": "Sandra Bullock is ever so enjoyable to watch in her movies, and I've been attracted to her star power since \"While You Were Sleeping\"1995 director Jon Turteltaub's heartwarming tale with Bill Pullman & the ensemble family, and \"Speed\" 1994 director Jan De Bont's action ace with Keanu Reeves. Her movies, mostly more 'commercial' and Hollywood, do have their mass appeal. Once in awhile, she gets to play more 'in-depth' roles, like part of the ensemble cast in w-d Paul Haggis' \"Crash\" 2004. In 2009, \"The Proposal\" is an amusingly fun 'rom-com' outing set in Sitka, Alaska, with Ryan Reynolds as the opposite force. But as Leigh Anne Tuohy, based on true (and current) story-events, in \"The Blind Side\" - she absolutely shines as she does, integrated and permeating with her own Sandra Bullock air (energy, oxygen) about her, without losing the essential characteristic qualities of Mrs. Tuohy.Whether she wins the 82nd Academy Awards Best Actress category is beside the point, \"The Blind Side\" is a well-produced movie directed by John Lee Hancock, who also wrote the script based on the story of Michael Oher in author Michael Lewis' best-selling book, \"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game\". The production notes 'downloadable' from the film's official site \"theblindsidemovie.com/dvd/pdf/prodNotes.pdf\" is in itself an interesting read. We get to know how Lewis (who was high school pal with Sean Tuohy - Leigh Anne's husband) came to write the story about Oher, and he explained about 'left tackle'. Writer-director Hancock (whose family is very much connected with the game - his father and two brothers all played university football) talks about his perspectives, what he sees as the decisive factors in approaching the film. The fascinating casting process in filling the key roles: the Tuohy family of Leigh Anne the amazing Mom and assertive woman by Sandra Bullock, of Sean the supportive husband and Dad by Tim McGraw, of the caring & fun sister and brother team of Collins and S.J. by Lily Collins and Jae Head, and the surprising turn of finding Quinton Aaron to convincingly play Michael Oher. There's also the real life tutor role of Miss Sue neatly played by Kathy Bates. The producers' illuminating accounts about how the film project came to be and the fruition of the production sure complement the experience of the film. (They've also included some Leigh Anne Tuohy quotes from \"The Blind Side\".) Hancock, who gave us 'The Rookie' 2002 with Dennis Quaid, once again delivered a winning movie, full of human warmth and inspiring elements without being overly sentimental. See \"The Blind Side\" and you will hearken to the thankful feeling for what we so fortunately already have - miracle or blessings in disguise. Contentment is a nice place to be.Note: This film somehow reminds me of a (sports) documentary by filmmaker, writer-director Ward Serrill's \"The Heart of the Game\" 2005. It was seven years in the making, following a high school basketball team, one stellar central player especially - her trials and tribulations, along with the tenaciously talented coach through the course of the film. The real-life true story is quite 'melo-dramatic' (and tear-jerker sentimental) in spite of it being a documentary. Highly recommended.",

Please, fellow commentators do not rag me about this film's lack of characterization, trite plot moves or done-to-death script lines and situations, I really understand all that high school English class criticism but I believe that we must move beyond puerile critiques of fundamentally good films that are enjoyable to watch. The Blind Side (and I have yet to read the negative comments) is heart-warming, gentle and very well acted by all concerned. There is room for movies like this one; movies that allow the audience a look into two hugely different lifestyles but interestingly seemed not to dwell on these variations. To me these massive differences formed a strange canvas upon which the film was painted but the substance of the film was elsewhere. I expected, after reading the movie fliers that Sandra Bullock's character, although telegraphed to do so, would not play her role in that way, that she would pass over these massive differences and not be at all troubled by them. She was from the Old South, she was a conservative (a Republican) and she was very well off. However, that is exactly what happened; she grew as a person during the film and she did genuinely, through meeting Michael Oher, saw parts of life that were unknown to her. Leigh Anne Tuohy's natural son, by Diane's judgment, stole every scene that he was in and I must agree. Everybody played their roles excellently well and we enjoyed their work to the max. I hope Sandra Bullock receives her much deserved Oscar for this role.",

That being the case, that this is one of those movies, The Blind Side is still a really good example of the genre. Sandra Bullock has really matured as an actress and without her playing the powerfully willed woman who takes a million chances and has unyielding faith, this movie would be nothing at all. That is not to say that the rest of the actors weren't cast well; the casting is perfect. But Bullock is the show and that's all there is to it. The Blind Side is long and drawn out at over two hours, but ultimately it is satisfying and not boring. The Blind Side is more about the relationships between human beings than it is a sports movie, so if you are hoping for a lot of exciting football scenes this one won't deliver. Instead it is like a really well made, sentimental Lifetime movie. It works on all levels and is safe for the entire family. I think the foulest word in the entire movie is \"penis\". I have to score this one and eight simply for the love it delivers. I'd like to see more movies about love. Love is a tough subject to tackle but The Blide Side does a good job at it.",

            "content": "Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews\n**queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the biographical sports drama flick The Blind Side (2009) starring the sensational Sandra Bullock Who stars as Leigh Anne Tuohy, an interior designer who lives with her supportive husband Sean an ex-NBA basketballer and a fast-food franchise owner (played by country singer Tim McGraw) and teenage children, cheerleader daughter Collins and son SJ who provides most of the film's comic moments. The Tuohy family are well off in the city of Memphis. The film really centres around Michael Oar who is known initially as \"Big Mike\" who from childhood grows up in ghettos and has experienced gang violence and drugs on a daily basis, but it didn't hold him back from achieving one of the best offensive tackler in the NFL. Before this achievement Big Mike sleeps where he can find a warm place, whether it be a friend's couch, a Laundromat and the school gym. Bullock's character notices Michael walking in the rain alone, back to the high school her kids attend to get some warmth during a cold night. This where we see a heartwarming story of a spunky white Christian mother bringing in Michael and helps out the teenager through school until he achieves success as a football player in high school and college, eventually being drafted in the first round by the professional Baltimore Ravens. The story and movie could have been so awful and really made foe television movie but with the performance from everyone in this flick made the movie most entertaining. This movie also gives the audience inspiration, to be the best version of yourself and not to let obstacles in life stop you from your end goal. Sandra Bullock's performance as the southern modern American woman whose life is enriched by her simple act of kindness and courage to act from her values. She controls each scene and plays her role in a simplistic yet touching way. Quinton Aaron as Michael did a fine job in the lead role, he took the material he was given and played the role very well. The best scenes of the film is when Michael, who is so big that Leigh Anne can hardly find any clothes to buy for him is also gentle and lacks the killer instinct required of a football tackle role, Leigh Anne counsels Michael to view his high school team as a family he has to protect, Michael begins to develop his aggressiveness as a left tackle and develops his skills, eventually turning the team into winners. To raise his grades to be eligible for a college scholarship, the Tuohys hire Miss Sue, remarkably performed by Kathy Bates, who admits to the Republican family that she is a Democrat, prompting Sean to remark that he \"never thought they would have a black son before they met a Democrat.\" The film breaks no new ground stylistically but what makes it really good to follow is resisting the genre clich\u00e9s of movie villains and avoiding cheap sentiments. Overall The Blind Side is not a film about sports but about the rewards of showing love and support when it is not always accepted or understood by the community 8/10.",

            "content": "Sandra Bullock was good. The rest of the cast was equivalent to an episode of full house. Quinton Aaron's portrayal of Michael Oher was hot garbage. I highly doubt Oher knew nothing about football when he began playing for his high school. The unrealistic football aspects to this football movie were rather cringe worthy in my opinion. No football coach is going to answer his cellphone on the sideline during a game, unless it's a family emergency. Nobody is going to allow a lineman to block a player all the the way to the end zone then throw him over a wall and not eject that kid from the game. These things simply displayed their lack of knowledge of the game and how do you screw that up when the movie is about a football player??? The message was good. It was about never giving up, not about accepting handouts or having a \"savior complex\" as some people misunderstand. You can do good things for people and it not be about you. I just think they should have done better on the football aspects and the acting in general.",

Personally I don't like movies circling around sports too much and I don't even understand Football, so these parts eluded me. However, Sandra Bullock definitely had a role of her life with an excellent performance. Because the story is sentimental it would have been easy to screw up the movie by a weaker actress. Unfortunately, I was a bit unhappy with the performance of Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher. Oher's character comes across as too sluggish so it is difficult to believe that he pulled off his achievements. The whole Tuohy family also remains a bit undifferentiated except Jae Head who also plays a great role as S.J. Overall, it is a very encouraging movie about courage, (white) privilege (or the lack of it), and how to make a change.",

Not exactly what I like so I went into the movie expecting cheese, or worse, boring cheese. Hence I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the movie, which could've fallen on the wrong side of \"inspirational\" but didn't, largely thanks to the charms of Sandra Bullock. The movie was undoubtedly fluffy despite it being based on a true story, but I thought director John Lee Hancock did well in not creating any overly-schmaltzy scenes in which I would cringe. I really don't mind feel-good movies as long as the director doesn't get heavy-handed with heart strings-tugging techniques. The star of the movie is undoubtedly Bullock, who is radiant and charming. It's not a big dramatic role that requires all sorts of emotions but neither was Erin Brocovich, and that got Julia Roberts her Oscar. Sometimes all it takes is the right vehicle for an actor's brand of luminescence.",

Crash was without a doubt her best performance. I just didn't see anything special with her ability here. Quinton Aaron was fabulous as Michael Oher.

He then becomes famous and he is scouted by NFL. What is good about this film is that the family is treating him like a real member of the family. The way Michael contact with his brother is funny.

For a Brit living in south east Asia most of the time, I think a narrative caption explaining to a non-American and non-enthusiast of US football who is lawrence Taylor - would have been appreciated, opening scene of the football match didn't do it for me I am afraid and was the weakest part of the film.I loved this film, similar for me like Juno and yes, it has Oscar potential. Sandra Bullock was average in The proposal and disappointing in All About Steve, this was her at her best and clearly she must have some enthusiasm for US football - but what with this Tennessee/Mississippi thing? Can someone please explain.Big Mike was great. Nice simple story in essence of an affluent American family doing a good turn for a homeless coloured kid; the football element I think was secondary to the social integration which Big Mike was trying to experience at school and in the new family home. Even his real Mum in her short role was a star.Does an American football player really have to have brains to progress his career? God help some of the English soccer players if there was ever such a requirement applied by the British FA! Did wonder what the husband did all day with his work/business to be sop affluent and allow Sandra bullock carte-blanche pretty much on running her family life and other peoples as well. Thought the children characters in the movie were a little stiff and unimpressive but this was really a film vehicle for Sandra bullock to really excel, she dominated this film much more than big Mike.OK, I finally got to understand about The Blind Side as part of the football game but as I said, i thought football was secondary in this films. It was well directed, overall well acted and it is quirky comedy which will make you happy at the cinema or on DVD",

            "content": "I love that movie inspiring, funny, with good values and the list goes on. It's definitely a feel good movie. I has the same kind feel Forest Gump has. It's very American. Personally I am generally turned off by this genre of film. I like dark Indie movie, Stanley Kubrick,action films and everything unpredictable. I am not saying that people who generally share the same taste has me would like but it worked on me.The story is about Micheal a gigantic Black teenager from the projects who gets a scholarship I upper class white school. The reason for this is his size and the possibilities he has for the football team. A mother, played by Sandra Bullock, gets concerned and takes him in her wealthy family.The main qualities of the movie is that it's packed with original jokes, a very solid script, unpredictable, captivating characters, and excellent acting.The movie had two mistake that weaken the intelligence of the film and they are two clich\u00e9 moments. Like I said it's a very American film, I was expecting to have those spread around all over the film, which is not the case. But only two times. It also has something I cant explain.He are those moments do not read or you'll be spoiled.Micheal, the black kid, passes by a park and small kids seem to like him and ask him to push them on the swings. The daughter of the Mother sees that and at that moment she becomes sympathetic of him. A little later he plays football and gets distracted by balloon flying by and it's funny. I felt she should have became sympathetic at that moment. The scene with the kids was a bit unreal I don't think a Black guy from the project would play with little white kids, even pushing kids nicely on swings. Never the less everyone around the knew him so it's not impossible either. Also it's not executed in a over the top cheesy manner too, like it may sound, but we have seen this before.When Micheal trains for football there is a training montage with an unessential homage to the Rocky films. It's not over the the top but obvious.They hire a tutor, played by Katie Bates, to help him in school. She is sympathetic the whole film. When Micheal needs to choose a university later in the film she convince him to choose a university instead of another, because extremely fantastic weird stuff. That gets Micheal in problems, down the line it is never explained why she did that and she isn't punish for it... I find very odd.Excellent film",

Michael Oher's parents were definitely not the Cleavers his mother a crack addict and mother of 12 children and his father an inmate at a local penitentiary who he was taken from at a very young age by children's services during a police raid on his home went through ( to put it mildly) a few years of hell until interior designer Leigh Anne Touhy on one freezing thanksgiving night find Michael walking to find shelter in only a t shirt in freezing cold weather offer their home and to share thanksgiving dinner with them, eventually taking him and adopting him. They give Michael all the warmth and care of a family that he so longed for and end up signing him up for football. That starts what is now after the 2009 entry draft into the NFL,l history. We need more people and stories like his out there the world would be a much better place!

            "review_title": "Reminds me of lyrics of Amazing Grace.",
            "content": "The Blind Side has been marketed as an Encouragement movie in Asia, and many Oriental audiences clearly have this message received that the movie is praising USA for having the best education system that inspired equality, humanity, etc..While in my opinion, this movie very much reminded me of the lyrics of Amazing Grace, that \"through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come\". Just like the beginning of the movie, this story is not about encouragement of success, but about the predicaments. Compared to his friends in the same block, Michael Oher is a rare case that he didn't bounce into others' surviving logics of violence and pride, though he's totally homeless and hopeless. Yet, I can't imagine if I were him when the Tuohy family accepted him into the house, how hard would I work and behave to win their approval. Very luckily, Michael Oher wasn't me. Out of some stubbornness of holding true to his own feelings, his heart leads him to choose otherwise again and again, thus unfolded this story beautifully.Note that the Tuohy family wasn't the first family to shelter Oher. The P.E. teacher's beautiful reasoning got him into the school in the first place, and the warm-hearted Big Tony also gave him a place to stay. But, as the movie showed us, you can love but you can't enforce it. Both the decision of the school and the decision of Big Tony were pushed decisions. It can all end up \"let somebody else be Christian about him\". In 2 Corinthians 9:7, it says \"each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.\" Guess it applies here. Our actions, especially those in the name of charity, usually starts as a delightful little touch of love and mercy, and dies in the name of responsibility. Oher wrote a sad essay \"White Walls\", indicating that the stakeholders around him all did their parts pretty hard though their \"hard\" and \"best\" is not enough. Yet, God didn't knock on each of their foreheads saying \"you are not treating Oher well enough!\" Instead, God inspired a family that actually can do better and really have a vision for a life with Michael Oher. With 3 sentences, Leigh Anne Tuohy invited this unknown and possibly dangerous factor into their house. These 3 sentences are, \"Why are you going to the gym?\" \"Do you have any place to stay?\"\"Don't you dare lie to me!\" They don't even sound kind enough as invitation, yet they are out of a woman's love, so personally, so honest and powerful.And that started this marathon test for this woman's love. The first time, it was because the 10000$ coach has been ruined by Oher's massive body. But, Leigh Anne just said, \"Do you want to stay here?\" The second time, it was gossips from Leigh Anne's reference group, who are at least as rich as her. They questioned her generosity was out of some \"white guilty thing\" and pointing out Collins (the daughter of Leigh Anne) might become a sex victim of the massive Michael Oher. Mrs. Tuohy only said \"shame on you\" to those gossipers, but she didn't hesitate to ask about her daughter's feeling either. The third time was the car accident which Michael was mainly responsible. Again the pressure was on Leigh Anne as the public doubted her love for this boy, but she bravely ignored the public and comforted her boy. The fourth time\u0085... It never ended, and it never will. That makes me envy the USA system and USA culture, but oops, if their system and culture are so perfect that love grows out of ground just by itself, why do Michael and Leigh Anne have to overcome so many prejudices and bitterness? I think, questioned to the end, system can't love, and despite many schools made biblical quotes their motto, system surely can't do anything in Jesus name. If a system can admit Oher into the school out of Christian duty, then this system can also dismiss Oher from the school logically, fairly, systematically in Jesus name. And anyone not completely ignorant would see the fact that nothing would be achieved in this way.We are creatures living in a machine, but I believe we are not machines. \"Don't you dare lie to me\" again was heard near the end of the movie. In the name of fair and righteousness the system questioned all that Tuohys had done for Michael. This is a reasonable doubt that the Tuohys loved Michael so much only because they are boosters of their university. It's the toughest test for Leigh Anne so far, and for the first time in the movie she couldn't find a way to instantly cope with it. She feared that Michael can run away and never come back. Finally, it's Leigh Anne's leap of faith to tell Michael that \"it's your decision, you life\", that again allowed their love to triumph over doubts. See? The system has to stay neutral to be fair and functional. And, if the system has to assume we humans are also only machines, I guess it's our duty to prove otherwise. That would require a continuous dedication and courage to come through many dangers, toils and snares. And the only way to do that as I have come to know is to believe. I surely hope that my fellow audiences don't only draw their conclusions of this movie on Dale Carnegie's books and theories, but also listen to Amazing Grace, that \"It is grace that brought me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home.\"",

            "content": "In the tradition of feel good sports movies like The Rookie and Hoosiers comes The Blind Side, and what sets this apart from the genre is a commanding performance by Sandra Bullock. In her best role to date, Bullock's character lifts this story, one that is a perfect example of popular film-making and its themes of love, hope, and redemption.Opening with the infamous injury of NFL quarterback Joe Theisman by Lawrence Taylor, the film centers on the importance of protecting the quarterback's 'blind side', and hence the position of left tackle has become vital to a football team's success. This true story recounts the beginnings of tackle Michael Oher who was eventually drafted by the Baltimore Ravens.Coming from a broken family, Oher enters a predominantly white high school. Quiet and introverted, he does poorly in his classes and performs marginally in athletic sports. Befriended by a younger boy, S. J. Tuohy, Michael (Quinton Aaron), by circumstance, endears himself to the wealthy Tuohy family, led by strong-willed mom, Leigh Anne (Bullock). She offers the homeless boy a place to sleep for the night which turns out to be a mansion of a home, and in time, a trust and bond develops as he is adopted by this surrogate family. Leigh Anne makes the young man her project so to speak and grows to love him as her own despite his abusive childhood which includes his biological mother who can barely survive on her own and his friends from the 'hood who border on criminals.Encouraged by his 'family' and the school faculty, Michael improves his grades and play on the football field. He opens up and is befriended by more schoolmates. Because his sense of family is so important to him, he takes his protective instincts to a new level, and it carries over to football with spectacular results. Before long, marquee college coaches descend on Memphis and attempt to recruit the gentle giant. To help get his grades get up to par, the family hires a tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates in an all too brief role). When an official from the NCAA interviews Michael about any conflict of interest (since the Tuohys are avid Ole Miss Alumni) with the University of Mississippi, Michael is at a crossroads in his career and relationship with the Tuohy family.There are moments to savor such as Thanksgiving in the Tuohy household and how the family rallies around Michael. And of course, the famous scene where Leigh Anne coaches Michael to protect his quarterback as if he were family is amusing. When she delves into his neighborhood, she gets a heavy dose of living on the other side of the tracks, and a scene where a local gang confronts her and gets more than they expected is a standout. It is a stark contrast to her comfortable lifestyle and her judgmental friends. The college recruitment scenes are amusing and lend an air of authenticity by showing real life coaching legends like Nick Saban and Lou Holtz. What is refreshing is how Michael is befriended by S. J. and later, his sister, Collins. Having children making positive, life affirming choices for the welfare of others is a rare depiction in film.Director John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) deserves credit for weaving a good script based on Michael Lewis' book into a pretty good film with a strong cast. The Tuohy kids are well played by Jae Head and Lily Collins, and singer Tim McGraw is quite good as Leigh Anne's supportive husband Sean. But this is most definitely Bullock's show, and her energy is infectious and carries the film through sheer will. It's the kind of performance that gets awards. Think of Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich.This film is a real crowd pleaser and easily watchable for most family members, not an easy trick. (Do stay for the end credits to see snapshots of the real life Tuohy family.) Yes, the narrative is very straightforward and plays with facts in places, but the spirit of a family and its matriarch who would not let one of her own fail cannot help but touch and inspire.",

            "content": "The problem with this film's detractors is that they see this as more than the literal story of a rich Southern woman who helped a black youth with no hope for a bright future rise up and become an NCAA football star, and later a player with the Baltimore Ravens. I suppose this movie does fictionalize the true story a great deal and punch it up so that it is a quintessential \"Feel-Good Hallmark Movie of the Year\" (TM). Still, do not forget that it is based on a true story... it really happened. I think it is supposed to be an inspirational story for those with little hope of achieving big things with their lives; by the same token, it is also possible that \"The Blind Side\" became a book and movie because it was a rare occurrence, something that does not usually happen in this world (Sandra Bullock's character says something to this effect towards the end of the film). If you take this movie at face value as an anomalous yet heart-warming true story, you won't read any \"sinister\" message into it and enjoy it a lot more as a story.Some detractors see this as movie as an example of insidious Southern paternalism by wealthy whites towards black people. It has been a subject of historical study by luminary historian as C. Vann Woodward in his book \"The Strange Case of Jim Crow\" (where paternal racism was replaced with the less subtle and toxic version of Jim Crow that was to grab hold of the Deep South in the twentieth century). I suppose it is possible, but the problem with this argument is that \"The Blind Side\" is but one example of the benevolence of a wealthy white Tennessee woman towards a poor black Tennessee boy. Is paternalism a common attitude, or even a common theme of films set in the contemporary South? Is this a trend we see often in movies and literature set within the last forty years, and is it a problem sociologists have noted recently? Unless this film's detractors can use other examples and fit \"The Blind Side\" into this, I can't help but to see their cases as weak and \"The Blind Side\" as nothing more than a slightly better-than-average heartwarming feel-good movie that is pining for Oscar gold, and was released towards the end of the year to get the notice of any Oscar judges who might wish to nominate it for honors.The acting was pretty decent, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it was excellent. Sandra Bullock was pretty good as the wealthy protagonist of this story. Her one annoying scene is at the beginning, where she narrates the football position Michael Oher would take (\"one Mississippi...two Mississippi\"). The boy actor who played her son does seem domineering and annoying, but he at least showed a genuine desire for love and compassion for his adopted brother. Some have criticised the actor who played Michael Oher for being taciturn, but I think he did a good job conveying his character's personality without needing to say much.A nice story and a fairly-good film, if you take it as a literal tale and not anything with a moral or transcendent theme. Real life does not work like literature. In spite of the efforts of the filmmakers of \"The Blind Side\" to force a true story to take the conventions of fiction, it shows the vagueness of real life, which often time has no discernible theme to convey, other than that sometimes some people are pretty damned lucky to have a rich good Samaritan help them achieve great things.",

It's interesting though he didn't end up getting accepted when his mechanic father had the funds to pay his way? When the school board was debating on accepting both the boys the mechanics son had the grades -Michael didn't. The movie never explained why they both weren't accepted into the school. If not for the mechanic man standing up for Michael in the first place Ms T would've never had the chance to rescue him. It was very moving and is very moving as it is a true story I found myself choked up quite a bit at the beginning to think of the courage it took to be so welcoming to this kid. And the positive influence Michael had on their lives and vice a versa is a moving story worth telling - but as the story continued it became more predictable a little bit of tension when the NAACP Wanted to investigate the college situation. I can't help but agree with other reviewers who say that more emphasis should've been placed on Michael's character in the script. They went for the clich\u00e9s but the story is worth telling nonetheless and huge props to Michael for his courage and resilience and smarts to choose to step out of the box he was born into. I would love to see a story told from his perspective of his life and not so much just his adopted mothers. Yes hers was a story worth telling too and one that hopefully will soften hearts and minds of those who otherwise would remain Insulated in white privilege. But Michael's story is an inspiration to all the kids struggling in the ghetto and deserves to be told as such. I'm not a huge football fan so I never heard of him before I saw this movie but I'm curious to know more about him as a person now and kudos to Mrs. T and the whole family for stepping up and really living their values!",

Leigh and Sean spot Quinton out at night in the rain and take him in. Here he gets a better life as the Tuohy's live in a large house and end up treating him like their own son with the mother of Michael who lets her son go. From here the Tuohy's encourage Micheal to be more confident in himself and help him improve his grades at school and encourage him to pursue American football as he wants to enter the NFL professionally.This is similar to Clint Eastwood's Invictus of telling a true story and being inspirational, the difference is there wasn't enough for me with Invictus, but The Blind Side is a different story. My dad took me to see this at the cinema and I wasn't expecting to like it much, but I kept an open mind and settled in my seat with my popcorn and drink and within fifteen minutes I was engrossed so much I forgot I had popcorn or that I was even at the cinema! This is the movie Invictus should have been. The viewer is taken on a fascinating journey of love, sadness and inspiration. Sandra Bullock for me has always been a good actress but one that never really stood out from the crowd, but she deserved her Oscar for this. Her acting was absolutely outstanding, it was nothing short of sensational, other actors like Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates as Michael's home tutor give good support and Quinton Aaron, though he dosen't speak much, he had a child-like innocence and charm that won me over.I was kept gripped by the whole 130 minutes of this movie and at the end it was one of those rare movies that I hated to see end. I could have happily sat there for another hour watching it. In the end this was a very inspirational and heartwarming true story that was excellently told and acted.",

Her husband (Tim McGraw) also delivers a stellar performance. Her two kids though act is if they were born to be on screen. SJ and Collins Tuohy (Lily Collins, 20 years old and stunningly beautiful).The movie is not a story about football, it's a beautiful, driven tale about Micheal's life and how the kindness and compassion of one woman along with her family changed his life forever.I absolutely adore this film and I've watched it many times at this point. Not everything is accurate to the actual events that took place in Micheals life, liberties were obviously taken to make it better for cinema purposes but the essence of the film is still carried across strongly.The only reason I did not rate it a 10/10 is because I wish they had added another 30m to 45m of runtime to the film and included some more real life accidents or events which occurred between Micheal and the Tuohy family. Events like Collins moving to study next to Micheal in the school library or the car accident and Micheal protecting SJ; They were very emotional scenes and adding a few more actual events like that from Micheal and the Tuohys life could only have served to make us love the movie that much more.Anyway 9/10 to the brilliant work of cinematic beauty.

Much more could have been made of the girl, Collins, if only for eye candy and to take some of the spotlight off Ms. Bullock. The Dad was pretty much a non-entity. But I thought by far the best part of the movie was about the relationships among all these people. Did everything really go that smoothly inside the family? I doubt it. A lot more could have been done with the family.Nevertheless, I was moved by the film. Then came the football part, which was pure Hollywood schlock. Oh my goodness, it's the big game, and guess who's not succeeding? I think I'm gonna have a heart attack. Time's running out. He's going to fail, he's going to let everybody down. Oh, no! But wait. Wait! Can it be, is it true? Glory hallelujah, in the nick of time, he's redeemed himself. Cue the victory music and crank it up loud. Ycchh! For me all that entirely predictable storyline, that stale old sequence seen in hundreds and hundreds of movies coming out of Hollywood, purely paint-by-numbers plotting, took a whole lot of the polish off what otherwise could have been a much, much better film.

            "content": "The juggernauts of gridiron cinema\u2014such as Rudy and Remember the Titans\u2014 almost all have one thing in common: they're unapologetically formulaic, but they're also extraordinarily well done. Sports movies of one variety or another are produced every year, but it's rare that any of them really leave a lasting impression on the collective American consciousness. More often than not, they're nothing more than exercises in the art of telling the classic inspiration story; you know, the faithful underdog overcoming crushing odds (think \"David and Goliath\"). In Rudy, it was all about a runt with larger-than-life aspirations. In John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side, it's all about a larger-than-life (literally) teen who just wants a bed he can call his own. He's not thinking about what will happen years down the road; he's only thinking about where he'll find his next meal.It's based on the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a down- and-out Memphis teen who regularly wanders in and out of foster homes. His mother is a coke-fiend, and he has no family to watch after him. However, thanks to the generosity of a friend, he's introduced to the football coach of a private Christian school and is admitted on the basis of his formidable athletic presence. Michael still has no home, however; he picks up half-eaten bags of popcorn at his school's gym after volleyball games so he's able to eat. He spends his evenings keeping warm inside a local laundromat.One night, Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wife of a wealthy fast-food entrepreneur, sees him walking the streets and brings him home. Her family provides him with new clothing and a bed of his own. All of this happens so quickly, in fact, that my first instinct was to say, \"Wow\u2014 this would never happen.\" The whole setup, in fact, seems so naively optimistic that it screams Hollywood contrivance. However, there's one catch to all this that's easy to forget: like the previously mentioned Rudy, it's a true story. As such, the movie has, to a certain degree, some wiggle room in terms of exploring scenarios that would otherwise reverberate as totally unrealistic or totally clich\u00e9d. I suppose, however, that clich\u00e9s sometimes receive their namesake because they are, in fact, reality for so many people.To my surprise, this fact actually causes The Blind Side to excel where other movies might've fizzled. The whole thing\u2014though often derivative\u2014 feels very \"matter-of-fact.\" The deeper into the story you go, the more genuine it feels. Wisely, Hancock has chosen to spin his tale by letting the actors and a steady camera do the work. There are no overly dramatic camera angles, and the soundtrack is minimal. The dialogue is a little over-the-top at times, but it's not so much that's distracting. Really, what we get here are a lot of unadorned scenes that depict our protagonist going about his daily activities, merely trying to survive. The 128-minute runtime does start to wear a little thin as things come to a close, but it's hard to imagine much of the story being cut. I guess that's one of the difficulties of telling a \"true story\": it's often hard to know what is essential and what's extracurricular.What really stands out in The Blind Side, however, is its penchant for probing the social class divide that so many Americans either ignore or pretend doesn't exist. Despite its references to Norman Rockwell and the plight of the working poor, I'm not quite ready to heap unconditional praise on the movie. It's exploration of these concepts is far from subtle, and is often presented in such a way as to almost shout, \"Hey, stupid! Do something about this!\" It's not that I question the film's call to action, it's just that its presentation is like a brick to the forehead. We're bombarded with images of dirty apartments, broken homes, and life \"on the other side of the tracks.\" My hope was that the movie's early use of flashback would get this particular job done in a much more subtle way, but Hancock and co. decided to take a more blunt approach that, in my estimation, takes a little something away from the overall \"bite.\"So, what are my final thoughts on The Blind Side?It's frequently gooey and predictable. At times its unabashed desire to make you blubber like an infant will be infuriating. Oddly enough, though, it's also very genuine, and no one can deny the inherent truth of its many messages.",

I think in movies generally the RomCom genre she usually appears in, makes her roles tired, and she often appears tired in those movies. When she has done serious, she always appears to me to lack the chops to make the roles believable or real. This is different. This movie starts off with characters, and builds them. Remember when films used to require a script, and acting...well \"The Blind Side\" is that kind of movie. Sandra Bullock is astonishing (not sure if it is her, or my generally low expectations for her) but she takes the role and makes it her own. I am not American and have no idea about American Football, but that is not the core of the story.The heart of the story is a family that opens their home to a boy who seems to have nothing, but of course has so much...it just requires getting over petty stereotypes. It could have fallen into clich\u00e9, and there were moments when it teetered on the verge, but it always managed to stay on the rails. The support cast is outstanding, and altogether it is a positive and uplifting film without being cloying or chocolate box. For someone who had low expectations, take it from me, this one is worth the time and money. Sandra Bullock deserves her Golden Globes nomination for this movie although having been nominated for \"The Proposal\" as well might take some of the sheen off this gem.",

I am not that big on writing reviews of movies especially movies such as the feel good sports one because they all end the same, but for some reason this movie struck a different cord in me. The reason was because the movie focused more on the path to him achieving greatness then just him being good at football. It showed him rise above his GPA of .06 to succeeding to the Dean's list in college. Being a college student myself I can say that in just doing that there should have been enough to have a movie after him, not including the broke past of a drug addicted mother and gang affiliated friends that was leading him towards the short lived life of crime. Obviously the acting was superb, especially Sandra Bullock, but my main focus was on Michael's character. He brought a sense of innocence to the movie that I think can be lost in the script. He brought to his performance emotions that the audience can relate to, especially the depressing and hopeless ones. I think that many people have felt these emotions in their own life, where they think they cannot go on. His performance gives hope and courage to people and show them that they can be lifted above these vices that stain their past. To see the courage in his eyes and the slow smiles when he knew life can change is something that I personally hope everyone can relate to. Slowing know that not only is your life changing but it is because of you is something money could not buy him. The clothes and car was just a material plus but looking past the big and tall shirts and shorts is a man who did it himself and changed his own life.As an avid movie watcher I would have to rank this on my top ten SPORTS movies just because of the different direction it took. It didn't just focus on the sports aspect but showed his courage to let someone, a total stranger, help him. It showed us to have the courage to take control of our own life because many times people feel as if everyone else just dictates us what to do. It shows us that family is not always the people you are related to, family is the people who love you and care for you regardless of the past or the present. Finally the movie shows that they are people in this world that do good for others regardless of the social norms but instead because it is the right thing to do. In the end doing the right thing can not only change others lives but yours as well.In closing take what you want from this review but I thought it was not an underrated movie. Though will say that I was skeptical at first, Sandra Bullock did deserve that Oscar because she did more than just read the lines, she captured something that can easily be forgotten. She captured the sense that love and support can surpass any terrible thing past or present and lift us up to places that we thought we could never reach.",

            "content": "Having read and, by word of mouth, extracted so many positive reviews for \"The Blind Side\" it was nearly impossible not to head into watching it without any preconceived idea of how great - or, for that matter, how poor - it might turn out to be.I see its central theme summarized in one sentence delivered by the woman portraying Michael's crack-addled mother who, upon learning Leigh Anne Tuohy (portrayed quite beautifully by Sandra Bullock) has taken in her son to her home: \"Well, what a fine Christian woman you are.\" That is it, really, summed up: The Tuohys did the fine, if extremely improbable, Christian thing by taking a very large black teenage boy into their home. Not just from the wrong side of the tracks, Michael Oher is from the wrong side of life: His mother, not so much a terrible person as a conglomeration of terrible decisions (and, yes, it's often hard to separate the two, but I think it's a useful distinction to make in this case), is so deeply disabled by her addictions that she couldn't care to attend to more needs than her own basic physiological ones, have largely left her many children to whim and circumstance.Michael is a product of this immense, criminal neglect, of an educational system that has discarded him and an environment that merely chews up those who are unfortunate enough to be born into it.But something happened on the way to a dead-end life: Someone - a few people, actually - stood up for Michael, without knowing who he was, really, but rather they saw a faint glimmer of something special in him. Sure, they saw athletic skill - and that has pragmatic value to people these days, especially at the professional level - but they also saw someone of character, a kid who hadn't just given up and succumbed to the lifestyle being offered to him.And the movie addresses, head-on, the controversy bound to be associated with the notion of a well-to-do white family stepping in and \"saving\" a black kid who seemed destined by circumstance to be neglected and forgotten. Not being black I can't say if the idea that white people - especially white Republicans from the South - \"saving\" black kids is a particularly repellent one, but I suspect from the generally militant ideology that tends to surround modern \"blackness\" being true to your being black - even if that ultimately means sliding by this mortal coil with few, if any, prospects - does indeed make it quite repellent.Of course, if a well-to-do black family had taken Oher in there would be no issue and that, really, is the problem: The inherent - and not entirely ungrounded - general distrust of white folk by black folk. The NCAA in the movie merely sits in to speak for millions of blacks who are casting a jaundiced eye to the notions being presented by \"The Blind Side.\" For the rest of us - blissfully ignorant white folk, I suppose - \"The Blind Side\" is a great story about a great family who merely decided to the right, Christian thing and step into and ultimately embrace what might be considered by most a very uncomfortable situation. Against considerable odds, Oher has succeeded where few have, even those born to considerably better circumstances. He has triumphed and, by extraction, so has the family who adopted him and made him a permanent part of their lives.",

This is nice, but what kills the film is the character Sandra Bullock plays. She is very self-righteous defiant (She is photographed too often with a sneer and arms crossed) soccer mom type. She comes across more like \"I need to show who is boss, who is tough...\" as opposed to \"Gee, I want to help this kid.\" The slum-kid she is helping usually has a sad beaten-puppy expression -like the only way this guy can help himself is if a tough-love spitting python like Ms. Bullock comes along. The film-makers are clearly tiring to win over the soccer-mom crowd, which they may do and help this film gain a profit, but others may be turned off by Sandy's \"I'm a B---- because I can be.\"",

            "content": "The best stories in life (and film) have simple plots and complicated, inspiring and intriguing characters.I want to see the film again and here are two of my reasons:Reason #1: I Don't Like FootballI've never understood the strategy, except \"throw the ball and catch it, or try to stomp on any one on the opposing team.\" I admit that's a shallow understanding of the sport, but that's where I was, before I watched \"The Blind Side\" last night.Sandra Bullock plays the mother, Leigh Anne. The film opens with her giving a play-by-play color commentary of a real football game, focusing on the role of one of the defensive linemen, the left tackle. I just might watch a football game this weekend. Even if I don't, this new awareness of how football works, or at least, how a part of it works, inspires me to see parallels in other parts of my life.Reason #2: Sandra Bullock's character was a b - - - - h, and I mean that in the nicest possible way.b - - - - h: The female of the canine kind, from Anglo Saxon, \"bicce\" (1949 Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary). By the 15th century the word was used to describe a bad woman. Why? It is helpful to look at how dog breeders and trainers regard the word, \"b - - - - h\" (\"Male Dogs vs. Female Dogs: A Guide to Dog Behavior\", by Mary Stasiewicz, http://www.howtodothings.com/pets-and-animals/a4104-how-to-choose- between-male-and-female-dogs.html). \"b - - - - hes tend to want to be in control of the entire situation. They may come to their owner when they are seeking affection but will often move away when they have had enough.\"The mother, Leigh Anne, is an interior designer, shown in the beginning of the film on the phone, dictating requirements of a project to a supplier. She sounds firm, knowledgeable and in control. She makes decisions quickly, she sees the big picture, and she's obsessive about quality and appearance, in life and home. Leigh Anne's first response, in almost all situations, seems to be one of taking control and solving the problem by moving and shaking.\"In many packs, a b - - - - h is typically the Alpha dog. Female dogs crave more control of situations and are quick to respond to perceived challenges with fierceness.\"Leigh Anne packs heat. She never pulls her gun out of her purse, but her strong words and \"in your face\" confrontation with bad-side-of-town tough guys who threaten her son leave no doubt: She's going to do whatever it takes to protect her own.\"Female dogs mark in the same way male dogs do. A spayed female may continue to mark for her entire lifetime regardless of when she is spayed while most males will cease marking behaviors shortly after they are neutered and the testosterone levels subside.\"Leigh Anne's home is visually stunning, with beautiful furniture and art placed intimately and comfortably. She has a place, a room, for every purpose, designed and furnished for that purpose. From landscaping to the laundry room, and from great room to guest room, Leigh Anne's aesthetic marking behaviors are clearly seen.\"B - - - - hes are generally less affectionate and friendly than male dogs. This characteristic is noticeable in puppies and becomes more pronounced with age.\"This is an interesting generalization. Discussing it with my wife, we couldn't definitely agree that this was true of Leigh Anne, or of women in general. The film offers a good representation of the complexity of human emotion and ambition. There were definitely instances when Leigh Anne demonstrated a business-like approach to solving family problems. However, she also showed a compassionate side, a weaker, softer, needy and caring side.\"It is also important to note that if you do not spay your b - - - - h, she will come into heat at approximately one year of age and approximately every six months thereafter. During this time, there will be some bleeding as well as a change in mood or behavior. Keep this in mind when you adopt a puppy and make the decision of whether or not to spay her.\"I laughed when I considered comparing this characteristic of female dogs to women. The classic descriptor of a women enduring her monthly cycle of menstruation, or the hot flashes and moodiness of menopause, is the rough, vulgar term, \"b - - - - hiness\". Cute bumper stickers and T-shirt slogans testify to the reputation that hormonal changes in females is cause for extreme wariness for all that may consider interacting with them.The film included no scenes that implied that hormones were involved in any of Leigh Anne's actions. But with a pistol in her purse, I would indeed tread softly if I were anywhere near her when she feels her pups were in danger!Go see this film.It will give you an itch to watch a football game this weekend. It will make you want to redecorate your living room. It may even inspire you to reach out in love to someone completely different from you, just for the joy of it!",

            "content": "As a cinefile, we expect two different (and often separate) things whenever we go to the movies to review a film: a) we expect a deep and intelligent story that will stir our minds and drive us into thinking about any number of topics and the artistry employed in interpreting them on screen, and b) we expect to be moved, touched, impressed, rushed, scared and/or any other verb which applies to making the film memorable and making it, more than a pastime, a viewing experience. Most importantly, it's a rare (and I DO mean rare) feat when a movie fulfills both expectations, and it's films like those that make us film critics rush at our laptops and start pounding away excitedly at the guilt-less keyboard. One such film is the one I've recently returned from watching, namely John Lee Hancock's \"The Blind Side.\" The premise is simple and, to a point, overused: poor African-American kid with no hopes in this world and no brains to call his own gets the attention of a white, Christian family who help him smart up, discover his talent and subsequently lead him (through a number of emotional scenes) to success in his area of expertise, usually sports (football). \"The Blind Side\" is the very same thing. It's a poor kid (Quinton Aaron), who looks retarded but is actually quite intelligent and who comes from an abusive, coke-inducing family in some ghetto finding a rich, happy, white family, spear-headed by a cocky, righteous and brave mother (Sandra Bullock) who gives him a home, helps him find his true self and discovers his latent talent for football, which is born out of an instinct for protection. As the kid, called Michael Oher, grows to love and care for his family, he begins to feel he's their protector, and from such intense protective maneuvers such as saving his little brother from a car accident or protecting Sandra Bullock from gansta thugs, comes out his great skill playing Defense on his school's football team, earning surefire attention from all major colleges around the country and close-to immediate success. All of this while understanding the true meaning of family, love and leaving a troubled past behind.Yes, the story is quickly growing stale, and that's the reason why it didn't attract me at first. But after Sandra Bullock won her Oscar for Best Leading Actress for this film, my curiosity got the best of me...and, oh, I'm so glad it did. There are two things (two VERY exceptional things) which make this an intelligent, engrossing and memorable film. First, there's Sandra Bullock's performance which I must admit is more-than-Oscar-worthy and which captivated me from the first second she's on screen to the last one when the credits roll. There you see her, crossing a school hallway ten minutes into the film, gorgeous in a designer outfit and talking heavy business on the phone with some associate. Five minutes later, you just KNOW this is a posh, fancy woman with an attitude and with more balls than anatomically-allowable; you really don't wanna mess with such a strong-minded, fierce woman. And after she meets Michael Oher, your preconceptions of Bullock's character melt away into a pleasant uncertainty and tridimentionalism, where we discover a strong woman with a gentle and caring heart, a whimsical and funny woman with a scared heart, all in one. Bullock has managed to take a single character and make an entire film all about her. You end up caring about this character as if it were your own family you were staring at. She's THAT good! The second thing is the dialogue which is as witty, quick-fired and moving as ever. The story is a \"tale as old as time\" but the dialogue sets fire to the characters and to the plot, and out from the ashes of an overused story rises a phoenix of something refreshing, poignant and with a HUMAN heart we can all relate to. And, of course, most of the dialogue is dominated by Bullock, so you can imagine the quick, memorable, incendiary kind of thing you're going into.Yes, it's rare when a film is both intelligent and memorable...but that doesn't make it an instant classic. Sandra Bullock and the dialogue give this film a wide shelf-life, but the story (which is, in a word, unimpressive), the typical cinematography and the (uncharacteristically) muted score by Carter Burwell figure among it's low points. This film is not an instant classic, and I can't even say it's one of the best films of the year (although it DID earn an Oscar nod in that category), but it's among the films you'll enjoy the most and you'll remember for some time, complete with a reflectively-smiling face and a sense of fulfillment. You CAN'T be disappointed.Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 4!",

This then makes the movie truth-filled, as much as it could be to still make it into a short film, there was nothing major added that wasn't true, the main story remains truth-filled. It was also relevant to experience because it quite literally reenacts someones life experiences. It can also be relevant to how people feel when they grow up in poverty. Micheal Oar grew up in ghettos and experience gang violence and drugs on a daily basis, but it didn't hold him back from, the wholesome part of this movie also correlates with the dignity of the human person. The lessons that one can get from this movie should allow the viewers to put themselves in those shoes and feel what Micheal Oar might have felt, this can help to improve the dignity of the human person. This movie also gives the audience inspiration, to be the best version of yourself and not to let obstacles in life stop you from your end goal. This movie also provides a balance of comedy/entertainment and seriousness/truth. Lastly the attitude portrayed is a positive, headstrong, confident, and hardworking attitude to inspire the people who watch to never give up.",

Michael had no advantages as he grew up with his drug addicted mother. When the story begins he's homeless and is taken in by the very kind and giving Tuohy's. Michael has few skills and appeared to have a bleak future before meeting the Tuohys. The Tuohys support Michael in every way as Leigh Anne, played by Sandra Bullock, spends caring time with Michael and helps him grow and expresses his interests. They even hire a tutor for Michael.I've always loved watching Sandra Bullock act and she didn't disappoint as she earned the Best Actress Oscar in this very convincing performance. She plays the incredibly charitable, nice and yet strong willed Leigh Anne. And in the movie Leigh Anne is definitely a handful. This was a standout performance you'll love to see.",

You could see her husband, Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw), carefully considering what supportive position would earn the most favor before he dared give it utterance. Only her son S J was able to bend her will to his by the most artful of manipulation. That boy had her down cold, after mastering his mother, college football coaches were putty in his hands.Michael Oher was a homeless black teenager barely coping with survival. He was a very sensitive young man despite his enormous size and strength. He only kept his sanity by blocking out almost all the horrid things in his past. This withdrawal made him very difficult to read by everyone he encountered. Strangers seeing his great physical prowess and knowing something of his past assumed the worst about his character.Leigh Anne had no clue about the nature of the strange young man she gave shelter one night. Since he was so different, she decided to let him reveal his character by asking him how he felt about his situation and how he wanted to be treated. Michael slowly started coming out of his shell under Leigh Anne's relentless questioning.S J was the first family member to bond with Michael. That was enough to encourage Leigh Anne to make the effort for the rest of the family. Once Leigh Anne had accepted Michael, no force on Earth was going to prevent her success in turning his life around. Michael really would have been destroyed by his awful situation if not for the intervention of Leigh Anne!I have not felt so uplifted by a film in ages. There really are some very wonderful people in this world. Once in a while the forces of darkness are cheated of a victim. I know, I know, the film glosses over or ignores a great deal to fit its time frame. Still, the effort is superb and well worth watching again and again.",

You can almost feel Micnael's disbelief when he is asked to spend the night with the Touhey family. And you can definitely feel the bonds of the family coming together around him.Perhaps the best scene, and probably what pushed Sandra to the Oscar, is the speech she gives to Michael on the football field, helping him to see his key role on the team. And the scene, towards the end in which she 'confronts the thugs' where Michael used to live. Her delivery of 'yeah, and it shoots well the other days of the week, too'. You don't see it coming and it has a little extra impact because of it.The comparison of the family members football players' slots was so moving and well-scripted.

Normally I don't care, but this movie deserves better. A \"sports movie\"?? C'mon!!. This is bigger than that. Someone also talks about white and black.Well, for me, I being an Indian not familiar with the American football or the black and white stuff, this was one of those which had a lot of warmth to it. Please see this without prior notions...This is a simple story, or would have been one, if it was not a true event. A simpleton, who don't keep a grudge on anybody or anything, happen to meet a great family, pure luck, and his life is changed forever. Forget football, forget being black and/or white guilts, savor this one. You will feel that genuine warmth that seeps through in each character and if that's half what actually happened in that big family, the director deserves a standing ovation. It is easy to depict people's feelings using apt dialogues, but the main character in the movie rarely talks. Even then we get to see how he is a changed person, not by his grades, not by his football, but by that simple \"Big Mike smile\" he begin to put on when he is accepted as one of the family. And that gets through even to the sister. Watch it for those moments where you will feel for him, for the genuine concerns of the mother and that little brother. If you ever felt being loved by someone, this movie will fill your heart.

            "content": "Okay let me get this right! The Republicans are insulted, the African Americans are insulted and the do gooders are insulted and the raw nitty gritty tell us the truth are insulted! Why is this so? It is pretty easy to explain really .... you see the story was always going to divide people in itself but the producers tried to run this down the middle IE not too left or right and as we all know it's human nature that if it doesn't sit politically correct in your head you are not going to be happy. Now here is my take on the story. Irrespective of the white folks intentions and would they do it if he wasn't a potentially going to be a football star this movie shows (even with its Walt Disney feel) that people can do good and that they should do good. Society is a difficult problem with no simple answers, for example here in Australia we don't do enough to help the indigenous people and yet they get upset if you do help them as they would like to do it on their own terms. I fully agree with them but this doesn't mean you should let a young children live on the streets or that we don't provide assistance. The reality is not every aboriginal is disadvantage but there is a high majority of them who are. This is where people need to think outside the square and not take offense to the stereo typing and appreciate the particular people's story. You see most white southern people are republicans and most Africans Southern Americans are living below the poverty line. I personally find it offensive that people who live in New York or Germany find it offensive when they do not take into account the particular person situation and they are in fact generalising their assumptions based on his/hers location and situations. It is also a fact that not every person has the chance to go to university of their choice without the right criteria. Do you think that every Harvard university student wants to be a lawyer or doctor because of their own goals or ideas? Many of these students are driving by parent's goals and dreams and if they have the resources then so be it. Michael had a chance to do something in his life that would give him future. I sure as hell don't want to work at my job every week but i do it and i am sure that I am not the only person who feels like that..... but life gives us all choices and Michael took his .... right or wrong Michael is a lucky man.Good story but could have been better, however it has good acting and it is well worth a look.",

            "content": "Movie review\nThe film named \"The Blind Side\" was written and directed by John Lee Hancock in 2009. The main characters of this film are Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, Quinton Aaron and other talented actors.I watched the movie for the first time, and I can say that I was really interested in this life changing story. The script was very well written with deep dives into the lives of children who grow up without proper care and lose opportunity as they just miss it. After learning that the movie is based on a real story, I was surprised at the level of detail the directors threw in to show the complexity of the story. This, of course, has to do with the fact that the actual story on which the movie is based is itself one crazy roller-coaster. I know that the story from the film is real, I was touched by it. There're a lot of things that people need to learn. The central theme of \"The Blind Side\" is altruism with a deeper focus on people's relationships, human life, and fate. The director does an amazing job showing us how altruism makes people happy because, when someone does something good for others, it makes them (him or her) happy too.This film is about a young boy, Michael Oher, also named \"Big Mike\", who became alone. At first he was not good at school, got bad grades. Later one family saw him during rain. They brought Mike to their home, gave him food and shelter. Michael was a very shy, quiet and modest boy. He became very close to Touhy's family. Leigh Anne, mom of the family, started to name him \"my son\". The family became official guardians of Mike, gave him education, and took care of him. And Mike was able to study in university. Sean, Anne's husband, and Anne were caring adoptive parents for Mike. They really loved him.I think the author described the meaning of the film very well. It was interesting to observe the character's behavior in different parts of the movie. This story touched me. I've never cried during films, but this movie made me cry. The filmmakers made altruism the central and focal point of the storyline. We can see that Touy's family helped the young stranger without any expectations; they didn't need anything and just helped him (Michael). Leigh Anne did all her best to give Mike the most important thing he never had, the family. He had never even had a bed to sleep in. But after the meeting with Sean and Leigh Anne, Michael acquired a family, education, friends, and an opportunity to be happy.It was a pleasure to watch \"The blind side\". I enjoyed it. It's a very kind, nice story that everyone has to know! The film teaches to be compassionate, understandable for other people's lives. We don't need to be selfish because there are a lot of bad things in the world, such as wars, the pandemic, illnesses, etc. And we should take care of others' lives. As for me, the happiness of this life partially consists of our wish to help. Just help...And nothing else.",

I can sew why it ran and ran in theaters for so long. Sandra Bullock really earned that Oscar.

            "content": "I started thinking about seeing Blind Side on the basis of that grab in the preview in which Leigh Anne bullocks her way to the head of a government shopfront queue, and both the front-of-the line, queue jumpee and the government flack-catcher are genuinely interested in seeing and hearing what she will do next. That summed up the cleverness of the approach Sandra Bullock took to depicting the character \u2013 sassy, unsentimental and an unblinking belief in the God ordained rectitude of her actions. But what really got me into the cinema was the controversy about the relative merits for Oscar glory of Avatar versus Hurt Locker. That whole fatuous debate arises from the kind of misguided insistence that Leigh Anne would probably display in comparing apples with oranges. The Hurt Locker is a fine film, even if it has to tack on an apparently much criticized epilogue to deliver on its opening statement that War is a Motivating Force that gives meaning the existence of those who are caught up in its rancour. That quote comes from the book of the same name by Christopher Hedges. In the book he argues that the real challenge to humanity is to find meaning in the simple events of every- day life \u2013 in faith, hope and charity rather than anger, hatred and destruction. Judged on that basis, the film fails to deliver on the theme it has set itself, even though it is a tense and riveting commendation of the American fighting (and bomb defusing) man. Avator is something much more momentous. It is to the first decade of the twenty-first century what Star Wars was to the last three decades of the twentieth century. Like Star Wars, the film Avatar is a story that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike. Its theme is somewhat more condensed but none the less compelling. It amounts to an articulate and compelling condemnation of the kind of post World War II foreign policy that resulted in the boys in Hurt Locker having to risk their lives in Iraq, to say nothing of the citizens of that country. Leigh Anne's kids would probably enjoy it as spectacle, then learn the message it seeks to impart from their teachers and peers when they go to university. Leigh Anne may well be voting for Sara Palin by then. Faith, hope and charity. That's what has me ruminating on the film long after the corn syrup sweetness that lingers in the mouth has dissipated. Long after the film's refusal to come to terms with the big picture causes of the ugliness and violence that can be kept largely at bay in suburbs full of palatial mansions has left the viewer feeling that something essential is missing. Did I feel a certain guilty pleasure in watching Bullock's performance? Yes! Am I inclined to think it was a cynical and exploitative exercise in the kind of self delusion that bolsters the Republicans in their quest to frustrate Obama's health care reform legislation? Now there's a question! Did it reflect the kind of sentiments that would lead to the more cinematically literate fringe of the Evangelical Right embracing Hurt Locker as uplifting, patriotic, sound doctrine and dismissing Avatar as mindless entertainment? So many questions...so few answers! But the more you think about it, the more it resonates with the all too- familiar right wing themes. The institutional advocates for African American self empowerment just get in the way of decent, right thinking white folks in their efforts to assist the coloured people. If you can do a reasonably good impression of someone packing a gun, you can face down the more dissolute members of the African American community. All you need is a bit of kindness and tolerance to take members of that (self)-disenfranchised community into your home and turn them into model citizens, ready to go out and put their bodies on the line to protect what you perceive to be your own interests. Leigh Anne's husband inspires his amazingly self disciplined African American foster child by quoting from the Charge of the Light Brigade. Subtext \u2013 do as you are told, even if the folks who are ordering you to lay down your life are foolish and evil. But then, it has to be admitted that the Leigh Anne character accomplishes more than all the cynical critics of the film will ever achieve. You never see her reading the bible. You never see her meditating on its precepts. She seems to be that kind of genuinely happy individual who revels in leading the unexamined life. But then... and I am going to hate myself for suggesting this... but then if you think about what Paul is saying in the first two chapters of his biblical letter to the Roman Church, about those persons who have never read the Law of Moses but show by their actions that what that Law says in written upon their hearts... then you find yourself ruminating on Blind Side. Has the Leigh Anne character intuitively divined the invisible qualities, the eternal power, the essential nature of God? (Romans 1:20). Can her actions that seem to bear all the hallmarks of God's Law written on her heart bear witness to the unfair accusations of Black civil rights guardians? (Romans 2:14-15) But ultimately, it is the very glibness of the film that robs the viewer of the opportunity to form a judgement on these matters. How would the Leigh Anne character react if, like the biblical character Job, she lost her health, wealth and loved ones? Would she emerge from such experiences a better person, like Job? The screamingly funny but very dark 1988 film La vie est un long fleuve tranquille ( \"Life Is a Long Quiet River\") by Etienne Chatiliez posed just such a dilemma. Would her spirit have been embittered? That is something that neither the film's script (based upon actual events) nor Bullock's performance can hide.",

It is such good films which make me realize that along with so much corruption and hatred and terrorism in this world there are still such good people in this world who make the world we live in a much better place . i am proud to give it a 10/10 rating as it made tears to roll out of my eyes not out of sympathy for the football player but out of joy that good people with a good heart can still be happy and successful in this world",

Her husband, Tim McGraw was just fun. Don't miss it.",

            "content": "The Blind Side is based on a true story staring Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) and Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). Michael \"Big Mike\" is a traumatized boy who becomes an All-American and first-round NFL draft pick player with the help of a caring woman and her family. Leigh Ann sees Michael in the rain one night after her sons school play. He spends the night and ends up staying for Thanksgiving dinner with them the next day. Leigh Ann decides to give Michael a home and the love of a family. She sees that he has a proper education and makes sure he has every opportunity to succeed. When Michael expresses an interest in football, Leigh Ann does everything she can to help him. He doesn't do good in school but can write poems very well. Leigh Ann gets him a tutor to help bring his grads up so he can graduate and attend college. Throughout the movie Michael and Leigh Ann's son S.J. (Jae Head) become very close. S.J. helps Michael train for football and seek fame. He also is his wing man when it comes to meeting college recruiters about playing football in college. Be kind to others and don't judge is the theme to the film The Blind Side. Leigh Anne meets Michael, a homeless boy who she takes under her own wing. Leigh Anne gets a lot of ridicule from her friends but she sticks up for Michael, because he is changing her life for the better. At first she isn't sure if taking Michael in is the right thing but throughout the movie they build an unbreakable relationship that she wouldn't change a thing for. The film shows how important family is and how they can be there for you no matter what. Accepting someone such as Michael into your family is priceless and the film really captures that. There is a scene in the movie where the Tuohy's are taking their family picture for their Christmas card. Leigh Ann tells Michael to get in the picture. He looks very out of place due to his color and clothing but, Michael is family. Leigh Ann's brother calls after receiving the Christmas card and lets her know that there is a colored boy in their photo. He doesn't seem to understand why they have a colored boy in their family photo. Sandra Bullock really does a great job of acting in this film. The film Radio also has a theme of helping others and not judging. It is also a true story of a young underprivileged boy who makes his way into the hearts of the football plays and town. The coach's commitment to helping him is unforgettable. The bond Radio makes with the characters is more important than aptitude, intellect, or athletic ability. Three elements used in the film to help reveal the theme are color, lighting, and angle. The element of color was used a lot, especially in scenes within the household. All over throughout Leigh Ann's house the colors are very natural and inviting. Leigh Ann is a very caring mother and the color scheme presented in the film fits her personality and character perfectly. The lighting in the film is very surreal. The film is shot mostly outside on the football field with natural lighting; however it is also shot in the house with on scene lighting. The different angles the director uses are very important. They convey emotion and set the mood. In one scene in particular all of these elements are used and it's like you were sitting with the family. It's the scene of the Thanksgiving dinner. The family is gathered around Leigh Ann's dining room table. They begin by holding hands and saying prayer. The close up angle of Michaels face represents that he is scared but very thankful to have the Tuohy's in his life. The close up of S.J. nodding his head and looking at his sisters hands lets Michael know that it's OK. The scene is perfect, the room is light by natural lighting thought the windows. The colors and emotion expressed are bright and happy. The different angles bring the setting and mood together, making the movie heart touching and interesting.",

Everything is outstanding , I am bouche b\u00e9e , I cannot describe my admiration for this chef-d'oeuvre . This is film is not a clich\u00e9 , it is by far the best movie I've seen in 2009 . The reason why ? It looks so realistic .I adore films like The Green Mile , Message in a bottle , K-PAX . The Blind Side is in the list and also a masterpiece you have to take a closer look at .It deals with reality ,poverty, family problems. It shows there are nice people (not a lot ) willing to help have nots ,opening their hearts as well as their purse strings. Even the well-off family in question felt happier with Big Mike in the house . Just watch it !",

It wasn't. The acting was superb and if I didn't know that this was a very true story I would think that someone made it up out of a Sweet and Low. there was an unnecessary dig at Pres.

It's based on a true story which is heartwarming and inspiring. I highly recommend it.Sandra Bullock did some comedy, rom-coms and big budget blockbusters but in this movie she gives her career best performance in my opinion. She plays so modest, unpretentious and caring and with that southern accent, not shocking for me, she won an oscar for her performance. Quinton Aaron is very good in the role of Michael Oher aswell.John Lee Hancock did a great job as a writer with the scene that Leigh Anne intervenes the football practice and explains it to Mike what he's supposed to do by giving examples for his \"protective instincts\" and using 'em as he can understand. He gives an example of great sense of humor with the scene that Leigh Anne and Mike go for a shopping to a store called \"Big and Tall\". That scene cracks me up lol. I also like the scene which is Michael tries to find a subject for his essay and struggles, his tutor (Kathy Bates) tells Sean (Tim McGraw) to help him out, then he reads the poem and helps Michael with his essay. By the way, \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" is an incredible poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson and you guys may wanna check it out.Sure, this film had some stereotypes. It includes a conservative, republican, white-collar and rich family which helps a boy out and i really can understand some people don't want to watch it because of it but i think you should check it out.",

The results of this pure act of kindness are inspirational, uplifting and thoroughly satisfying. Sandra Bullock's Academy Award winning, knock out performance is the heart and soul of this film, but she couldn't have been this good without anyone to play off: Tim McGraw as her adoring sweetheart of a husband; Lily Collins as the teenage daughter who refreshingly plays against type and expectations; young Jae Head who declares every scene he's in his own; and the inimitable Kathy Bates in a minor but pivotal role.

The link to this character just wasn't there and I felt bad that the had a tragic life and I know there should have been a parallel to Michael and this kid but it wasn't developed. Even when Sandra Bullock's character had to say good bye to Michael when he went off to college, it should have been an emotional moment but it was just OK.

Her character looms so large in the movie as to eclipse everyone else even Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) who you would have thought would be the center of the story.

As a feel-good movie, it pales in comparison to many other films I would place in the same category. Take \"October Sky\" as an example. It has many similarities to \"The Blind Side.\" Both are about a teen-ager who has had little encouragement in his life and an adult who sees potential and nurtures it. Both have positive outcomes. And both are based on true stories. But \"October Sky\" gave us a much more compelling story and kept us more emotionally involved. The fault may lie partly on the subject matter, but I believe there it more to it than that. I, for one, believe Sandra Bullock's Oscar was one of the least deserved in recent history. I may be no drama expert, like some who are on the message board claim to be, but to me her performance was uninspired. All in all, much of the time while I was watching the movie it seemed like something I'd seen a million times on the Hallmark Hall of Fame channel or a Lifetime movie of the week.",

I watched it in 1080p HD and that was great too. Then there is the story telling. I believe all good movie whether it is Batman or the Godfather is all about story telling. This movie tells a very true story and an unexaggerated story too. Never does it seem overly Hollywood. Being from UK and knowing nothing about \"Football\" as Americans wrongly like to call it, I still throughly enjoyed it. For that reason I recommend this movie to anyone and it is well worth the time. Reminded me of the movie In Pursuit of Happiness. In some ways this movie is much better. One thing I noticed as I was about to write this review is no one mentioned the sister's role (Collins) in this movie. I thought she was fantastic. Hardly did she have any thing much to say, but she communicated volumes though her expressions, body language etc. I am sure she has been spotted by other film makers. Sandra Bullock is a blond Republican. Exciting as that may be for some, I really was warmed by her role. Judging from the photos of the real Mrs Tuohy I think Sandra Bullock needed to bring her best screen presence forward to portray an overtly strong real-life character. The kid is another great performer. The main character Mike played by Aaron carries the story perfectly well resulting in a memorable movie experience. Even the role played by Kathy Bates blends in well. Good to watch with family.",

However, I'm not as most of the young minds, so I found something worth watching and giving 10 this movie.I've never been a fan of a long movies, but this movie made me think of that. Through whole movie, I haven't even notice how much passed; I was so focused on what's going on on screen rather than when the movie will finish. It takes a lot to impress me; I do not dwell in the corner where a little thing is most satisfying, rather where only things worth smiling to are smiled to. I must also say that I wasn't much of a fan of Sandra so far, but her acting in this movie was really amazing. What I like most is a plot. Plot was written almost perfectly, as plot should always be written, no matter what. It's a life drama, uncommon to the world because of the people's grief; however, it's refreshing to see that there are, out there, still people who fight for justice and who want to change the world.But, the best of all was Quinton Aaron. As an actor I've never heard of before, he really amazed me with his performance. Not just that it was stunning, but it was true; it was like he IS living the story - it was the way all actors should act. I've liked mix of comedy and drama, some scenes that shows us what life really is and yet some to show us that what we saw isn't totally true. Of course, all actors did their roles, but Sandra and Quinton as Anne and Michael did stunning job. I've never seen such a chemistry between two people that aren't in love, that aren't actually related to each other in any other way that just knowing each other, I like the moment when Michael says \"I don't like to be called Big Mike\" - it really shows how is he closed within himself - that nobody actually knew that he does not like to be called Big Mike. Or the moment he says \"I thought I'm already part of this family\"It is really hard to put some scenes before others because I think that movie wouldn't be what is without every scene in it. Hopefully I did not spoil anything. And, I actually don't understand why does this movie have such a low rating - yes, 7.6 is low. It is much better than Dark Knight, Ineception or whatever. Looks like people prefer fantasy and crime above truth and reality. And we wonder why are we at place we are.",

For me, she pales all those screen sirens through the ages into insignificance and \"The Blind Side\" expresses her unequaled talent and natural beauty superbly! As an Aussie, I know nothing at all about American Football (and, from what I have seen on movies and TV, I don't particularly want to!). That's not to knock it though - I just don't understand it and, since it is pretty well exclusive to the USA, I have no real need to. However, that's not the point of this review. In actual fact, the game doesn't matter. The point is that the Tuohy family - and Leigh-Anne (Bullock) in particular see the potential and the need in a young man who couldn't be much more different from their own lifestyle and they give helping him their everything (and MORE).Bearing in mind that \"The Blind Side\" is based on a true story, all I can say is that I would have loved to have known the Tuohy family. What awesome Christians from Dad to the young son. Actually, all the time I watched this film, I couldn't help seeing a family that attends my own church here in Queensland. The total absence of any sort of jealousy and the genuine love that emanated from every member of that family was just SO like my friends. (Actually, my friends here would make great subjects for a similar biographical drama - but I know their modesty would never let that happen! Pity really!) When the pictures came on with the credits at the end I was amazed at how well all five actors portrayed the real Tuohys and Michael. (Didn't Sandra look gorgeous as a blonde too! - I'm not biased!!) So this is the second time in as many weeks that I have sat through a movie centred around American Football and loved every minute of them (the other one was \"The Grid Iron Gang\"). I don't mind admitting that I had to wipe the occasional tear from my eye during this one too. How refreshingly pleasant to watch a movie where the predominance is on decent, loving and caring people rather than an over-abundance of violence, profanity and unpleasantness - especially when it's a true story. If I could, I'd give this 11 out of 10 and, if it doesn't win some major awards, the judges are all dormant!",

I wish I could meet both the actors and the real family so I can hug all of them. Everyone needs someone like that in their lives. Sandra Bullock offers her entire soul to her audience. Her portrayal was spot on. I would love to see the two women in the same room and the conversation they would have. The casting director did a superb job! I can't imagine anyone else playing this part and pulling it off as well. Sandra Bullock looks great as a blonde!",

            "content": "I think i might have had preconceptions when thinking about wanting to watch this movie or not. The trailer was good and so it did its job of enticing me straight in to watch this film. I notice a lot these days that there aren't any true story type movies in circulation any more, i guess its a dying breed and quite a rarity with not many people wanting to take a chance on such a story.I bet that anyone who would have read this script would have jumped at the chance to work on this film (me included). I thought that the casting of Sandra Bullock was an odd one at first judging by her acting roles in the past (Miss Congeniality, Speed, etc etc) but then again this was another one of my misconceptions coming back to haunt me. I decided to take a chance on this one and boy I'm thankful for it. Bullock executed her role down to a tee, i think what grabbed me most about her performance is how convincing she can be in her roles especially in The Blind Side. Its quite a difficult thing to do but i feel like she conveys so much more through her eyes, it sounds odd but i think when Bullock is in front of the camera, she can act with such emotion that it can bring so much more to the story and i think that its quite a gift to be able to do that, Im not sure if many other actresses could be so believable, sure there will be some but i think Sandra nailed it! We shouldn't also forget about Quinton Aaron, for such a 'newcomer' i think he stepped up to the plate and gave a very memorable performance and also executed ' his role perfectly and i hope he gets more great scripts like The Blind Side because he could be one to watch. The classic story line where the struggling kid on the wrong side of town ends up getting in school with a little bit of extra help has been seen before (Coach Carter, 2005) and previous to that, with this plot though, i feel as though there is more to it, obviously the fact that a black man being accepted into a white Christian home where racism is still prevalent in society is another interesting take on this 'classic' plot. I'm some-what glad that i saw this film because it does remind us that we are in uncertain times but it just goes to show that with a lot of hope, faith and courage that it seems nothing is impossible. Thank you for this movie, it made my day!",

My only real complaint was the music. During the first football game scene I felt like the music could have been a little more upbeat and it would have been nice if it had been a song that's well-known or something. It just didn't really get me excited for the game, the way MOST football movies do. Come to think of it, the music through-out the whole movie was like that...

He becomes a part of their family. She even helps him out for a better life at school through education and Sports. The movie is a biography and in my opinion this movie completely belongs to Sandra Bullock.

            "content": "Micheal Oher (Quinton Aaron) was a large black kid who grew up in the Memphis projects living on people's couches because his crack addicted mom was unfit to take care of him. One day, Tony Hamilton (Omar J Dorsey), trying to enroll his kid into Wingate Christian School, also gets Micheal enrolled in the school. Moving from place to place to find shelter, Michael finally comes across Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw) who invite him to stay at their house, and eventually invite him to be a part of their family.The story of Micheal Oher is really a quite amazing one. Oher traveled from place to place never really having a place to stay, until he was invited by the Tuohy's to stay with them. Having never remained in a school for more than a year, and failing miserably, the Tuohy's helped him raise his grades to be able to play football (and basketball) in school. Eventually this lead to him being one of the most sought after high school players for college recruiters. Just before the 2009 NFL season he became a first round draft pick for the Baltimore Ravens and became the 2009 Rookie of the Year. With such an amazing story of \"rags to riches\" how does Oher's story translate to film? Very well. One thing that surprised me, and I found refreshing was the fact that a such an openly Christian family was actually treated respectfully and without ridicule. I say this because the movie itself actually has a genuine spirit to it, it doesn't completely feel like a by the numbers inspirational sports movie. The writing does a great job at keeping many of the true things that happened in real life in the movie, moving things around as is typically necessary for screen stories, without making things feel forced. As sports movies go, this movie feels fresher than many that have come in recent years.This, of course, is the movie that not only earned Sandra Bullock her first Oscar nomination, but her first Oscar win as well and for good reason. Playing a character based on a real person is already a daunting task, but for an actress known most for playing America's sweetheart type roles, playing a strong willed genuinely philanthropic Christian woman is definitely not an easy task, but Bullock equips herself well and steals the movie. And Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher does a fantastic job playing Oher as a person who is shy, quiet, and even somewhat cynical, but doesn't allow his cynicism to define him. Throughout the film we watch these layers removed as he becomes more ingrained in the Tuohy household.My biggest problem with the movie is some of the changes they felt the need to make to this already fantastic true story. Michael Oher already knew how to play football before being placed on the team at Briarcrest (the real school that he attended while in the Tuohy home). Making it seem as though he didn't, to me, is an insult to the true character this film is trying to portray. On top of that the story, as portrayed in the film, is a little too good to be true. Having researched the matter a bit there's a lot in the real account of the story that does seem that way, but there was also a bit more struggle to get Micheal's grade's up, and he also wasn't the perfect teen that they depict him as in the movie. This lack of an inner struggle for the main character, as well as the lack of an outer struggle throughout most of the movie drags it down a few notches.All in all, I think it was a really good movie, and while it might not, in my opinion, be an Oscar worthy movie on the best picture front, its definitely one of the better inspirational sports movies to come out in recent memory. Check it out for the performances, the heart warming story, and the inspiration that you will derive from it.3.5/5",

So, for the correct audience, The Blind Side is filled with happy and emotional moments that lift your spirit. However, in some parts, the movie goes far with this and becomes similar to a cheap comedy. As a case in point, the moments with the little brother, while being funny, are exaggerated and not believable enough. Furthermore, the third act seems strange and out of place as it has no actual connection with the rest of the movie.The acting of Sandra Bullock and the casting of Quinton Aaron are the main strengths of the movie. Sandra Bullock gives an outstanding performance of a kind, loving, and confident woman and a mother. Unfortunately, while Bullock's acting is enjoyable, the performance of other actors seems a bit bland that probably stems from their poor dialogues. Given that, the actor of the main character, played by Quinton Aaron, has the perfect face, posture, and expressions for the movie, which makes you genuinely care about and love his character. To give some examples, I loved scenes where he is doubtfully staring at someone or blurts out the words \"I don't know!\".In conclusion, if you are feeling low and need an emotional boost, this movie is satisfying; however, I would not recommend it for a having gratifying cinema experience.",

            "content": "I am English and as such quite ignorant of the specifics of American Football. Fortunately I am not a lost cause as 'The Blind Side' does not revolve around the sport, despite featuring it heavily. In truth, the movie tells the story of the influence that one unfortunate individual and a wealthy family have on one another. 'The Blind Side' the title refers to is not the technical aspect of the game so much as the aspects of life that each party has been missing, the aspects of life that they discover through each other's presence. In essence the story is a rags-to-riches tale, which may contribute partially to its emotional power; however, this film is not so shallow, focusing on spiritual, rather than material wealth. Even when dabbling in clip montages the picture is never superficial.Sandra Bullock delivers an Oscar-worthy performance in her award-winning role as Leigh Anne Tuohy, who takes broken youth Michael Oher under her wing when he starts attending the same Christian educational institute as her own children. With the love of a family and the support of a determined mother and father figure, the initially troubled and introverted Michael begins to excel in both studying and sports, despite the low expectations of his teachers. 'The Blind Side' encompasses not only Michael's transition as a character, but also the transition of his carers.What is most refreshing about 'The Blind Side' is that the film does not lose itself in its serious tone, delivering the full spectrum of emotions including humour, entertaining the audience by allowing viewers to share not only the moments of grief and strife that these characters suffer, but also the moments of joy that they experience. Why should movies (Oscar contenders or not) sacrifice such affairs in order to maintain critical integrity?Immersing and inspiring, 'The Blind Side' is a rare achievement in storytelling that, notwithstanding heartache and sorrow, conveys a consistent sense of realistic satisfaction that is sadly often lacking.9/10",

The movie is about a young kid who lived in a bad neighborhood where gangs were. There were also a lot of people selling drugs. The neighborhood influenced Big Mike by teaching him the bad way to live. He really didn't have a family and a woman saw him walking down the street so she wanted to help him by taking Big Mike into their family. She taught him the right way to live and got him interested in football. Big Mike started a new life and became a professional football player. The best thing about this movie I liked was how good the acting was. The characters were really believable and the plot was really well crafted.Robert DicksonThe movie \"Blind Side\" is a sad story with a happy ending, a life- changing and inspiring movie. This movie can make you laugh and cry at the same time. This is also a movie that you'll watch more than once.Micheal is a homeless boy with no family to support him, maybe only one outfit and never has had any education. Micheal sleeps on the couch of a friend's when he gets the chance to. Micheal's friend who lets him sleep on the couch takes him to a Christian college to enroll Micheal. The guy also mentions that Micheal is very good at sports, so that's another reason to enroll him. Micheal gets accepted in the school and meets a little boy that he becomes friends with. Micheal struggles with the school work the teachers give him. The little boy's mother gave Micheal a home and adopted him.In the movie the antagonist would be the people and family around Micheal's old neighbor hood where he was raised. These people tried to get him in the drug business and to drink beer. Micheal did the right thing in the end though.The protagonist in the movie is Micheal because after he gets helped he really try's hard and keeps it up. Micheal never does anything bad or anything to hurt anyone. He also watches out for his new family and takes care of them, like they take care of him.This movie is very heart-warming and would inspire you every time you watched it. Watch the movie the blind side and you'll love it.Amber Adair",

The Mother is especially fierce and tenacious, however she's also warm & loving.\nThe only issue I have is with the casting director who hired a 25 year old man to play a 16-hour old boy. Anyone who believed this full-grown man was 16 yrs old, needs their head examined.\nAll-in-all it is a terrific story.",

            "content": "I usually am not one for the sappy, beat all odds athlete stories because usually they are a dime a dozen. The Blind Side follows the usual trend. The story is laden with clich\u00e9s, predictable and at times a little melodramatic. This film though was quite touching and the vehicle for that was Leigh Anne Tuhoy played by Sandra Bullock. While the role is showy and at times maybe a bit over the top, I blame that on the writing and not Bullock. There are several outstanding scenes in this movie that should assure Bullock of her first Oscar nomination, hell maybe even a win. The one scene that moved me the most is when Leigh Anne was talking to Mike's real mother. Not much was said, but the facial expressions on Leigh Anne's face said it all. It was so touching to see Leigh Anne begin to realize just where this boy came from. Its easy to see why this film has become such a hit over the holidays and its easy to see where all the praise for Bullock is coming from. This film is by no means flawless, but it is a neat little story.7/10",

He didn't have a home, he didn't have a bed to stay in, he wasn't being fed properly (although he sure looked like he was being fed more than enough), his teachers didn't think he was smart enough, he was left walking around in the cold etc... Overall he just wasn't good enough. But then! Sandra Bullock comes along and saves his life gives him food, bed space, and a roof above his head. Then she helps him with his education and guides him to join the football team. Then woah, all these colleges take interest in him and want Michael Oher to play football for his team, and as if this isn't enough the family that brought him in and claim him as their own helps get him a tutor so his grades will be good enough for a college football scholarship and entry into a school of his choice. But! When questions and rumors start flowing about the whole football world, did Michael Oher choose the University of Mississippi? or was he tricked into being raised to go and play football and run off to a college that everybody else wants him to play for? Michael Oher doesn't like that rumor so he runs back off to his ghetto where he gets into a scuffle with some of his old friends. This is where the movie went from bad to suck. Am I supposed to give a crap about some fat idiot that got a damn piggyback ride to money and education and then feel bad for him when he doubts his families intentions of raising him? I mean I have troubles of my own, this kid doesn't do crap for himself except be ginormous, if I were in the Tuohy family I would've said \"screw you Big Mike you don't trust me after all the stuff I've done for you? enjoy your life on the streets jerk off!\". This movie is insulting not only to the Touhy family but to the viewers. I should have known though, John Lee Hancock being the terrible director and writer that he is couldn't deliver even a decent movie worth watching.Don't see this movie, unless you have a Sandra Bullock obsession.",

            "content": "The Blindside is based on a true story about Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron. He is a homeless boy that is taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy played by Sandra Bullock, her husband Sean played by Tim McGraw, their son S.J played by Jae Head, and daughter Collins played by Lily Collins. Michael had a rough upbringing and ended up at a private school when one of his friend's fathers tries to get his son into the school but won't allow him to go without Michael. The Tuohys take him into their home and eventually end up adopting him. We see Michael turn into a great football player and eventually get a scholarship to college which is a big accomplishment considering his GPA was at a .06 when first starting at the private school. The movie shows that if you are given the chance with will and determination you can do anything that you want no matter what the situation you come from. It also shows that there are people who care about others and use their good situations to help those in need. Michael is given the chance to better his life and when the Tuohys and the teachers at his new school give him the chance he shows that he can do it with a little guidance. He raises his grades, gets into college, and eventually gets drafted to the NFL. The lighting used in the movie really fit the theme. When Michael would visit his old neighborhood the lighting would be low and dull giving you the sense of the bad situation he was in before. When he begins to play football and better himself the lighting is brighter. The dialog is also used well in showing the theme. I like the flashbacks to some of the things that Michael went through as a child I actually think it could have used a little more to get a better understanding. The acting was also great Michael was portrayed as a silent shy boy in the beginning who wasn't smart and didn't trust anyone. As the movie goes on he becomes more talkative and more trusting in the family. He also feels as if he is part of the family before he is legally adopted. All the characters were portrayed beautifully. This is a great movie for anyone to see as it shows us we can do whatever we want with will and determination.",

Narrated by Sandra Bullock in the voice of character Leigh Anne Tuohy, a professional upscale Caucasian wife and mother who opens her house\u2014and heart to a then homeless African American teen referred to as 'Big Mike.' Bullock explains that the job of the left tackle \" is to protect the quarterback's blind side.\" Although Michael Oher is the focal figure of the heartwarming movie based on true events in his life documented in \"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game,\" each Tuohy family member has a key role, which figures prominently in helping Oher to overcome the challenges of his impoverished childhood. At the time Oher's unaware of the whereabouts of his drug-abusing mother, who is displaced from their Project apartment. Accused of having ulterior motives for taking in the genteel and peaceful-natured, promising athlete; the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) investigates the Tuohys on suspicion of being 'boosters' for their alma mater: University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), and imposing undue influence over Oher to play for the school's team. Passed through the educational system with a near zero IQ, below average reading level and no personal records; Oher succeeds despite the odds against him to make the Dean's List, and become a 2009 NFL first-round draft pick offensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens. (Oher's high school assessment test reveals a 98% rating for protective instinct, a pivotal point that factors in the overall film and positive outcome). Youngest child and only son\u2014before legal guardianship of Oher is obtained\u2014adorable pint-sized, freckle-faced charmer Jae Head as SJ (replete with braces), steals the spotlight the moment he appears on screen and holds it to the very end. Bullock's Oscar-winning portrayal of Leigh Anne's strong,domineering character is evident as she literally bounds into the scene. Not as aggressively but with more subtlety, country crooner Tim McGraw is surprisingly equally endearing as her mild mannered, docile husband Sean, who customarily gives in to his wife's overly willful personality. The personal photos of Oher, the Tuohys and a video clip of the televised first round draft ceremony shown alongside the ending credits roll, appropriately demonstrate recent black history at its best.",

            "content": "One of the ironic things about \"The Blind Side\" is that it's a feel-good movie that is too good to be true, but in this case, it actually is a good movie that happens to be based on a true story. Many people going into this movie are not going to have an idea in hell that this movie is actually based on a true story, but those people are only going for a reason and one reason only, and that is to see Sandra Bullock put on the best performance of her career. The performance she puts on is the likes of what Julia Roberts did with \"Erin Brockovich.\" It's that good.You will also be glad to know that not only does Sandra Bullock put on one hell of the show, but so does the entire cast. It's a rare feat to see in any movie. Frankly, I've never seen Sandra Bullock like this before, because for one, she's embodied a character fully and completely, and secondly, she's not the center of attention. It's a nice change. I also failed to recognize that Tim McGraw played a pivotal role in this film. That's what makes a really good movie, is that you are so enveloped in the characters that you forgot (let alone don't even know) who is portraying them. It makes everything feel real.This film is not along the lines of \"Remember The Titans\". Yes, it does have it's scenes of football games, and the players around it, and it does tend to drag just a little bit, but while the film is a feel-good movie, it doesn't overdo it one bit like \"Titans\" did. In fact, I can't stand watching \"Remember The Titans\" again, either because every teacher in my high school had a copy of it on VHS and played it at least weekly, or of its excessively overdone feel-good story. \"The Blind Side\" should be awarded with multiple viewings, and has a good balance of light and dark, and an overall sense of realism.However, there are places in the movie where you can tell some bad things are going to happen, and of course, they do, and that is my only complaint is that maybe that director and writer John Lee Hancock made it too obvious. Still, it doesn't drag this movie down, and once things play out, it is a rewarding viewing experience. The movie isn't without its PG-13 rating though, it's obvious because of the dark drug-related material and the antagonists, even if both do play very small roles.But I have to say it again: This is the performance of Sandra Bullocks career, and I will be disappointed if she doesn't take home at least a Golden Globe award this year. But this is not the reason you should see \"The Blind Side\". You should see it because of the moving story, the strong cast, and the diverse characters that they play. What else could you ask for? Another really positive thought on this movie is that the director has made a movie for all audiences, not just blue-collar audiences. The characters, while religiously conservative and based in the south, do not adhere to hypocrisy. Neither do they bash each other with politics or religion. These are very good people, and they mean well, and they try their best to do things well. It just goes to show you that religious denominations or political affiliations are not what define you. It's who you are that defines you.They don't make feel-good movies like this anymore, and it's about damn time that they did.",

            "content": "There's a certain time of year when I attend the cinema's on a very frequent basis. This time in Australia is usually the summer period. However, I am not usually frequenting to the cinema to see the summer blockbuster releases, like the good majority of cinema patrons. Summer cinema release does not mean summer blockbuster to me, but instead equates to the Academy Award contenders.In this time, I see pretty much any film that is a sure fire flick to be nominated for an Academy Award. This surge in cinema viewing that occurs across the world can be seen as one of the huge upsides to the very controversial award giving group that is synonymous with shaky and questionable choices.In this time leading up to the Academy Awards, I became aware of an advance screening of John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side, a football family drama about a Southern family who takes in a disadvantaged black youth and aid him along with love, support and encouragement all the way to the NFL.This is not my usual type of film that I attend. The family friendly feel good, \"you can do anything if you have love\" story does not usually fly on my radar for too long before I wipe it off, let alone a sports film. However, The Blind Side had a leg up being nominated for Best Picture Oscar, and having its star, Sandra Bullock, as the frontrunner to win the Best Actress prize. So with this reason in toe, I speed off to see it in it's advanced release. And boy did it surprise me.Set in Memphis, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy (played by Tim McGraw and Bullock) discover Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) walking in the rain one night, with a dirty shirt in his plastic bag as his only possession and nowhere to stay. You can pretty much guess what happens from here on end. The usual conflicts and resolutions follow in a very neat order, which is to be expected of a Hollywood produced film with a Hollywood superstar as it's leading attraction. And yet, somehow, I found myself continually smiling and wanting to bursts out into applause for many different reasons. Most importantly, there is the issue of representation of race.The last year in cinema has seen two different and interesting portrayals of disadvantages black youths. In Lee Daniel's Precious, we see an physically and sexually abused and overweight 16 year old girl, who is pregnant with her second baby from her father, and who cannot read. With the aid of a teacher, she manages to breakthrough and discover above all else, the power of love.The similarities are seen within The Blind Side in this regard, which A. O. Scott sees in an article he wrote a few months ago in the New York Times (click here to read it). Scott notes that both films portray the disadvantaged youths as overcoming their obstacles with the help of teachers (in Precious) and a rich Southern white skinned family (in The Blind Side). The message that seems to be reiterated in the final moments of The Blind Side, is that without this aid, these kids would just be another causality in a poor, disadvantaged, ghetto life.There have also been critiques, which Scott among others acknowledge, that see Precious as further perpetuating a negative stereotype, whereas The Blind Side is being more delicate about the issue of race, yet at the same time propelling an idea of a fairytale saviour through the guise of a wealthy white family.After seeing these two films in a period of a week, I would have to strongly disagree that either one perpetuates any negative stereotype regarding race. While these issues are questioned, both films instead swim in the notion of overcoming adversity through the support of well wishing and benevolent forces.To this matter, both of these films are based on true stories, with The Blind Side being explicitly based on the story of Michael Oher, and Precious being based upon an amalgamation of many girls like the main character, written by \"Sapphire\" (a pseudonym for Romona Lofton, teaching in the projects of Harlem).Being made for a fairly modest Hollywood budget of $27 million dollars, The Blind Side has received extremely successful critical reception as well as impressive box office takings. In it's opening weekend, it came second only to New Moon raking in $34 million. However, in it's second weekend, the film took in $40 million, a large step up, which is so rarely heard of. The Blind Side has also been the first film to make over $200 million with having a female name receiving sole top billing over the film.The film has been Bullock's most successful box office draw and has drowned her in awards from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (the Golden Globes), Critics Choice, Screen Actor's Guild and what I predict (although an easy prediction to make) an Academy Award.The Blind Side is rounded off with very good performances by Aaron, McGraw, Kathy Bates and Ariane Lenox (who plays Michael's drug addicted mother, and who in real life won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Mrs Muller in the Original Broadway production of John Patrick Shanley's Doubt).While it is a clich\u00e9 filled film, it still succeeds in presenting all the necessarily elements of a successful family sports drama.

Their are a lot of lonely people in the world that have not had the benefit of a wholesome upbringing.

            "content": "The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Goodfellas, were transcendent movies. The Blind Side (TBS) is not, which is why it is not a great movie. But in terms of its themes, it is a serious, well-made movie.The main point, IMO, is that there is a disconnect between the Christianity Americans profess and the Christianity that they practice. Michael Oher went to a Christian Academy. But he wasn't admitted because he was a child in need, he was admitted because they thought he might be a good football player. He was consistently viewed as an outsider, befriended by no one. Were the Touhys the only people who saw that he was in need, or were they the only ones to act on their Christian faith? And if the faith of others is so shallow, what does that say about the state of Christianity today? TBS doesn't beat you over the head with this, but it is there. You often see statements of Christian faith (\"in God, all things are possible\") juxtaposed with examples of how people fall short of those ideals. Bullock's character is a right-wing, gun-toting, fundamentalist Christian. That such a person would take a 300-pound black kid into her home only shows how deep HER Christian faith is.Another theme in TBS is how much of the plight of the black underclass is a result of their own behavior as opposed to the plight they find themselves in. TBS told you _a lot_ about Oher, but it did it through exposition, not dialogue. You saw his mother, you saw his background. You saw the thugs in the 'hood and you saw how utterly different he was from them and you knew, somehow, that that difference in character was why he was where he was, and why they were where they were.Race, class, faith \u2013 all in a Hollywood movie about a football player. And the script makes sense and the performances ring true. I was glad I saw TBS and I wholeheartedly recommend it.",

            "content": "The Blind Side describes a story about a homeless teenager who is taken in by a family who fulfills Michaels potential and changes their life in the process. The Blind side was about a true story with Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy who was played by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw who decide to take in a teenage boy Michael Oher who was played by Quinton Aaron. Michael's biological mother was a drug addict and Michael was a ward of the state. Leigh Anne did not know he was a ward of the state until she and Sean decided to adopt and take care of Michael. Michael has had no established education and in order for him to succeed in high school and keep his grades up, Leigh Anne and Sean hire a tutor to help his improve his GPA which in turn will help qualify him for a NCAA Division scholarship. Leigh Anne and her son S.J. Tuohy played by Jae Head, help train and get Michael into playing football. But because of Leigh Anne and Sean's contributions to their favorite college Ole' Miss, there were certain discrepancies brought up Michael wanting to attend that college. A NCAA Lawyer assumes the Touhy's were using Michael for his abilities and Michael felt used. Leigh Anne reassured Michael that they were not using him and they he could go to any college he chose to go to. Michael decided to attend Tennessee College and was the first pick to the Baltimore Ravens in 2000 of the NFL draft. Michael became an All-American offensive left tackle For the Baltimore Ravens with the help of his family and coaches. The motif of this movie has to be Leigh Anne continuing to go to the apartment complex where Michael grew up, whether she was looking for him or they were looking for his mother. The lighting of this movie was natural lighting for the most of the scenes in this film and the use of artificial lights for indoor scenes. The film was a very inspiring movie based on hard work and determination. The film shows people that if you want something on life you have to work hard for it and not every hard working family will pass someone up on the street, they are just as determined to help people out and this movie proves the love for family.",

            "content": "The film The Blind Side, based on the true story of Leigh Anne played by (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy played by (Tim McGraw), two people who take in a homeless teenage African-American, Michael Oher, also known as \"Big Mike\" played by ( Quinton Aaron) . Michael has never really had a true family, and does not know the whereabouts of his father and or his mother, whom he has left because she was a drug-attack. Michael has had little education and few skills to help him learn. With help of the Tuohy family, and teachers at the Wingate Christian School, he soon begins to gain the proper knowledge and skills he needs to be able to try out for the school's football team. Leigh Anne soon takes charge, and helps to ensure that the young man has every opportunity to prosper. Leigh Anne starts off by giving the coach a few ideas on how best to use Michael's skills and help him become a football player with such \"protective\" instincts. The Tuohy family, not only gives him a loving home, but hire a tutor, Miss. Sue played by (Kathy Bates) to help him improve his grades to the point where he would qualify for an NCAA Division I, and be eligible for an athletic scholarship. With the help and support of everyone around Michael, he was the first-round pick of the Baltimore Ravens in the 2009 NFL draft. (Hancock, 2009) In the opening scene where Michael is sitting in the back seat of a car with his friend and his friend's father, the viewer sees life though Michael's eyes as he is riding along in Big Tony's car and the viewer gets the idea the kind of life Michael has while driving through the ghetto and into a better neighborhood as they get closer to the school. The camera angles are very observant to the characters view. Another scene that shows good lighting and has specific relevance to the theme, is where Leigh Anne shows Michael his room and he then tells her he has never had a bed before. The lighting is very bright but as Michael scans the new bedroom he is given, it gets lighter as he explains to Leigh Anne he has never had a bed the lighting grows darker as Leigh Anne exits the room and goes to her room to ponder the information Michael had just given her. This gives the viewer the feeling of emotions that have overtook Leigh Anne as she has realized she has just given Michael something he has never had before. One of my favorite scenes in this film is when S.J. played by (Jae Head) and Michael are driving in Michael's new truck and listening to music and they get into the wreck, the director uses a slow motion type affect that shows the truck smashing into the truck and the airbag deploying and Michael stopping it from hitting S.J. The angles used in this scene give the viewer the feeling as if they are in the accident too. This film reminds me of the film Radio with Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr. The theme is somewhat close to the theme of The Blind Side. Both characters are taken under the wing of white people who give them the guidance and love they deserve along with a chance to prosper.",

Michael's mother is a drug addict, and lives in the inner city projects \"Hurt village\". Due to his mother's lack of stability he was taken out of her custody. Overall Michael had a challenging childhood, endured a lot of pain and observed some horrible events. As Michael grew older he lost some of his close to the streets. He slept on couches of neighborhood friends. Eventually, luck landed him in a popular private school. Although Michael had what would be consider an ugly past he was a very manner able young man. His story touched a lot of people hearts. He was adopted by Tuohy's, a wealthy suburban white family. Over time the Touhy's helped him fulfill his potential as a student and athlete. Michael Oher became the NFL first draft pick. I think this film is excellent. However I did find the theme a little hard to decipher. Some would say that this nothing more than a bibliography of an NFL player's life whose story was really touching. Other may say this is just and demonstration of white guilt. I think that the theme is that everyone story is different, but at the end everyone has something that could be an asset to someone else. Coach Cotton used his creditability to get Michael in to school. In Return Michael made won championships for his sports team. The Tuohy's used their wealth and family oriented lifestyle to change to give Michael a second chance at life. In Return Michael embraced protected and showed them how life is on the less fortunate side. During the film some of the techniques I noticed were Subjective view point. During some of the scenes at the actual football games once Michael started to tackle his opponents you could feel his rage, and intensity. Another point of view used was the director's interpretive point of view. There were numerous of scenes where the director has manipulated the viewpoint of the viewers to make us see things in a different way. The lighting also had it effects on this film. It seemed to me that lighting in the suburban areas where brighter, versus the lighting in \"hurt Village\". During the scene where there was a lot of thought the lighting was dim. For example when Mrs. Tuohy was in the bed wondering if she had made the correct decision inviting Michael into her home. The Blindside is a very good film. I would give this movie five stars. The actors did I very great job fulfilling the roles of the characters. Not only did the actors learn something from one another, but it taught me some things too. I learned that some may not been given the same things as me, but to treat them as if they were equivalent to me. In return you may receive something even greater than what you had offered in the first place.",

Groomed by his unlikely guardian angel, the youngster defies the odds to make it to the professional league.Peopled by an always believable set of characters like the teen's tutor (a welcome return to form by Kathy Bates) and his drug-addicted mother, the film engages us with its many moments of humor and tenderness. The scenes between the middle-aged housewife and her gentle-giant houseguest are particularly warmly etched.However the dramatic conflicts -the racist snickering of the white folks, reservations about the foster family's motives for sponsoring the footballer and a face-off with the gang of his former ghetto buddies --- are resolved complacently. Also, the athlete's younger brother is introduced in a restaurant scene only to be then left out of the narrative altogether.The story is given much of its sinew and spleen by Sandra Bullock. Having snagged both the Golden Globe and the Screen Actor's Guild awards, she is a shoo-in for the Best Actress Oscar. The outsize Quinton Aaron makes an auspicious acting debut.Be sure to check out this slice-of-alife movie.",

The story is truly inspiring. I've read quite a few comments which called this movies things like awful. Nosir, this movie is a must-see. It's kind, original, funny, family-like and inspiring. It preaches all the things that a real person should appreciate: family, kindness to others, hard work and education, sports, understanding and, well, color-blindness. I simply loved it. I watched it once myself and once more with me wife, who was WOWed by it as well. I can not recommended it more!P.S. It's funny how nowadays people can rate some zombie-movie 10, but they rate a movie like this low. Why? Because it's not cool to be kind to others? Because it's not cool to see a movie about family and school? I mean, I honestly don't understand what is wrong with the world today :/ P.P.S.

In an age where charity is defined by its tax exemption, where giving of money is a poor substitute for giving of self, Christmastime is the right time for the feel-good movie of the year.And that is what you have here... a big-budget feel good movie of the year. Will it challenge the way you think? Probably not. Will you learn something new? No. Will you be able to identify clich\u00e9 conventions for telling a story? Yes (If I have to see one more movie where the actual coach from an actual school shows up to make a pitch for a recruit, I'm gonna throw up).That being said, the movie is well-put-together and is non-offensive. It is easy to see how it could be a crowd-pleaser and weekend box office champion. Watching Sandra Bullock do her best Julia Roberts impression was certainly entertaining.Not every movie can move us and challenge us and change the way we think. Once in a while, you have to settle for mildly entertaining from the production company that brought you The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Hence, The Blind Side. You will have a hard time hating it and you may just crack a smile, but feel free to wait for cable.www.justinalpert.com",

Everyone in the story is angel. If the director want to shot documentary film,why didn't shot more Michael's miserable childhood and his talent in football instead of his perfect adoptive family. This movie is totally for political correctness.And secondly,the movie is too slow,I found it had no effect on me when I watched this movie on 1.5x speed.And Sandra Bullock won the Oscar Best Performance by this film,I just think it is ridiculous.",

            "content": "Blindside(2009) is a five star film that is entertaining to all. The movie feels very realistic and it is based on the true story of Michael \"Big Mike\" Oher. It is full of comedy, drama, excitement, and it touches all your emotions. You will laugh, you will cry, feel a sense of joy and you will feel a sense of sadness. The movie Blindside will keep you at the edge of your seat, showing you the value of life. It will take you through hardships and struggle and will show you the determination of a child to have a better lifeMichael Oher played by Quinton Aaron is a boy who grew up on the bad side of town. He is a homeless black teenager who got through school with straight D's. He wanted to avoid living on the streets, and succeed in life using his protective instincts and goodwill. Michael is the main character alongside Leigh Ann Tuohey, a very wealthy mother, played by Sandra Bullock. She takes no nonsense and is the perfect fit for this role. It is said by the New York Times that it is her best performance. Leigh Ann and her husband, Sean, played by Tim McGraw decide to adopt Michael giving him a life he could only dream of having. They adopt him because they cared that Michael was just a kid with no place to stay. In this movie, Big Mike was taken from his mother at a very young age due to her drug addiction, forcing him to live his life on his own. In the very beginning it shows his uncle trying to get him into a top line school, called \"Windgate.\" He gets accepted but has nowhere to live or go, and his education level is very low. One night after the Tuohey family is leaving a school event they see Michael walking in the cold, pouring rain with only a tee-shirt and shorts on. They stop and offer him a place to stay. The Tuohey family is a very wealthy family that lives in the nice part of town. They drive nice cars and have a lot of money, and they step out of their own routine just to help Michael to a better life. After some time, the Tuohey family and Big Mike become very close with each other. They take care of him, and see that he is a nice young boy who just needs a family. As Michael is staying in the Tuohey household he begins to become part of the family. After they adopt him they give him his first bed and brand new clothes. Throughout the movie they teach him manners, the importance of life, what it's like to have a family and to be loved. SJ, Mikes best friend, and new little brother, who is played by Jae Head is the comedian in the movie. This little guy keeps you laughing and makes you want to have someone like SJ apart of your family. SJ and Leigh Ann teach Big Mike how to play football. At first he lacked experience on the field, not using his talent to the best of his ability. One day at practice Leigh Ann tells him the football team is like their family and you must protect them. From that moment on he is unstoppable. Michael learns a good lesson about never letting his family get hurt and he sticks to that for the rest of his life. Michael ends up getting football scholarship offers from many schools across the country and he earns grades that make him eligible for college. His school of choice is Ole Miss (Mississippi) which is also the Tuohey family's favorite school. Both Leigh Ann and Sean Tuohey attended Ole Miss and are a huge part of the booster club. If it wasn't for Sandra's ability to convey a strong sense of leadership, courage, and strength, the movie would not have been as successful. She plays a lead role that truly touches your heart. She plays a great part with being a hard working determined mother to raise her kids to grow up the right way, and she goes out of her way to help someone less fortunate. After watching Blindside, the story of Michael Oher will never be forgotten. Blindside is a must see hit film that you and your whole family will enjoy. Its dramatic elements and frequent moments of comedy make this a movie that you will always remember. This film is a powerful inspiration to us all. It makes us want to get out there and help by showing us the power of love, family, and kindness.",

            "content": "The film The Blind Side directed by Hancock (2009), written from a true story about Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron, is a fun and touching view into how lives can be changed when a selfless family helps someone without any family of his own to speak of. Leigh Anne Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock, a busy career woman, wife, and mother sees a need and fills it, when she and her supportive husband Sean (Tim McGraw) find Michael homeless and walking in the rain. Humble Michael blends well with the Tuohy family as he learns and teaches lots of life lessons, ending up a star. The themes of the drama touch on several categories. Categories such as social concerns around the disparity in income and access within the same city; and human dignity as a young man struggles to survive outside of the community he knows. But, most of all, the human relationships of people from a variety of social and financial backgrounds and how they can help and learn from one another as they grow into more fulfilled individuals. In addition, the film shows how people can grow to love and nurture others like family in a relatively short period of time. Though the film begins rather slowly, the editing and sound crews do wonders in bringing to life. The use of flash and parallel cuts by the editor brings attention to the drama, fears, and action throughout the film. Both produced and ambient sounds along with the music in the movie heighten the experiences as if one were sitting in the car, the stands, or the living room with the family as they go through their daily adventures. When the time is taken to analyze the techniques used in the making of the film, it is amazing what the professionals behind the scenes can do to enhance the viewer's experience. All in all the film is masterfully put together and may be useful in teaching many the joys and self-fulfillment received when stepping out of their comfort zone to share themselves and their good fortune with others. Much like the film Pretty Woman produced by Milchan (1990), also starring Sandra Bullock as Vivian, not only does the family rescue Michael from a life of despair and misfortune, but he \"rescues them right back\" by teaching them humility and gratitude. One can be fairly certain that Michael has not forgotten his \"family\" as he moved on to enjoy a successfully career with the Ravens.",

            "content": "'The Blind Side' Tackles the True Story of Michael OherBased on a true story. Showing these words at the beginning of a film immediately captures the attention and emotions of the audience. Films based off of a true story naturally make it easier for the audience to relate to the characters and empathize with them. This holds true for the emotional, heart-warming film The Blind Side. The true story of Michael Oher touches the hearts of all audiences.Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), the African American son of a crack-addict mother and absent father, grew up in the stereotypical 'slums'. Michael literally had no direction when Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) found him wandering the streets in the middle of winter and offered him a warm bed for the night. This turns into many nights and then a permanent home. Michael Oher turns his life almost completely around while living with the Tuohys. He improves in the classroom and becomes a star on the football field. Michael Oher's 2009 draft into the NFL made this movie a blockbuster when it was released because of his true life story.The Blind Side was nominated for 22 awards and took home eight mainly for the phenomenal acting by Sandra Bullock. She shined brightly in her role as Mrs. Tuohy, a rich, Southern-belle, white woman who takes Michael in. The conviction in every single one of Bullock's lines validated her decision to defy social norms and make Michael Oher part of her family. Though some may say the story whose focus was supposed to be on Michael Oher, focused too much on Bullock's portrayal of Mrs. Tuohy, the balance and relational dynamics between her and Aaron only enhanced the story. Bullock's soft but direct expressions like, \"you threaten my boy, you threaten me,\" perfected her role as an authoritative and proud mother. Mrs. Tuohy and Michael developed a completely believable mother-son relationship on screen. The story of Michael Oher is nothing short of emotional however, director John Lee Hancock never forces the audience to break down and cry. The emotion-laden scenes like when Mr. and Mrs. Tuohy ask Michael if he wanted to be part of the family and he replies, \"I kinda thought I already was,\" are quickly balanced with a spark of humor, typically exhibited through the lively younger brother S.J. played by Jae Head. This balance is key to an emotional film because the audience remains emotionally invested without worrying about constantly having to dry their tears. The audience can grieve through the struggles Oher faces with school and his absent family and then laugh with S.J's way of describing football plays with the entire contents of the Tuohy's spice cabinet. Hancock, did an amazing job portraying the true story of Michael Oher and his shambles to fame life. Some may critique him for turning the 'true story' into a more Hollywood version, but in films this is usually for the better and in this case it definitely is. He may have embellished a few parts of Oher's life, but unlike other 'true story' films he does not add unnecessary violence, sexual innuendos, or romance, yet he still captures the audience.After seeing this film, prepare to have a heavy heart and a smile on your face. The story of Michael Oher and Mrs. Tuohy will leave you longing to make a difference in someone's life just as the Tuohys did for Michael, or at least longing to see another 'based on a true story' film.",

            "review_title": "Family movie about love and football.",
            "content": "In football a left tackle is the protector of the team. According to Leigh Anne Tuohy, an Ole Miss football fan, wife and mother of two, he has to be \"wide in the butt, massive in the thighs\u0085long arms, giant hands and feet as quick as a hiccup.\" But who is there to protect the left tackle on and off the field? The Blindside, based on the novel by Michael Lewis, follows the true story of NFL left tackle Michael Oher, from homelessness in, appropriately named, Hurt Village of Memphis, to the football field of Ole Miss and beyond. Under the direction of John Lee Hancock and supported by a marvelous cast, this film of love, family and football shares Oher's story of poverty to triumph and proves true family runs deeper than blood. Hancock took on the difficult task of turning the bestseller into a film. The movie accurately depicts Oher's story with only a few slight detours. One mistake is made on Oher's first day of football practice at his new school, in upper class Memphis, where he appears clueless on the rules, including not knowing the basic three point stance. Although this was designed to give the movie a light hearted comedic moment, Oher was knowledgeable. He came to school on an athletic scholarship. Other than this mistake the film brilliantly shows the relationship between the Tuohy family and Michael and the characters real life persona's. Oher grew up only miles from the Tuohy's, on the other side of Memphis, but seemed to be from a different universe. Hancock does an excellent job illustrating the polar opposite worlds. He shows Michael in baggy, worn out clothing, coming from a broken home, broken family and broken world filled with drugs and violence. While the Tuohy's, fast food tycoons, come from country clubs, fancy cars and designer clothing. From the beginning their relationship felt natural and welcoming. Quinton Aaron assumes the role of Oher with ease and excellence. He captures Oher, a gentle giant, as person and an athlete. Even though Aaron plays the main character, he has relatively few speaking lines throughout the movie because Oher was very closed off. Aaron relies largely on emotional execution and body language to tell the story. He does so in many ways including rubbing his knees when he felt anxious or out of place. Leigh Anne puts it best when she says \"he is like a fly in milk,\" because he stands out at his new school, on the football field and in the world because of his race and size. Many people have a hard time expecting Michael. The Tuohy's son, SJ, played by Jae Head, is one of the first people to befriend Michael. Head charms as Michael's pint sized side kick with a contagious smile. The chemistry between the two feels like they have always been brothers. Head stops at nothing to make sure his, \"big brother,\" is treated fairly and Michael always sticks an arm out to protect SJ. Leigh Anne and her family see they need Michael just as much as he needs them. Sandra Bullock steps into the shoes of the fiery and feisty Leigh Anne, where she gives the performance of her lifetime. She transforms into a sweet southern belle, not afraid to fight for her beliefs. The perfect balance of bossy and vulnerable, everything from Bullocks wardrobe, to her southern accent and body language screamed Leigh Anne. Bullock brings out her natural maternal instinct when starting down a gangster and fighting the NCAA. She shows that even though he is from a different world Michael is her son. The Tuohy family becomes Michael's left tackle and fill the cracks of his broken world. The movie reminds you of the importance of love and protecting your family. All 129 minutes are worth your time as it pulls at your heartstrings and truly changes your life.",

            "content": "The movie is based on the 2006 book The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game by Michael Lewis. The movie is heart touching and grabs your attention from the first scene .It's written and directed by John lee Hancock starring Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, and Quinton Aaron.In his childhood, a 17 year old boy, old Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a huge, physically imposing black youth, grew up in Memphis. He left his drug addicted mother, but he goes to a foster care when he isn't running away to sleep anywhere else he can find.Michael gets accepted into Wingate School, an exclusive private school, despite his low grades. After Michael starts attending classes at Wingate, most of his teachers believe he is unteachable, except his science teacher, Mrs. Boswell (Kim Dickens), who begins to understand that he learns in a different way. Believing he is homeless, Leigh Anne Tuohy(Sandra Bullock), mother of Wingate students, Collins Tuohy (Lily Collins) and S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head), and the wife of wealthy businessman Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw). invites Michael to stay in their home for the night. But that one night slowly extends itself both in terms of time and emotion as the Tuohys begin to treat Michael like one of the family.Part of that emotional investment for Leigh Anne is fully understanding Michael as a person so that he can fulfill his potential as a human being, which includes giving him opportunities such as what Coach Cotton initially saw in Michael as a potential American football player. The film ends saying that he'll succeed and become a professional player later on.The movies has a moral lesson behind it, in my opinion, it is to be open minded about your surrounding and everyone is unique and has a different way of learning things.",

            "content": "Heartwarming, inspiring, and memorable. The Blind Side directed by John Lee Hancock captures all of these emotions. Based on a true story of love and family, you will learn to protect your blind side.This movie is about the Touhy family and how they took in Michael Oher, an emotionally traumatized high school student who has a talent for playing football. The Touhy's are a wealthy Memphis family that includes Leigh Anne a headstrong designer and mother of two who first took action to Michael when she saw him talking to her son.This moving film had many great features including the contrast of characters and the actors who played them. Sandra Bullock's role as Leigh Anne was breathe taking thanks to her strong personality and not to mention her charming southern accent just for the role. Also, the different characters and background made this movie come to life. I honestly cried each time I saw this even though I knew all the parts. Because of the flashbacks and heart breaking events that took place I couldn't stop watching it. There was also a good balance between the football aspect and the background story to understand what was happening. I really appreciated the recognition this movie brought to people who are well known like Michael Oher. To most he is a just a football player but this movie expressed that even people who are popular or have a talent that is shared, still had a past to get there that may have been difficult. Another reason why I recommend seeing this movie is because its based on a true story. Throughout the show I couldn't help but think that their are people who have had negative events in their life such as these in the movie, but I almost feel like this movie brought a sense of awareness to that. Its also pretty amazing to watch Michael Oher's past and see what he is doing now. The best part about this though is the Touhy family. They created such a positive effect on Michael through their generosity and love. Not to mention Leigh Anne who first decided to help Michael. My absolute favorite part of this movie is when Leigh Anne is at a fancy lunch with her lady friends when they make a few comments about Michael. One lady says \"You're changing that boys life\". And Leigh Anne response is,\"No. He's changing mine.\"Overall, I completely recommend watching, renting, and even owning this movie because of it's heartfelt message of finding your strength and making your future brighter than your past with the help of kind people.",

Love and empathy just radiates from her character, no matter the situation.Another honorable mention goes to Quinton Aaron playing the wayward teenager, Michael Oher. Initially, he exudes the lack of self confidence and childlike qualities that you would expect from a kid that has been abandoned by his drug dependant mother. After being bounced around the system, he ends up couch surfing for a while but ultimately ends up homeless when he meets the Tuohy's.You don't have to love Football to love this movie, but it sure is better if you do!Excellent movie; well worth your time!",

            "content": "The characters were pretty two-dimensional, and were for the most part as transparent as glass. That is to say, you'll feel no sense of intrigue when introduced to the characters because you'll know exactly who they are and what their place is in the film as soon as they first appear. This is with exception to 'Michael' who was really the 'main' character of the film. Nonetheless, I felt this movie was more about everyone else being nice to him rather than being about him and the turmoil he had face being a young African-American coming from an impoverished background. Therefore you'll find that the one character you want to know more about remains some what of a mystery for the extent of the movie.The one character that stands out in this film is 'leigh Anne tuohy', played by Sandra Bullock. This character was 'The Blind Sides' biggest down side. She came across as being arrogant and self-righteous for the duration of the film. And although the character was supposed to be a heroine, it seemed to me the only reason she was doing the things she did was so she could feel smug and good about herself.Although the story itself was quite 'nice' and had some sentiment behind it, I found it very tedious to watch. There was no conflict of any kind in this movie and the plot was so predictable I felt like I knew what was going to happen before even the writers did.I understand that some people enjoy 'feel-good' movies, and on occasions, so do I. But this movie takes the genre to a whole new level- to the extent where you're just praying for something bad to happen to one of the characters just to add a bit of depth to the movie.If I were going to sum up the plot of this movie in one sentence it would be; things start off OK, they get better, everyone's happy, things get even better, every feels great, the end. If I were going to sum it up in one word it would be 'cheese'.If you're looking for a low brow, feel good movie that isn't going to make you think than this is the movies for you. If you want to sit down for an hour and fifty minutes and watch something that's going to make you feel so good about life that you're probably gunna want to puke afterwards then watch this film.The only reason I've given this movie a half decent rating is because I can see the merits of it, despite the fact I found it quite boring to watch. The dialogue, for the most part, is pretty good and the direction was brilliant. I just felt that it was poor story telling, for the reason that there was no real story- at least not one worthy of being made into a movie.",

            "content": "The juggernauts of gridiron cinema\u2014such as Rudy and Remember the Titans\u2014 almost all have one thing in common: they're unapologetically formulaic, but they're also extraordinarily well done. Sports movies of one variety or another are produced every year, but it's rare that any of them really leave a lasting impression on the collective American consciousness. More often than not, they're nothing more than exercises in the art of telling the classic inspiration story; you know, the faithful underdog overcoming crushing odds (think \"David and Goliath\"). In Rudy, it was all about a runt with larger-than-life aspirations. In John Lee Hancock's The Blind Side, it's all about a larger-than-life (literally) teen who just wants a bed he can call his own. He's not thinking about what will happen years down the road; he's only thinking about where he'll find his next meal.It's based on the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a down- and-out Memphis teen who regularly wanders in and out of foster homes. His mother is a coke-fiend, and he has no family to watch after him. However, thanks to the generosity of a friend, he's introduced to the football coach of a private Christian school and is admitted on the basis of his formidable athletic presence. Michael still has no home, however; he picks up half-eaten bags of popcorn at his school's gym after volleyball games so he's able to eat. He spends his evenings keeping warm inside a local laundromat.One night, Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wife of a wealthy fast-food entrepreneur, sees him walking the streets and brings him home. Her family provides him with new clothing and a bed of his own. All of this happens so quickly, in fact, that my first instinct was to say, \"Wow\u2014 this would never happen.\" The whole setup, in fact, seems so naively optimistic that it screams Hollywood contrivance. However, there's one catch to all this that's easy to forget: like the previously mentioned Rudy, it's a true story. As such, the movie has, to a certain degree, some wiggle room in terms of exploring scenarios that would otherwise reverberate as totally unrealistic or totally clich\u00e9d. I suppose, however, that clich\u00e9s sometimes receive their namesake because they are, in fact, reality for so many people.To my surprise, this fact actually causes The Blind Side to excel where other movies might've fizzled. The whole thing\u2014though often derivative\u2014 feels very \"matter-of- fact.\" The deeper into the story you go, the more genuine it feels. Wisely, Hancock has chosen to spin his tale by letting the actors and a steady camera do the work. There are no overly dramatic camera angles, and the soundtrack is minimal. The dialogue is a little over-the-top at times, but it's not so much that's distracting. Really, what we get here are a lot of unadorned scenes that depict our protagonist going about his daily activities, merely trying to survive. The 128-minute runtime does start to wear a little thin as things come to a close, but it's hard to imagine much of the story being cut. I guess that's one of the difficulties of telling a \"true story\": it's often hard to know what is essential and what's extracurricular.What really stands out in The Blind Side, however, is its penchant for probing the social class divide that so many Americans either ignore or pretend doesn't exist. Despite its references to Norman Rockwell and the plight of the working poor, I'm not quite ready to heap unconditional praise on the movie. It's exploration of these concepts is far from subtle, and is often presented in such a way as to almost shout, \"Hey, stupid! Do something about this!\" It's not that I question the film's call to action, it's just that its presentation is like a brick to the forehead. We're bombarded with images of dirty apartments, broken homes, and life \"on the other side of the tracks.\" My hope was that the movie's early use of flashback would get this particular job done in a much more subtle way, but Hancock and co. decided to take a more blunt approach that, in my estimation, takes a little something away from the overall \"bite.\"",

My heart felt like it was going to burst from such emotions. When I learned that this movie was based on a true story I was even more moved. I have to say Sandra Bullock did an amazing job, she has definitely grown as an actress. Quinton Aaron is a great actor and I'm glad he got his big break, I'm looking forward to see him in many new movies. I was very surprised to find out that that was Tim McGraw. I have never seen him without his iconic black cowboy hat, scruffy beard and drunk swagger. Hopefully he can do more movies in the future. Overall an amazing movie.",

            "review_title": "The movie Blind Side was a very inspiration movie",
            "content": "What we have is a young black kid at the age of seventeen yrs. old with a large body who grew up in the projects in Memphis, Tenn. He left his mother; because, she was a drug addicted, and he slept wherever he laid his head down; because, he did not want to be around that entire negative environment. With Michael's homeless circumstances, Tony Hamilton, Omar Dorsey like a father figure let him stay with his family. One day Tony introduced his son Steven, and Michael Ora, Quinton Araon to football Coach Burt Cotton, Ray McKinnon from Wingate Christian School a private school that may benefit the school's football program; because, of Michael's sizes, and moves. With a GPA.0.6 Michael was accepted to the school, and Michael started going to classes at Wingate. The teachers said, Michael Oher was unteachable, but there was this science teacher, Mrs. Boswell, Kim Dicken who believed in Michael, and needed a special tutor to help him get through school. There was this lady Mrs. Tuohy, Sandra Bullock mother of two kids one named Collins, Lily Collins, and S.J., Jae Head, and her husband name was Mr. Tuohy Tim McGraw the owner of a many Taco Bells who took Michael in has a family member to stay one night, but that one night turned out to be a lot of extra days, to weeks, months, and years of love, and emotions for both. This was an investment; because, Mrs. Tuohy was very patience with Michael as a young teenage so he could fulfill his dream as a human being, and a pro football player the left tackle for Wingate's football team. With Michael's academic problems in the way would prohibit extra activities; because, of his learning abilities, and his life beyond school, and he may not be able to play football. The People around town were asking questions to all the Tuohy's family members why they brought Michael Oher into their family. The theme that I like when the Tuohy family took to kindness; because, this family was friendly to people, help the poor, help other students giving Michael a place of growing up in a positive environment. The Tuohy family helped Michael Oher get his life on track when they noticed he was having problems in school. The Tuohy family proceeded giving him attention, and to get him a special patience tutors that helped him in the long term to graduate. This story of Michael Oher a 17yrs old boy who was homeless, and came from a broken home, and needed some guidance in the right direction to become a NFL draft pick behind love, kindness, and care coming from Mrs. Tuohy, and the family. In my opinion the acting was graces; especially Michael Oher, Quinton Araon acting the age of a 17 yr. old boy being that big with those basketball, and football moves, and taking his time using that graces acting role with a learning disability. What a way to act, being patience, and the way he talk the script, and moving his body language slow in certain scenes.The movie Miracle on ice is one of those family movies that the whole family can enjoy. The themes in this movie are just like the movie Blind Side where there is teamwork involved, leadership, and Mrs. Tuohy family dynamics; between Coach Burton, and the teachers who tutored him. They all helped him avoid negative language, and any bad behaviors to become a Michael Oher miracle for the Tuohy family; especially Mrs. Tuohy. Miracle, and Blind side, these two movies show what awesome things ordinary human beings can achieve when they believe in one self. With the juxtaposition close, long, mid, and full shots of Michael's neighborhood this gave the audience a feel of Michael's world living in the hood of Memphis, Tenn. The camera shots angles are used to show Michael's life in the hood and a complete full circle of his life being turned around, and being able to adapt to a wealthy family. These kinds of camera angles for example panning and tracking shots, show a group of black youngsters hanging out in the hood on the steps, faces full of hate, and lust like gangster faces; especially when Mrs. Tuohy Sandra Bullock pays a visit to Michael's hood. In my opinion it was the scene In Blind Side first movie where Coach Burton kept telling or yelling at Michael Oher no do not pick up that offensive player, and carry him, and Coach Burton kept going over the plays with the team, again, again, again; especially with the balloons in the air, and everybody stop, and looked at them; while, Coach Burton was yelling they are just balloons, back to practice over, and over repeatedly. This was the same theme as Miracle, Again, Again, Again trailer where you showed us in class two weeks ago a repeatedly motifs where Kurt Russel the coach kept telling his team again, again, again on the ice sprints. Courage can be like pulling at rabbit out of a top hat casting a magical spell telling it what to do wishing there was a rabbit in that hat. Any ordinary person can be brave, but have honor, that is life you make it happen or you do not make it happen. You hope for a Miracle again, again, again, and have the courage, honor to believe in oneself to win a Michael Oher, and the miracle on ice back in 1980.",

The Blind Side takes a heartwarming, charming story and turns the cringe up to a solid 10/10.The story takes us through the life of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) as he meets Sandra Bullock's Leigh Ann and has his life drastically turned around for the better. The narrative is the most alluring aspect of this movie, with the 'real-life' story of Michael and Leigh Ann's relationship providing most of the sentimentality. Michael is a loveable, gentle-giant that you instantly warm up to and Sandra Bullock provides a career best performance as the no-nonsense, (very) southern, cheerleader mom who takes Michael into her family home and under her wing.Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. The boring cinematography and the laughable score, reeked of TV Movie standards and at some points the film felt like a Disney Channel Original Film (and not a good one). The script was held back by it's cheesy dialogue and forceful attempts at humour (including an uncomfortable James Corden esque Carpool Kareoke that goes horribly wrong). The script offers no surprises and follows a very formulaic rythm, with most of the film being very easy to predict.Despite Sandra Bullock performing at her best, the cast still left a lot to be desired. RJ (Jae Head) was just wholly annoying ; the writer clearly not being able to write for kids, and Lily Collins' coincidentally named 'Collins' was a blank canvas of a character. The only stand out performance was a brief cameo from Kathy Bates -who is always brilliant- whereas the rest of the supporting cast seemed to be exaggerated caricatures (Including some scenes of Bullock's Leigh Ann).A corny score, cheesy dialogue, ridiculous characters, vapid acting and a predictable narrative leaves the Blind Side fumbling on a 4th down and long.4/10.",

Leigh Anne found out that Michael was homeless and wanted to adopt him formally, but because Michael's father had passed away, his mother could not raise him normally due to drug use, which made Michael an orphan. Leigh Anne's friend warned her that if Michael and Leigh Anne's children live together, it will affect their social relationship. Because of Michael's skin color, Lianne's friends worry that the school's students will reject or bully Lianne's children. After Michael joined the school's American football team and achieved excellent results, he was also selected by the University of Mississippi's American football team, but the NFL doubted the purpose of the Touhy family's adoption of Michael. This made Michael very sad and ran away from home. Michael was sad because he felt that he was being used, and the Touhy family didn't really treat him like family. After Michael ran away from home, the Tui family worked very hard to find him. After Michael came back, he told NFL investigators: \"This is where my family goes to school.\" Michael was willing to come back because Lianne told him that no matter what he wanted to do, she would support him, which convinced Michael that Lianne regarded him as his son.",

After Michael met Leigh Anne, he became a member of Tuohy's family. Not only did his life change, but it also made Leigh Anne think that her life was changed, too. Thanks to Michael's over-sized shape and amazing talent, he became a football player.In my opinion, you cannot choose the environment where you live or even every predicaments you meet. Despite that, we have the chance to struggle so as to overcome all the plight. In the process, it is necessary to find a reason to stand by you, such as the Tuohy to Michael.The part which I like the most is the lunch that Leigh Anne with her friends. When they are discussing Michael, one of the lady says\" You're changing that boy's life\", but Leigh Anne response, \"No. He's changing mine.\"Furthermore, I love the theme which can see SJ, the little son of Leigh Anne.

All I want to know is how did Mike leave the one guy who got him into the school? The movie never explains that for the viewers. They also didn't mention he was good in basketball. How many times do you see some big teenager walking around homeless? The movie is giving us a message that we need to have hospitality. Without that we are not caring. If you don't care for others you don't care for yourself. The family helps Mike academically and physically. SJ is a very funny child who loves attention. Would you put your life in danger for someone you love ? Mike was so good in football that he made it to the All-American team. Then he was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens.",

            "content": "The Blind Side, which came out in 2009, showed the struggles of a young blank highschooler as he integrated into a more white society. Michael Oher is a very protective and lonesome teenager who, due to his financial problems, lives from place to place without a real home. One of his teachers, Leigh Anne Tuohy, sees Michael after school, walking on a road. When Mrs.Tuohy asks michael if he has a home tonight, Michael confesses he does not, and Mrs.Tuohy graciously takes him in as one of her own. Throughout the movie, Michael learns how to express himself and learn to love those around him. Many movie critics loved the movie and Joe Leydon even described it as, \"Uplifting and entertaining feel-good, fact-based sports drama.\". The Blind Side scored a 67% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 82% in good reviews from movie goers. When I saw the Blind Side, I was touched by the kindness of other people's actions and inspired me to be more open when talking to people and not initially judging at first glances. The acting, while it showed enough emotion, was not as great as many other movies I have seen, it was well enough to advance the plot and help us understand the context of the movie. I liked the idea of the story and thought it was very heartfelt and definitely can make viewers emotional. However, due to the simplicity of the plot, there were many parts that were not as interesting or engaging in the movie. I enjoyed watching it but I do not feel the need to watch it again or suggest it to others.",

Leigh Ann (Bullock) and Shaun (McGraw) Tuohy take a young Michael (Aaron) under their wing, helping him to leave the demons of crack addict mother and poor upbringing behind him. Having no real education and chances few and far between for a \"Ghetto\" kid Leigh Ann, having a soft spot for Michael, takes control and ensures that he gets all the opportunities her own children have. Leigh Ann despite facing criticisms from her circle of friends for having taking in a \"black kid\", battles and when Michael express an interest in American football Leigh Ann ensures he gets the best coaching to make it. With a football coach and a tutor to help improve Michael's grades the offers for athletic scholarships pour in. Problems arise however as Michael must make his choice, and in doing so chooses a university to which the Tuohys have long been affiliated. People find the choice suspicious and so question the Tuohy's influence on young vulnerable Michael. This is a moving and emotional true story of a boy that with help from strangers became something spectacular. The greatness in what the Tuohy's did for Michael is captured in a brilliant performance from the whole cast. Sandra Bullock takes on the role of a strong Southern woman, but Bullock adds an element of humour which makes it all the more real. The role saw Bullock earn herself an Oscar and quite rightly so, her performance sees her step up a level; proving she can't only flex her funny muscles but can make you laugh and cry simultaneously. Bullock isn't the only star however, newcomer Quinton Aaron steps up to the mark in the lead role. Aaron brought the vulnerability and believability that makes you sit up and watch, and gives a performance that is well beyond his years. Country crooner Tim McGraw also gives a solid performance that doesn't look out of place against the heavy-weight of Bullock, and their on screen marriage is believable and enjoyable to watch. Hancock cast greatly and directed even greater a story which had to be approached without the attitude of a \"rag to riches biopic\", but instead a strong narrative of how one family changed the life of a young man in need. It's sad, compelling, and funny but above all true to the story of which is based on. Worthy of its rave reviews, The Blind Side is without doubt a fantastic example of simple film-making at its best.If you liked this please have a look at my blog:http://courtneywelsh1.blogspot.com/",

Everybody did an awesome job. There were a lot of hilarious moments, heart-breaking moments, and heart-warming moments throughout. A homeless 18 year old named Michael 'Big Mike' Oher is a quiet and peaceful person. He keeps to himself. He is under-educated because of his past. Leigh Anne Tuohy sees Michael and offers him a room in her house. He soon becomes apart of the family, because they adopt him. The Tuohy family help him become involved in football. Other coaches from universities see what he can do, and offer him a Scholarship. Michael goes on to become a #1 draft pick in the NFL. What could be better than that? I highly recommend THE BLIND SIDE!!!",

I first assumed that this movie would be centred all about football but every chance it gets the story that makes you want to laugh and cry all at the same time creeps up on you and somehow you forget that this film is even a sports story, thats how strong the story and the performances by the actors/actress that has been placed on screen affects you. This is a film that I would pay any amount of money to see again & again as it pulls at your heartstrings. One event that happened last night made me realize this film's staying power in Hollywood. As we came out from another film we had seen , a lineup had formed outside a theatre, we figured it was for Avatar or something. Now this theatre has kept showing The Blindside even though this is a theatre that keeps films on there screens for a max of 3 weeks.

Focusing on the basic story line of a women with a vision and a pure heart with the support of her family and a young man with great will power and potential. Simple, moving and straight to the point. The Blind Side included some great acting, even though i believe that some characters in the movie were downplayed and with the help of an inspiring story i give this movie a 9/10",

It is the Story of how one very large teenage boy who has not had an easy life makes it to the National Football League. Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron is a teenage boy who has been in out of foster homes his whole life. Michael gets the opportunity to go to a private school. At the private school he meets the Tuohy family. The Tuohy's are made up of Leigh Anne Tuohy a southern belle who knows how to get things done played by Sandra Bullock, Sean Tuohy the Husband of Leigh Anne Tuohy played by Tim McGraw, the families two children S.J. Tuohy played by Jae Head and Collins Tuohy played by Lily Collins. The Tuohy family is well off and has most of the things they want. Mrs. Tuohy finds she has a soft spot for Michael and invites him into their home. Michael and the Tuohy family's lives will change forever.The very power theme of the movie is that individuals can overcome their circumstance if given the right opportunities and when they make the right choices. Throughout the movie Michael and the Tuohy family have to face some challenging choices. They all have to make sacrifices and they all get the chance to learn from each other. The Blind Side reminds me of a movie called Rudy. The two movies are completely different stories but in both movies you have a young man who faces hard odds and come out on top.\nIn the movie The Blind Side, director John Lee Hancock uses great lighting and camera angles to make the story come to life. When Michael is on the football field you are on the football field as well. The sounds in the movie match perfectly to the feelings of what the viewer is watching. Sounds are the best effect in the movie. The sounds, be it the dialogue, sound effects or music are very well done. In one scene Michael gets into the car accident. He is driving his truck when out of the blue, he hits another vehicle. The smashing of the truck into the other truck, the brakes squealing, the sound of the airbag being deployed and the smashing of the glass is so real it makes the views feel like they saw the accident in person.The Blind Side is entertaining with outstanding performances and great dialogue. This is definitely a movie worth the 129 minutes of run time. I recommend this movie for family viewing.",

One of the main character is Quinton Aaron called who character name is Michael Oher( Big Mike) is what they call him. Michael was a homeless African American teenager with no parents to guide him in the right direction. As Sandra Bullock who character name is Leigh Anne Tuohy a strong women doesn't take no for an answer. Leigh Anne narrates the beginning giving some incite to this movie. Leigh Anne says the left tackle is suppose support the quarter back blindside. By the end of the story you will understand what she means. As Michael sleeps at different homes just when he thinks it may be permanent things change. A custodian Big Tony working at Briarcrest Christian Academy asked the football coach Burt Cotton if he would help his son and his son's friend Big Mike who had been sleeping on his couch get into to the school for a good education. Once Coach Cotton saw Big Mike he immediately went to the board of the school to convince them to let the two kids in even if it was for selfish reasons on the coach's part. Big Tony wife wanted Michael gone off her couch and out of her home. So now Michael at a new school with no friends and nowhere to live his first day of school was overwhelming but he got thru it. At the end of the day the teacher meet up as they were discussing the day the teacher started talking about how horrible of a student Michael is. They were stereotyping him when one teacher Mrs. Boswell spoke up and said as a teacher none of you have even taken the time to even help Michael. Now that Michael has nowhere to go he goes to the Laundromat to clean the few clothes he has and sleep in the school gym. Michael soon makes a friend named Sj Tuohy one day after Sj's school play on a cold raining day Leigh Anne and her husband Sean Tuohy see Michael out in the cold rain once Leigh Anne finds out that he has nowhere to go. She invites Michael to their home the day before Thanksgiving for a night. Michael agrees to one night after Leigh Anne gets Michael together for the night. Leigh Anne second guesses her decision because she has a strange in the house with her son Sj and daughter Collins. Once the family has got to know Michael Leigh Anne decides to take him under her wing. This family was not prepared for all the racism they were receive or lack of help because she decide to help Michael .Once Michael got his grades up from the teachers helping him he goes out for football with his little buddy/brother Sj as his trainer/ manager . Michael starts getting a lot of unexpected attention from college Coaches with Sj help l.o.l. The Tuohy soon realize that Michael needs to get a better GPA so they hire Miss Sue to help. Michael graduates with a 2.52 just when you think Michael life is coming together he gets investigated by the NCAA. Michael decision to go to Old Mist didn't sit well with NCAA they felt it was forced by The Tuohy family. Michael had to explain to Sharon Morris that this was his decision. This movie can also be compared to a new movie from Disney called Safety (2020) also a true story about a teenager trying to make thru with any help from his parent.

The Blind Side (2009.) written and produced by Micheal Lewis and Broderck Johnson, although categorized as a drama, is one of the most fulfilling, kindhearted, yet emotional films I have viewed, even more so because it is based upon a true story.In the film we watch as the homeless teenage boy, Micheal Oher who is played by Quinton Aaron residing in Memphis, Tennessee's foster care system since a young child. We witness as he is an inspiration when Leigh Ann Touhy, played by Sandra Bullock, decides to take him in as their son. As we get further into the film and get to know Michael or also referred to as \"Big Mike\", we see his lack of education and big heart open up, and form a relationship with their younger son S. J, Sean Jr. Touhy, played by Jae Head. S. J.'s character becomes Mikes coach and begins to encourage his in succeeding in both in education and on the field when he joins the school's football team. Michael's character reveals a protective instinct over the family and this becomes the reason for his success on and off the field.The emotion brought to the screen by Mike's character or better known as, \"the gentle giant\" displays a sense of happiness and you can't help but to smile while watching this film. Sandra Bullock, also winning and being nominated for many awards for her role casted as Michael's adoptive mother. Her sentimental moments are the reason why this film is so fulfilling and heartfelt. Revealing her warm heart the night Michael says he has never had his mother read him a book as a child, then later that evening he and S. J. laying alike as Leigh Ann reads one of S. J.'s favorite books. Later she references back to him being like the character on the football field. After watching this scene, it made me want to go grab a book and read to my own son!The technique of the make-up, customs and hair made the actors bring fourth more of the characters role along with emotion that ties to deep into each shot. The hair made the character come alive for Leigh Ann, as the clothes made Michael, and brought out more of his social class and personality. The clothing and angels also elaborates on Big Mikes size and his features, which are also symbolic to the role.Production design, by Michael Corenblith, takes us into the structure and the differences between the economic classes of the rich and the poor in the film when Michael takes Leigh Ann to his neighborhood. From the Touhy family's house and the area of where the school is to the ride to Michael's area where he resides from we see a drastic change in social structure. The larger houses become apartments and the color fades to natural and less bright displaying the care and worn parts of the neighborhood where Michael is from.In correlation, if you follow the actor Adam Sandler, who plays in the film, The Water Boy, it also displays the potential of another young man fighting to face the odds and become successful in football as well. This film has the same effect on our emotions with sympathizing scenes as well.The Blind Side is an outstanding representation of how people can be uplifting to one another no matter their race or economic status. America can take not to this family and their story.The film is simply a realistic movie with much intent to inspire and change the viewer's lives!",

Quinton Aaron plays the gentle giant, Michael Oher. Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw play Michael's adoptive parents, Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy. Kathy Bates stars as Michael's tutor and friend, Miss Sue. Many actual college coaches make appearances through out the film such as Lou Holtz and Nick Saban.To say that Michael Oher is an overcomer would be an understatement. From a young age, Michael had to deal with a mom that was a drug addict. His father passed away and he was left on his own. Being passed from one foster house to another, then living on the streets, he eventually crosses paths with a man named Burt Cotton that was the coach of a high school football team. Michael's size and athletic ability made him a perfect fit to join Coach Cotton's team. Michael becomes friends with a younger student named SJ, and is eventually taken in by SJ's family, the Tuohy's.Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy care for Michael as if he were one of their own children. Leigh Anne connects with him like any mother connects with her son. She fights for him and pushes him to grow academically, with the help of Miss Sue, as well as on the football field. The Tuohy's make sure that Michael is not only on track to get a high school diploma, but that he also will be able to continue his education while playing college football. Their alma mater, Ole Miss, would be their top choice for Michael but knew the decision had to be his own. He meets with many different Division I coaches and struggles with what would be the right decision for his future. Some people in the NCAA thought the Tuohy's care of and interest in Michael was born out of their desire to make sure he played football for Ole Miss. The NCAA authorities even begin to make Michael question the Tuohy's sincerity. Eventually, after returning to his old neighborhood and realizing how far he has come with the help of his new family, Michael casts away all his doubt of Leigh Anne and Sean and returns home.Michael does eventually pick Ole Miss, but not because the Tuohy's wanted him to. He does it because he felt like it was were his family goes to college. He had found his true home with his forever family. Not since Remember the Titans had a sports film had such a strong impact on so many viewers. Michael Oher's strength in character shines through the actor honored to portray him in this movie. He deserves all of the success that he achieved through his perseverance and hard work.The director does amazing work showing the contrast between Michael's original neighborhood and the surroundings that he is eventually brought into. The settings make the viewer feel that the scenes were actually filmed in Michael's home town. Pulling the actual college coaches in to meet with Michael for recruiting purposes was another incredible aspect of the film making it feel that much more true to real life.",

            "content": "The Blind Side does nothing short but hit home, Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw do a phenomenal job of coming together to take in this man who is homeless and rugged looking. While raising two other children of their own, and fighting the many battles of two, very much Caucasian taking in an African American. On a side note who is freakishly tall to say the least. Most would be quick to judge and assume that he is stealing from them, or using them. But \"Big Mike\" was just grateful to have a home and a place to lay his head at night. He didn't know how to react or what to expect because he had been homeless for so long. His mother was a drug addict and was not able to provide for him. When Leigh Ann (Sandra Bullock) observes this she acts fast on taking him home, and what was thought to just be a few nights turned into Leigh Ann and Sean (Tim McGraw) adopting him and eventually sending him off to college. This changed both his life and their own and their children as well. You can easily see that this film contains a drama theme. While it could also be a \"sport\" themed movie, due to Michael becoming a well renown football star, I really think that drama is the most important piece here.Sandra and Tim do an excellent job, parenting together, bringing this man into their lives, despite the judgements they Receive from people in the community. As well as the judgements that SJ and Collins are thrown into for being white and being around Michael is is not white. Those are just some prime examples of why this has a theme of drama. Michael had been in and out of schools, and Leigh Ann wanted him enrolled in the private Christian school where the other kids are going, while he really struggled with school due to being in and out of the school system, his athletic ability is what got him into this private school.The acting by all characters is nothing short of excellent, these specific actors work really well together and make this film seem more realistic as it is based on a true story. I would say that motif is a common and appropriate technique, due to the repetitive judgments that the family is getting for taking Michael in, the other important technique is lighting, especially in the scenes where Michael is in the field playing football. All of this easily ties together making this a drama film, also showing the love that this family creates for Michael to make him feel at home, and feel accepted into their family.",

            "content": "The Blind Side is one of the most inspiring movies of all time. However, I feel like that that movie should have done better in the box office. Based on a true story, current NFL player Michael Ore has had a rough life since childhood before getting drafted by the Baltimore Ravens. He was taken by the state from his mother at a very young age and had nowhere to go until a family adopted him and got him to get a football scholarship to the University of Mississippi. They gave him everything he needed like a tutor for school, a truck, a place to live, even his own room that he never had anything like one before. This movie shows that even if you had a very rough childhood, you can still make the best out of life because of it. Even though the movie did do well by receiving over $255 million, it could have still done better, especially if it's based on a true story. The one star that really shines out in the movie is Sandra Bullock, who plays as the mother of the family that adopted Michael. Sandra Bullock has always done great movies, but I believe that \"The Blind Side\" is by far her greatest movie yet just because of how she acts like it was really happening in real life.",

            "content": "The Blind Side directed by John Lee Hancock is based on the true story of football player, Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron. Before NFL football he didn't always have it easy. The story of the Blind Side tells the story of how he came to play. Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy played by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw take Michael into their home after finding him freezing walking down the street with only the clothes on his body and an extra shirt in a bag. They start by feeding and clothing him then giving him a bed to stay. Eventually they adopt him and become his legal guardians. Due to Michaels size he has the name Big Mike and the football coach fights for him to be admitted into the private Christian school and try out for football. Before this Michael was sadly taken out of his home away from his mother and running out of foster systems. He was from the projects and his mother had drug problems. They show an idea of how bad things were in that area. With Leigh Anne and Sean's support along with his siblings Collins and S.J (Lily Collins and S.J.) his new siblings, this act of kindness changes Michael's life along with all of theirs. This leads me into the theme. Kindness goes a long way is the reoccurring theme I see throughout the movie. The Tuohy's were shown to just be true good people, their integrity was questioned when they hired a dedicated tutor to help get his grades up so Michael could get a scholarship to their alma mater, Ole Miss. They tell Michael he can go wherever he wants for school and asked if he even wanted to play football. Sean Tuohy said, \"I would do it again tomorrow\" Referring to adopting someone in need. At a lunch, Leigh Anne's friend says she is changing Michael's life and her response is \"he's changing mine.\" Another act of kindness is shown by his science teacher. She reads the tests to him and proves he is absorbing the material in class. The other teachers have their doubts and she defend him. Compassion, empathy and kindness are big motifs throughout. Another with a similar theme is Disney's Inside Out. It depicts the emotions in your head as characters. This shows how feelings are expressed and to empathize with other people's feelings. Another element in the film that plays a role in the theme is color. The movie touches on racism and the school is primarily white. Michael writes down that all around him is white, the floors and walls and people. Leigh Anne also says they need to get more color in the school. This inspires her suggestion to fund a charity for people like Michael to get quality educations. Overall this is truly inspiring story and feel good movie. I always have thought acts of kindness can make a huge difference whether you realize it or not. Be kind always.",

After watching the movie; one feels that Quintin WAS Michael. He transformed. That is what acting is all about. If 'acting' were the football field; Sandra gets slammed. Seems rather ironic that just because Sandra Bullock has a 'name' that all the acting accolades are pointed towards her. In fact; I would say all four main actors (including the young boy) actually did a better job than Ms. Bullock. But the winner is clearly Quintin. Hmmm. Is there something 'stinky' about Quintin not getting much attention? Is it possibly because he's not pretty and white? MbF",

            "content": "This feel-good, inspirational movie is a must-watch for anyone. Quinton Aaron, who plays Michael Oher; is born to a mother who is addicted to drugs. At a young age, he is taken away from his mother, he is then forced to find a place to stay almost on a nightly basis until the parents of a student at his new school decide to take him in. Michael is a massive human being, that most people are scared of. Not everyone was scared of Michael though. Leigh Ann Tuohy, played by the highly regarded Sandra Bullock, and Sean Tuohy, played by the famous country singer Tim McGraw; decide to allow Michael to stay at their place for a night. Spoiler, it isn't just one night.Michael is accepted into Wingate Christian High School mostly because of his athletic ability, teachers assumed he was dumb, they thought he was a troubled kid. After getting into the school, Michael was found on the side of the street by the Tuohy family in the dark, in the pouring rain. The Tuohy's are a wealthy family with a huge house, lots of spare room for Michael, but it was thought to only be a one-night stay. The Tuohy's start to work with Michael on his grades and try to get him eligible for football. This wasn't an easy task, but they got it done, Michael then turns into one of the best football players in the country and is wanted by every college in the country. The major theme of this film is to not judge a book by its cover, Michael was a very smart man, he was very kind and gentle, and he was far from a troubled kid. This theme is the same theme seen throughout another sports film, Rudy (1993), people view him as a scrawny boy who couldn't play football, but he proves them wrong.Throughout the film, we notice dark lighting during the hardships Michael endured, as a way to emphasize what he has had to deal with. We can recall the moment Michael was homeless and was forced to go to the laundromat, it was pouring down rain and was pitch black outside. Another scene that comes to mind is when the Tuohy family first finds him, it was pouring down rain and also dark outside. Lastly, when Michael goes back to look for his mother, he is talked into coming into visit some old people he used to know, the room is all dark and a shooting eventually breaks out. Despite what people thought of Michael, throughout all the dark moments and troubles he went through, he never got on the wrong path. Occasionally we see the director sprinkle in flashbacks of Michael's troubled childhood throughout the film. These were thrown into the film to show you what Michael has dealt with; how easy it would've been for him to go down the wrong path, but he didn't. But as the film taught us, don't judge a book by its cover, Michael Oher went from homeless to making the NFL and being a multi-millionaire.",

This scene certainly made me realize how racist society is that people can judge someone based on their race, sex, gender, appearance, and social status, therefore, making many people become a victim of racial injustice.Sandra Bullock definitely deserves recognition for acting as Leigh Anne. Her acting is decent and superior as her tone of voice, gesture, eye contact, and many other things she performed on the screen made me highly getting involved and feel emotional with the plot even more. She is one of the reasons why I started to watch this film and also replay it a few times.Although there are many things I like in this film, I would like to point out that the ending was not great. As an audience, I supposed it would be great if there are more scenes after Michael gets drafted as I am curious about the further relationship between Michael and his adoptive family after he became successful and also how well he does in his professional career.",

Tuohy, and Lila Collins as Collins Tuohy to round out the family. Based on a true story, Michael was brought up from a troubled past in Memphis, Tennessee led by his mother who was addicted to alcohol and drugs. Michael was homeless throughout his childhood and often didn't have a place to go until Leigh Anne Tuohy came along and saw Michael walking in the street while it was pouring down with rain. Little did Leigh know that her, her family and Michael's life as well would be changed forever. The story follows Michael and his new family Tuohy's journey as Michael moves in and changes his high school to join a much better football team where he would become an all-American all the way up to eventual first round pick in the National Football League (NFL).This film is a well-rounded mix of emotion and triumph as Michael fights through his past and current demons to better himself as well as the people around him. The overall theme of this film is, in my opinion, beating the odds. From coming from literally being homeless to a first round NFL draft pick is seriously something straight out of a fairy tale. It's absolutely unheard of, until this film and Michael Oher's story was released in 2009. This film is similar in theme to one of the all-time great films, Coach Carter. If you haven't seen Coach Carter by now stop everything you are doing, find Coach Carter on whatever platform you can, and sit down for two plus hours and appreciate greatness. It's a lot to compare these films and their work but the themes are very similar in that Michael Oher and the Richmond High School Boys Basketball team beat the odds and achieve things that will live on forever in a shining bright light for others to be inspired to do just the same, beat the odds.The Blind Side uses multiple techniques that we have been reading about in our class textbook as well. For instance, the film displayed multiple moments of flash cuts, jump cuts, montages, and slow motion to really maximize the viewers pleasure and attention. This was a nicely blended balance of cuts and use of cinematography as well. Overall, I recommend just about anyone to watch this film and if films with the theme are beating the odds this is most definitely one that will catch your attention.",

Quinton Aaron who played Michael Oher was an All AMerican football player who stood out, Michael was a homeless child who got took in by the family of Sandra Bullock - Leigh Ann, Tim Mcgraw - Seam, following the children Jae Head- S. J., and lasty Lilly Collins, Collins and later becomes his legal family members. With the help of Ray McKinnon - Coach Cotton seeing his potential. Michael made it to the NFL. This movie had great editing, and the overall theme was stunning.This movie has great editing and with the credit from Mark Livolsi he did an amazing job gathering all the lighting together to make sure that nothing was too dark or light. The script went well with the scenes and background of the movie. The camera work is nice and clear, especially in a movie made in 2009. The characters were put in the correct angles so that the light was captured in the correct scenes. When it came to the music in the background there were some intense moments that brought in dramatic music and the calmer moments brought in peaceful music. The producer John Lee Hancock did not need much thinking to do plot wise because it was based on a true story.The theme I got from this movie was Love and kindness. I say this because when leigh Ann and Sean let Michael in their home as a kindness of their heart knowing they didn't have to, but they still did anyways. He got what he wanted and made it to the NFL with the help of the family following his dreams. Michael even had good sibling's aka leigh Ann and Sean kids, S. J. and Lilly Collins. Another time the theme went perfectly in his film was when S. J. went on a ride with Michael in his brand-new car, it was always love between the two, never a dull moment. Even after Michaels got S. J. in the car accident everybody still loved him the same way.Overall great movie especially being based off a true story. Michael had a great story to tell and a great family to back him up. I would give this movie a ten out of ten especially because it teaches you a lesson. Never let anyone feel abandoned, it is always good to take people in because you never know the goals, they have that they can reach but can't because there in the system feeling abandoned. Everyone needs love.",

            "review_title": "An excellent story, and a well-executed performance",
            "content": "The Blind Side is a well-executed performance by the involved cast and is written slightly overdramatically. It is sure to be a tearjerker. Quinton Arron plays Michael Oher and gives an excellent performance. The story follows a young man taken in by a wealthy family and pushed to his potential as an offensive tackle playing football for a private school, moving on to college, and eventually the NFL. Michael comes from poverty and is abandoned by his drug-addicted mother. He is left to sleep on a friend's couch, and when he is no longer welcome, the Tuohys pick Michael up one rainy night and allow him into their home and hearts. Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw play Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy, the wealthy parents that take Michael in and eventually become his legal guardians. He is coached by the Tuohy's young son SJ, played by Jae Head, and Coach Cotton, played by Ray McKinnon. Coach Cotton is slightly overbearing and passive-aggressive but an equally supportive football coach. He is disappointed in his decision to let Michael on the team initially but is quickly impressed after a pep talk from Leigh Ann spurs his \"protective instincts.\" The Tuohys help Michael reach his full potential as a student and an athlete.Mark Livolsi is credited with editing this film, and his work is nearly flawless. There is a flow that keeps the story moving, and not an extreme amount of suspense is created, which is uncharacteristic of a film of this length. At 2 hours and 8 minutes this is a longer film, but it is not full of filler material, the story is just on the longer side. Thematic elements are appropriate as well and not overly obtrusive or disruptive to the theme. The film makes use of a lot of bright lighting and many outdoor scenes making solid use of natural light. This is suggestively symbolic of the brightness the characters bring into each other's lives. Camera work is not overbearing or dull. It seems to portray the characters equally, except for Leigh Ann. She is often shot from low angles to give a dominating stature. She often owns the screen even though Michael is about a foot taller. Camera distance is used in variation with medium shots making up the most influential scenes.At times, I believe Bullock's performance overshadowed Arron's role and the theme, but she was intended to be a strong independent character. She acts in a dominating capacity controlling the other characters with her manipulation and always getting her way. The way she takes charge and asserts dominance over the other characters is like different roles Bullock has played, such as her acting in Crash or Miss Congeniality. Michael being African American adds to his struggles as a student-athlete who is already dealt a lousy hand. The theme is about overcoming life's obstacles and carries tones of racial inequality within school systems. Michael had issues getting into a private school at the film's beginning because of his below-average grades. Also, it is implied his race is not helpful in getting admission into Wingate. Michael is subjected to different prejudicial circumstances as we follow him through his high school journey. He is even called racial slurs at a game by an opposing teammate's father, to which Leigh Ann assertively reacts. This scene is included to show racism is still alive and a real problem in the new south. The theme also brings to light various issues surrounding morality within athletics departments. Coach Cotton is shown using deceptive practices and dishonesty to further his football program and career. Also, the underserving of African American communities is an issue in the beginning hence why Michael comes to Wingate with a friend. There is a strong family dynamic created and an unbreakable bond between the characters as they help each other to be their best selves.This reiteration of a true story is heartfelt and wholesome and is indicative of John Lee Hancock's writing style. This film has no shortage of emotional scenes and sad situations that can make one reflect. It could be viewed as an overdramatization, but Michael's story is triumphant; the obstacles this young man had to overcome on his journey to the NFL were nothing short of spectacular. This story is not without deviation from the real one, and such is not uncommon when fitting a true story to the big screen. Nonetheless, it is without a doubt that adherence to facts was of some importance to John Lee Hancock and the producer, Molly Smith. This well-crafted film is well deserving of a 7.6 out of 10 rating.References:Lewis, M. (2007). The Blind Side. WW Norton.",

It's heavy at times but has a great story and will make you want to do great things. The acting was also very good. Sandra Bullock did an awesome job playing a semi-serious role after starring in \"The Proposal\" and \"All About Steve.\" Tim McGraw played the husband and also did a good job. This movie is appropriate for most audiences but it depends on how well you know your kids. I recommend this movie to everyone because even if it doesn't look like your kind of movie, you will get something out of it. I was happy that Sandra Bullock received Best Actress In A Drama for \"The Blind Side\" but didn't see how Avatar was a drama and beat The Blind Side and how the Blind Side wasn't even nominated for Best Drama but was relieved that she still received Best Actress. Just because a film doesn't make millions upon millions of dollars in the box office doesn't mean it's not a good film. So I say you need to see this movie!",

The story line is very inspiring, because the movie told one way how to be a good Christian family when you live at United states (because there were many dialogue that mention about Christianity). And the journey of the poor boy Michael Oher, who at the first did not know the Tuohys and then became a part of The Tuohys and protector for the youngest member of the tuohy, S.J. Tuohy.The screenplay was very good, you can see many parts of their life. From the first time when The Tuohys met Michael until he got to the university. And there are real footage and pictures from the real character too, and they really helped me to knew the real persons behind the story.I wasn't very surprised when Sandra Bullock got an Oscar for her performance as Leigh Anne Tuohy, because she had done a great job by acting as a kind rich mother. Especially her accent, it was very convincing.Don't worry just because that this is a drama movie so you have to cry all along. I think this movie is fun to watch.

            "content": "Michael Oher is a seventeen year old teenager whose life had been a living hell . He was taken from his drug addicted mama at an early age and spent his life changing foster families since.Luck smiled at him when he met Leigh Anne Tuohy . She and her whole family gradually adored him and eventually he became a part of that family . As time was passing by he adapted to his new life and with his will and support he had ,he became a NFL athlete.What a movie that was ! Even though it's another happy ending movie ,you never know what's gonna happen next with \"Big Mike\" because of his mysterious behaviour .While it is not as dramatic as it may seem at first , it's your loss if you don't watch this movie !",

I highly recommend the book, it's a nice read, and the story is good and I personally hate football so that is saying something that I like this movie, as for people reviewing it and complaining that Sandra Bullock should not have won and all that blah blah blah... that is your opinion and save it for the People's Choice Awards because her peers decided she was the best this year.",

So, pathetically, I went into the movie ALONE. but just after the movie started, I didn't feel lonely anymore. It's a movie about football, but not much a bout football, it's actually about the love between two strangers, that sometimes made you feel really heartwarming. Personally, I don't like Sandra with blond hair, but it did help her to portray the character to make it more realistic. The unreserved love happens between a family and a homeless boy. It's really moving when you saw how they treat him. I was not a football fan before, but now I'm starting to have some interested in it. hope you guys enjoy that",

I Had the opportunity to see the family that this film is based on the Huckabee program on Fox. Gov. Huckabee ask the husband if his wife was really like the portrayal by Sandra Bullock he said yes. This is a true American story and one we need to repeat and copy. The actor that played Michael was great you could look into his eyes and see what he had been thru.",

Also I congratulate the film makers on the scene when Michael Oher was pushing the two little girls on the swings, it was good to see a lovely gesture not made into something more sinister, its sad that I notice this. I really enjoyed this film and its not often you don't want a film to end . It was nice to see the family photos on the end credits. Another thing I loved was Michael was loved by his new family and it does not matter about blood or the colour of you skin . I shall go to bed with sweet dreams. Sandra Bullock was amazing as always, she really made me forget that she is an actress and not Micheals mama . The two you actors that played SJ and Collins were very talented especial SJ . Tim McGraw was very good and like every good man he made sure he agreed with his wife or are they so close that he just knew. I really enjoyed Kathy Bates I admit was a bit worried about her character at 1st but it was set perfectly .",

            "content": "This 2009 drama follows the Touhy family as they learn that love and compassion reach past what makes them different. When Leighann Touhy (played by Sandra Bullock) meets Michael Oher, she is immediately drawn to him. After a difficult childhood with an absentee Father and drug addict Mother, the African American teenager was homeless and fending for himself. After much persistence, Leighann convinces Michael to spend time with her family. He quickly finds that he has a place within the family despite their obvious differences. With the help of Leighan, her husband Shawn (played by Tim McGraw), daughter Collins, and son SJ, Michael becomes a star football player who completes his high school diploma and earns a college football scholarship.One great example of Leighann Touhy's love for Michael is when she travels to speak with his Mother. Leighan wanted to adopt Michael, but knew needed permission from his Mother. In order to do that, Leighann had to travel to a dangerous part of town and risk her safety. Leighann know the dangers of this neighborhood from a previous trip with Michael where he made her stay in the car. This word of caution from Michael did not stop her from making this trip alone. She did this knowingly and willingly because she wanted to give Michael a permanent place in their family. To portray the danger in the neighborhood, the scene was shot in an area with run-down apartments that were close together. The element of fear for Leighann's safety was the use of people to crowd the neighborhood in small groups. This example plays on the common fear that women are in danger when they travel alone. A technique that was used to give viewers the idea that Michael's Mother's apartment was run-down was the use of lighting. The lighting was dark, giving the impression that the house was dingy. While the story of The Blind Side is in a class all of its own, parts of the story do resemble that of the 2003 movie Radio. Both movies are about strangers who come across a child in need. Through love and understanding these strangers take these children and help them to find their true potential in the game of football. They teach that love reaches beyond differences. It sees no color, social class, or social norms. Love is pure and unconditional and this is demonstrated in both movies.",

            "review_title": "Great Feel Good Movie",
            "content": "I'm not a movie buff but this one tops all the movies I've seen in a while. It stars Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy, Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher, the main character, and the son of Leigh Anne and Sean and Jae Head as SJ. The movie has a great plot filled with caring individuals who although come from different cultures, showed lots of care for each other. Leigh Anne during many moments of disappointment never stopped caring nor expressed any negative judgment for Michael and neither did her family. Throughout the movie many social issues were touched making the viewers uncomfortable at times but handled very well by all the actors. There were scenes of anger, happiness, sadness,compassion, and greed. Surprise visits of famous sports figureheads were enjoyable throughout the film as well. It's nice to see a movie once in a while that touches the heart by showing that people in today's society still care. I would put this movie in the category with the \"The Green Mile\". A story about the lives of guards on death row leading up to the execution of black man accused of child murder & rape, who has the power of faith healing and a gentle giant,played by Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey. It is obvious that Bullock, McGraw and Aaron are the leading roles in this movie but Jae Head, SJ, the son hits a home run on this one. His role was quite entertaining as he takes in Michael \"Big Mike\" as his brother, trainee,and best friend and never gives up on him. I felt this movie was good for the entire family to enjoy with great acting and a good plot from the beginning to end. This was my second time seeing the movie and just like the first time I enjoyed it and was not bored. Each segment of the movie played a significant role in the plot and if altered would have had a profound effect on the movie as a whole. The Cinematographers,Directors and Producers set the lighting just right from scene to scene to capture your attention during the moment. A great example is during the football game scene where things were not looking so good for \"Big Mike\", the producers lowered the lights to give the viewer a since of feeling alone with Mike as he filled the screen with his massive size. Most of the scenes were shot from a wide angle to capture Big Mike as well because of his size.This was an absolutely delightful, heart-warming, \"happy-ending\" story. It reminded me of the good-side of humankind for a change. A great feel good movie.",

            "content": "In the movie The Blind Side, Sandra Bullock does a great job portraying Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wife of a successful fast-food entrepreneur and the mother of two children who ends up taking in a homeless teenager who also happens to be African American.Although this movie has a numerous areas that are serious, Sandra doesn't disappoint in getting the audience to laugh in this movie written and directed by John Lee Hancock. Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron, has a long way to go to become the football star he is today. In fact, he never even played football before meeting the Tuohy family. The Tuohy family takes him in on the first night they meet him and they end up raising Oher to become an integral part of a team as their left tackle.Although this movie has a few misses in a few scenes, Hancock does a good job of getting the performances he needs out of the actors in this movie.Tim McGraw plays the husband who can't tell his wife no and because of that often finds himself in Leigh Anne's shadow however there are times in the film where he makes her character seem warmer. During the first part of the film, Leigh Anne comes across as being a tough parent but finds herself going through changes and learning more about herself. The Blind Side is a movie about how a family transforms itself and not just about how Leigh Ann made Michael Oher into a football star. The truly inspiring part of the movie comes after the credits start to roll as we are given a view into the life of the real Michael Oher and Tuohy family. The Blind Side is a sentimental movie that will pull on your heart strings.",

            "content": "I like movies and my favorite genre is drama and documentary. I watched the movie 'Blind side' without hesitation because it is human drama which is based on a true story.For me, Blind side was like a hot chocolate in cold winter day. This movie is filled with warmhearted humanity, courage and love. I laughed, contemplated and was moved to tears.The director is John Lee Hancock who directed the movie Rookie, in 2002. Rookie is also a sports drama, especially baseball. Blind side is a story of young promising American football player Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). The plot sees a white family in Memphis, Tennessee. Sean (Tim McGraw) and Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) are couple and they have two children, Collins (Lily Collins) and S.J. (Jae Head). Sean is a CEO of big restaurant and Leigh Anne is a successful furniture designer so this family is quite rich. One day, Leigh Anne brings a poor homeless black teenager boy Mike(Quinton Aaron) to her home and she and her family accept and support him. Leigh Anne helps him to show and improve his ability as a football player, especially a left tackle who should protect other players in the area, the blind side.As I mentioned, this movie is based on a true story so it is absolutely predictable. Acting and compacted storyline made up for this weakness instead. All the actors did a good job. Tim McGraw was a tolerant and well-mannered father. The daughter Lily Collins was normal teenage girl who is looked chilly but warmhearted. The son Jae Head took a role of humor in this movie. Even the freckles on his face were so cute with his chatter. Quinton Aaron's appearance was suitable for the left tackle football player and also his job was not bad. There was one other famous actress, Kathy Bates, and her acting was great, too. Most of all, Sandra Bullock did an amazing job. There are many critics about her acting and her Oscar, and even I think she is little bit lucky. This movie contains many typical 'Academy style' elements like family, American dream, human drama etc and there were no striking candidates. With these advantages, Sandra Bullock acted well. She looked like a real mother who loved her children and her smile, worry, anger and tears are understated. The scenes and music was not noticeable but not bad. The scenes of football play were not exaggerated such as pausing too much. The music also takes its role honestly as a background setting. All other elements redounded to the plot, I think. Some people criticize this movie and say that it looks like a folk tale or Disney, but all humans want to live with happiness. 'Happily ever after' looks old-fashioned, but nobody wants an unhappy future. Dreams come true if you really want and try. It's very common and usual saying.'With us, this is possible. With god, all is possible.' This impressive sentence was the motto of the school of Mike and other two kids. Despite the religious mood, I was touched so much. I want to remember and keep it. Go and see the movie and dream of your 'Happily ever after' with Blind side.",

            "content": "When I first sat down to watch this movie I thought not another sports movie. But this movie was more than sports. It's theme is basically that we must help the people in need and that need guidance. This movie showed me how much a few actions by a good person can change another person's life dramatically. An example of the theme being portrayed in this film was when Leigh Ann saw Michael walking alone in the cold she picked him up and offered him a place to stay. This showed that Leigh Ann is the type of person to help those in need. Another example of the theme is the scene at the end of the movie when Michael is drafted to play for the Baltimore Ravens. This shows that because of the positive influences of the Tuoy's Michael's life has changed. He went from being a homeless teenager to being a soon to be profession football player and millionaire.There were a few main actors in this movie. The actors and characters they played were: Quinton Aaron-Michael Oher, Sandra Bullock- Leigh Anne Tuohy, Tim McGraw- Sean Tuohy, Jae Head-SJ Tuohy, Lily Collins-Collins Tuohy, and Ray McKinnon-Coach Burt Cotton. This movie was about a homeless teenager named Michael Oher. He father ran off when he was a baby and his mother was a crack head. He keeps moving from foster home to foster home and always ends up running away. He ends up going to a private school where he meets SJ. One day after a holiday festival while on the way home SJ's mother notices Michael walking alone in the cold. SJ's mother Leigh Anne offers him a place to stay. After that she offers him a room in the house. Being do good people the Touy's help change Michael's life. The Touhy's help Michael achieve academic strength and strength on the field ultimately giving him a chance to play college football and gain an education an opportunity that was once in a lifetime. There were a few techniques that the director used to get the theme across. One technique was motifs. One idea that the director wanted to get across is that you should help one in need, and all throughout the movie the Touhy's help Michael many time when he is in need. Another technique used in this movie was lighting. Usually when it was a scene that had a lot to do with the theme the lighting would change during that scene to sow the intensity. Overall this movie turned out to be a very interesting movie. I liked that Michael came out on top at the end. Overall I think the theme was expressed all throughout the movie. The movie did a good job of portraying the theme in a easy to understand way. So overall this was a very good film.",

This film was fantastic, to see such a headstrong lady along with her family adopt a neglected and out of place teenager was very inspiring. I feel that the acting was phenomenal and that the actors deserve some major credit. There wasn't a slow part in the entire movie and it really made a lot of good points. The point that really came across to me was that if you see someone struggling, you can be that persons hero all by helping them out and believing in them. This can make a huge difference on that one person, knowing that somebody actually cares about them and will take the time to support them. You won't believe the impact it will have on you after seeing this movie. I think this movie had solid points and it had a very inspirational message behind it.",

Michael Oher grew up not knowing his father, and living with a crack head mother. As a young child Michael is taken from his mother only to have to learn how to manage through life on his own. Michael meets the Tuohy's and his life takes a change for the good. Leigh Ann Tuohy, has a heart of gold, and decides to take Michael in as one of her own. This movie shows us that even when the odds are against us, we can overcome the adversities of our lives. This movie was well written and shows one man's struggles and the triumph he received because of one families love for him. This is not your ordinary football movie. This movie is one man's story from poverty and despair to a life of greatness on the field. Michael Oher started out with a less than average education level to becoming a great wide receiver. Leigh Ann Tuohy, a mother of two decides to take in a strange boy who had no one else in his corner. She shows him love and provides him the same benefits she gives her children. Michael for so many years had been passed along in school with no one really caring or showing an interest in him. From the lighting in this movie to the sounds, you get the feel for being at the game. This movie reminds you much of Remember the Titans, where a team faces all types of adversities only to triumph in the end.",

            "content": "The Blind Side is a true life film about a young black man, wonderfully played by Quinton Aaron. This man, Michael Oher was born into a difficult family situation but today, lives a life polar opposite of the one he could have ended up living. This is all due to the love and compassion of one woman; Leigh Ann Tuohy brilliantly played by Sandra Bullock. Sean Tuohy is played by Tim McGraw and Miss Sue, Michaels tutor, is played by Kathy Bates. Considering that Michael Oher was born in a rough part of Memphis Tn., his mother is a drug addict and his father is absent it seems that Michael has all opportunities to become like so many of his neighborhood friends. Michael could do drugs, steal, and/or become a gang member. There is something in Michael that pulls him away from that sort of lifestyle. Michael has perseverance and honor. He keeps trying to \"do life\" on his own; sleeping where he can, and doing laundry on someone else's dime, until someone comes along and gives him a better opportunity to do something with his life. Michael has honor and protective instincts he honors his mother no matter how bad her choice of lifestyle is. She is still his mother and he wants to be with her. He wants to protect her. Leigh Ann is very compassionate when she meets Michael's biological mother. She feels her pain as well as she can considering their opposite lifestyles. Michael continued his education in the home of the Tuohy's. When he got there, his GPA was barely on the scale; when he left the Tuohy's home, it was because he had worked so hard (with the help of Miss Sue) and received a scholarship to Ole Miss. Kathy Bates is wonderful as his tutor. The Blind Side is similar to \"Remember the Titans\" starring Denzel Washington, in the fact that they are both based on true stories about young men, football and racism. When you watch The Blind Side, you will feel like you are right there in Michael's head when he has flashbacks regarding the day he was taken from his mother. Even though the scene around him is total chaos like when he goes back to his old neighborhood and gets in a scuffle with one of his acquaintances. They pull back in the scene so that you can see Michael among all of the chaos just after the scuffle and then see his memories of being ripped from his mothers grasp. In the present scene, the screams of the women and children enhance his despair and the sounds of their cries demonstrate what he is going through in his flashback. This movie is proof positive that even if you are born into diverse conditions that if you have perseverance, honor and courage that you can change your destiny.",

            "content": "The Blind Side is a movie about a boy who has nothing and a Christian family who helps him gain more than just material. Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron was a boy headed down all the wrong roads, and not because he chose to but because he had no other option. He was going to school every day and then pretty much living out of the school for the most part. One night the Tuohy family noticed Michael walking down the street and had at this time figured out that Michael was homeless. Leigh Ann Touhy the mother played by Sandra Bullock insists on giving him a place to stay. From that moment on the family had grown to love Michael, and his ways. They learned that he was traumatized as a child and has a keen sense of security when it comes to people that he loves.In my opinion the theme of this movie is that you should never ever judge a book by its cover. This may sound so clich\u00e9 in many ways, but if it wasn't for the Tuohy family who would have known what would have came from Michael, they had compassion for others and they seen something in him that many other hadn't even thought to stop and analyze. They kept faith in Michael and because of that he became a big star athlete down the road.Another theme I caught was never under estimate the silent ones. They are silent but deadly. And this deadly isn't the deadly as in harmful, but he can \"hold his own\". Michael was a traumatized boy and obviously grown a sense of how to protect his self. As he began to play football the guys on other teams looked at him as he was a joke, they later found out that the names they called him soon ticked him off and he used that to climb his way to the top and become one of the best football players out there.As mentioned above it said that Michael Oher was a traumatized boy, I feel like this was a thematic idea for the fact that it reoccurs throughout the movie, sometimes in good ways and in bad ways. There was one scene when Michael went back to his old house and all these bad men where there, they obviously knew him through his mom, but they kept saying these vulgar things of his mom and then turned on him, something clicked in him and he just went off and used his protective instincts from being traumatized. Also another time was when he was in the football game which was mentioned above. That was mainly for the good.Well, initially I feel like this movie gives people hope and faith that they can do what they want with their lives. Within the theme it also shows that inner strength comes from courage. I would also like to say that not everyone is selfish. There are some good people out there, and when you find these people don't take advantage of them, respect the fact that they are helping you.",

            "content": "The movie The Blind Side is a true story about a homeless teenager named Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) who is taken in by the Tuohy family. The Tuohy family consists of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw), Collins Tuohy (Lily Collins), and S.J. Tuohy (Jae Head). Michael Oher goes by the name of \"Big Mike\" and is from the \"projects\". He is the son of a drug addicted mother and a father in which he does not remember. Michael Oher is a homeless teenager with very little clothes so he has to spend his nights trying to find a place to sleep.Towards the beginning he is walking to a gym in which it is warm so he will be able to sleep. While going to the gym Leigh Anne Tuohy and her family are leaving from a play and she sees him walking without adequate clothing and in turn stops to ask what he is doing. He tells her what his plans are about staying in the gym and then she tells him to get in the car as he is able to go and stay with them for the night. That night then turns into days and eventually into him being adopted by the Tuohys. Michael Oher has no records available and has never really done too good in school.The Tuohy family is portrayed as high class republicans and a very Christian family and they also put on a persona as they might be better than everyone else. That is what I thought in the beginning because of their BMW's and their huge house but it turns out that they are a nice and loving family that only wants what is best for their kids.Big Mike is enrolled in a private school in which he then begins to get a great education and is later introduced to football. Through football he is able to keep his mind right and figure out what he is wanting out of his life. He is so good at football that every college in the nation wants him to come and play for them, but he is hindered by one thing and that is his grades. Over time he gets his grades up way beyond what was needed for him to be eligible for scholarships. Acquiring the grades needed was the first hurdle as the NCAA was doing an investigation because he had decided on a school to attend that the Tuohys were affiliated with. The NCAA just wanted to make sure that he was not forced and or paid to choose that school.With the Tuohys allowing Michael to stay at their house for that one night changed not only his life but theirs as well as they had seen that they were able to help him to basically get off of the street. The hard work that Michael and the Tuohy family put into him allowed him to excel in the classroom as well as on the football field eventually leading him to being drafted in the 1st Round of the NFL Draft by the Baltimore Ravens.Two techniques used in The Blind Side are angle and sound. When I mention angle I am talking about how the camera would be angled during football practice as well as the football games themselves. As a viewer of the film it made it seem like I was right on the football field for every hit and play. The sound inside of The Blind Side quietly helped in the film especially the background voices of the other students that were making fun of \"Big Mike\" as well as on the football field with the grunts and the sheer groans of pain.The acting in The Blind Side was very good. I thought that the cast was a great fit for this film as they all played their intricate roles in developing the story and the theme of the movie. The Blind Side is not only a sports movie but it's an inspirational movie for everyone showing that anything is possible just as long as you believe in yourself and others.",

            "content": "I have seen this film 2 times now and each time it managed to put a smile on my face, i have only just got up from watching this with my entire family, ages ranging from 14-76. I can honestly tell you that not one person in that room would have rated it other than 10. Heres a few reasons why: Sandra Bullock did play her part amazingly well but in truth all of the actors seemed to fit and everything just feels quite natural and they support each other fantastically.The story flows quite quickly but at a pace which i think fits ( you would have to watch the film to truly understand this comment) The occasional one liners that help to disperse the drama and keep a smile on everyones face without making the film seem to corny.The actual plot is truly inspiring but i don't want to ruin it for you, i can say that only the most steel hearted of people would struggle to feel something.The so called \"negatives\" I have noticed many people talking about stereotyping and the poor portrayal of ethnic groups etc. However this is a True story, so how can the story be unrealistic? As for the stereotyping well some of that surely must have come from Michael Oher in which case its not stereotyping but in fact what he saw through his eyes. Some say he is portrayed as a dumb child in need of white Christian aid, when in fact it is quite clearly stated by one of the teachers that he is actually intelligent but just shy. Surely he must have signed off on this book and how he must have seen himself? I would strongly recommend you to watch this film yourself and see your own reaction to it whether it be a simple smile or a sense of inspiration.",

            "content": "The Blindside is a true story based on the life of a once homeless teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) affectionately known as \"Big Mike\" who was an all-American high an all-American high school football player who in 2009 was the first round pick for the Baltimore Ravens. Michael grew up in the inner city projects of Memphis, Tennessee to a drug addicted mother and a father that he never knew. Having being removed from his mother's home by Children's services and bounced around from foster home to foster home Michael opts to sleep on a friend's couch every night. On the opposite side of town Leigh Ann Touhy(Sandra Bullock) and husband Sean Touhy(Tim McGraw) seem to have the perfect life and the children everyone adores (Lily Collins and Jae Head). One cold winter night the Touhy's are on their way home and see \"Big Mike \" walking in the brutal cold to the school gym where he sleeps at night , Leigh Ann demands her husband to pull over so she can assist the young man. The Toughy's provide \"Big Mike\" with room and board, which makes uncomfortable because he is not use to the reality of a functional, loving family since he came from a broken home. Eventually \"Big Mike \"becomes a part of the Touhy family and begins to open up more and express his feelings, where he was once shy and introverted. Leigh Ann introduces Michael to the game of football, in which he has no interests because he was unable to follow the game or its rules until Leigh Ann explains the game to him and what his role on the football field is. From this point, Michael becomes a valuable player to his team and a n opportunity presents itself for Michael to play at the university level, however his grades were not up to par so the Touhy's hire Michael a tutor Miss Sue (Kathy Bates) who helps him excel tremendously in his academics. In the mean time, Michael's has soared academically and three major universities want him to play football for their school so he must make a very challenging decision and he does. He chooses to attend the college where Sean was a football player and Leigh Ann was a cheerleader, this causes a tad bit of controversy being that many people thought he was forced by the Touhy's to attend their Alma Mater for their personal gain. After questioning, Leigh Ann about his decision to attend her former university Michael now realizes that he is a part of the Touhy family and that they love him unconditionally. The Blindside is a definite family must see and proves that we can all succeed in life no matter what the circumstances if we put our mind to it, stay committed and focused.",

The plot also captures all audiences from those who like sports movies to those who like heartwarming stories as well. The actors in this movie are exceptional. They portray the real life people very well. The actors have everything from the accents to the demeanors of the real life characters down. They are also entertaining and engaging. I believe if these actors weren't in the movie it would not have turned out as well as it did. The rating for this movie was PG-13, which I feel is appropriate. There were some language and drug references that occurred. However, I feel the movie had to be rated this to tell the whole story and really understand what happened in real life.

            "content": "A countless act of kindness can turn a life upside down and The Blind Side showed just that. This film was the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) who was a homeless teen who knew nothing about the joys of family or having a proper education. Growing up in the projects of Memphis he only knew the effects drugs and what the streets could offer him. Leigh Ann Tuody (Sandra Bullock) was a classy woman living the high life with not a care in the world. It wasn't until their paths crossed that they unknowingly impacted each other's lives forever.Leigh Ann took Michael in for what she thought would be for just one night. She soon realized he had no family and nowhere to go. Michael continued to stay at the Tuody's home and was eventually adopted. When Leigh Ann asked Michael if he wanted to be a part of the family and be adopted his response was, \"I thought I already was.\" The Tuody's contributed to Michael's success by giving him a stable environment. He was able to bring up his grades and joined the football team becoming their star athlete.The film used a mixture of angles and music to portray emotion. Michael was a rather big boy and often times he seemed like a giant compared to the other children. But when Michael was feeling sad or intimidated the camera would draw back making him look rather small conveying that Michael was uncomfortable and not feeling like the big man on campus. The music played a big part in the film as well letting you know when something important was happening in Michael's life. This film was filled with joy, laughter, tears and compassion. When a family takes in a complete stranger and turns their life around for the good it's not only a selfless act of kindness but shows that there are still good people out there. This reminds me of the film Seven Pounds where Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks out to change the lives of seven strangers. Ben is the one ultimately transformed in the end by one of his strangers Leigh Ann was changed by Michael. Random acts of kindness are not seen every day so when someone goes out of their way to help someone out the way the Truody's did Michael it's heartwarming.Michael not only graduated from high school but went on to a Division I college Ole Miss. He was later drafted into the NFL.This was a great and inspiring movie. I would recommend this movie for all ages. It teaches us life lessons that not everyone is the same yet there are still people out there willing to lend a helping hand to help you reach your destiny.",

Michael ended up moving out into the world all alone. He went to a very good school but he didn't have the best education background so he was doing poor at school. Leigh Anne Tuohy's son S.J. went to school with Michael. She saw that he wasn't in the best of place so she and her family took him in one night. Leigh Anne and Sean, her husband, asked Michael if he wanted to be apart of their family, so they adopted him. The Tuohy family was very kind to Michael. They helped him with his schooling and he even got to play football during his senior year. He was an amazing football player and got many scholarships for college. He picked to go to the college that all of the Tuohy's loved! This movie has a great meaning behind it. Michael Oher, Quinton Arron in real life, was from the projects. He didn't have a great childhood, but look at him now. He was drafted 23rd to the Baltimore Ravens. This is a great movie that I think everyone should take the time to watch!",

            "content": "In the film The Blind Side, Leigh Anne Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock, takes in a young man who was out roaming the streets. Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron, was a young homeless boy who grew up in a family who used drugs. He was taken from his mother when he was a child. He did not do well in his school work so he just didn't go to school. When a man finally thought he saw potential in Michael, he convinced him to start going to school. Michael still wasn't doing well in his studies but he was excellent in sports. He became friends with Leigh Anne's son and eventually he becomes part of their family. Leigh Anne includes him in their family photos and takes him to buy new clothes for school. When she found out he wasn't doing well in his studies, she goes to the school to see what she can do to help. She learns that he understands a lot about how to protect someone so she tries to relate things to that in order to get him to get interested in learning new things. The Tuohy family convinces Michael to join a football team and encourage him to continue with it. Leigh Anne teaches him that he can make something good out of himself even if he had a rough childhood. Michael goes on to become a famous football player and loves what he does. The theme for this movie is that anyone can become what they want to be in life if you are willing to work hard, it doesn't matter what your background is. It also teaches you to help people when they need it. Michael was taken from his mother when he was just a young child and he didn't know what to do after that happened, he was on his own. He just felt like he wasn't worth anything and he didn't believe anyone really cared about him. You could see this on his face when the cameras showed him from a specific angle. They would focus on his face up close so the viewers can see the hurt in his eyes. Lighting was also used to show Michael's feelings and emotions. Many times when Michael was down and out or feeling bad, the light of that particular scene seemed to be darker than normal. For example, when Michael was walking down the road on a cold night with shorts and a t- shirt on, he was feeling bad and lonely. The setting was on a bit of a dark street and it was late at night so there was not much light at all. After Leigh Anne asked him to come stay at their house, as soon as they walked in the lights got a little brighter. Michael was still not feeling very self-confident but he was happy to be able to stay in a warm place for the night. This helped to show Michael feeling sort of sorry for himself and not even trying to better himself because he knows what his background it. Throughout the film, Michael must work hard to prove to himself and others that he could be something better. He had to work hard in school and was lucky to have help from Leigh Anne and her family. Just like Julie in Julie & Julia, Michael had many struggles to work through but both Julie and Michael eventually reach their dream goal of becoming what they wanted to be in life. In the end, the lights are shining bright on Michael as he is accepted to play for a professional football team. This had become Michael's dream in life. Once again, the cameras angle in on his face to show how happy he is. It also shows how proud he is of himself because he never thought he would become anything good during his lifetime. He had worked hard to become what he wanted to be, regardless of his horrible childhood. He is an encouragement to anyone who may find themselves in the same situation.",

The movie is great because it's based on a true story of how a couple Leigh Ann and Sean Tuohy, played by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw, took in a homeless kid and gave him some direction. The kid they took in was Michael \"Big Mike\" Oher who was played by Quinton Aaron. I would consider one of the major themes in this movie to be something along the lines of if you put your all into something no matter the obstacle you'll achieve your goals, and that's exactly what Michael Oher did. I think throughout the film you get many different themes whether it's race, family, or simply sports. I think the film did a great job at being inspirational and giving people hope to succeed. To me this film seems a lot like Gladiator, stay with me for a minute, my reasoning behind this is a person has a family loses them goes through some extremely rough times, but in the end they fight their way to the top and succeed. In Gladiator they had the same issues race, family, and sport, but obviously the movie plot is a touch different and I know this is a long stretch so please just use your imagination and think about it.

            "content": "The Blind Side is an uplifting movie based on a true story book by Michael Lewis called the Blind Side:Evolution of a Game. Michael Oher, played by Quinton Aaron, is a young black kid that grew up in the projects and was taken away from his drug addicted mother as a young boy. He has bounced around foster homes and, as we find him in the start of the movie, he is sleeping on a friends couch. When his friend gets him into a private school named Wingate because of his athletic ability he finds himself in strange surroundings. After his friend's girlfriend makes him kick Michael out he is taken in by Leigh Anne and Sean Touhy, an affluent white couple. With the help from the Tougy's, and a tutor Miss Sue, Michael starts to excel in his school work and on the field. The movie does a wonderful job of not focusing just on the football action and puts more focus and effort into the background story of Michael Oher. We see the struggles that he must go through as a young black kid such as being taken away from his mother, not having a place to go home to, and basically being on his own with no resources. I also enjoyed the way Quinton Aaron portrayed Michael Oher. He was very quite which left some mysteriousness to his character. Without overplaying his role it keeps you wondering about him and what he's thinking. The scene where He and Leigh Anne are in the car and she ask him to tell her one thing about himself in which he tells her that he doesn't like being called big Mike. I think this is a breakthrough moment for the two of them and he starts feeling comfortable with her. This movie put me in mind of another great football movie, Remember the Titans where the black coach and players are cast into a predominantly white school and they have to find a way to coexist and get along with one another. In the opening scenes we get an idea of what Michaels journey is going to be like as he rides in the back seat of a car and is watching the scenery go by. It starts out as they go through the projects with buildings being run down with roofs falling in and as they go along the neighborhoods slowly get nicer. When Michael and Steven walk up on the baskets of basket balls sitting open and not locked they are shocked that they are not locked up. Michael exclaims that white people are crazy. One aspect of the film that I found odd though was the fact that Steven and his father are in this opening scene's however after that they are dropped entirely from the film with no other mention of them. Another item of the movie I felt should have been visited more was showing how intelligent Michael really was. At one point he has a teacher exclaim to other teachers that he knows the material and he isn't stupid but we never see him show that side. All together I throughly enjoyed the movie. I felt like it was a great feel good story that was told very well with out over doing the drama. Sandra Bullock does an amazing job and its her performance that really stands out to me. One of the greatest strengths of this movie is that you don't have to be a football fan to love it because its really not just a football movie it has a greater depth in its story than that.",

            "content": "The Blind Side is about a young black man Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron who receives love from white family. Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy. Leigh Anne is married to husband is Sean Tuohy played by Tim McGraw. Leigh Anne and Sean have two children S.J. Tuohy and Collins Tuohy played by Jae Head and Lily Collins. Essentially, Michael is homeless, his mother is addicted to drugs, and he sleeps on the couch of a family friend. Michael enters a private school because a coach sees his enormous stature and pleads the board to let him in school. Leigh Anne is spots Michael and figures that he doesn't have a warm place to stay for the night. She makes Michael get in their car and sleeps with them for the night.During the night Leigh Anne and Sean talk about Michael and if he will steal from them. In the morning Leigh Anne wakes up to find the blankets that Michael used are folded neatly and stacked. Michael had already left their home. Leigh Anne feels ashamed for thinking that Michael would steal just because he is black. The main theme for this film is prejudices. Michael faces them every day in an all most all white private school. The Tuohy's experiences it because their friends and family don't understand why they would care so much for a young black man.Save the Last Dance could be compared to The Blind Side because in Save the Last Dance, Sara Johnson played by Julia Stiles, a young white dancer moves into an urban school with mostly black students. Sara meets the prejudices of being the only white girl and hated by the other students just because she isn't like them. In the Blind Side before Michael moves in with the Tuohy's Michael is always surrounded by darkness. For example the scene where Michael is at a laundry mat, Michael is there at night time. Another example is when Leigh Anne asks Michael if he has a place to go to it is night. The contrast of night and day in this movie represents Michael's life, mood, and hope. A dark night is gloomy and you can't see where you are going. Michael's future before the Tuohy's was the same. After Michael moves in with the Tuohy's his life changes and his future becomes brighter. Another technique used is color. Before Michael moves in he has two shirts both gray. After he moves in Leigh Anne takes him shopping and he gets multicolored polo's. The next day Michael proudly walks into school wearing his new polo. The clothes and colors here represent Michael's confidence. Before he hung his head and rarely looked up but after the new clothes he smiled and was confident in himself. In the Blind Side, a young man transforms into his full potential. Michael and the Tuohy's face the prejudices and overcome them together as a family.",

            "content": "The \"Blind Side\" is a movie for the entire family. If a person is looking for a movie with a heartfelt message, but still involves a few laughs, this is it! The movie balances out the drama and comedy, which is great! The best thing about The Blind Side is that it is based on a true story of Baltimore Ravens football player Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron). Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw also have roles in this film as Leigh Anne Tuohy and Sean Tuohy. They played a married couple who discovers Michael Oher while at a restaurant one evening. They were told that he was a homeless teenager and both decided to bring him into their family. After viewing this movie, I feel that it was put together perfectly. I thought that it would be all about football, but I was wrong. It goes into more detail of Michael and how he becomes the person he is today. Michael Ohor was attending a predominately white private school, which was proved to be a task for him. He was an uneducated African American male and needed to seek help from others in order to succeed in high school. Michael was able to fulfill his dream of playing football in high school and the storyline takes on from there. One thing that stuck out the most from the movie to me is the love the Tuohy family showed Michael to make him feel like he was actually part of their family. Another thing is that once a person thinks that they figured out the plot of the movie, they will be thinking, \"Wow that definitely took an interesting turn.\" Not many movies can keep a person thinking to what will exactly happen and this is one of them. Sandra Bullock is not one of my favorite actresses, but after this movie I look at her so different. She definitely played her role in this film and I was very impressed by the hard work she put into it. Please be sure to go out and support this movie! It's a must see!",

            "review_title": "Not Just Another Football Movie",
            "content": "In 2009, The Blind Side was directed into a film after being published as a novel in 2006. After reading the spectacular biography of Michael Oher and watching the movie, the two were surprisingly very similar. In both the novel and the movie, the story begins with a football injury that ended a great player's career. This provides a smooth transition and a glimpse of how football affected the life of Michael Oher. Along with football, the loving Tuohy family completely turned Michael's life around. The film successfully created scenes and images into real life that were previously demonstrated in the novel. The anticipated movie emotionally affected many of those who watched it and exceeded all expectations. While growing up, Michael was abandoned by his parents, leaving him to survive on his own. As each day passed, he struggled to find a place to sleep and literally was forced to sleep on the streets. On one rainy night, Michael was walking down a dark street with his belongings after leaving a local volleyball game. Fortunately, the Tuohy family, who happened to be extremely wealthy, suspiciously drove by him wondering where he was going. They soon realized his difficult situation, and offered to take care of him. Soon after, Michael became enrolled in one of the top private schools in the area thanks to the head football coach who sought after his athletic ability. S.J. Tuohy, the son, gives his best effort with transforming Michael into a football player, and seemed to have done a great job. Immediately into the football season, Michael began to receive scholarship offers from the top college football teams across the nation. The Tuohy's were alumni's of Ole Miss and contributed greatly to his decision in continuing his football career at this college.The movie contains many excellent actors that performed absolutely brilliantly at each of their roles. Sandra Bullock plays the role of Leigh Anne Tuohy, the mother, and could not have done better at portraying a loving mom who wanted the best for her family and Michael. By showing true emotions and constant protection, she was able to excel at her role in one of the best pieces of acting I have ever witnessed. In comparison with the mom, S.J. Tuohy, played by Jae Head, perfectly suited their character, and acted as if the movie were real life. Jae Head does remarkably at showing his true passion for the sport of football and his enjoyment in actually helping Michael. His constant smile helped show his passion in filming and the bright character of the young man. Along with Bullock and Head, Tim McGraw fitted perfectly as the father and the football coach acted great as a typical southern football fanatic. Each of these actors played their roles tremendously and contributed greatly to the success of The Blind Side. Before watching the movie, most people thought that this movie would have been only about football. However, the cinematography actually focuses the move on the struggling life of Michael Oher, and how the Tuohy's changed his life around. I thought the most memorable portion of the movie was when Michael first got connected and comfortable with the family. In these scenes, the filming emphasizes the emotions of Michael Oher and the mother and son and the beautiful scenery in the background. This allows the movie to touch the emotional side of the audience and become closer to each of the characters. The movie shows Michael's journey through the point of views of both Michael Oher and the Tuohy family. The cinematography helped establish a closer connection with the characters in the movie, and contributes to the audience's love for The Blind Side. Personally, The Blind Side was absolutely one of the most outstanding movies in all aspects. The story line was heartwarming, the acting was nothing short of pure brilliance, and the cinematography portrayed the perfect image throughout the entire journey. In my opinion, this film fell nothing short of perfection, and received all ten stars.",

            "review_title": "The Blind Side is an amazing movie",
            "content": "The Blind Side is a compelling movie about the coming together of two very different American experiences. John Lee Hancock wrote and directed this eye-opening biography film that was the fourth highest grossing film in 2009. The film revolves around two main characters: a teenage athlete from the projects and a wealthy suburban family who, in the end, change each other's lives. Hancock took a step in the right direction when deciding on the location for the story. Set in Memphis Tennessee, moviegoers feel the experience of the two Americas. One with well manicured lawns, large houses and a beautiful private school. The other showing the rundown stores and the gritty housing projects complete with broken windows and eviction notices. The clothes of the various characters reflect the two different Americas: preppy and stylish on one side and worn out and drab colors on the other. Quinton Aaron plays one of the two main characters, Michael Oher, also known as \"Big Mike\" to most. Aaron has the large physical stature to fit the role of Big Mike as a budding high school football star, but it is his portrayal of the quiet, but thoughtfulness in Big Mike which makes us root for him to succeed. With few words but realistic facial expressions and slow body-movement, Aaron conveys Big Mike's unease in his new surroundings, his sadness of never experiencing a real family life and ultimately his growing comfort. Sandra Bullock steps into the shoes of Leigh Anne Tuoghy. Bullock is best known for her flirtatious characters in movies like Miss. Congeniality and All about Steve, but in this film, she executes the role of Leigh Anne, not as smiling and flirty, but as a calm, confident wife and a mother of two, whose life is changed by Michael. At one point in the film Leigh Anne is in the projects looking for Big Mike, when a man calls her an expletive. Bullock shows the tension, not by screaming, but with eye contact. She also conveys Leigh Anne's thoughtfulness behind a materialistic appearance. She drives a Mercedes, but calmly yet sternly challenges her lunch friends who almost mock her when she says Michael is apart of the family.Rather than merely walking through the story in chronological order, Hancock effectively uses flashbacks to show the difficulty of growing up with a drug-addicted mother. Learning about Big Mike's rough life was an emotional part of the film. Hancock uses a camera angle to make you feel you are in Big Mike's shoes as he watches his mother struggle. Having a wide camera angle when Big Mike was comes to his new private school helped show how different this setting was from the projects. How the camera moved was nice, creating the storyline to flow well and not having a chopping cut break up to story either. The soundtrack by Carter Burwell added to emotions that the audience and the two different cultures experienced. The football scenes are realistic but do not overwhelm the film. Rather, football is one way the two Americas can come together. The Blind Side will stir a wide range of emotions: from holding back tears to jumping joy. It will also cause adults and school aged kids to have a greater appreciation about what someone from the other America can do or is thinking. That is a lesson, which will make this movie relevant for years to come.",

            "content": "\"THE BLIND SIDE\"\nIf every person on Earth once did at least one small and very kind deed, then our world would change significantly for the better, and I am sure that every person living on the blue planet would feel the changes. Directed by John Lee Hancock, this film is based on true events. It was doubly rewarding and exciting to watch this amazing biographical drama knowing that it was based on a true life story.\nThe Blind Side is based on the novel by Michael Lewis. In the original, the book is called The blind side: Evolution of a Game. There are two parallel storylines in the work: in one, the writer investigates how the strategy of games in American football has changed, and in the other, he describes the fate of Michael Oher. He was adopted by a former classmate of Michael Lewis and his wife, Lee Ann and Sean Tui.\nFrom the book The blind side: Evolution of a Game, only the second storyline was taken for the film adaptation. So all the viewers in the world saw the story of Big Mike.\nThe film touches on important topics that are worth reflecting on - the values of life and relationships in the family.\nPlot of the film\nThis film is not about football as it might seem at first glance. It has a deeper meaning. It is about family, about courage and willpower. Human relations between people in this family are put in the foreground. It seems to me that this is a big, just a huge plus for this film. There is no focus on the eternal suffering of children from disadvantaged areas, there is no sugariness and unnecessary drama. We are shown a family that is trying to function as a real, loving family.\nThe film tells about the most difficult period in the life of Michael Oher. He is a homeless, oversized teenager who doesn't even have a change of clothes. Lee Ann Tui accidentally saw him and decided to help him. In the end, everything goes much further than 1-2 nights on the couch in someone else's house: the Tui family takes Michael under guardianship and helps him find his place in life.\nThe acting\nAn excellent cast was assembled for the roles of family members:\nTim McGraw perfectly coped with the role of the soft-bodied head of the family, who completely trusts his wife and supports her in all endeavors.\nSandra Bullock - incomparably played the role of the mother and not in vain received for her 'Oscar' and 'Golden Globe'. From the very first minutes she creates the impression of a strong and confident woman. During the film, she evoked one feeling in me - admiration. Admiration for her decision, her method, putting everything in order, her ability to put someone in their place.\nJay Head is a funny little boy. Particularly smiled were the moments of his drill and interviews with college coaches.\nLily Collins did a very good job as the charming little girl.\nQuinton Aaron - he incredibly got used to the role: on his face we see all Mike's emotional experiences, his insecurity, despondency, sadness. He showed us a guy lost in life who finds purpose only after he finds the love and support of his family.\nRay McKinnon, Coach Cotton, also played well, he was the first to consider Mike's potential and, after a short lecture by Lee Ann, he understands how to treat the team and the players.\nAnd the interactions of the main characters are very carefully brought to the fore, once again emphasizing the main idea of the picture. In general, the film is so balanced that there is not a single superfluous episode, not a single superfluous movement.\nSound\nExcellent musical accompaniment, Carter Burwell as always on top. The background music is well chosen for the film.\nOutcome\nI have always loved to watch films based on real events, biographical, about sports and kindness. And this film combined all these genres that I love to watch.\nThis film showed me that not everything in our world is bought and sold. That not everyone is heartless selfish. There are people who are capable of doing good. And let this family be an example of unity, love, support and understanding.\nSumming up, I can say that the film is full of charm and love. The kindness you find in this movie is amazing. 'The invisible side' - this is the inner world of Michael, who for all those around him remained so. Watch this movie, it will give you a chance to look inside yourself.\nThe film is worth watching, because after watching it, a very pleasant and warm trace remains on the soul, and this is the most important thing!",

She has a hit rom-com in the summer ('The Proposal') followed by her worst reviewed performance ever ('All About Steve'). Now she turns in what may be her best performance ever as a steel magnolia with a heart of gold. Director John Lee Hancock knows a thing or two about making a feel-good sports movie ('The Rookie') and brings a surprising smartness and sensibility to this one. Quinton Aaron make this gentle giant sympathetic and says a lot without much dialogue. He and Bullock give this story a lot heart that helps it over the weak spots and clich\u00e9s. Tim McGraw has shown himself to be a pretty good actor and manages a southern-fried sweetness here. Oscar-winner Kathy Bates is very good in a small role. Speaking of which, Bullock is so good here there could be a Best Actress nomination in it for her. And word has it it's hers to lose. She would deserve it too, because she helps make this sports flick a winner",

The detailed depiction of Michael's life in the projects came off like a borderline-racist caricature of what a white person thinks it would've been like. I'm a little ambivalent about Sandra winning the Oscar for her performance because she also won the SAG and Golden Globe, so they can't all be wrong, but to me the role didn't require much of her and it feels like the votes came in large part due to how likable the character was that she played.",

            "content": "This movie is an insightful one that takes you into the firsthand experiences of current NFL offensive lineman Michael Oher and dramatizes the struggles that he had to go through to get to where he is today. Director John Lee Hancock does a great job recreating an impactful story of a once abandoned child who was adopted and raised by a family of different color and class system. Overall, I enjoyed the effort put into recreating this story and putting the viewers into the situation clearly. \n\nMichael Oher is shown from the beginning stages of his life from a young teen drifting in and out of various schools, all the way to earning his eventual scholarship offers and ultimately becoming an NFL athlete. Michael was one of the 2.9 million children neglected or abandoned in the U.S. every year, however, he was lucky enough to be adopted by an upper class family, the Tuohys. By adopting Michael, Hancock takes you on a journey that shows that while Michael was the one being nurtured and assisted by his new family, he was providing just as much knowledge and learning experiences to the Tuohys, a domestic of a different race. It was an overall learning experience from both parties as we went on this journey of Michael finding himself both in class and on the football field. During this, Oher's new family was learning to live with a family member who wasn't their blood relation. What makes this movie even more powerful is Hancock takes you back to Michael's differing residences as you see where he once lived and how he was mistreated before he was adopted by the Tuohys. All in all, Hancock  provides an accurate biopic of what Oher's life was like growing up.\n\nWhile John Lee Hancock did a great job on this movie, it can be seen that some parts of the movie are more dramatized to capture the audience than what had happened in real life. However, this is understandable in the movie industry and I still pay credit to the legitimacy of the movie in respect to Oher's life.\n\nIf you are an avid sports fan or just like a good plot that will really bring you into the lives of mixed families and the process of adoption, this movie is a must see. It brings together sports, academics, bonding, and emotional conflict all into 129 minutes and will keep you at the edge of your seat. The Blindside educated me on how impactful a surrounding family is and the support system they provide to one's success. Furthermore, it doesn't matter how different your backgrounds are when it comes to being there for one another.",

I went to the theaters, in 2009, to watch this film, and I left feeling so happy that I supported it. After doing further research of the film, not only did they cut out a few useful scenes, they absolutely botched who Michael Oher really is, and his story. This was just a white, feel good film.\n\nHancock made Oher soft & shy, to help build the emotion this film possesses, but in reality, he was an outspoken, delinquent. Quinton Aaron did a good job for what he was handed, but I just couldn't buy into this manufactured story. Jae Head put on a charming performance, playing Big Mike's little brother. His connection with Big Mike was probably one of the best of the film, selling each scene perfectly together. Hancock didn't really focus too much on Collins, or Mr. Touey's character, nearly as much as Mrs. Touey & SJ. The main attraction to this film, was Sandra Bullock. Bullock won an Academy Award for Best Actress, due to her inspiring performance, and being easily the best asset to this film.\n\nOverall, due to the hack job John Lee Hancock did with Michael Oher, and the story as a whole, I really can't recommend this film.",

And when I do, they're either done well (Middle School, 10 Things I Hate About You, The Spy next Door) or quite badly (any Diary of a Wimpy Kid, any Alvin & the Chipmunks, Million Dollar Arm, Parental Guidance).\nMy FIRST impression of this film, before I'd even seen it, was that it was about a professional adult rugby player (wrong) who is so put down by racist comments from opposing team/audience members (not really) that he retires and chats about philosophy with his Mum to pass the time (wrong and wrong). What it's really about is:\nA homeless black teen called Michael Oher who is taken in by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a Christian mother, and her husband, Sean. The Tuohys eventually become Michael's legal guardians, transforming both his life and theirs. Michael's tremendous size and protective instincts make him a formidable football player, and with help from his new family and devoted tutor, he realises his potential.\nThanks Google.\nOf course, I wasn't disappointed with my mistaken assumption. Believe me, I was FAR more interested in sitting through 2hrs of a boy's life being changed then some lectures on life. And plus, I'd never seen ANYTHING like it before. I just put on a blindfold and reserved a movie that was nominated for Best Picture back in 2009.\nThis is also my first Sandra Bullock film, unless you count Minions (2015), so I really couldn't compare this as a best performance (although I'm sure it was). Quinton Aaron also does an excellent job at portraying Michael, the boy with an ugly past but a heart of gold; in FACT, good acting all round.\nThe moment this film hits its height is when it's at its grittiest; all I'll say is that Michael's lucky he's a quarterback!\nIn conclusion, I really feel that I have nothing more to say other than that this drama really opened up my eyes to the American lifestyle and did the best job it could. Would I highly recommend it? No Would I even rewatch it? Probably not, but it did what it was there to do, nonetheless.",

            "content": "I haven't hated a film as much as I hated this one in a while. This was a textbook example of why the white savior trope is not only hugely offensive to racial minorities but also painful to watch for audiences. The fact that this film earned a Best Picture nomination should make the Academy feel ashamed of themselves as it's possibly one of the worst films of 2009. Sandra Bullock's Best Actress win was also ridiculous as she is at her scenery chewing worst and nominated against obviously superior actresses like Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren. I have a burning hatred for this film and yet, much like a car crash, I found myself watching and cringing as the events unfolded against John Lee Hancock's tasteless direction.\n\nWealthy, privileged housewife Leigh Anne Tuohy, Sandra Bullock, adopts an African-American teenager out of guilt and because she wants a pet project to brag about to her equally privileged friends. She, and she alone, trains Michael Oher, Quinton Aaron, to be a competent human being and trains him in how to be good at football. Then it is discovered that the Tuohy family probably only took Michael in because they wanted him to attended Ole Miss University. This conflict is quickly brushed aside however and we reaffirm that Leigh Anne is a saint.\n\nThe complete lack of tension at any point in this film caused it to feel inert and stale which didn't help when the characters were so easy to hate or to poke fun at. When tensions are brought up I placed myself firmly on the side of those who \"attack\" Leigh Anne because they often made reasonable arguments and I wanted to see this annoying, privileged woman be taken down a notch. When you have one of the only African-American characters in the film be a villainous investigator from the NCAA who interrogates a seemingly deranged Michael it doesn't send the right message. At no point did I feel that Leigh Anne or her family were in any way at risk for the supposedly difficult decision they made and that only added to the sickening feeling that this family had taken this boy under their wing out of vanity not altruism.\n\nThis was also one of those \u2018creepy' Christian films in which references to the lord and Christianity are dropped in here and there, enough to appeal to the Southern conservative base while not isolating those who aren't on board with the views that the film is in favor of. I was grossed out by how the film presents Leigh Anne as this angelic woman who saves Michael from his evil African-American community and when his biological mother tells her she is a \"good Christian woman\" I wanted to slap Leigh Anne. Beware that if you watch this film with even an ounce of decency within your body you will also want to throw up at the sight of these horrors.\n\nGetting to Bullock's performance I have to say that it is the worst to ever win an actress the coveted Academy Award as Bullock is simply awful. Yes, she is working with terrible material but even the moments that most actresses could sell are fumbled by the incompetent Bullock. Had Judy Davis or Sissy Spacek been cast in this role you can bet it would have appeared a hell of a lot better on screen and they wouldn't have messed up a simple line like \"No, he's changing mine,\" as bad as it is. I think that the 2009 Best Actress category was fairly weak but Meryl Streep gives a fantastic performance as Julia Child that reaches beyond impersonation in Julie & Julia (2009).\n\nDon't ever, ever watch this film. It mystifies me how this piece of trash received any critical praise but the negative reappraisal that it has received was correct because it is as bad as everybody says it is and it proves that we need to get rid of the white savior trope once and for all. I would suggest that people watch every film nominated for Best Picture in 2009 over this film because I don't think I have seen many films worse than this one.",

            "content": "This film manages to be uplifting, sentimental, heartfelt, superficial, realistic and contrived all in one mix of mainstream entertainment.  Quentin Aaron portrays Michael, the troubled and introverted boy who is big and talented at football but lost until taken in by wealthy Leigh Anne.  Aaron's performance holds the movie together, when otherwise it might spin out into obnoxious or hokey sentimentality.  No, Sandra Bullock isn't the key to the film's success, despite receiving an award for her performance.  I consider Bullock a mediocre actress, one who tries to obscure her shallowness with stagey acting that looks just like acting.  She's better than usual here, despite the one-note quality of her performance, and at times is somewhat charming as the determined surrogate mother for Michael. But she still tries to chew the scenery too much with over-acting.  Her Oscar for this tell you only what a hopeless band of cheerleaders the Academy often is.  The film works as much despite Bullock as because of her.  If you want a tear-jerker with an inspirational message in a tidy package, this film will do nicely.  It's not that deep, but it does succeed with a bit of tough love and a cookie.",

It's a very thought-provoking and riveting story not about just a lucky boy but about his long thorny way to the top and people who were unindifferent tohis fate.\n It based on a true life story about famous anerican football player thus it's not mediocre one. The movie is full of attention-grabbing episodes -you really worry about the main character every moment that's why it's soupy one so if you're too sesnsetive persone - prepare your nose-wipes because it makes you plunge into this atmosphere of compassion. \nTalking about acting, to my mind, it rather powerfull and natural and Sandra Bullock did her best in this movie I suppose. Her acting is very convincing and in general the atmosphere makes you feel as if you are a participent of all these events. To my mind it's also edificatory as it shows the worm relations between strange people, true and honest friendship and touches the problems of descrimination and social unequalty that's why it's also some kind of family movie and it's really excelled my expectations!",

            "content": "Krista Phillips\nAdrian Ramjoue\nLanguage Arts 11\n8 Mar. 2018\nThe Blind Side is a sports film of the typical 'underdog' story.  Based off of the true story of how Michael Oher, was drafted into the NFL.  The entire design revolves around the point of giving the improbable hero, Michael, a life-changing chance- which ends up altering everything previously known to him.  Michael had grown up on the streets when Leigh Anne Tuohy brought him into her home- and eventually turned his life around.  The purpose of the Blind Side, is to present the life of someone who lives in poverty and how that can change their life, with ease and even humor.   This is seen through showing the adoption into a white family, friendships made in the movie, and creating a story around a sought-after athlete.  \n    The focal point of the movie The Blind Side is that Michael Oher's life changed because he was adopted into a white family.  He was born and raised in poverty and knew nothing else.  The contrast between his old life and a new life shines a light on how poverty really is, by showing the opposing side of an upper-class family.  An example of this seen in the movie is showing his reaction to his new room in the Tuohey house.  Michael tells Leigh Anne that he's never had one before so she responds by asking if he's talking about having a room to himself, he responds with \"A bed.\"  These two words say lots about his previous life where he had been on and off the streets, and where he did not even have something he could call a bed.  Through showing us the life of a wealthy family we see that it's not like that in lower-income families.  \n    The film also makes an emphasis on the friendships made throughout the movie.  It shows the growth in trust as Michael begins to get to know his new family.  During the movie, his relationships with his family begins to grow, and as it does the film gives brief flashbacks to his old life and the influence his old friends had on him.  Michael was having a hard time adjusting to his new life, and it showed him going back to his old life, with his old friends.  The friends were partying, drinking, and likely doing other illegal activity for their age.  At this point in Michael's life, he already had the healthy influence of the Tuohy family and understood that what they were doing was wrong. \"David (one of Michael's closest friend's) is portrayed as a gang member who doesn't really want to be a gang member but he doesn't really see another option.  He doesn't have any guidance so he takes the path of least resistance, which is the gang.\" (Scribbles \"The Blind Side\").   It is apparent that without the influence of the Tuohy's in his life, he may not have had the moral conscience to know when to stop- which could have changed his life dramatically.  \n    Once Michael has achieved a good enough grade point average, he is allowed to play on the football team.  Michael had never played football and did not understand the rules.  Leigh Anne Tuohy was able to use Michael's past experiences in order to help him better understand the object of the game and his role to his team.  Through the help of his teammates, coaches, and family Michael becomes an extremely talented athlete that many colleges want to play for them.  His life changed drastically from being homeless to now being one of the most vital athletes to college recruiters.  Without the opportunity given to him by the Tuohy family, Michael would have never been able to play football in high school, college, and eventually the NFL.  \"The film eventually gives us the immense satisfaction of seeing footage of the real Michael Oher and the Tuohys at his 2009 draft to the Baltimore Ravens.\" (The Harvard Crimson).\n    Those with an opposing claim would say that the purpose of The Blind Side is to create another racist story.  This is valid because where Michael had lived, before moving in with the Tuohy's, it never shows a single Caucasian person, only those of African American race.  This is seen as racist because it makes them feel as though they are not good enough to live in an upper-class setting.  However, the movie uses real-life scenarios, 14.5 percent of Americans live at a poverty level, of that percentage, African Americans had the highest poverty rate, 27.4, and whites had the least, 9.9 percent.  The film doesn't feed into racism, but rather shows how it is in reality.  \nIn essence, opinions on the quality, or enjoyment of the overall film, may not have change.  However, with a new found understanding of the purpose of the film, it may be easier to understand what others have seen in it.  The purpose of the Blind Side, is to present the life of someone who lives in poverty and how that can change their life.  The director, John Hancock, was successful in achieving his purpose during the movie.  He gave examples through adoption into a white family, which gives contrast to his old life.  He also showed his new found friendships, which give him higher moral standards than old friends.  Last, he is given a chance to be a professional athlete, by going to a high-end Christian high school and learning the rules of football.  These variables all come into play, to create something that inspired people, and made them happy.  \n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotated Bibliography: The Blind Side\nNewton, David. \"Michael Oher gives negative review to effect 'The Blind Side' has had.\" ESPN, 18 June 2015, http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/13100161/michael-oher-carolina-panthers-says-hit-movie-blind-side-hurt-career.\n    Web.\nMichael Oher describes his challenges with his ability to play football, now that the movie has been released.  He states that people no longer see the skill he really has, and that it's because of the movie.  Generally speaking, most people don't watch the offensive line, however every time that Michael Oher plays, every move is seen and noted.  Michael Oher has speculated that it's because of the movie, that people are so nit picky about how he plays.  Michael Oher believes that his value as a player has decreased since the release of The Blind Side in 2009.

The article also uses pathos by using what his signed contract amount is for, and who he plays for.

He made the subjects light to make it easier to swallow, but still gave it enough seriousness as to not make fun of the topics.  It spoke of the unlikely friendship between the wealthy Leigh Anne Tuohy, and Michael Oher, as the two take on new challenges together, like Michael's failing GPA, and his lack of aggression on the football field.  She explains to him that he needs to protect his team as he would his own family, once Michael starts to understand the game, he wants to start earning better grades to continue playing.

Film.\nFilm.\nThe blind side is a film about the story of Michael Oher and his journey becoming a professional athlete.  Michael had been throughout school for years, and was homeless, when Leigh Anne Tuohy took him into her family; gave him a bed, schooling, food, and love.  Leigh Anne brings his protective instincts to the football field, during practicing showing him how to protect his team, eventually making him a very sought after athlete from numerous universities.  A main theme found in the film is love.  We see that Leigh Anne is a Christian woman, who brings a homeless teenager in her house, when no one has asked her to. She not only houses and clothes him, but she treats him like family.  One bias is that the director of the movie is white, as well as the 'heroine' Mrs. Tuohy, where as Michael is a large black man.  Many people have seen this as prejudice that black people need the whites to survive. The movie is strongly related to pathos, tugging at your heartstrings through every trial the family goes through, as well as raising your spirits with it's humor and uplifting message.

            "content": "A movie which will initially evoke feelings of \"been there, seen that\", The Blind Side is a based on true events sports drama which strikes the viewers with its huge heart, touching and inspirational story. A simple and predictable delivery, it explores the loving and giving nature of people, without falling into annoying or boring cliches. \n\nJohn Lee Hancock's delivery tells the true story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a poor teenager whose fate is changed when the Tuohy family (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw) open their house to him. A story of giving love, helping each other and believing in success, The Blind Side would have been just another feel-good tear-jerker if it was not for smooth blend of drama and comedy as well as the brilliant performances of Quinton Aaron and especially Sandra Bullock. Both of them, directed by Hancock, succeed to deliver moments of tears and moments of fun to the audiences in an extremely convincing and heart-warming way. The story of how Michael was saved and elevated from poor, crime-soaked environment to a college and NFL stardom is one that will surely please the mainstream viewers. However, what deserves also a significant attention is Sandra Bullock's performance. The depiction of the conservative, but determined Leigh Anne Tuohy is one that earns admiration. Bullock succeeds to amplify the  dramatic moments and touch the hearts of the viewers with her endless believe in good and second chances, which ultimately got her the Academy Best Actress Award\n\nIn conclusion, The Blind Side is one of these rare and delightful gems which go completely against the odds of the majority of deliveries from this painfully known and cliched genre. A movie to be seen over and over again, the story of Michael Oher is one that I would strongly recommend (and watch over and over again).",

Leigh Anne Tuohy, who is played by Sandra Bullock, is a upperclass woman that is a take charge person and is not afraid of anyone or anything. His father, as we eventually find out, killed himself by jumping off of a bridge. His mother was a bonafide crack head. Michael Oher was virtually homeless and survived on his own, but one night Michael was out on the streets with nowhere to go and his life would be forever changed. His adoption into the Tuohy family helped him, but the members of the Tuohy family lives would never be the same.

I'm all for inspirational films, but this one looked like an overcooked, manipulative tearjerker with Sandra Bullock stepping way outside of her comfort zone to play a Good Samaritan Southern Belle who helps a struggling black teen with a painful past. I was afraid the film would exploit or gloss over the true pains of African-Americans struggling to escape the projects. I was afraid Sandra Bullock, whose forte is romantic comedies, would annoy with an attempt at a Southern accent. I was afraid that the power of this true story would be lost in hackneyed and trite filmmaking.\n\nMy fears were unfounded, and one cannot, it appears, judge a film by its trailer. This is one of the best mainstream films about Christians I've ever seen, possessing charm, integrity, and honesty in spades. Bullock's stab at a Southern accent, while dubious in a two-minute trailer, is actually quite convincing when viewed in the complete film. She truly loses herself in the role, and much to my surprise, I'd like to see her win an Oscar for her tough-love portrayal of a woman whose cannot help but help others. Country-music superstar Tim McGraw, as her husband, proves himself a capable actor, Granted, he doesn't have to do any heavy emotional lifting in the film, but his ability to deliver lines of dry humor was an unexpected delight. Newcomer Quinton Aaron, as the young man helped by Bullock's family, conveys a great deal of pain, sorrow, and joy with his eyes.",

Although still sporting the same Sandra Bullock redeems herself after the dreadful beautifully played by Leigh Anne Tuohy, a Steel Magnolia in Memphis who takes a troubled black teenager named Michael Oher into her very white family's McMansion. Leigh Anne's husband Sean remarks later on the couple's prejudices, \"we would have a black son before we knew a Democrat? \"There aren't that many one-liners in \"The Blind Side,\" which is basically a true rarity: a fish-out-of-water drama about race relations centering on Michael, who, like the heroine of \"Precious,\" is large, African-American, abused and functionally illiterate. Michael is on the verge of flunking out of a lily-white Christian academy when Leigh Anne - seeing him running around in shorts and a T-shirt during the dead of winter decides to make him an improbable member of her family. The Tuohy's young son is on board with the idea, although his older sister resists at first. The reaction from Leigh Anne's friends is more pointed. \"Is this a white guilt thing?\" one friend asks her. In fact, the well-to-do Tuohy's, who describe themselves as rednecks, are no liberals - but they take Christian principles seriously. They do meet that Democrat, a liberal tutor hired to help Michael improve his grades enough that he can try out for the school's football team, Michael Oher became a star for the University of Mississippi and was drafted by the NFL's Baltimore Ravens this year. What makes \"The Blind Side\" a great movie is that Sandra bullock is portraying that no matter what the color of the skin is that someone can get very far in life with support and love from the people around them and not giving up and when you have a dream never give up on it no matter how hard it gets.",

These are all what I look for in a movie, and \n\nhow i'll be reviewing The Blind Side. When I go to see a movie I am always looking for how the \n\nactors/ actresses play the part, the quality of the graphics, the storyline is consistent, that the \n\npace of the movie isn't too fast you can understand what is happening, and looking to see if \n\nthe plot is a continuous thing throughout the movie.\n\n\tWhen looking at actors/ actresses i am looking for how well they play the part. I want to \n\nsee if they really fit the part; like do they connect with the person that they are playing? In The \n\nBlind Side I feel like the actors, and actresses really fit the part that they are playing. It really \n\nseemed like they were actually a family; was as if they really weren't acting or playing a part. \n\n\tWhile looking at graphics I want to see stuff that looks realistic. I want to see stuff \n\nthat's like really high quality and looks extremely real; like it actually happened. I also want to \n\nsee that it wasn't just done on a computer screen; while looking at this category I\u0092ll also be \n\njudging it on how the actors/actresses react to it, or act when they are interacting with the \n\ngraphics.  This movie had great graphics. \n\n\t\n\nWhen I see a movie I want to see the storyline be continuous; I don't want something that \n\nis confusing or anything like that. I want it to make sense, and for it to be easily to understand, \n\nbut still entertaining.  I also want to see good development of how the storyline comes together.  \n\nLooking for the graphics, and the quality of the graphics is pretty easy to do, just look for how \n\nreal they look. Like fake blood , fake fighting and multiple things like that. \n\nDuring a movie I want to see the plot being continued throughout the whole movie.  \n\nSome movies just have the plot on certain time like when it's actually happening but then they go \n\nright into solving it I also like to see a interesting plot, I don't want to see a boring plot because \n\nthen the movie is usually boring. \n\n \tSo basically how I reviewed The Blind Side is on actors/ actresses, pace, \n\nstoryline, and plot development.  I hope you can see what I mean, with the categories and why I \n\nlook for those things in a movie.",

            "content": "Writer/Director John Lee Hancock's adaptation of Michael Lewis' true-story book \"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game\" is a tactfully hedged intriguing mixture of complicated socioeconomics', politics and willpower.\n\nEmbodying her character as a wealthy All-American Memphis Republican housewife, Sandra Bullock couldn't be more deserving of her first Academy Award nomination in this career-best role. Often overlooked for her questionable comedic pursuits, it is wonderful to see Bullock back in the Drama style she has such talent for. \n\nFinding new talent and athletic prowess is top private school football Coach Burt Cotton's (Ray McKinnon) job. After setting sight on 16-year-old African-American gentle giant Michael Oher, derogatorily known as Big Mike (played by Quinton Aaron), Cotton found the offensive left tackle  (Blind Side player) of his dreams.\n\nIn an uphill battle, Cotton is determined to convince the straight laced and conservative school board that it is their \"Christian duty\" to give the boy the education he deserves. Learning disorders and all, Oher is enrolled in school on one condition; he cannot play sports until his grade point average reaches the basic standard.\n\nQuiet and introverted, the undereducated 'Big Mike' instantly falls behind in class, unable to communicate his comprehension in the expected methods. A misfit in every way, Oher's problems stem even further than the classroom. Son of a crack-addicted mother and absentee father, Oher's is alone in the world; homeless, penniless and living out of the school gym.\n\nOne night, as Oher waits for the gym to empty, he is confronted by the white well-to-do Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock). Brash in her mother-knows-best approach, Leigh Ann demands that Oher come home with her family.\n\nA woman with purpose in her stride and absolute certainty in her heart, Leigh Ann's perfectly cultured upper-crusted exterior conceals a complex and deeply caring woman. \n \nConcerned with his well-being, Leigh Ann invites Oher to stay. Crossing into the Ghetto (Hurt Village) to collect the last of \"Big Mike's\" meager possessions, Leigh Ann realizes the extent of society's failures towards Michael and single handedly decides to put them right.\n\nCreating him a home, giving him a personal and respectable identity and getting his grades up to standard, Leigh Ann finally gets him on the football field and the path to a decent life.\n\nAs expected this story utilizes every clich\u00e9. Can Michael get the grades he needs to get into college? Can he fully comprehend the game well enough to play? Will she stand up to her snobby socialite friends? Does Leigh Ann have an ulterior motive to her do-gooder ways? \n\nIf you can see past some of the cringe-worthy 50cent cash-in lines, Bullock injects humor and strength into this very delicate and soft true-story biopic. \n\nThe exact opposite to the fictional Best Picture nominee Precious, \"The Blind Side\" doesn't feel the need to delve into the gritty and authentic sense of defeat and despair of the situation, rather present a cleanly polished, packaged and palatable uplifting journey. \n\nSimilarly, opposed to its other Best Picture nominee Invictus, \"The Blind Side\" doesn't harbor dreadfully on-field, resisting the urge to descend into a mediocre sports movie. \n\nExceptionally well-cast, Bullock is teamed with movie newcomer Quinton Aaron. Aaron's understated and appealing performance is pleasant and easy to accept. Kathy Bates' contrasting character as a left-wing Democratic tutor sits well within the film. Country Singer Tim McGraw and 12 year old Jae Head bring a well crafted light-heartedness and innocence respectively to the film.\n\nThe Verdict:  Although nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, this wonderfully positive and emotive story has an overly glossy mainstream style and lacks the hard-edge of its competitors.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 05/03/2010",

Michael discovers his passion for football and gets numerous college football offers. The movie is a feel good movie and does a good job with keeping the plot moving with many tear jerking moments such as a crazy car accident with Michael and SJ the Tuohy's young son. Overall, \"The Blind Side\" is an excellent movie with a good true story and great actors. Thumbs up!",

The film is based on the true story of Michael Ohre's transformation from homeless to star athlete. Michael is taken in by the Touhy family and treated as one of them almost immediately. The film focuses on the relationships that characters develop, and how these relationships change the characters.\n\tThe character progression throughout the movie creates a sense of personality, allowing you to be empathetic towards them and therefore pull you more into the story. The variation of ages and personalities makes the film appealing to everyone in the family because it is easy to identify with one or multiple characters in The Blind Side. The movie portrays the struggles of this unusual family in a comedic yet touching way, leaving you feeling uplifted. The movie does a really great job of reflecting the feelings the real Touhy family experienced during the early days of Michael Ohre's football career and life as part of their family. \n\tWatching the movie alone brings back the best feelings of growing up in a happy family, and makes you appreciate the things you had on an everyday basis that others were not fortunate enough to have. Aside from bringing back memories, the Touhy family is an inspiration through their love and compassion for Michael. Michael returns the feelings in his own subtle ways that prove how grateful he is to his family. \n\tWatching this movie is guaranteed to uplift and inspire all ages. It is one of those movies you can watch anytime and still love the way it makes you feel. Overall, The Blind Side is a great movie that manages to evoke feelings that lead to laughing, crying, and everything in between.",

However, after taking the film itself into consideration, without the critical hype and ridiculous whispers of Best Picture, the film itself is not all that bad.\u00a0\n\nThe plot revolves around two central characters, Sandra Bullock's Leigh Anne Tuohy and Quinton Aaron's Michale Oher. There are no qualms about the plot, it's fairly straightforward, simple and bred to bring tears, it's the rest of the film which is the problem. The sugary look of Michael's old neighbourhood is terribly restrained in order to maintain a PG rating; a slum made up of gangsters whose main weapon is calling people names. The minor characters are dreadfully thought out; the extremely annoying young boy playing the wiser-than-thou card, a teenage girl who apparently has no problem with ditching her friends and no insecurity about anything, seemingly at peace with having a boy walk in while she's wearing a ridiculous facial mask, not to mention having less lines than a mute, a tutor whose role is difficult to define, a father who seems to do nothing but bend to his wife's wishes and go along for the ride and a coach who might as well not be there. There is also the small problem of having a lead actor who can't actually act.\u00a0\n\nHowever, Sandra Bullock's performance is the film's redemption. She is rock solid throughout the film, never once leaving character, strange for a woman who's nominated for a Razzie this year. Her strong, maternal role is the star of the show, but it's the moments when her underlying emotions bubble to the surface that really define the performance. She deserves more screen time than she gets, and you'll wish that she had more by the end of the film.\u00a0\n\nPeople say that you should take a box of tissues with you because otherwise your shirt will be soaked, but I didn't cry at all. Mostly thanks to Aaron's extremely unconvincing performance. But if you're in the mood for something you don't have to think about, I would recommend this.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nSaying goodbye to Michael, Sandra's emotional side kicks in.",

The film is focused on the beginning of Oher\u00b4s football career and all what he had to go trough to triumph in the said sport.\nAs a non USA citizen I had to admit that I have never liked \"football\", unlike most people that had seen this film, so I didn't expect much from this stereotypical sport film. \"The Blind Side\" counts with a really amazing story as the film\u00b4s source material but its translation to big screen lost some of the story\u00b4s power by lacking a memorable directing, well written supporting characters and suffering the expected Hollywood exaggeration treatment; Sandra Bullock and Quinton Aaron deliver solid performances but the rest of the cast left something to be desire regarding their acting; it has a handful of scenes that stand on their own, the first half of the film (before the football comes into the picture) is actually entertaining and well made, and this film is filled with clich\u00e9s and cheap ways to touch your heartstrings  that most people fall for but the effect it has on others, like me, is to make us roll our eyes. \n\"The Blind Side\" is a film filled with clich\u00e9s that still manages to entertain you for most of its long runtime but overall has almost nothing to talk about other than the source material and both Bullock\u00b4s and Aaron\u00b4s performances, but other than that this film has absolutely nothing.",

Sandra Bullock essentially takes Michael under her wing and puts her stewardship into practice. She gives an outstanding performance aside from the forced dodgy accent. It is what fuels the movie and guides it in the right direction, even though even she loses footing once or twice. She's still got the chops though, with that dash of Sandra corniness. She does incorporate a spattled method to her madness like none other. Also I love the little brother, S.J., and his storyline. It really attributes to the ethic of the movie. Him and Michael are like Mutt and Jeff. I firmly believe this movie did get lost in the mix of its time period. Looking back, I  was considerably surprised that there was no awards contention or at least more buzz about the acting guild. The cast was inspirationally good. Team Ward. The source material was so rich in fiber that the movie kinda wrote itself though actually, and really despite the cast the movie had no outside influence. I relent on whether it gave the story actual justification. A lot of this seems like a cram cram cram directorial technique. Like he had too much to do and not enough time to do it.

It has some hilarious moments in it too which is unexpected when I saw it. The only thing I forgot about when I watched it first is Lily Collins, it's nice to see her in this too, and she's also really good in this too. I do see why people think the kid is annoying, I also thought the kid was annoying when I first saw it. But after seeing the scenes that I thought he was annoying in, he was not that annoying and he's really funny. The Blind Side is a great film that the acting makes this movie the best that it can be.",

            "content": "Essentially a remake of The Waterboy, Adam Sandler's eponymous hero is replaced by a young man from the projects of african-american origins, the sort of young man Hollywood is fond bestowing magical, mystical powers upon. In this case, Michael, the young man in question, is a quasi-retarded bohemoth, equal parts Michael-Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile and Sloth from The Goonies.\n\nMichael says nothing, does nothing, hinting we are to presume, at untold sorrows. He arrives at a well-heeled Catholic private school by some crude machination I've forgotten the details of, thus starting on the road to redemption, college and ultimately the NFL that we know is the conclusion of his story (it being a true story and all). He's taken in and saved from his pitiful existence spent hanging around laundromats and kids playgrounds by Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a brassy, sassy Southern belle and queen bee of the smuggest family in existence. \n\nTuohy has the gaudy jewellery, the tight white pants, multiple BMW's and all the tacos she can eat. She eats $18 salads with WASP stereotypes and donates to multiple charities but still something is missing from her life. Driving home from her daughter's volleyball game, the entire family ensconsced in the sort of vulgar comfort only an X5 can offer, a divine convergence brings Michael into their life. Michael lives in a plastic bag and can't speak, so naturally they drive him back to their house, give him a couch to sleep on, a pile of rugby shirts, an enormous dinner, some books and a massive pick-up truck.\nAll they ask in return is that he plays football. They don't, of course, say it in so many words, but there's an implicit threat in Tuohy's shrew-like features. \nWhen Michael first steps on to the field, after what feels like a lifetime, the expectations are enormous. I mean, he's huge, and well, you know, black. Surely he's going to brilliant? He's a disaster though, getting pushed around, smiling at childresn, pointing at ballons, and it's not until Tuohy brushes the gormless coach aside and demands the entire team suckles on her teat of sassy, southern motherly wisdom. From that moment Michael and the team are transformed and run riot over the ramshackle redknecks assembled in opposition.\nTuohy's ridiculous cunt of a son makes a dvd of Michaels one high-school football game, sends it to every college in the bible belt and before you know it we're treated to a delightful montage of elderly Southern gentlemen, the type who survive by sucking the souls out of others, masturbating furiously, frothing cocks in hand, over endless replays of Michael pushing guys around. \nThe only thing now standing between Michael and endless riches, not to mention an appearance on Cribs, is his GPA. He needs straight A's for the rest of the year, but how could he ever do this? The guy can barely write. The answer, of course, is Kathy Bates. Reprising her role from The Waterboy, she signs on as Miss Sue, Michaels personal tutor and infinite font of homespun wisdom. With her help Michael gets the required grades, and even has time to visit the project, beat up a bunch of gansta's and learn how to close his eyes.\nAfter trying out for the college coaches in a very subtle satire on the old slave auctions (and kudos to the makers for tackling such sensitive subject matter in a delicate and even-handed manner), Michael goes to the college of his forefathers and pushes around a load of other guys in tight pants. As expected, he's brilliant at this and graduates from college, voted \"Guy most likely to push other guys around\" and gets drafted to the NFL.\nAn incredibly brave film, combining broad slapstick humour and documentary style reportage, it's no surprise the Academy have chosen to embrace this film, and Bullock in particular. She really does have a very nice bottom.",

In a funny way, this bit of late-breaking information functions the same as the \"he's dead\" revelation in M. Night Shyamalan's \"The Sixth Sense\", because it forces the moviegoer to reexamine all the preceeding scenes under a new frame of reference. Whereas Shyamalan situated the Bruce Willis character sans conversation among the living, this filmmaker too stages scenes that hide the truth in plain sight, then blindsides the moviegoer with a game-changing moment of epiphany. Here, it's in a surprisingly terse scene between Michael(Quintin Aaron) and a NCAA investigator, in which the Touhys are cast in a surprisingly unfavorable light, complicating the film's emotional uplift ever so slightly. Good samaritans or hell-bent boosters? Although the Touhy's are never labeled as such, the evidence of their vested interest in a good left tackle is right in your face all along. An Ole Miss football game on Thanksgiving Day dominates the Touhy household, in which the family gathers around the television from the sofa with their turkey-stuffed plates. When Leigh-Ann(Sandra Bullock) observes her charge sitting by himself at the dining room table, she shuts off the game, and has them join their permanent guest for a more traditional familial holiday arrangement. This is the moment, perhaps, that Leigh-Ann starts to understand how their football-centric lifestyle might need some toning down. (Even the Touhys' young son is put to work as Michael's trainer.) To what extent is her paternalism motivated by a rabid love for Rebel football? Unfortunately, \"The Blind Side\" bails the University of Mississippi alumnists out, during an exchange where Leigh-Ann and Sean(Tim McGraw) suss out their motivations with a proper amount of self-flaggelation, so we don't have to. But in a telling scene, Miss Sue(Kathy Bates), Michael's tutor, tries to recruit the future NFL star away from hated SEC rival Tennessee with a crazy story about Neyland Stadium(where the Volunteers play its home games), which validates the possibility that a well-to-do couple would feed and clothe an offensive line prospect for their beloved team.",

In \"The Blind Side\" Sandra Sandra Bullock is absolutely fantastic! Why? Because she's so believable in her role; most of the time a big name actor gets in the way of their own character because all the audience recognizes is the face. In \"The Blind Side\" Sandra pretty much disappears into her character of Mrs. Tuohy, which allows the movie itself to have a life of it's own as it's big name actor is replaced by a charismatic southern mom. Yes, Mrs. Tuohy does drive the movie, yet she is not too overpowering to where the other characters are drowned out. Michael and the rest of the Tuohy's act superbly within their roles; the scenes with the smallest Tuohy (SJ) and Michael are very humorous and impactful when they need to be. They really portray a good brother to brother relationship. The movie as a whole is more of a drama than a sports film, about the power of family and what it means to challenge yourself: if that means going out of your way to help another, pushing yourself to achieve what you once thought impossible or looking inwardly to see if you really are the person you want to be. Fantastic performance by Sandra, the story is told wonderfully with enough humor to balance the sometimes dramatic or intense turns. Overall a grand accomplishment for feel good cinama! And a final comment: for all the people that seem to think the movie is about a poor black child helped out by the more privileged white angels, I think you are projecting your own prejudice onto a film that clearly does not have that kind of message in mind. Point in fact: I doubt the Golden Globes would recognize an actress for her role in a obviously racist picture if that were the case at all.

If you don't live in the south and you have never been around zealous boosters and you never been exposed to sheltered/gated-wealthy-I-wanna-help-the-poor you probably did have a feel good experience. (I imagine the family had such a feel good experience they have adopted a tight end and guard by now) I'm sorry the answer he gave to the investigator, and Bullock's enlightening drivebys on the side of town she'd never been to, and their poor boy walking in the rain come home with us beginning - just didn't work for me. But if you are right I hope this movie empties our foster homes - still a silly story. And I don't want to shock anyone but if they say it is based on a true story it doesn't mean that it is all or even mostly true.",

The Bright Side should be a case study for what's wrong with American mainstream filmmaking, an exemplar of dumbed-down writing and directing, wrapped in the transparent gauze of reality. As if this \"true story,\" saccharinated to cancer inducing levels, has any resemblance to actual events. Reality is complex; this movie is not. What's worse, the messages are patently offensive: the glorification of wealth, the inherent goodness of whites over blacks, the retreaded notion that sports are the only ticket out of the ghetto. John Lee Hancock has never met a reaction shot he doesn't like. Every time the big kid opens his mouth, Hancock cuts to one of his white savior's droopy expressions -- now, isn't that just the saddest thang y'all evah heard -- just in case we didn't understand that the black boy's plight is worthy of sympathy.

I can't believe some of the ludicrous comments coming from some reviewers, in particular Melissa Anderson from Village Voice. Does she know this movie is based on a true story? Does she realize that white people are overwhelmingly in the upper class of Memphis? Did she skip the entire scene where Bullock's character is discussing adopting Michael but the other 3 white women seemed outraged and disgusted? Where in the world does she get the idea that this movie is in any way about \"whitey\" being \"virtuous saviors\"? Overall, this film was great. It makes you feel good for the characters and how people coming together can accomplish so much. It speaks volumes about how race relations have progressed during the past decades even though there is still a lot to accomplish. One big complaint I have for this movie is Sandra Bullock. While she overall does a good acting job, it felt as if she overdid her character. The other complaint I have is how the author added into the movie things that simply don't fit reality (like Bullock confronting a crack dealer in the middle of the projects), which takes away from how seriously you can take the movie because it begins to slide into a fantasy tale. Nevertheless, all the other aspects of the movie pick up where it slacks. Good family movie. Good time for all. Watch it!",

Upon viewing the final product, my suspicions were validated. Its heart is entirely in the wrong place. The movie ought to be about Michael Oher and how he achieved success, but this is not the case. The Blind Side centers around the kind Southern white woman who takes in an underprivileged black youth. Her kindness, not his struggle, is what the movie is about. To the actors' credit, everyone does a good job. The leads are mostly great, especially Quinton Aaron, but the direction and writing undercuts the performances. The Blind Side is all uplift and no substance. When the movie isn't trying to win your heart with its blatant emotional pandering, it's trying to warm it with sentiment-heavy and sitcom-lite humor, a rather nauseating combination. Also problematic is the unflattering portrait of African Americans. In the movie's eyes, if black people aren't waiting for kind white folk to lend a helping hand, they are either unable to support their families or are manipulative bullies. I suppose there is one business-professional African American woman, but it's telling that she is introduced as a villain. There are moments in The Blind Side where a better movie shines through, one with both the appropriate seriousness and sweetness for the situation, but this better movie is largely overshadowed by the mediocre one in the foreground. It is sadly telling about the state of film when movies like this are nominated for Best Picture.",

This beautiful and touching story shows the life of Michael Oher, a poor street boy who with the help of Leigh Anne, a wealthy housewife, will be successful in life. As the situation develops the protagonist starts asking questions to himself; this part is very interesting because it represents the typical questioning of adolescence. Some examples are: should you always do what others tell you to do? Or sometimes you do not even know why you are doing something; and honor is the real reason either you do something or you don\u2019t, is who you are or maybe who you want to be. Apart from that is captivating the title of the picture; it is called the blind side because every time something bad happened during his difficult childhood the protagonist closed his eyes. The problems of the movie are that recurs excessively to the sports, when it should be used just as a way to transmit the message; and the final investigation is totally out of placed, seems that this part is just filling space.

Sandra gives a great performance, but time to time she just annoying, and the rest is all right. Score is descent. Not the best. Story is really good. Telling the story of micheal oher is just great. The football scenes are all right. It like each time they blow each team out, it's just not beleiveable. Overall, blindside is a great sports film.  With all the heart, this is for everyone to go and see.",

Even a good intentioned act can be made to look like a dishonourable one. I'm not sure how great Bullock's performance was but I do think that it was the best of a poor year's showing from actresses across Hollywood. Sports movies do not normally go this deep, but The Blind Side shines through all the hardships faced by Michael Oher on his road to becoming an NFL player.",

When I heard all the buzz about papaya, I decided that I just had to try some. Both decisions left a bad taste in my mouth.\r Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy, a plucky gun-wielding mom with a lot of spunk (remember what Lou Grant said about spunk?) One day, Leigh Anne notices a behemoth named Michael Oher (played well by Quinton Aaron) walking around shivering and homeless. She invites him to stay overnight in her upscale home.\r Now, I don't know about most guys, but if some rich woman that looked like Sandra Bullock invited me to stay overnight in her home, I'd be there faster than a Viagra-laden Superman flying to his date with Lois Lane. However, after a few minutes of listening to Tuohy's junior-high psychology as well as enduring her general all-around annoying personality, I'd be out of there faster than Sarah Palin's ouster from a Mensa meeting.\r Then there's Bullock's performance itself. I don't know if it suffered from the fact that she was portraying such an irritating person. I was hoping some hulk from the football team would mistake her for a blocking sled and... well, not really. But maybe the fact that the character got under my skin so much says something about Bullock's acting.\r I doubt however that this is what was intended by all those involved in making this flick.\r And, by the way, I'm still waiting for the first great football film to be made (the best of the bunch, Jerry McGuire and Heaven Can Wait can only marginally be considered football films).",
