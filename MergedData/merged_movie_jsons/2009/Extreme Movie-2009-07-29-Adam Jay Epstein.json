            "content": "There seems to be a general rule of thumb now that a \"Movie\" franchise film is only really half-decent if Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg aren't involved with the production. The good news then, is that in this case, they weren't. The people behind \"Extreme Movie\" are the same people who brought you \"Not Another Teen Movie\" which is one of the better spoof movies of recent years.This is not the kind of movie you'd let grandma watch. It's not really the kind of movie you'd want your parents to catch you watching either, but it is perhaps the sort of thing teenagers would watch as a 'Date Movie'. It's juvenile and full of sex and fart jokes, not to mention a fair bit of nudity, so its not really for the easily offended. A film about teenagers and sex is by its very definition going to be a bit raunchy. At the grand old age of 35, maybe I'm getting a bit long in the tooth for these kind of teen 'High School' movies, but I do like comedy and spoof films so am always prepared to give stuff like this a chance, and I did find a couple of parts of this film quite funny and I did laugh. Also for once, I was disappointed that the film came to an end after just over seventy minutes - unlike with the 'Epic' and 'Disaster' movies, my brain cells weren't starting to fry and I could easily have sat through more of the same.This is not a movie in the normal sense of the word but a series of skits with the common theme of teenage sex. Personally, I liked the guy who went to the wrong apartment by mistake dressed in a mask to act out a kidnap fantasy with a girl he met online - \"Did anyone order a rape?\" - it just cracked me up for some reason - not sophisticated by any means, but funny. This is definitely a film for the Lads rather than the ladies though.",

To give this movie credit, it is not as bad as those two. However, it is still a dire movie. The title is a head-scratcher, I wasn't sure what it meant by extreme, if it meant the humour I'll understand but if it was something else, sorry I don't get it. The film is rather cheap to look at, while the direction is decidedly patchy. The acting is pretty terrible, not the worst I've seen, but nobody seems comfortable with their material. Frankie Muniz is bland, Ashley Schneider is all looks no acting talent, Jamie Kennedy is uncharismatic, Michael Cera tries hard- in all honesty he is the only actor seemingly who tries- but struggles with bad material while Matthew Lillard is pointless. The biggest failings of Extreme Movie are in its humour and storytelling, the jokes are unfunny and the script is really lame on the whole, while the story is predictable and almost a non-event. I also hated the irritating characters and the ending, which felt really tacked on. All in all, a dire movie but I have seen worse. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

Is it really one of those franchise \" ______ Movie\". Is it really as bad as those films? The answer is no.It is incredibly worse.Ladies and gentlemen this flick has cracked my top ten on the list of the worst movies ever made. It is truly that terrible.The film, if you can even call it that, has no virtually no story or plot. It is honest to god, a bunch of sketches. Something off of SNL or Mad TV, but for raunchy. There is one character that runs throughout the entire film and he tries to get the girl. Nothing new, original or funny there.The \"film\" for some reason has recognizable names. Stars like Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Frankie Muniz and Michael Cera. This \"film\" is an embarrassment for all involved and should be locked away with films like Belly or Carnivore.Non of the sketches are funny. We've seen all these things before. It tries to be edgy, but comes off as juvenile. A woman gets her cellphone stuck in her vagina and it constantly goes off, pleasuring her at the most inappropriate times. A kid buys a sex toy, a life like vagina and the entire skit is his relationship with it, it becomes jealous and kills itself. Matthew Lillard some unknown reason inter cuts the sketches with unoriginal jokes that your father probably knows.The only tolerable bit was Cera, and it's only because he sells it, not the writing.For the love of god and all that is good, never watch this trash.",

Its basically just a bunch of skits of teens in embarrassing situations trying to get the girl. Though there's one main story, involving a kid-Mike (Ryan Pinkston) trying to get a girl from his class. That seems to come around here and there and ends up being there towards the ending. The setup of this movie reminded of the animation series of Robotchicken: a bunch of sketches which are zapped when finished. And the same thing is going on here. Mix Robotchicken with an average teen movie and this is what you get. Also the talented cast was wasted (Frankie Muniz, Michael Cera, Jamie Kennedy), they're only in about one scene which is pretty deceiving considering they get top billings and are on the cover of the poster. Overall this movie was just lame, unfunny and just horrible.",

The jokes do not really work either.

This \"movie\" is really just a series of moving pictures from the backlot of a fourth-tier porn studio that decided to have its actors get together between takes and try to put something \"funny\" together. To discount it as offensive and gross would be unfair to offensive and gross movies; it's just...pointless. No acting, no plot, no special effects, no jokes, just the constant repetition of naughty words and breast shots.

The movie is just one incoherent skit to another - all involving different characters, with flashes to an awful 'Street confessions' mock TV show and film editing transitions of white noise, how windows 95. Also talent wise Frankie Muniz headlines the movie, which for an out of work child actor doesn't say a lot. Big name Michael Cera looks embarrassed through trying to bounce off other wooden 'actors' (I doubt they were even that) involved a small role in an equally unfunny scenario. And the porn scene... I think it's safe to say SAG have no idea where those artistes were hired from. The writers also embarrassed themselves implementing poor, poor imitation scenes from Weird Science, Girl Next Door and Not Another Teen Movie, so much it ruins the original.Overall I felt hurt I had wasted my time watching this film, the very least they could have done was edit it so it all stories were linked and thus gave somewhat correlated chronology of events, instead of mind wobbling mess of themes. There was a main plot of the film nestled inbetween the separate dire toilet humour gags, though it was underdeveloped and poor.",

All are very similar...with a barrage of jokes, almost all of which are crude, disgusting and rarely funny. And, like these other films, there really isn't much plot, so I cannot really describe what you'll be seeing if you see the movie.So did I like \"Extreme Movie\"? No...but it was less because it was so unfunny but because I felt uncomfortable because these films are all marketed towards teens...and \"Extreme Movie\" is about sex...pretty much each and every joke. I cannot even mention what many of the jokes are about (due to IMDB standards)...but, yes, there is a scene involving dwarves and a girl dressed up like Hitler...yes, Hitler! Many of the jokes also are about STDs and all sorts of nasty things....and all handled in a crude and unfunny manner. In many ways, it felt like a movie that was made by 13 year-olds....and I am sure many of them would laugh themselves silly with this film, though any sane parent would be horrified if they watched this thing.

The first scene with Frankie Muniz was one most gut busting funny bits ever. I laughed so hard I started choking on a cookie I was eating. The movie was set up more like the 70's gem \"Groove Tube\" that came across as if you were surfing through TV channels. There was one consistent story line that it would keep coming back to, but in between there were fake commercials, skits, and even a tip to HBO's \"Real Sex\" where they would do the supposedly random interviews on the street....Which usually turned out with more info than one of the interviewed knew or basically wanted to know about the other (or others).I too was going to drop the movie early on, but I decided to hang in there a bit and was able to get a few more laughs...I mean a movie with fart jokes involving pretty girls can't be all bad right??? Like groove Tube I think this was probably made with the idea that people in a state of mind pollution would find this rolling on the ground funny....And they'd probably be right.....But this isn't the seventies so I don't think it received the same underground fame that Groove Tube did...",

There were some laugh out loud moments (such as the next level scenes, the Michael Cera rape scene, the portable vagina scene and most of the scenes with Ryan Pinkston in, mainly because he really plays the average teenager trying to get with the hot girl really well) and unfortunately there were some really not so funny scenes (mainly the Matthew Lillard scenes).Anyways to sum this film up, it's a middle of the road comedy with a few good laughs so if you're expecting to see a great comedy film with funny moments throughout I strongly advise you go and watch The Hangover films or The Inbetweeners movie instead.5/10",

With a title like Extreme Movie, an embarrassing cover, and the fact that it's a Blockbuster Exclusive, honestly doesn't give it very much appeal. However, the cast seemed pretty good, the directors made a hilarious spoof movie (I loved Not Another Teen Movie), and the writers were impressive, many big name Saturday Night Live writers. Even with all that hidden talent though, the movie turns out to be exactly how the DVD case made it seem... embarrassing. For the most part very, very low brow humor with not very spectacular timing or very good taste. The movie for some reason plays like a typical American Pie storyline with sketches randomly thrown in. Some of these sketches made me chuckle, but for the most part, every sketch went on way, way too long. Michael Cera's sketch though actually had me laughing for a few hours after I had already watched the movie. It might seemed a little biased because he was the reason I watching the movie, but really his sketch was the only one that was casted perfectly. He's only in the movie for maybe ten minutes, if even that, and the first couple of minutes really nothing happened. However, if you're not sick of Michael Cera's awkwardness yet, then it's used perfectly here. Other than that, Jamie Kennedy's sketch made me went to take a shower after watching it. Really disgusting. Thought I was watching porn... actually the majority of the movie kind of feels that way... Matthew Lillard's portions of the film were incredibly unfunny. He basically just sits in a chair and throws at you the old sex advice jokes you've heard from so many standups in the past. Honestly, this isn't a movie I would recommend. If you've been enjoying the movies Michael Cera has been putting out... then probably skip this one. It's really not worth waiting forty minutes from him to appear only to disappear moments later.",

I don't know why it is called \"Extreme Movie\", but it fits the way that topic is depicted. If you liked \"Not Another Teen Movie\" then this one might be suitable for you, although the level of the humor is mostly lower.Definitely not a movie for the really young or the elderly or Cannes-lovers, but enjoyable for a comedy fan who already took a shot at other \"...

Now let's see what this movie brings; one or two good actors (can some1 explain to me why Michael Cera wanted to be in this movie; same for the guy from malcolm in the middle) and a few good looking girls! Together with some lame fart and sex jokes, these parts bring in the three stars I gave them.Now lets have a look at the 7 stars I didn't reward this movie with. First of all, I'm completely missing a storyline. Only sketches! Oke, most sketches continue where the others end, but still...this is not enough for a storyline, not even for these kind of movies. Than we have the jokes; these are probably not as bad as I think right now, but that's due to the acting. Bad actors make bad jokes! The only time I was really laughing was during Michael Cera's sketch.So we have no storyline, bad actors and bad jokes. Hmmm, you're still thinking about seeing this movie? Don't, please don't!

But alas, what starts out as a hilarious opening scene quickly gives way to an utterly disappointing movie with some really awkward scenes.The movie itself is about teens going through the usual issues with sex and maturity (well just sex actually) and plays in the form of small episodes.The only probable reason to even watch this movie would be for its few good funny scenes,namely - the opening scene with Frankie Munitz,the misplaced cell phone,the mistaken room,the scene with the prostitute and the intermittent commentary scenes with Matthew Lillard.In fact,the most hilarious scenes are those with Matthew Lillard and are worth watching (but only these scenes).All in all this movie which starts out promising is just another sad excuse for an attempt at comedy,which contains mostly awkward but un-funny scenes and pretty women (surprisingly enough), with the only good part being Matthew Lillard's jokes. Ultimately in the end not worth the effort or your precious time.What still amazes me though, is how in hell did IMDb give this movie a 7 out of 10???.",

There isn't much story to it, as a lot of it is individual \"skits\", but the main story is a boy who is trying to reveal his crush/love to a classmate of his.

Extreme Movie could be funny but it just ended up taking the sick jokes way too far and actually started to really annoy me.I mean, comedies can be as disgusting as they want as long as they have a story behind it and at least one normal character that can lead us through it. Extreme Movie had neither, it was just a bundle of jokes that started to get annoying quickly, 12 year old kids playing with sex toys, just about every character was some sex addict, and it was just horrible. It was a waste of money and time and the character you think may be the normal character I was talking about hardly ever comes up or does anything the rest of the movie is just about stupid people doing stupid stuff that gets on your nerves after a while.I could probably best describe this as a deranged orgasm in the form of a movie, if that makes sense, because I'm telling you now this movie doesn't. See my vote to see what I really think it's worth!",

            "content": "So here's the deal, I caught only the last 3 skits of this movie and now I really want to see the rest of it. The fact that people are saying it's worse than the spoof movies that have been flooding theatres is complete garbage. It's not for everyone, imagine the most vulgar movie you have seen, this more than likely pushes the envelope a little bit farther. I am not a fan of American pie movies and things that fall in that genre, which this kind of does, what separates it from that style is that it's a few separate skits, no one falls in love, or learns a valuable life lesson to take it from crude entertainment into corniness. Not for everyone by any means, but if you like vulgar comedy this is worth checking out. Just don't take it too seriously.",

            "content": "It's a series of sketches about the teens at Great Bay High School. The senior prom is coming up and the kids have sex-ed. It's part spoof and part sex-romp. The team of Adam Jay Epstein and Andrew Jacobson has made various broad spoofs. It's a lot of scattershot jokes vignettes and they don't hit that often. The major thing holding this back are the lead kid actors. They are not terribly funny on their own. The jokes are basically inappropriate sex jokes with very young actors. It's mostly not that funny. I like Kevin Hart and a couple of the scenes. The writing team has some very notable names. It would be interesting to see who wrote which section. That would have been fun to know.",

The film is kind of funny and similar to \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" and \"Not Another Teen Movie.\" \nMichael Cera (Superbad), Kevin Hart (Central Intelligence), Matthew\nLillard (Scream) and Jamie Kennedy (Scream) make appearances.\nI'd give this a try at least once if you're into laughs.",
