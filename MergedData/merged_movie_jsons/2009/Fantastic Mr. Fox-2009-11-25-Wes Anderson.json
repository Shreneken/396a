            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox is acclaimed director Wes Anderson's first animation, specifically stop-motion, and it's, well, fantastic. George Clooney's voice as the head fox of an animal clan that shouts diversity is straight out of Danny Ocean-- cool and witty with an overlay of sentimentality that would convince you to open your hen house door to let him have his way. That's after his little speech that tries existentialism on for size, foxwise that is: \"Why a fox? Why not a horse, or a beetle, or a bald eagle? I'm saying this more as, like, existentialism, you know? Who am I?\"As the animals pull a caper against farmer Bean (Michael Gambon) and his thugs, the animation pulls away from the gloom of another winner this year, Where the Wild Things Are, and confirms the fun of a well told beast fable with loads of anthropomorphism to reaffirm our love of humanity and confirm that animals, like us, will always be animals. The ease with which Anderson/Clooney convince that this stealing and mayhem are what animals do is a tribute to script and performance that seduce us into the stylistic den of thieves known as the fox lair and all its attitude and custom, sanctioned by mother nature herself.Mr. Fox: \"The cuss am I? Are you cussing with me?\" Badger (Bill Murray): \"No, you cussing with me?\" Mr. Fox: \"Don't cussing point at me!\" Such an exchange is indicative of the fun Anderson has with kids and adults by not bombarding the youngsters with profanity but winking at the adults as if to say, \"You know what I mean.\" And the most violent moment comes not from scenes with guns but rather where the animals steal chickens and break their necks, done so gingerly and quietly that it seems what it is: Just what foxes do and what humans must do to eat the chickens. Darwin meets the cartoons: Mr. Fox: \"And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?\"That's Wes Anderson for you: Sartre and satire with a dash of dashing fox.",

            "review_title": "A Nutshell Review: Fantastic Mr. Fox",
            "content": "I'm pretty much the sucker for stop motion animation, so this naturally comes with that wee bit of bias, because I surely take my hats off to the filmmakers, especially the modelers and pretty much everyone who has to painstakingly move everything a little bit at a time, which for folks who are impatient (like myself), would already have driven one nuts.But this crazy effort in bringing to life Roald Dahl's story of a sly fox, is pretty much worth every frame of it. The man hours and intricate designs are something of an old school technique when compared to the latest computer wizardry, but you'll be amazed at what director Wes Anderson and his team managed to come up with, complete with a solid story, likable characters, and plenty of fun.George Clooney voices Mr Fox, a smug (what else, since Clooney chews these type of roles for breakfast) and wily erm, fox whose specialty is being the chicken thief that he is, providing for family. An incident cutting too close to death has Mr Fox promise Mrs Fox (Meryl Streep) that his thieving days are over, but you know how a leopard cannot change its spots. Soon he moves his family near three farmers Bean (Michael Gambon), Boggis (Robin Hurlstone) and Bunce (Hugo Guinness), and crafts his final hurrah in hitting all three neighbours, only for them to retaliate and demolish Mr Fox's lifestyle, and not to mention his relationship with wife, family and friends, resulting in a battle of wills and wits.Despite the relatively short run time, the film managed to pack plenty of subplots, characterization, and comedy into one well oiled narrative. You'll surely be one without a sense of humour should you not be able to laugh at anything and everything that Anderson had put on screen, from slapstick to really smart and funny lines that make up every moment of enjoyment in this film. The A-list voice cast also includes the likes of Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, Brian Cox, Adrien Brody et al, some of whom you'll know are regulars in Anderson's past works.And if you had enjoyed his past quirky films, then you'd come to expect the same for Fantastic Mr. Fox, with Wes Andersen's signature touches all over the shop, where he made some departures from Dahl's book, but manage to retain the essence of the story, and through a stroke of luck, finding an alternate ending from Dahl's original manuscript which got adopted here in the film. It's comical, it's smart, it's stop motion and it won't be too long before fans will soon adopt Mr Fox's trademarked whistle-whistle-click-click.",

            "content": "I made a diorama in third grade of Fantastic Mr. Fox- a book which I loved fondly- and seeing this film brought me back to that, only better and bolder, but with the same handmade quality of someone awed by the world they read. It's also wildly funny and cheerfully light-and-heavy all at once. It brings director Wes Anderson's concerns as a filmmaker to light, as usual (dysfunctional family, idiosyncratic touches with the characters, absurd child-but-adult-like comedy), and in a setting that is a fantasy that anyone can attach to. Children will latch on to it because of its cute/creepy designs, and its raucous energy. Adults will eat it up because, like with Where the Wild Things Are, it brings us back to a time when we just want to have a fun time and do things, even if we might know or thing they're wrong, or maybe just to dance at very odd moments.Mr. Fox (George Clooney, who else?) is a sly guy with a quick mouth and a caring manner. He is a wild animal though, which is why he breaks the promise he made to his wife to not go out and steal chickens after their first child is born. He can't help it really- those nasty trio of farmers, Boggis Bunce and Bean- have all of those chickens and deliciously alcoholic apple cider just waiting for the taking. As it turns out, this makes the farmers angry as hell (or rather Bean mostly, who at one point does one of those manic 'destroy everything in the house' reactions Kane might appreciate), and they go and destroy the Fox home and all the outlying areas.From there it becomes a battle of wills and, sometimes, real fire power and acorn-bombs and a rabid dog and other wild craziness. Oh, and the stop-motion. Thanks be to someone out there: there's filmmakers still going through the painstaking but endlessly creative process of frame-by-frame film-making where it takes dozens of hours to get just a few seconds of film. People like Anderson and Henry Selick seek out the limitations so they can break through them, or toy around with them as much as possible.With the characterization of 'Mr. Fox', Anderson and his animation team gives us creatures whose hair is always slightly blowing in the wind (something that must have been hard to attain being shot frame by frame), have eyes that are motorized and look like real human eyes almost, and water (or apple cider) when it flows becomes rather dreamlike and appears like we haven't seen it before. That all of the characters have something amazing to their features, be it the way Mr. Fox gnarls his teeth and then does his trademark whistle or to how Rat clicks his fingers like a West Side Story villain, there's something happening every other second. You might figure out how this is all done, but it's not as much concern as what they do with their creations, like kids with action figures making an epic on 8mm film.Fantastic Mr. Fox has the childlike wonder, the modestly dazzling sets and production design (art-Anderson is basically the way to put it by now with his films, from the title cards of species identification to maps and chapter-headings), and an original sense of perspective when it comes to action scenes and simple little camera moves that comes off extraordinary in this setting. But it's also, mostly, hysterically funny. It's not a crude funny like the Hangover or too bizarre like the Men Who Stare at Goats. It's sometimes just plain awkward, or just totally unexpected, or built around an absurdity that comes up and down like the explanation of how to play Whackbat, or Mrs. Bean and her blindness. Or just a line of dialog (\"He's just another rat found in the back of a Chinese restaurant\") sets off a belly laugh that's hard to contain. This is, at the least, the funniest of all the Dahl adaptations, keeping to the surrealism of animals and humans alike, while sticking to a perfectly dry, off-handed approach by its filmmaker.As with everything else in the movie, the comedy feels home-grown, not in a Hollywood lab where everything's tested. This goes too for the excellent voice work that brings Anderson/Baumbach's dialog to fruition. In the theatrical trailer, when first seen, the voices of Clooney and Streep and Bill Murray almost distracted from the quality of the animation. But in full context, they all work, even Anderson himself as a real-estate agent creature. And the outdoor-not-in-studio recording of the voices does add something extra: you feel like there's something real going on, not just in fantasy, thanks to the actors and their \"on-set\" work. I'm sure some extra ideas or expressiveness came out of this, because the performances are a great part of what makes this world so tangible: we know these people and animals, sort of, at least as much as any other Wes Anderson movie.And sure, they're foxes, but why not connect with the theme while we're at it? The film is lovely and insane, smart and silly, lovable and (for a few moments) a little scary, with a kick-ass soundtrack straight out of a record collection (and musical store) that connects just right right this spectacular place of someplace-England. And hey, why not some existentialism to top it off: \"Who am I? And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?\" How indeed? \"I don't know what you're talking about, but it sounds illegal.\"",

            "content": "Giving up his life of a chicken thief because of a child on the way, Mr. Fox gets a job as a newspaper writer and lives underground. Years pass, his child is older and he wants to move to a tree and not feel poor anymore. Along the way he takes in his nephew and decides to steal again, from the three biggest farmers no less. The farmers get wise and start a battle against Mr. Fox, his family and all their creature friends. At first I didn't know if I wanted to see this, the animation looked really bad. But after thinking about it for a bit, I found that it fit into Anderson's style, it was something that he would do. So I gave the film a shot and I'm glad I did. This film has Anderson's signature style all over it, right down to the obvious voice casting, which has the likes of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Michael Gambon, Owen Wilson, and Willem Dafoe.A lot of people, and I'm including myself in this bunch, might think nothing of this film. After all, it doesn't have the bright, adventurous feel of the recent Disney/Pixar films that have been dominating the animation scene. I'd even throw Dreamworks into that bunch. Those films are done by people who are at ease in their field, animated director like Brad Bird and John Lasseter know their way around the animation style. Yet here comes auteur Wes Anderson, who has a unique style and sense of comedy. His transition to animation, stop motion animation no less, is smart, funny and a pleasure. Is it his best film? Of course not, but it's one of the more enjoyable ones.The voice cast all work well, Clooney does a good job as the lead. He has that leadership tone in his voice, that arrogance that is needed for the character. Streep isn't given much to do, so her role as the wife is pretty basic, as is the character. Their son Ash, voice by Bored To Death star Jason Schwartzman was a stand out for me, as was Eric Chase Anderson, as Kristofferson. That name might not sound familiar, that's because his resume only consists of Anderson films. Bill Murray plays a badger and Fox's lawyer, who advises him not to buy the tree house. Fox does anyway and that's why he's in this mess. The animals are really small and live in this world where there are apparently small motorbikes for them to use. They can communicate with the human characters, no one seems to find it odd in this little world they live in. You won't find it odd either, you'll just be enjoying the fun.Each chapter is subtitled, Fox's Master Plan A, Fox's Master Plan B, etc. They even tell you how time passes in human years and fox years and in a comical bit one human hour compare to one fox hour. You never know how long these hours are in comparison to each other, you don't want to know either, it just adds to the uniqueness of the film. At heart, these characters are still wild animals, as Fox even says this in the film, and the way they eat and \"fight\" each other proves this. The film has that Anderson humour and might go over some kids heads. It's dark in some places, as one character dies, but I think they will enjoy it. They won't jump up and down for it like Up, or Finding Nemo. They won't want to go out and buy the latest Mr. Fox stuffed animal or toy. This feels more like a film for adults, it doesn't really cater to the kids, but they will have their bits to laugh at, like the possum who stares blankly at some people for whatever reason. This film was made from scratch, this world Anderson creates is fun and I had a fun time being in it. The film flies by it's running time and I never found the film dragging. It was in and out. As stated before, the kids might enjoy this, but it's more for adults. There's smoking and there's even a unique way of swearing, which I found funny. The camera movements scream Wes Anderson and if you're a fan, then you will enjoy this very much. One of my favourite films of the year.",

Anderson makes you feel and care for the characters from square one which is a supremely difficult task to do (most directors/writers instead employ making them dislikable because it's way easier). The visuals are top notch and super original which deserves + 1 star on its own so really this movie gets a 11/10 from me.The story and the overall effect of this movie to inspire artistic creations and not be afraid of telling a story from your unique perspective is what this movie should really be looked on about.

            "content": "For those who are looking for a 100% faithful adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, I think they will be disappointed. Lacking the dark edge of Dahl's book and of his writing in general, Fantastic Mr Fox is not so good as an adaptation, however on its own terms it is wonderful. It is an endearing and hugely enjoyable film.One thing that stood out was how the film looked. Instead of the CGI rendered effects, Wes Anderson opts for a more old-fashioned stop-motion effect. This decision worked, because the visual look is outstanding, not just in the beautifully detailed backgrounds and sets but in how the characters move as well and the small details such as the armchair in his writing hut.I like Alexandre Desplat's music quite a bit. His score for Fantastic Mr Fox is no exception, it is quirky yet still has the minimalist style that makes Desplat stand out. The story is sometimes slow in the pace but because of the humour and how it looked, I never found the film boring, besides the story itself is so good. The writing is great, the humour is more adult but a vast majority of it is very funny with the odd touching moment too.The characters add a lot. Mr Fox is one of my favourite titular characters in a book and the film did little to change that, and while some are slightly underused they serve their purpose well. The voice work is fantastic. I wasn't sure about George Clooney, but he does do a bravura job, and Meryl Streep is quite touching. Michael Gambon is sterling, as is Bill Murray as Badger.In conclusion, hugely enjoyable and one of my personal favourites of 2009. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "In recent years, Disney's Pixar division, with their monopoly over animation, has churned out some of the biggest, funniest, most emotional material to hit theaters in the last ten years. By this point, the public knows their aggressive marketing campaign and knows it well. Adult humor and themes geared not only toward the kids, but the parent's as well. The mass appeal? Mom and dad can now take their eight year old to the local multiplex and fork over the steep price of admission without wasting it on a two hour long power nap. Last quarter's CGI constructed Pixar extravaganza \"Up\" captured audiences' hearts, imaginations and pocket books, raking in a less than modest 292 mil at the box office, making it one of the highest grossing animated films of all time. Along comes \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\", helmed by auteur Wes Anderson, a crack team at Twentieth-Century Fox (Yes, I said Fox) and Indian Paintbrush, one of Wes' collaborators on his predecessor \"The Darjeeling Limited\". If there's one thing that's detrimental to the Trump-like successes of the Disney powerhouse, it's a new found competition\u0085let the games begin.\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is a pure delight. A feast for the eyes. From frame one, it takes no time at all to draw you into its beautiful visuals of vast countryside's, running streams and falling foliage, all in marvelous stop motion. That's right I said it, stop motion. From the course hair on Fox's face to the cotton ball chimney smoke of Boggis, Bunce and Beans warehouse smoke stacks, everything's been designed from scratch, much of which involves simple household items. After just a few minutes in Wes Andersons world inspired by written cues from the mind of the British children's author Roald Dahl (inspired by Dahl's own hometown) you're dragged out of the theater and immersed in a faraway land for the entirety of its modest and to the point one hour and twenty minute runtime. The real treat lies in the notion of how long it actually must have taken these top notch art designers to bring everything to life. There are forces at play here that give one a clear sense of the fact that stepping away from a computer screen and getting things done the hard way pays off when witnessing the final product. Production value is staggeringly noticeable and truly memorable. I for one am still transfixed by the universe of Mr. Fox.Among one of the droves of Wes Anderson fans, I had high expectations going into the film. Anderson is one of those rare writer/directors that manage to separate themselves from the societal norm, branch out and go their own way. With Fantastic Mr. Fox, he effortlessly supersedes his reputation as one of the most unique Directors of this century. You may be asking yourself how you direct a bunch of puppets, but Andersons 'puppets' are among some of the most realistic and complex that you're likely to meet. With human emotions, expressions and actions, it is clear that Mr. Anderson took great time and preparation during the film's production and pre-production to make sure everything came off as smoothly and impactful as possible. Look out for a particularly funny scene during one of the nightly stake outs portrayed wholly through images on security camera monitors. Very, very well thought out and clever. Fox, for being aimed at children, is probably one of the most adult animated films I've seen to date. Think Pixar Redux. There's smoking, 'cussing' and above all some extremely heavy handed adult humor and themes. In Wes Andersons sharp, funny, unbelievably witty script, he keeps all of that classic dry comedy that's become synonymous with his trademark, the only exception being that it's coming from the mouths of the animals he's intricately created. Parts had me gasping for air; others had me rolling in the aisles. It's clear to me that by now Wes has really honed in on his craft and gets marginally better with each new picture. Wes Anderson, with his creative brain that can only be compared to an Einstein of the medium, lays all his cards on the table and ups the ante for Pixar Studios. When asked if he wanted to continue to make animated films he commented by saying, \"I would certainly love to make other animated films in the future.\" Could this be his new calling? Truly focusing on the niche market of animated movies tipping the scale more in favor of adult audiences? One would love to think so (of course without turning into another Robert Zemeckis and taking a permanent vacation from live action). Fantastic Mr. Fox is something to be experienced. Children will love its adorable characters while adults will marvel in its ability to connect with them. After all, each of us was a kid at one time or another and because of that there has never been a better excuse to pretend again.",

            "content": "After reading the reviews on here I wasn't put off watching this film. As a huge fan of animation, as well as Wes Anderson films this film definitely did everything and more for me. There's so much going on in every scene, I found it even funnier than other Anderson films, and as usual I loved all the characters. Anderson manages to keep all the coin facial expressions/awkward silences between characters/quirky background stories that appear in all his films. It's a true work of brilliance! This film has a 'kids film' label on it, but it's not really for children in my opinion, I urge anyone who appreciates animation and is looking to watch something quirky and intelligent to go for this film. Don't be put off due to the hordes of children. Anderson films are best watched on the big screen, so go see it now before it finishes at our cinemas.The only criticism I will say about this is that I don't think Anderson should have kept the original title of Roald Dahl's story 'Fantastic Mr Fox'. Mainly because it has been adapted so much to Anderson's style (as well as being Americanised) that it isn't really in keeping with Dahl's story, and fans of the acclaimed writer who want to experience the film adaptation of his story will be disappointed I feel. I think he should have given it a different title, like 'Foxxed' or something (that's a rubbish suggestion, but you get what I mean), as I loved it, and wouldn't change anything else, but marketing it as an adaptation of Dahl's book is a little mis-leading (definitely for British people anyway).-As a side point I think that as much as Dahl supplies a brilliant story and tons of material to make a very good film, I think Dahl's stories are best kept where they belong, and that is on paper. It is his literacy genius where the magic of his stories lie, and reading them (rather than looking at them) gives me the most enjoyment than I could ever get from watching a film of one of his stories.I left the cinema with a huge grin on my face and felt like bouncing along the pavement as I made my way home. It definitely has been the highlight of my week, and will be without a doubt one of the best films I've seen this year.",

Even more impressive than the stop action process used here (it must have taken forever), is a delightful set of people/animals that charm us and make us care. As with all Roald Dahl children's books, we get to see the dark side of humanity, no punches pulled. The animals are a combination of their natural propensities and \"human\" qualities. The story involves an upwardly mobile fox, voiced by George Clooney, who wants the best for his family, but can't seem to avoid killing chickens or robbing the people who live on the edge of his domain. He is a \"wild animal\" and this makes it hard for him to restrain himself. He is also quite irresponsible but so charming that he can talk his way out of anything. Into the mix is his faithful wife (who really gets fed up with him) and a son who is small, aspires to be an athlete, and is in the throes of teenage low self-esteem. A whiz kid cousin come to visit and upsets the apple cart. Ultimately, the actions of Mr. Fox bring about a battle with the dangerous humans and the fun begins. This is a delight to look at. Even if you're not into \"children's\" animated films, I became totally absorbed.",

            "content": "I'll admit it: I love stop motion animation. From the crude Christmas classics that are always on TV this time of year to the elegant masterpieces of Tim Burton, I never miss the chance to see classic animation at work. Needless to say, when I heard about Fantastic Mr. Fox, I was excited. A wonderful Rhold Dahl book, beautifully crafted animation, and an illustrious cast all in one package \u2013 this was exciting. I'm happy to say that my excitement was justified as Fantastic Mr. Fox is perhaps one of the best new movies I have seen this year. The story of Fantastic Mr. Fox follows the lives of the Fox family \u2013 Mr (George Clooney), Mrs(Meryl Streep), and their son(Jason Schwartzman) \u2013 and their animal neighbors and friends. Mr. Fox, once a professional chicken stealer, decides to settle down with his wife after she becomes pregnant and instead take up a career in writing. After moving to a new home in the trunk of a tree, Mr. Fox takes notice in three massive fowl and fruit farms. Risking everything. Mr. Fox decides to embark on one last big job \u2013 stealing from all three farms. What happens after that can only be described as pure confusion and debauchery.As with most Rhold Dahl stories, the book Fantastic Mr. Fox works to both excite kids and humor adults. As a result, the original short story is considered a classic for many families. Though some adaptations of Rhold Dahl classics (see BOTH adaptations of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) have strayed from Dahl's dry, quirky humor, the film version of one of his best loved stories have honored this side of Dahl's story, projecting a humor perhaps more suited to adults than children, but creating an overall story that will appeal to all. This movie would likely have been impossible without the work of numerous wonderful voice actors. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Owen Wilson all provide voices in the movie, among other lesser known but still wonderfully talented actors. As a result, the voices blend beautifully into the animation. Instead of feeling like characters with a voice shoved in, the voices and the characters are one. The animation is perhaps the most appealing aspect of the movie. The script and humor works with the animation in ways traditional or digital animation could not. In many instances, the animation itself provides part of the story. By using a more traditional method, Fantastic Mr. Fox is also able to provide very specific quirks and personalities to each character, something often lost in newer animation. Adding to the animation is a muted, fall palette of colors, giving the entire film a homey, comforting feel. Animation has become so perverted in recent years. Throwing away emotional appeal for visual appeal, the plethora of slick, computer animated, shiny films are almost unnerving. In such an atmosphere, choosing to make a use traditional animation can often spell anathema for the film. As a result, Fantastic Mr. Fox shines, choosing to pick traditional animation techniques to allow the viewer to relate to and communicate with the film in a way few films are able to do anymore. Though perhaps not for everyone, I would recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox for anyone interested in quirky humor, stop-motion animation, or simply a beautifully crafted and well written story.",

Apparently, a lot of other reviewers here did, too. There is a lot to appreciate about this movie.\"Fox\" is written for other adults, let's be honest. This isn't a kids' movie because most of the dialog would go right over their heads. However, intelligent adults - people especially with a good vocabulary and a quirky sense of humor - should love \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\"The hero is even voiced by a real-life elitist, George Clooney. The smug-sounding Mr. Clooney does a super job in the lead voice role of \"Mr. Fox.\" The same goes for the villainous \"Mr. Bean,\" voiced by the nasty-sounding Michael Gambon.

Thus, this film offers great visuals along with the wonderful dialog.The story is typical; a father finds out his family is more important than anything else and his young son tries to win approval from dad - but how this is executed is really \"clever\" to both see and hear. Yes, it's a clich\u00e9 story but it's done so differently with such unique dialog and humor that it's fantastically entertaining.If you think animated films are strictly for the young; this movie will change your mind. Best of all, it's the type of movie you should be able to enjoy multiple times because there is so much to take in.",

However, while I really liked some aspects of the movie, it fell a bit short of being memorable.I will say that the graphics are an absolute treat throughout this film. The stop motion animation is amazing and the sepia tones really work for me. I find that the majority of 21st century animated films are visually overwhelming with far too much happening on the screen. I often feel that the producers are more concerned with showing what they are capable of doing rather than what they should be doing. Fantastic Mr Fox is one of the few exceptions. It is quaint and charming and matches the feel of the book very nicely.Unfortunately, I felt the telling of the story just got a bit messy. It was not close enough to the original and felt unnecessarily complex at times, especially given the target audience. My other big gripe was with the American accents. I understand the draw of big Hollywood stars, but this story really demands well-spoken English actors. Sir Ian McKellen as Mr Fox with Ricky Gervais as the Rat could have been epic! Having said that, George Clooney did a pretty good job and grew on me as the movie went on.Ultimately, I felt this was a beautiful production but one that lacked any real substance. I would still recommend it to anyone based on the remarkable animation but it's not something I'd rush to see again.",

I think having the unlimited creative license that animation provides really let him indulge his creativity, and a absolutely great movie was the result.Anderson and Noah Baumbach took the classic Roald Dahl story and greatly expanded the beginning and end, while giving it a unique look and tone that is quite different from other recent animation. It's still essentially about a fox who steals from three local farmers in order to provide from his family, and brings a lot of trouble on all the nearby animals as a result, but the story is now fleshed out beyond that. This is an Anderson movie through and through, with all the eccentric characters, wonderful music, complicated family dynamics, and understated, off-beat humor that the world has come to expect from his work.It's difficult to find any part of Fantastic Mr. Fox to raise a complaint about. The animation, character designs and sets are beautiful, the cast of actors and actresses brought in to do the voice acting were all excellent, and the movie as a whole was just charming. Along with Ponyo and Coraline, I'd say that this is among the best animated films I've seen in quite a while. Even better than Pixar's excellent recent work.

            "content": "What exactly is the Fantastic Mr. Fox? Since it's a feature cartoon based on a Roald Dahl story one might assume it would be a movie for kids, or a movie for kids of all ages, but it's not. The dysfunctional family and the arch dialog and the low-key performances all make it clear this is something for adults, something aiming to be a quirky way to deliver Anderson's typical fare. Or perhaps it actually does aim to be a kid's film and this was simply the closes Anderson could come.In either case, the movie doesn't totally work for me. Even though I never read the Roald Dahl story, I know his work well enough to know that this has little to do with it. Anderson and Dahl have very different sensibilities. But at the same time, they are both quirky. I think if Anderson wanted to take a kid's story and give it a modernist twist he would have been better off with something less quirky, a more traditional children's story like The Wizard of Oz. As it is, the two varieties of quirkiness work against each other. Anderson is small and thoughtful and acerbic, Dahl is over-the-top and ironic and somewhat savage. And while Anderson wins this debate, because he has the final word, the vestiges of Dahl make it all feel a bit off.This is not to say I didn't enjoy the movie. I generally did. It's mildly amusing and the animation is kind of interesting in places. I didn't particularly mind watching it. But I was never drawn into the world, I never felt connected with the characters or concerned about their plight. The movie, like all Wes Anderson films, keeps you at a distance from the characters, but unlike his best movies, it doesn't make up for that with enough eccentricity to keep one engaged.It doesn't surprise me that the critics loved this movie. Critics tend to get jaded and immediately latch onto anything different, and this movie is decidedly different. But Anderson would have been better off either making a cartoon aimed at kids or making a live action show aimed at adults. Instead, he just confuses the two.",

            "content": "The base for \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is the beloved children's book by British iconic author Roald Dahl. As in the original the film focuses on life ordeals of Mr. Fox and his family. The premise for the story is Mr. Fox's stealing spree of chickens, ducks, turkeys and cider, which make him top of the most wanted list of despicable farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Unlike in the original instead of a fox basically trying to cater and feed his family in this outing we have a typical dysfunctional Wes Anderson family, whose papa is addicted to stealing. Not to mention that his son is an irritating little bugger, whilst you also get a key new addition of kick-boxing super-athlete cousin Kristofferson . Oh! And did I mention that all the animals in the forest are Americans (which really makes the movie jar throughout, as the characters are cool hipster forest animals). Meanwhile the farmers remaining outstandingly British.I can and will forgive the scriptwriter (Wes Anderson) for basically taking a dump on the whole sense, premise and feeling of the story. I will in this case treat \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" as something totally unrelated to the book (which remains outside of Anderson's capabilities to ever achieve as long as he resolves to sticking to his gameplan).I will not however gloss over the fact, that the animation has neither the humour and wit of Nick Park, the intelligence and unforgettable charm of Hayao Miyazaki or the heart of Pixar. The only thing that Anderson has is... quirkiness. I have never seemed to be able to understand the almost unanimous critic appeal of Wes Anderson (albeit his cult adoration thankfully does not seem to extend too far outside American borders). I never found his movies profound, if anything to me they reeked of pretentious artsy drivel (including the underwhelming \"Rushmore\"). Additionally Wes Anderson seems to be incapable of directing movies with likable leads - even in \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\" the charmless title character played by George Clooney sounds like a George Clooney with a persistent headache on Valium impression. The only actor that manages to ring true is Meryl Streep as Ms. Fox, but her role is relatively insignificant and secondary. As usual I also found the lines nowhere as deep, meaningful and brilliant as Anderson believes them to be. Actually they mostly felt flat and written by an adolescent during Sunday school. Whats worse the add-on quirky jokes are tragically unfunny and I found myself battling to even produce a single smirk during this ordeal.The worst thing is however that I have no idea who the target audience is. The plot plods along at snails pace and the characters are whiny, cajoling, boring and unlikeable with a unrelenting need to spit out inappropriate inside jokes (not to mention they are constantly 'cussing' with standout lines like: \"\"This is going to be a total cluster-cuss for everyone\". What the cuss?). Additionally they are hard to understand due to seemingly inherent articulation flaws. Not to mention that some of the animation (one of the few brilliant things in the movie) is eerie, creepy and frightful in a very inappropriate manner. That basically means the whole base audience of kids is not suited for this visualisation of the children's book making it an obscure attempt at mainstream by Wes Anderson, which easily explains the poor sales of the movie.If we are to believe that this is an animation for adults, than well... I will never jump onto the Wes Anderson band waggon, even though I'm quite sure all the negative feedback I will get for my above review. I find Anderson's films unmemorable, unimaginative and tiresome dragging on like a snail with rheumatism. Basically a animation soap-opera.I would really love to catch the drift and hop on-board the Anderson love-boat, but with this dreadfully boring animation of a brilliant children's book this revelation will have to be put on hold. Until than count me out of this adoration.",

I was right.I'm a big fan of mainstream stop-frame animation - I have the complete Harryhausen (excluding Earth vs The Flying Saucers, but including all the Puppetoons etc.) On my DVD shelves, and I'm a big fan of Willis O'Brien, Jim Danforth, and Phil Tippett. I don't much care for the middle European stuff from the 50s and 60s though.And that's pretty similar to the style adopted here, and I have to say I don't care for it. There were times when I greatly admired the way some effects were achieved, but I really didn't like the way this film looked (from a character and set design point of view) or moved. In fact, populating an essentially rustic English setting with distinctly American animals didn't really work. There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea, it was simply that the execution meant that there was, to me, an irreconcilable disharmony between the two.The voice talent was, on the whole, very good, with Clooney, Streep, and Gambon not unexpectedly taking the honours.The script was, I thought, awful. Wes Anderson joins the Coen brothers and Darren Aronofsky in that select group of writer/directors who make films which display, with utter confidence, a belief in how clever they are, a belief which a) I don't necessarily share and b) irritates me intensely with its arrogant disregard of me as an audience member.Finally, this film has no idea - and doesn't care - who its audience is. In many ways it is clearly pitched at adults, but then it is tweaked downwards for tinies: the script contains a number of instances where the word \"cuss\" is substituted for the F-bomb, for instance.",

Gorgeously designed backgrounds and scenery full of simply incredible attention to detail, the film is full of such loving care and attention. Each character feels full of personality and it's refreshing to see something other than a glossy 3D rendered animation film for a change most certainly. It feels like a return to a day where a little imagination was expected in films, which is nice.Comparing Pixar releases and this film is besides the point. This film wasn't made to be compared or compete with others, it was made to tell a classic children's tale by one of the greatest authors at writing them. Dahl's wife Felicity herself has described her delight at how the film portrays the universe great author created and the modification of the story for film length is smoothly and smartly done. It is a beautifully told story, heart-warming and charming, witty and full of comedic moments.While Pixar films play like films made for children that can be enjoyed by adults. Wes Anderson's film feels like one made for adults, that can be enjoyed by children. Some parents may not feel too comfortable of the less than subtle replacement of curse words with \"cuss\" or \"cussing\" it has to be mentioned however.The voice acting is excellently done, Anderson took the cast outside, underground and indoors for the varying parts of the film to give it a real feel of authenticity which pays off. The soundtrack, as with all Wes Anderson films, is stunningly good and really elevates the film. After watching you may find yourself searching out the soundtrack as soon as you get home.The film's style and direction screams Wes Anderson at the top of its lungs and so, haters of his previous work may need to be careful, but I would certainly suggest to give the film a try and see if it can convert you, if not at least not make you feel like you've wasted your money.As a self confessed Wes Anderson fan I was doomed to love this film no matter what, but am genuinely delighted with the end product and believe that more than just the blind Wes Anderson lover will find this film a charming, witty ride of enjoyment.",

            "content": "What a conundrum. It's impossible for me to give this movie one star because in many ways, it's far from a bad movie. The merits which it does have, and there are some, definitely exclude it from that general category. It is, in all fairness, visually stunning, technically brilliant, flawlessly directed, and an all-around treat for the eyes. It's loaded with a great voice cast, wicked creativity, witty dialogue, and a lot of clever ideas. Yet nor can I give it ten stars either. Because in spite of all of this, its stunning visuals and innovative imagination does not mean that I enjoyed it. I didn't. One bit.For starters, hello? Helllooo, Road Dahl's story? Where are you? Look I understand that when you have a fairly short children's book you often need to pump it up with extra material in order to bring it up to the two-hour mark. No protests there. What I DO have protests about is when you not only add extra ideas but remove the old ones as well. Extra material can be forgiven as long as it's still entertaining and stays faithful to its inspiration. What isn't forgivable is when it's anything BUT faithful, to the point of betraying the book's spirit with its presence. Make no mistake, only a handful of references to the book manage to make it into this rendition - and even then, it almost feels like they're only there because the producers knew that they couldn't really get away with dropping ALL of the old stuff, so they added it as filler, as if to assert that they haven't forgotten what it is taht they're adapting. So woe big fans of the original story. Fantastic Mr. Fox was one of my favourite Road Dahl books when I was little but the manner in which they've twisted it here ensures that the joy which I remember is not captured. Spoilers FYI...One of the things that made the book so heartwarming was the fact that Mr. & Mrs. Fox had such a sweet and loving relationship. In the movie, perhaps in an attempt to modernise it (and God knows why, it's a kid's story people! Why the cynicism?), Mr. & Mrs. Fox have been altered into a squabbling married couple. The sweetness of the story is almost entirely absent here. It crosses over the line into being depressing. It comes complete with a fight scene in which she hits him, making him cry, and leaving a claw mark across his face which he has for the rest of the movie (domestic violence?). Cripes, there's even a scene where she says that she shouldn't have married him; a comment which she never takes back. And by God, there's another scene where he goes on a suicide mission, agreeing to turn himself in so that the other animals can be spared, and she makes no attempt to stop him. This isn't exactly what I would call uplifting. OK, so it has happy ending, but by that stage I was so disheartened by what had happened up to then that it was impossible to feel moved. This is because the falling-out scenes were painfully drawn-out, while the make-up scenes were merely glossed over. The result, I have to say, makes the ending highly unsatisfying.George Clooney has a sexy voice as always, and Meryl Streep is great for this kind of role because her voice is so maternal and softly-spoken that it creates the perfect Ying to George's Yang. As I mentioned earlier, the voice cast is great; Jason Schwartzman is brilliant as the son, as is Eric Anderson as the nephew, and everybody else fits their roles like a glove. But the charm of these characters has been so diluted that the actors behind them can't make up for the total lack of engagement, connection and poignancy. Even the jokes, which admittedly can be very sharp in a number of scenes, are not able to take your mind off just how uninvolving the story is. Basically, this is a movie in which they've tried to be edgy so as to appeal to older audiences. Which is fine because this CAN be done successfully; when done right you get a film which keeps adults and children ntertained in equal measure. When done wrong, you get the likes of this, which tries so hard to be watchable for adults that it ends up losing its heart.Elsewhere, certain scenes are taken in totally unnecessary directions before they have a chance to really get interesting in order to make way for the story's new trappings. The best character in the movie, by far, is Rat, who is superbly and flawlessly voiced by William Dafoe. But what's this, Rat is in it for all of two scenes, and is then killed off. Man. There was so much more room for him, and instead they got rid of him early so that they could go into the all-new (and completely pointless) suplot of Fox's nephew being kidnapped. That's the all-around approach with this movie - bumping off things which could have been entertaining in favour of focusing on things which aren't. There's a scene involving a wolf which I asbolutely failed to see the point of; conversations which don't go anywhere; scenes which ended after two minutes without serving any integral purpose to the plot; and who knows why Owen Wilson was given fifth billing, he's in it for ONE scene!So those who enjoyed the novel with have trouble with this. Its energy, slickness, animation and special effects are of such an astonishing standard that they're worth the five stars that I gave it alone. But due to the way in which they warped the story with only a pedestrian payoff at the end, that's all I'm giving it. Dahl virgins approach with open mind; Dahl fans beware.",

            "content": "First, the good news: there's some sweetly nuanced stuff here, well-crafted little details and homages, such as Mr Fox's study being a meticulous recreation in miniature of Mr Dahl's garden hut, and the urbane Mr Fox, like the director, being quite the snappy dresser. While Mrs Fox, voiced by Meryl Streep, is indeed most foxy. \"You're as fine looking as a cr\u00e8me brulee\" leers Farmer Bean's sole security detail, Rat (Willem Dafoe), a finger-popping, flickknife-wielding Dennis-Hopper-with-a-tail from some 1950s B-picture. \"Am I being flirted with by a psychotic rat?\" is the wry response.Suspiciously wry, some might say. If we reveal this film also features a Buddhist-chanting, yoga-practicing fox cub called Kristofferson, the least welcome new addition to a Roald Dahl story - or a canine family since Scrappy Doo; a soundtrack which includes the Beach Boys and the Ballad of Davy Crockett; assorted critters who talk like American co-ed hipsters; laconic musings on existentialism; and lines like \"You really are a kind of quote unquote fantastic fox\", then alarm bells might just start taking your eardrums apart, piece by jagged piece.Watching this, we're reminded of the game in which you pair entirely unsuitable directors with other people's films: think 'Eli Roth's The Full Monty', 'Sam Peckinpah's Bambi', or 'Neil LaBute's The Wicker Man.' (Can you imagine how embarrassing that might be for everyone if the latter were actually made? Ah.) This is a Wes Anderson joint first and foremost, with Dahl - and indeed Britain and Britishness - running an extremely poor second. Naturally, only those nasty old farmers have British voices, c/o Michael Gambon and Brian Cox, while even that most English of icons, Jarvis Cocker, contributes a forgettable bluegrass-style number. Turning AA Milne's creations into baffled little rednecks was bad enough. But dear old Foxy? In the big scheme of things, this shouldn't really matter - but somehow it does. It jars tremendously. The counter-argument runs that story always wins out; that story crosses genre and geographical boundaries. Which would be fine if Anderson had bothered to even slightly subjugate his singular style in its service. If Dahl is all about the story, Anderson's films are all about the attitude. Again, fine. But you'd hardly turn The Royal Tenenbaums, Rushmore or The Darjeeling Limited into bedtime stories for your children. Not unless you were feeling particularly sadistic.It's also a stretch to imagine today's kids responding positively to the deliberately retro stop-animation, an earthier European-style familiar to elder generations, but which might seem abrasive to those weaned on Dreamworks and Pixar. By tying thousands of helium balloons to it, the latter has also raised the bar for family films to vertiginous heights. It's hard to see how Anderson's film, with its bafflingly charmless leading fox, could garner as much goodwill as Up, except among those who still think it's incredibly big and clever to smugly subvert family fare with some tiresomely idiosyncratic shtick.The best children's stories find magic in the trash. They seek to elevate the everyday. In their droll, archly detached way, Anderson and his co-writer Noah Baumbach seek to reduce. When all's said and done, Mr Fox acknowledges that he's just a \"wild animal\". Felicity Fox says that, although she loves him, \"I shouldn't have married you\". Bean's cider-craving Rat may have ultimately redeemed himself, but in the end \"he's just another dead rat in a garbage pail behind a Chinese restaurant.\" Way to go, Wes and Noah. Hope that babysitting gig works out for you.Honestly, this really isn't some kind of Transatlantic stand-off on our part. But how much longer are we expected to stand impotently by while Hollywood arrogantly Americanises our every British children's icon, from Winnie the Pooh to Peter Pan? Who's next - Paddington Bear? (Yes, we know he's technically South American, but you get the drift). Clearly, it's time to fight back, starting with an all-new adaptation of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.

Also it is overly wordy \u2013 hardly a few seconds go by without someone saying something that is allegedly witty, amusing or humorous. The whole thing became rather drab with characters being constantly added to make up for the lack of a substantial story-line. It fact, overall, it lacked in emotion and was on the dry side.

But when he moves into a new house adjoining the bloated farms of messrs Boggis, Bunce and Bean, the temptation to help himself proves too great \u0085I think Wes Anderson is probably the wrong director to adapt Roald Dahl's classic children's book for the screen, but having said that this is a pretty good movie. Dahl's characters tend to be simple and strong - either very good or very bad - whereas Wes Anderson's are full of tics and neuroses. In the book, Mr Fox is simply a hero, whereas here he is part cuckold, part rebel narcissist, with a tendency to pontificate and an adolescent son with an inferiority complex. The problem throughout is that the movie is pitched too high - it should be designed for six-year-olds, but feels more like it's aimed at teenagers. The novel is too short to fill a movie, but the expansion into a three-act drama is quite successful, giving Mr and Mrs Fox a back-story and the three villainous farmers a dose of revenge as they flood the fox tunnels with Bean's cider and flush our heroes into the sewers. Where the movie really scores for me is in the quality of the animation, lensed by stop-motion expert Tristan Oliver. There are some amazing action scenes, great point-of-view tracks, daring close-ups of the animals' faces, and a beautiful sequence against the backdrop of a waterfall. Alexandre Desplat's rustic music is excellent, and there's a great song in the middle by Jarvis Cocker of Pulp fame. The voice cast are mostly good, with some flashy parts like Dafoe's scene-stealing turn as a beatnik jd-styled rat, but the casting is a bit odd; Wolodarsky is really a producer, Eric Anderson is the director's brother and Wes also voices a part, Hugo Guinness (Bunce) is a painter, director Garth Jennings has a part - what, weren't any real actors available ? The movie has some good scenes and enough laughs and I found myself warming to it towards the end, but it doesn't really capture the purity, wickedness and joie de vivre of Dahl's writing. For that, check out the two best film adaptations of his work - Nicolas Roeg's The Witches or Danny DeVito's Matilda.",

So, naturally, I assumed it must have been a heck of a good film--not a slightly better than average film with some slightly creepy characters. Yes, I say slightly creepy because the stop-motion characters look quite a bit like dead stuffed animals. Plus there simply have been so many animated films that looked more technically advanced. This one seemed more like a cast-off from the old days of stop-motion--which isn't all bad, as it IS interesting if old fashioned.The story is about a thrill-seeking fox who loves to take chances--though he seems to forget that he has a family back home. At the same time, there's an inspiring plot (or at least that's what the formula dictates) about the wimpy son of this fox needing to prove himself. Both these plot come together when three local entrepreneurs get sick of Mr. Fox stealing from them again and again. Much of the final half of the film involves the foxes and other animals all trying to avoid getting killed by these men--and the young fox (not unexpectedly) proving his worth.Really, there's nothing too extraordinary about this film--the animation or the story. The only outstanding things are the expensive actors that were employed to provide the voices. Otherwise, it's an enjoyable film for older kids and adults alike--though I do think it's a bit too dark for younger audiences.By the way, you might think I am crazy for making this comparison, but right after seeing the much-praised \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\", I watched a film with no real distribution at all (Disney basically killed the film and released it straight to video) that had no critical acclaim (1996's \"The Wind in the Willows\") and found I much preferred the lower budget latter film. It was simply more fun...something I felt was missing at times from \"Fox\".",

Though it's done in stop motion puppet animation, it will go over the heads of kids. The deadpan humor, particularly from Ash (voiced by Jason Schwartzman), Mr. Fox's son, was on point. Likewise, Badger (voiced by Bill Murray), Mr. Fox's attorney, chipped in with his own brand of comedy.

George Clooney voices the calculating vulpine who organizes the other wild animals after some farmers try to kill him. Also starring is Meryl Streep as his wife, and Anderson regulars Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe in other roles.The movie very much has the feel of a Wes Anderson movie, with the centered scenes and stark colors. There's a reason why I've liked every one of Anderson's movies.* I'll be eager to see his upcoming movie \"The French Dispatch\" (whose release the coronavirus has delayed).I should note that this flick isn't an exact adaptation of Dahl's book. There are some changes along the way (namely the ending; I guess that the movie's ending looks more conducive to the 21st century). Even so, it's a fine piece of work with all the humor that one would expect in a Wes Anderson movie.

For the math-challenged, that's almost half a century ago. You'd think that the state of the art in stop-motion animation would have shown some advances since then. And indeed it has, if you look at the never-ending feast of delights from Nick Park's Aardman Studios, home of Chicken Run and various Wallace & Gromit features. And of course there's Tim Burton's brilliant The Nightmare before Christmas, directed by Henry Selick, who went on to use the technique extensively in Coraline.Return with us, then, to those halcyon days of half a century ago, this time at feature length, for really crappy stop-motion animation in Fantastic Mr. Fox. The story was based on a book by the estimable and unpredictable Roald Dahl, so you'd think it would have potential, but the screenplay by Noah Baumbach and director/producer Wes Anderson is pretty uninspiring. Mr. Fox (roguishly voiced by the perfect choice, George Clooney) has agreed to give up raiding the henhouse to placate his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep). But, like Danny Ocean, he's gotta go back for 1 more job \u2014 well, maybe 2, make that 3 \u2014 in the company of his amiable but dull opossum buddy Kylie.These raids understandably tick off the farmers, Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, and they retaliate against not only the foxes but all the other burrowing creatures in the vicinity, attacking with steam shovels, explosives, and a deluge of apple cider (the specialty of Farmer Bunce), apparently more readily available than plain water. Running, scrambling, some shooting, and encounters with beagles and electric fences ensue, but nobody seems to get particularly worked up over anything. Evidently Anderson was going for suave, but he just ended up with dull.All the creatures stand upright and wear ill-fitting human clothes. They speak like adults, except for the cloying convention of substituting a standard kid-safe epithet where it's obvious what any normal English speaker would have said, as in \"This is going to be a total cluster-cuss for everyone.\". Ugh.Other cast members who probably pulled in substantial paychecks for their efforts include Jason Schwartzman (fox son Ash), Bill Murray (badger), and Willem Dafoe (rat). In return for the savings the producers could have realized by hiring regular voice actors instead of big- name stars, they could have afforded better special effects. But what the pic really needed was another couple of runs thru the typer.Too bad. This was an effort to try something outside the mainstream, and I normally root for those, but they've still gotta deliver. This one just wasn't anywhere near fantastic enuf.",

That's right, one short, one fat, one lean, or however it goes.I don't quite know where to start with my criticism.Well, I'm in my late teens and was never a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his material well enough, having read a few of his books as a child and seen Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory over and over again. This film, however, struggles for an audience. Is it aimed at children? Adults? I'm still unsure! Many of the 'jokes' would bore a child, especially as Mr. Fox visits a lawyer for example, or complains about being poor. Also, an audience of (I'm assuming) children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens. I'm all for the food chain, but you practically see Mr. Fox biting down on their necks! Surely that's a bit much? And also, the plot... well, it's kind of boring. I stayed only with the hope of it getting better, but instead I just got more and more annoyed at Mr Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions.The humour, meanwhile, falls flat. I laughed only once or twice, even though I specifically recognised attempts at jokes. I think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned. The voice actors have no sense of comic timing, instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums. George Clooney aims to portray Mr. Fox as charming and sleek, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep shows no emotion, I didn't even realise Bill Murray had a role until the end credits, and Ash, twelve-years old in fox-years, sounds like he's about 30.I love animation, particularly stop motion, but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit. Characters are tall, spindly and lacking any warmth of design. They move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange. There is also a distinctive 'mixed medium' feel, as 2D components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully. Characters look straight at the camera and talked; it was very awkward. There was one or two moments when Kylie looked straight at the camera, didn't move and had swirls on his eyeballs. It actually freaked me out.Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. Lots of people still seem to like it - look at the reviews. Maybe it just wasn't for me.",

Just about. Then Wes Anderson released the best filmed fairy tale since the invention of the zoetrope.It may be argued that Anderson is not the most consistent director working. That attribute is better attached to Bay, who consistently insults my intelligence. But consistency, while a virtue, is not the mark an artist ought to hit. Excellence is a better target. Michael Bay thinks that excellence is measured by ticket sales, that transcendence is related to expenditure, that success is found in delivering the lowest common denominator of good time to the broadest possible spectrum of children. Every shot in a Michael Bay movie feels test-marketed. Which is why his movies tend to last exactly as long as their initial release.So, yeah, I am a big Wes Anderson fan. I still don't like BOTTLE ROCKET all that much, but it is better than any movie I saw this year not directed by Wes Anderson. This guy is so defiantly not a populist that with every new release, I grow a little more afraid of his never getting funding again. His movies don't tend to make money. His audiences are necessarily educated, open-minded, analytical, patient, compassionate. Does this sound like your America? Anderson seems uninterested in selling a single ticket. He clearly has no desire to make a movie that will help him to make more movies. Any question remaining on this point after LIFE AQUATIC was answered by DARJEELING LIMITED. Here is a man who can only make art for himself. He will starve before he makes any other kind. So I worry, because he happens, tangentially, to be making it for me too.And hey - this is a kids' movie. Anyway, I'm sure Fox thought so when it signed up. I mean, it's animated, it's from a kids' book, it's got talking animals. But the kids in the theater with me did not experience my ecstasy. They will not clamor for Mr Fox dolls on Black Friday. Mr Fox is in fact a scary, villainous, superficially charming ne'er-do-well. He is boorish, a dangerous egotist. A bad father. A bad husband. His excuse (\"I'm a wild animal\") sounds like a wifebeater's apology. The movie does not celebrate his deeds or personality. At the end of the picture, he has reduced his community to living in a sewer, eating synthetic versions of the real food they used to enjoy, with none of their former freedoms, listening to his speeches about how THIS is the good life while the rest of the world tries to kill them. (What kind of metaphor for suburban values is this? Mr Fox as Mr Bush? Am I reaching? I am not.) So this isn't a movie for kids. It isn't a movie for imperialists. It isn't a movie for 20th Century Fox, who would surely have preferred another STAR WARS-type toy delivery system.It's a movie for me.There's my G.I. Joe from 1975, blowing up the Fox home. There's Roald Dahl's repeated line about \"little electric sparks\" dancing in the characters' eyes, finally brought to life. There's the opossum that keeps invading my mother's house. What? Yes. It's a movie so god damn personal that it achieves the universal through minutiae. In doing so it achieves my dream of a fairy tale so much like a pre-Disney Grimm version that 80% of the characters behave with total self-interest and abuse everyone else.It's a myth that performs the essential function of mythology: it reminds me of my responsibilities to my society, which are legion. I must be all I can be; I must not bring harm to my friends; I must not make bad art to buy another Lamborghini.It's a movie from Wes Anderson, for Wes Anderson and me and you.

Such a sickening amount of time is wasted as numerous failed attempts are made to be sharp, witty and funny.The results are very lifeless and cynical and share 9's problems with narrative and audience.Yet despite all this it is somewhat enjoyable, and one cannot hate it entirely.This is most likely owing to the honest, home-style animation, which is by no means perfect as the work characters' facial expressions are downright awful, but it is definitely the best thing on offer here.Or perhaps it is the novelty of having a voice cast of well-known and well-loved actors \u2013 George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon... \u2013 but sadly most of them are underused, miscast, or just simply don't deliver.Bottom line: avoid this at all costs.",

Granted, there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self-consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny. The worrying thing is that I think it was, and this is the best that Wes Anderson could come up with.The animation is good in the close-up shots of the animals, however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess. There wasn't really anything special about the acting either, with Wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better. I'm pretty sure George Clooney's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in South Park, one of them where he played a dog.The film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically, despite the film being set in England, all the good animals are typical Americans playing baseball, whilst the bad guys are stereotypical English with the most insulting English accents. I cannot stress how much of a waste of time this film is. I didn't laugh once.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson becomes an animation director while retaining his signature visual style. The stop-motion animation itself is intentionally crude and old fashioned, almost like an episode of Gumby, and it has a charm. One wonders whether the younger generation will accept it or not. Some kids in the theater behind me certainly didn't, and were fidgeting throughout the movie. That may not have just been due to the animation style, though, as it's not really aimed for kids so much as Wes Anderson fans. Based on the book by Roald Dahl but presumably barely resembling it, George Clooney voices Mr. Fox, a former bird thief forced to give it up by his wife (Meryl Streep) after they are nearly captured. Twelve years later and saddled by a son (Jason Schwartzman) and a new mortgage, Mr. Fox decides that he's had enough of the safe life and decides to pilfer from three nearby and very dangerous farmers. In retaliation, the farmers attack the entire animal community in the forest where Mr. Fox lives. I haven't read the Dahl book, but most of Fantastic Mr. Fox's best moments are definitely Wes Anderson moments, with perfectly chosen music and semi-awkward dialogue and petty character conflict. The plot of the film is really not Anderson's interest, which does lead to problems later in the film. As a children's story, Fantastic Mr. Fox at least in part relies on action, and Anderson is just not an action director. His set-ups are confusing and often make little sense. As the film goes through its climax, it gets considerably weaker than when the characters were just standing around conversing. All in all, it's far from a great movie, and perhaps in reality it isn't even that good of one. But there is a lot of beauty in it, and I love the handcrafted feel. I'd marginally recommend it, though I'd say you have to at least in part be a fan of Wes Anderson.",

            "content": "This film piqued my interest for two reasons -- the fact it was based on something by Roald Dahl (known for quirky stories) and the fact that Meryl Streep voiced one of the characters. I realize the second reason was a bit shallow, but the film turned out to be equally so. I had to work to find bits of joy. The first third or so of the film was very slow. I cannot think of when the last time was that I considered walking out of a film, but the beginning of this one had me contemplating a walk out. Finally, the actual Dahl story kicked in at about that point -- and got a little more interesting.Overall, the film lacked any real reason for me to care for any of the characters or what happened to them. Mr Fox (George Clooney's voice) was, from the start, self-centered and wanting to prove himself to the world, to be famous, as he admitted several times during the movie. But, he had no real, redeeming qualities. His son, Ash, was equally shallow. Kristofferson (nephew), was created as a too-good-to-be-real child. The evil rat (Willem Dafoe) was delightful, and the single-minded fury of Farmer Bean and his wife was somewhat engaging. However, Mrs Felicity Fox (Meryl Streep's voice) was only mildly intriguing, and while her husband was a less than admirable spouse, her blunt comment to him indicating her regret in marrying him to begin with did nothing to make her endearing.Finally, there was a poorly coordinated side story - that Mr Fox had a fear of wolves, and in the film's culmination, Mr Fox meets a wolf and they show each other a begrudging respect in an overly long segment. Unfortunately, since the fear of foxes had been largely glossed over during most of the film and truly underdeveloped, this scene falls flat and feels completely out of place.My favorite take away from the film - besides Bill Murray's voice as Badger (and, to a certain degree, Meryl's voice as an uninteresting Mrs Fox) - was the use of the word 'cuss' by any character wishing to swear. The first couple of times it was used, I pricked my ears in curiosity. But, then there was a whole scene filled with 'cuss' this and 'cuss' that. And, for some reason, I found it quite funny. Likely, the reason I was so easily amused was that I had been waiting, hoping, praying for something, anything, to be funny. So, when this came along, I grasped it with both hands and held on tight. I have no doubt the studio is well aware the film is teetering, dangerously close to being a royal flop. Which is why it comes as no surprise that they are waiting to open it back home in the States on Thanksgiving weekend -- with the hopes that millions of young children will drag their parents to the film before turkey day festivities or as a break amidst 'Black Friday' shopping sprees. They may be able to recoup some costs this way, and, if they are lucky, audiences will be too mellowed out by tryptophan-induced comas from turkey feasts to notice that this movie seriously underachieves its ability to truly be 'Fantastic.'",

Now married and with cub, he has to put his wild days behind him and do what fathers do best: be responsible. He is too rebellious, he is too wild and he is going to try \"just one more raid\" on the three nastiest, meanest and fox hating farmers that are Boggis (Brian Cox), Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and Bean (Michael Gambon). The direction here is suburb, extremely humorous characters and personalities that project a warm, charismatic, optimistic adventure for all ages. There are chuckle-out-loud as there are certainly laugh-out-loud moments here, the close-ups of Mr. Fox's \"grin\" and his tiny friends \"vacant staring eyes\" are worth their weight in gold. This too, is a visually interesting film that has been done with a Nikon D3 35mm digital single-lens reflex camera and stop-motion techniques that give a wonderful cinema experience. It is a far away cry from the classic and golden days of Charles -\u00c9mile Reynaud (1844 - 1918), the pioneer of animated film, and Ray Harryhausen (b. 1920) et al, and it works a treat.Okay, only Mr. Dahl's story, apparently, is used during what we can call the \"middle section\" of the film and with added new parts both front and rear, this may just explain why, with the final \"toast\" by Mr. Fox, there seems to be a serious note, or message, that concerns \"survival\". This may seem too pessimistic, too out of place for this narrative, this may be the director telling his audience the contemporary message, that it really is a dog-eat-dog world and that we have to do what needs to be done to \"survive\".Take away the gloss, and all Mr. Fox is, and lives by, are his basic instincts to kill and steal in order to survive. A cynical, and possibly, a pessimistic approach, but I do believe that this may be the narratives undercurrent message here. Also, there seems to be a very \"un-Englishness\" feel about this film, from the very start we are delving into a high-octane cast, and soundtrack, that is all too obvious in its origins, yes, the farmers are from the other side of the pond, but it is not they who are the selling point. On the positive, this alone cannot distract from the charming, rich and freshness feel of Fantastic Mr. Fox, it is a breath of fresh air, literally, and it is also one more credit to the writing of one Mr. Fantastic Roald Dahl.",

            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)I never would have seen this movie, I think, if it wasn't for \"Moonrise Kingdom\" which I totally adored. Directed by the same man, \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is a kind of animated or claymation production with famous actors doing the voices, like \"Where the Wild Things Are\" or the more animated Pixar and Disney movies.It's not really quite for children, however. Director Wes Anderson has shown in both movies a sensibility unique in movies. These aren't just a kids cartoon movies with adult overtones (undertones?). But they aren't the sardonic and ironic adult fare sometimes seen in animation, keeping all through a sense of playfulness and innocence. Both movies are consistent, incredibly well designed and filmed, and warm without being sickly sweet.But my own preference is for the more recent Moonrise Kingdom because that movie used real actors, and had a wilder sense of exploration of the scenery with the camera. There will be equal numbers who prefer \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" for exactly the opposite reasons--it's all invented and original, going not only across fun mid-America landscapes but going underground, too. It's endlessly fun. There are villains and heroes. There is a clear sense of right and wrong, of love and even of some kind of character development.There isn't, for my taste, enough of what you just call plot. Things happen, and it progresses, of course. But it's nothing much to chew on, just further and further escapades escaping the baddies. Fun, yes, but it actually gets tiring, too. When this happens you turn to the set design and the general style, which is worth watching for its own sake. But I still wish there was more. (An example further out-- the first \"Monsters Inc.\" is non-stop interesting and inventive. That's a high standard, but hey\u0085.)The voices here are big names (like George Clooney) but maybe they don't matter so much. It's not like their character, as a human actor, is embedded in the character, at least not much. (This is done more clearly in \"Polar Express\" where Tom Hanks is kind of evident all along.) Yeah, enjoy the heck out of this. And you really can let your kids watch it--they'll likely love it. And you might, too.",

I went in with Dahl's whimsical Mr Fox, adored by his family and beautifully and loquaciously winning over his friends and neighbours, making him truly 'Fantastic' Mr Fox. Very shortly into the film I wondered why Wes Anderson had bothered to 'adapt' Fantastic Mr Fox when every character was so far removed from Dahl's characters, with Mr Fox's pubescent son resembling Gwyneth Paltrow's Tenenbaum character. Clooney's Mr Fox is far from fantastic, Streep's Mrs Fox is nothing like Dahl's Mrs Fox. Hearing such typically UK English prose adapted to Anderson's American 'Hey, Man's is grating for those familiar with Dahl's book. Similarly, the plot and settings loosely resembled Dahl's, with over half of the plot being Anderson's creation, and the bits that come from Dahl's book being changed so greatly. In Anderson's favour, this film had his typical rhythm, style, pace, and his depressed, staccatoed, little-explained characters, but then why take a story with such a different pace, with a completely style and with such different characters? Admittedly, Quentin Blake's illustrations live vividly in the mind of many Dahl readers and seem to so perfectly illustrate Dahl's dark, twisted and curious characters. However, it is not the animation that leaves alienates me from this film. The animation is generally well done, although, again, Anderson's overtones bear strongly on the animation, with each character bearing an Anderson 'twitch'.I did my best to try to understand this as an 'Anderson' film and rate it based on that, but the incongruity of this film to the story it's based on gave me little enjoyment.",

            "content": "There really is something a bit fantastic about Wes Anderson's stop-motion animation debut \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" The quirky spirit of the Roald Dahl book could only be captured by a filmmaker with a deep and unforgiving wit. Anderson's dry and subtle sense of humor might not translate into big dollars (at least by comparison to giants such as DreamWorks and Pixar), but his affinity for diverse and amusing characters fits the world of animation better than anyone might expect.Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a cocky yet certainly charming woodland creature who relocates his family to an area where three nasty and powerful farmers named Boggis, Bunce and Bean live nearby. A former chicken thief, Mr. Fox sees a chance to recapture some of his former glory, even if it means going behind the back of his loyal wife (Meryl Streep). When the farmers catch onto him, they go after his home and family.Snagging your attention from the get-go is the unique quality of the stop-motion figures. Anderson explores the medium's full potential, blending elements of the modern day detail- oriented school of thought with cartoon elements and also playing with the 2-D diorama aspect which is unlike anything done before. Stop-motion masters such as Nick Park are all focuses on making the world seem as real as possible whereas Anderson isn't afraid to make his characters look and feel like moving figurines. He embraces that quality in a way most filmmakers would likely be afraid to do.The details on the close-ups of Mr. Fox and friends are stunning. I can't recall any stop- motion characters that looked so good inches away from the camera. The fur and the way the eyes roll around in the sockets are two unparalleled qualities.Anderson's dry humor lends itself excellently to the family film, which fans of his work probably did not expect, but probably should have. His films have always been focused on family. Tone down the family members to PG levels and the extent to which they are dysfunction and you have an excellent director for such a film. \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" would not top any kid's list of family/kid movies, but there's no issues of child-appropriateness. Some physical humor accompanied with the dead-pan wit of of Anderson and his usual suspects (Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, etc) achieve the child vs. parent-geared balance most animated films strive for.Then again, adults will appreciate \"Mr. Fox\" a whole lot more. Animation has proved itself a viable means of adult entertainment in 2009 with \"Mr. Fox\" capping it all off. The film will make you laugh in ways you never thought an animated film with talking animals ever could because of how ingeniously understated all the gags are.But \"Mr. Fox\" is equal parts art, taking stop-motion to new places. The opening sequences of Mr. and Mrs. running through a farm and stealing chickens serves as an ideal taste of what's to come. The camera pulls back and you see the set as if you were one of the filmmakers looking at these miniature models and the two are running around and jumping to some classic-as-always soundtrack choices from Anderson. It is a unique and spirited adventure that despite a somewhat disinteresting plot breaks ground in enough special ways to warrant some serious acclaim.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",

It is a crackerjack of a film that has all the components of a hit for families. It has plenty of adult humor that is sure to go over kids' heads; it has some fairly adult themes about dealing with a midlife crisis. Above all the film has a great, great sense of moment, space and visual scope. The animation is wonderful. And it is just so Anderson.Fans of the Dahl book might be annoyed. The adaptation is fairly loose. The film expands both the beginning and the end of the tale. Further, the tone of the story doesn't quite have the subversive edge that Dahl's work does. I read the book as a kid and this isn't quite what I thought the film would be. Anderson's personality comes through more than Dahl's.Clooney is really engaging as Mr. Fox.

A fox or a \"human\" looking like a fox? He was dressed like a fox, liked to steal chickens, but settled down as a newspaper columnist. Where was the society that supported and craved daily news on the printed page? Actually, that part was put forth halfheartedly.I mean was there an animal society with culture and stuff or not? Even if there was Mr Fox didn't really suit that life. If the narrator in \"Marley and Me\" was a columnist, or the narrator in \"The Soloist,\" then this guy was a sham, a farce. He had no interest in his trade . . . none. Yet his family duties demanded that he stay legit and not \"break the law.\" He dare not get sent to prison or be killed. The roles confused me here. (Maybe reading the book would clear it up.) Is he right to take up stealing again or wrong? Stealing is in his blood, you can tell that but the tightrope between getting the adrenaline rush and risking the safety of his family and neighbors is confusing. He and the story keep demonstrating inconsistencies.What I'm saying is that it was hard for me to know who to root for. He kept succeeding until his overconfidence got him busted. His relationship with his son was dysfunctional. It was almost painful to hear the lines from his son. They were quite realistically written complete with veiled hostility, appeals for encouragement and flat out statements of inadequacy. Was that supposed to be funny?Finally, the whole issue of stealing was schizophrenic. Foxes don't steal in the human sense. They hunt for available food. Their aim is to get food but not die trying. Many a fox has made the fatal mistake of hunting Man's flocks because of diminishing natural habitat or the laziness of old age. Here the issue is more like a cartoon scenario like Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. But wouldn't the Bugs Bunny saga be more of a downer if we witnessed Fudd wipe out Bug's entire home environment and endanger his kids and cause Bugs to feel guilty for what used to be fun? And feel guilty because Fudd was coming close to ending the entire cartoon? You'd have worry creep in where there used to be only humor. Your laughter would change from a series of guffaws to intermittent giggles. For me, some of those giggles were from embarrassment . . . like when someone's bombing on stage.I think the film suffered from the writers not knowing what kind of film they were going for--they seemed to opt for what cracked them up that moment as they sat around the writing table.",

The bright colours were good, but I was suffering the ill effects of alcohol at the time of viewing.Geaorge Clooney and Meryl Streep lead this ridiculous affair as Mr. and Mrs. Fox, and it appears that every effort has been made to create evil British villains who want to kill the good old American Mr/ Fox who only wishes to feed his family and live happily. By thieving.Of course there is more of a plot to this version of the Roald Dahl tale - where Mrs. Fox gets pregnant, so Mr. Fox has to promise to get a real job, turning him into a normal white collar American (in what appears to be the British countryside).Naturally it is required for a lengthy version of the story to have more of a plot, but I found this new plot a little tiresomely American, which should have been expected considering the total Americanisation of the animal characters.Whilst I am sure this will be very popular with younger generations who are not versed in the ways of Roald Dahl and enjoy Americans work at ruining everything we British have ever created, I find it will not become one of those unforgettable children's classics that time will never forget.Do your children a favour, and read them the book.

            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Delightful animation movie features stop motion, which has sadly been pretty much forgotten over the years, although a few examples show up every once in a while. The story here concerns a fox (George Clooney) who gets his wife (Meryl Streep), kids and the other animals kicked out of their homes after stealing chickens from a trio of farmers who then decide to take revenge on the animals. After letting everyone down the fox must try and come up with a way to strike back at the farmer and reclaim their land. FANTASTIC MR. FOX is rather refreshing because it's an original film that doesn't try to cater to any certain type of viewer and instead just comes off as a fresh work that can go into any direction it wants without having to play by any sort of rules. Based on a book by Roald Dahl, there's no question that this film isn't going to be for everybody but the story is so good, the visuals terrific and the voice work is downright wonderful and in the end if you're able to accept this type of film then you're going to love it. The visual look of the film is so beautiful that you really just want to pause scenes and gaze at the beauty in them. There are so many terrific looking scenes but one of my favorites is a POV shot of a rabid dog chasing the fox. Another terrific sequence comes when the fox has let everyone down and he stands out in the rain while his wife comes to talk with him. The look of the rain is unlike any visual I've seen in any movie before and it's certainly one I won't forget. The story itself allows for many kid-like qualities but the screenplay makes sure that adults will get the many jokes thrown their way. I really loved how the bad words were covered up by the creatures simply saying cuss and it's easy for the adults to fill in what word was suppose to be there. Clooney has one of the greatest voices out there when it comes to giving off any sort of emotion and I thought he was terrific here. He can do sly and be a smart aleck while at the same time being charming and he brings that to the fox character and makes him quite memorable. The supporting voices include Streep, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe among others. I'm really not sure how many kids will enjoy this thing but those familiar with different types of animation will probably find this to be quite refreshing. Its sense of humor and messages are all very well handled and when you consider the talent and look this is certainly a must-see.",

Some scenes aside, this is a very dry story, not terribly colourful in performance, and lacking in old fashioned humour. I'm interested to see what kinds of films Wes Andersson grew up on that could inspire such oddities like Fanastic Mr. FoxI don't even wanna begin to describe the story. Now the last time I read Fantastic Mr. Fox was when I was Ten years ago, but I do remember it being fairly coherent, much less convoluted than this story. Well convoluted isn't the word, lets just say, The rhythm is unusual as is the dialogue for that matter. Further more, there seems to be quite a lack of it, These critters don't really have a whole lot of productive things to say to each other, sometimes it feels like dialogue for the sake of dialogue.The Music ques are kind of catchy, that's what I remember best about Fantastic Mr. Fox. The banjo in particular is not a commonly used instrument, but it's the star of the orchestra in this movie Fantastic Mr. Fox has it's ups and downs, I wouldn't recommend it as a family feature, but movie goers may get a kick out of its eccentric charm.",

            "content": "I wanted to like this film. I love animation, whether its the flashiest CGI or the simplest stop-motion, and I love Roald Dahl. I like witty, quirky unexpected humour and I don't get into a spin when a book adaptation does just that - adapts a story for the screen. The cast list looked terrific. What could I lose?First I lost hope; then I lost interest. The trouble with this film was that it was trying to be a witty and stylish adult heist-film within a child's storybook - but there was never enough sense of threat to make that work. But they didn't stop there: a touch of spagetti-western with the showdown with a texan rat actually got me interested for the whole 3 minutes before they dropped back to the boring main threads. They squidged in a disaffected teen buddy story, with the jealous, overlooked son and his perfect cousin - unconvincing, tiresome, solved by the son suddenly becoming athletic and brilliant under fire for no reason. They made a stab at a dash or romance Mrs Fox the fiesty wife who lets him away with it anyway. Couldn't find enough clich\u00e9s?The Americanisation of the story wouldn't bother me at all if it was complete and wholehearted instead of half-baked. Why were the villains, in this rural American landscape, English? Why did Jarvis Cocker turn up singing bluegrass? Why did the helicopter spotter Australian? These things are so absurd they almost sound funny, but in the event they just seemed stupid and unconvincing.The adult humour came over as smug and self-indulgent - very different from Dahl's odd, daring and absurd charm. \"Based on\" is overstating it - they kept the 3 villains, a rat and Mr/Mrs Fox: most other things were changed. The one element from Dahl's story, which was published 1970, that they did not change was the gender balance. Hard to imagine a wildlife community with a male/female ratio of 9:1 lasting. Oh, and the females were 1. the wife/mother and 2. the possible love interest for the cousin (so the son could be jealous). No, no hold on... a villain's wife appeared briefly twice...I did like the animation - the strange layers, the funny digging scenes, the narrow and tall thing. But it didn't make up for a muddled plot, no likeable characters, a tiresomely smug script. No joy and no surprises.This film was selected by my youngest kid but the kids watched it pretty well in silence and said it was... \"Mmm. Okay\" That says it all really. Disappointing.",

Wes Anderson, director of such modern classics as Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, takes a Roald Dahl novel, and makes a superb movie out of it. Funny, witty, perfectly-paced, the plot and direction are spot-on. The animation is great and the choice of actors for the voices was inspired. George Clooney as Mr Fox is suave and sophisticated yet impishly naughty. Meryl Streep adds gravitas and motherly concern as Mrs Fox. Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, ever-present in Wes Anderson movies, are perfect for their roles as the kid fox and the wise-cracking badger- lawyer, respectively. Even the minor parts have major names: Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe and Michael Gambon plus Jarvis Cocker (lead-singer of Pulp, in case you didn't know) as the folk-singing sidekick of one of the villains!All this, and then Wes Anderson's customary perfectly-chosen rocking soundtrack.It may be animated, but this isn't just for kids - it has something for everyone.

I won't compare it with the Roald Dahl book which I never read, but it doesn't make a difference, The movie was charmless and so bland and boring I bailed after twenty minutes. I doubt even little kids would enjoy this.So what happens? Mr. and Mrs. Fox are at a farm, first conversing, then stealing a squab from it. Then Mr. Fox sees a trap and gets curious and ends up trapping himself and his wife in it. Then all of a sudden, two years pass (no explanation of how they got out of the trap) and they have an adolescent son, then they have a young cousin visit when his father is ill. In the meantime, Mr. Fox got a job in the newspapers and they move from their old hole into a tree home, even though they are located near disreputable farmers.My description makes the movie sound more interesting than it actually was. Where there should have been laughs and/or excitement, there are none. Everything is done in such a bland and blah way, even the puppets seemed like they were bored and wished they were somewhere else.

            "content": "Yes, Americanising. With emo kids, animals who work in companies, a failing marriage, all the drama.... just please stop. Roald Dahl is my favourite writer. It was thanks to his books that I became an avid reader as a child, and Fantastic Mr. Fox was his first book I read that lead me to discover the joys of reading. It had witty humor and the reader would savor the idea of eating plump chickens, juicy geese and syrupy cider. The point was that simple animals could outwit man and his machines - it was about survival from a wild creature's point of view, of course with all the humour thrown in.The movie completely tramples on this point and instead portrays the animal world much like our human world, with lawyers, loans and mortgages. What is going on here? What made it worse is that the movie dumbed everything down into an American soap opera - Mr. Fox has a worn out marriage with his purple-eyed wife (?) and they have only one child, who is a rebellious teenager. The weird cousin comes over, and I seriously don't comprehend what he contributes to the plot - he just stands there awkwardly and behaves like victim of abuse with all his frightened stares.The story barely focuses on the delicious food but instead on the drama and making it look like the overused Ocean's Eleven shtick. Instead of rooting for the characters like in the book, in the movie I didn't bond with them and I didn't care about their fates. I give this a 2 out of 10 because it takes a lot of effort to create a decent stop animated movie, but plot-wise it was a complete disregard for Dahl's work and wit. Let your child or younger sibling read the book, it is a very entertaining read, while the movie is very forgettable.",

            "content": "From the very moment it begins, you immediately know it's a Wes Anderson movie: his fingerprints are all over it. Indeed, before it is even an adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic it's a Wes Anderson movie - and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, what would be the point in making the film be exactly the same in style and tone as the book? The book is already marvellous in its own right, and it already exists so you could just go and read it. Both the book and the film deserve to be experienced (because the film is an adaptation, not a copy.)The movie is a stop-motion animation following the exploits of Mr. Fox, a retired chicken thief who now writes for a local newspaper after having a child. However, when he moves into a tree that just so happens to be across from three mean farmers, Mr. Fox can't help but get back into the game. The story mostly sticks to the plot of the book, but it does deviate slightly by adding in a few scenes before his retirement and by altering the ending. It also replaces his three children with Ash (Mr. Fox's son) and Kristoferson (Mr. Fox's Nephew) and places more emphasis on his relationship with his wife, Mrs. Fox. I don't mind the changes, however, as I feel that they do make for a more entertaining and fleshed out movie.The cast is comprised of a few acting heavyweights; most notably George Clooney as Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox, Michael Gambon as Bean and Bill Murray as Badger. Also joining the cast in much smaller roles (for only one or two scenes) are Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe and Adrien Brody. The cast help bring realism to the characters, and it's amusing to see animals hold human conversations. I have no complaints with any of the casting choices, as they all match their characters perfectly.'Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)'is filled with tiny little details that are barely noticeable but make the film unique and really show how hard the animators worked to bring this world to life. The stop motion looks choppy, but that is intentional as the film was shot in 12 frames per second instead of the standard 24. It's great stuff with plenty of stylistic flair. I especially liked the running gag where every expletive was replaced with the word 'cuss', so phrases like \"you scared the cuss out of us!\" were both common and amusing.Overall, the movie was an enjoyable animation with a good plot, quirky humour and excellent casting. It's certainly a Wes Anderson movie, despite its animated nature. 7/10.",

            "review_title": "Wonderful work by the team coordinated by Anderson, but Anderson is best with live action",
            "content": "Anybody can tell you that an animated film written by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach and directed by Mr. Anderson will be more about family rivalries and quirky characters than about cute animals, despite Fantastic Mr. Fox's basis in a famous Roald Dahl children's tale that's been called \"great for reading aloud to three- to seven-year-olds.\" Dahl was a Brit, and much of this production is English. But it's a hybrid of Yank and UK elements, with the animals, headed by George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as his wife, with Anderson regulars like Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Angelika Huston, and Adrien Brody, are a star-studded and somewhat cultish American voice crew. The animals outwit three despicable farmers and steal their livestock for food. These agricultural baddies, described by Dahl as \"Boggis and Bunce and Bean/One fat, one short, one lean./These horrible crooks/So different in looks/Were nonetheless equally mean,\" are not only humans, but in the film contrast in all being played by Brits. Mr. Fox premiered as the gala opening night film at the London Film Festival, with Mr. Clooney on hand to add glamor. Media reaction was positive, though privately some English viewers were less pleased with the \"Americaniation\" of the material.The stop-motion animation using stuffed dolls -- especially with Anderson's reliance on extreme closeups -- may result in the foxes and other critters appearing seedy at times, but the process is executed so slickly and photographed so brightly (with heavy emphasis on orangey earth colors) that the contrast with more hi tech pixilations and computerizations may not be so great to the untutored eye as some think. More serous for the kid audience is, well, how serious the material is, as well as more complicated, in this enlarged version of the Roald Dahl story. Take the quote offered by IMDb:Mr. Fox: (sighs) Who am I, Kylie? Kylie: Who how? What now? Mr. Fox: Why a fox? Why not a horse, or a beetle, or a bald eagle? I'm saying this more as, like, existentialism, you know? Who am I? And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth? Kylie: I don't know what you're talking about, but it sounds illegal.Not very funny, and right over the heads of the seven-year-olds; but still, pretty cool stuff for an animated children's tale. Fox (one wants to say Clooney, so ably does he insinuate himself into the role) is often referring to the fact that they are finally just \"wild animals.\" And the film is most captivating when the various creatures eat -- explosively devouring a pile of food and leaving crushed fragments -- or burrow into the ground -- again with explosive, instinctive animality. One wishes these hints of the savage creature inside the talking animated model came more often, and more surprisingly. These are places where 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' feels truly original.It might have been nice if the film hadn't gotten so elaborately caught up in the grand war campaign between Fox and his friends (no, there's no Fassbinder in here) and the three agri-business meanies (that's what they almost become in the film) played by Robin Hurlstone (Boggis), Hugo Guinness (Bunce) and Michael Gambon (Beane). Though some British viewers have chafed at this, the intimate dysfunctionality (so typical of the maker of 'The Royal Tennenbaums,' 'The Life Aquatic' and 'The Darjeeling Limited') provides the best stuff, the moments when the dialog sparkles and charms and makes you think. The script is so subtle, even with stuffed animals, at nuancing the conflicts between Fox and his wife; at conveying their son Ash's (Schwartzman's) insecurities and his rivalries with the too-talented visiting cousin, Kristofersson (Eric Chase Anderson), that you may wish the film focused more on the intimate stuff. As with Anderson's other movies, it's character, not action, that matters. So you kind of wonder why there is so much action. Nonetheless there are action sequences that work very well, which is perhaps where the animators come in, the vast Visual Effects crew, and cinematographer Tristan Oliver -- who seem to have had a life of their own and partly had to fend for themselves in London, with Anderson directing things from a distance, via e-mail, from his Paris apartment. But if the direction was phoned-in, it seems to have worked pretty cussing well (an oddity of the script is its substituting the word \"cus\" where a stronger swear word, including the F-one, is meant). 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is an animated feature that's both sophisticated and winning. Those (including a couple of name New York reviewers) who say this is Anderson's best movie yet, however, may just not like his other movies that much. Wes does wonderful work here with the voices of Clooney, Streep, Schwartzman, Wilson, and the rest, and he's shown he can coordinate a great animation team. But he does even better work as an auteur when he gets to put human bodies as well as voices on the screen. Still, this is the year's smartest and most winning animated feature.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's films are about mid life crises, castration anxieties, emasculated man-children, self doubting child-men and tweed wearing posh people who fantasise about being macho enough to wrestle big fish. Anderson's \"Fantastic Mr Fox\", based on a story by Roald Dahl, is no different, despite starring a stop-motion fox.The film stars actor George Clooney \u2013 cast due to countless past roles as a thief - as Mr Fox, an ex robber who now lives a responsible life with his wife and son. They're all relatively happy, normal and peaceful, until a midlife crisis hits Fox like a ton of bricks. \"I don't want to live in a hole any more!\" he yells, desperate to cast aside his suburban life and sink his jaws into some larger achievement. After all, doesn't he deserve more out of life?Fox's answer, like Edward Norton's in \"Fight Club\", is to embrace the feral beast within. Roping his friends into his midlife crisis he embarks on a string of dangerous heists, breaking into the factories of 3 villainous farmers and stealing their delicious loot. As Fox becomes more successful, Anderson's camera begins to focus more on his emancipated animal tail and less on the constrictions of his human neck tie. One phallic symbol \u2013 one of freedom the other of servitude - has essentially replaced the other, and when the evil farmers shoot off Fox's tail and keep it as a trophy, all sorts of interesting thematic avenues are opened up. Yes, this is literally a stop-motion kid's film about the conflict between wild, natural masculinity and the neutered alienation of the postindustrial workplace.Like \"Fight Club\", Fox also sets up an underground union of sorts. In an attempt to release his friends from bondage, Fox urges all the animals in the land to revert to their scientific, Latin names, and suggests to them that they each have natural, in born talents which it is in their benefit to set free. The animals agree, and together they start a little war against the farmers, using a series of subterranean tunnel networks to undermine their human overlords. From this point onwards Fox becomes a Robin Hood figure, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor.These kinds of meretricious tales were common in the works of Roald Dahl. Dahl loved tales in which the poor and dispossessed outwit the powerful and cruel and often told stories in which those who own the means of production dominate others, both physically and psychologically. What Anderson does is take things a little further. Fox may be a rebel, but it is suggested that he has the capacity to be just as evil and egotistical as those he fights. \"I think I have this thing where I want everyone to think I'm the greatest,\" Fox says, though he does eventually learn to direct his ego toward the benefit of the animal community as a whole. The film differs from the book in other ways. Anderson introduces Fox's son, who is your classic Wes Andersonian messed up kid. At once hating and admiring the masculinity of his constrictive father, the son is going through a psycho-sexual dilemma akin to his dad's, torn between a life of domestication and that of a wild, free animal. In other words, the head of the son's little Oedipal complex is the father, whilst the head of the father's complex are the farmers, both daddy and son itching to break free of those whom they believe to be holding them in bondage. The film simplifies very complex issues, and is wrong to localise its cast's anxieties around a series of daddy figures, but the notion that one (the father) must relinquish the ego and set free the son before first seeking freedom from The Big Other is something Anderson's other films often tangentially deal with, the artist possibly responding to the fact that the ego has been in decline now for generations. Unable to libidinize objects itself, today the libidinization of objects is accomplished for the ego by the superego in the form of mass culture, the educational system, media, technology and advertising. The ego itself is now libidinized externally, for example in the form of virtual \"Yous\" (the You of YouTube) and \"faces\" (\"Face\" book). Unable to unite itself with the objects libidinized from without, the ego then suffers through greed, dissatisfaction and despair, afflictions which tend to plague Anderson's heroes. The film ends with a rather bleak ending. The farmers don't catch Fox, but he is forced to live underground, always in hiding and always in fear, allowed only to come up to the surface to take food from a huge supermarket. Fox now has the illusion of freedom, of unfettered access to product, his bourgeois aspirations met, but in reality he still has a foot over his head and is unable to actually regrow his tail. In this way, Fox's masculine impulses have condemned both his friends and family, a collective defeat which the animals assuage with acts of light rebellion- they occasionally steal the very produce the farmers sell. Throw in the fact that Fox's wife swiftly becomes pregnant (further domesticating Fox) and that Fox suddenly learns he is unable to \"talk\" with wild animals, and the film's ending is revealed to be something pessimistic masquerading as victory.What makes this ending doubly bleak is the fact that Anderson genuinely doesn't understand how regressive and dark it all is (like Dahl, Anderson is firmly wedded to the ideals of the American Dream); he seems to think his heroes have won and have earned the right to party. 8.5/10 \u2013 At its best, this flick examines the risks and consequences behind Hollywood's typical \"be true to yourself\" message. Stylistically, like Anderson's other features, its a postmodern collage of 1960s vogue, self-conscious whimsy, much quirkiness, Euro-camp and layers of schmaltzy psychodrama. Actress Meryl Streep stands out as a stop motion fox.",

There's not a lot of good humor going around - the conversations are not at a children's level and well, the story just isn't very adventurous or appealing. For adults however, there's also nothing to be found - the humor isn't good enough to keep you entertained and the story and animation itself are ... bad.

In this movie, animals' personalities are defined by their archetypes but Anderson, faithful to Dahl's spirit, always find a little twist, a way to play with it rather than being chained to it. And the whole tonality of the film indicates that this is a rather adult-oriented movie. Indeed Mrs. Fox comes from the doctor, a few minutes later, during a fox-trap situation; she'll reveal what we didn't dare to suspect. It seems like Fox is caught in a worse trap with no getaway except the promise to go straight.Meryl Streep has always possessed that homely, motherly authority and creates the perfect contrast with Clooney. Together, they form a more believable couple than any live-action movie. As a matter of fact, it's a miracle how Anderson finds the perfect tone between a ludicrous premise (style-wise) and the authenticity of his characters. His movie is set in a world where humans and animals coexist and seem to live within the same standards, except for one thing: humans have all the rights, they can raise, domesticate, kill and eat animals, this is the only Disney territory where Anderson ventures. But the paradox of anthropomorphic animals confronted to normal humans is one of the film's most creative bits. It's interesting though that the two worlds rarely share the screen.The film is based on the childhood rhyme about three mean men, Boggus, Bunce and Bean, one fat, one short and one lean, they're three farmers who mind their own business (poultry, duck raising and cider) before they're victim of Fox' robberies. With the help of their new house's attendant Kylie Oppossum (Wallace Wollodarsky), Fox steals from the three farmers and make mortal enemies out of them. The three men will know no rest until they get Fox, digging him out to the point that all the furry animals are forced to live underground and risk starvation. But foxes have more than one trick under their sleeves and thankfully, the plot doesn't just rely on a simple humans vs. animals antagonisms, there are a few demons to overcome within the animalistic characters and Anderson treat them sometimes with the same three-dimensionality than the people from his live-action movies.In fact, anyone familiar with Anderson's style shouldn't be surprised by the kinship with his films.Anderson is a director who cherishes static shots and linear movements, in perhaps the style that is the closest to comic-books than any other directors or maybe animation \u00e0 la Hanna-Barbera. In the film, characters run like in the old Atari video games, and the digging looks exactly the same except in the vertical sense. We suspect that the 'artistic license' was also forced by a few budget restrictions and the fact that Anderson isn't an animator from the start, but he finds a way to transcend possible flaws and turn them into old-fashioned visual delights, as the lack of green and blue provided a nice autumnal sepia texture. The eloquence of the scripts makes up for the static moments, many times people talk without necessary looking at each other, which also simplifies the use of stop motions.Overall, the stop-motion gives a real edge to the film and is perfect for a movie centering on furry and funny characters, each fox has a unique design and fur complexion accentuating the realism (while the human characters are more ordinary looking with the help of CGI). The real thrill of the film comes from the various personalities, and they're surprisingly believable. A masterstroke of characterization is Ash (Jason Schwartzman), the teenage son (two years in fox years) who could have been a little brat or an awkward teenager, like any of the \"Incredibles\" children, but he's a kid who lives in the shadow of his father, who's bullied because of his short height, who's everything his father is not, and who must suffer from the inevitable comparisons with his cousin Kristofferson, who's everything he's not. I never thought a movie would feature an archetype that has seldom been in movies: the perfect guy.After two Hayao Miyazaki's movies, which multiply the number of viewings by two to fully get the films' brilliance, my mind needed a rest. I pulled a Monty Python and said to myself: and now for something different. Yes, I needed to see something new, imaginative enough to challenge my perceptions but in a more soothing way. I didn't know what to expect exactly from \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\", but that ignorance was perfect, the film was exactly the medication I needed, I longed for something different and maybe the best compliment I can give to this Foxy adventure is that it's like no animated film I've seen before and like no animated film you'll ever see, from beginning to end. And one thing for sure, this Mr. Fox is indeed, fantastic.And as if ever needed, here's another offering that proves that Wes Anderson is as much an auteur as Miyazaki in the sense that he really invented a style, a form of storytelling that channels his own creativity, in total symbiosis.",

When I sat down to watch this filmed version of the tale, I couldn't help but wonder how they would take what was a somewhat short book and make it to feature film length. As it turns out, only a short amount of the movie follows the book; the first third is a new backstory, then the next fifteen minutes or so follows the book, and the remaining running time is a kind of a sequel to what happened in the book. The sequel portion of the movie is a little interesting, since as a child I wondered what happened after the point where the book ended. Though at times it felt like blatant padding, just like what the first thirty minutes felt at times. But the padding wasn't the main issue I had with the movie. The problem was the same that I had with the book as a child - I didn't much like the character of Mr. Fox, even more so in this movie. In the movie, he is such a braggart, a heartless thief, and so irresponsible that I was greatly annoyed by him. This is a fatal blow, in my opinion.As for the animation, it was interesting to watch, if a little crude and cheap at times. But interesting animation almost never makes up for unlikable characters and boring story padding. I have a feeling that if Dahl were alive to see this filmed adaptation of his book, he'd be very unhappy... though reports state that he disliked almost all of the filmed adaptations of his writing.",

The soundtrack is crisp and the movie has some great characters. This is one of the best roles Clooney has played. His voice was perfect for the lead character.I have always appreciated Anderson's movies for their originality, but they have always missed the mark of greatness. This one however did excel due to its great plot, pacing, music, and characters.Despite having plenty of clever laughs Fox is not really for children. There is a certain complexity in the mix which makes it more fun for adults than kids I would think (much like Coroline and Where the Wild Things are).Overall, this is one of my favorite films of the year and the best movie Anderson has made.",

However since it was $2 admission day for kids shows and the reviews seemed to be SO positive I decided to chance it. I should have gone with my gut feeling. There were 4 kids (aged 9-14) and two adults in our group and EVERYONE hated it. It was truly dreadful. It looked like it had been pieced together by high-school students and the caption for each change in scene (I guess they must have thought the audience was too stupid to notice) didn't exactly give it the feel of a professional show or do anything for the flow of the film. The Claymation looked like it was done by amateurs and was a poor choice for a feature-length film - which is thankfully it barely long-enough to qualify as - I was waiting for it to wrap up or improve after the first two minutes. It is easily the worst children's movie I've seen of any kind. Had I not had the kids and neighbour's kids with me I would have left after the first ten minutes it was that bad. When the characters were swearing they would use the word \"cuss,\" which became very confusing in the first scene in which it occurred. The rest of the dialogue was equally bad. I'm not not sure where all the positive reviews are coming from but after seeing this piece of work I have doubts as to the ratings/reviews on IMDb as a whole.

But as a guy who's read the book about 15 times and for whom it remains an integral part of their childhood, I just didn't quite catch on. Don't get me wrong, the animation is magnificent, the music is solid and the comedy is mostly fine. The emotional moments also work to an extent, but I wasn't super invested.I think the entire thing boils down to how much have changed for the book. You see, what I love about the book is the simplistic joy it brings, the terror of the family trying to escape, followed by the heartwarming adventures as they invade the farms. But in the movie, the animals are treated as humans: They have human jobs, live in humanlike homes and do human stuff. In my mind, the main reason for having humans and other equally intelligent beings coexist is to showcase how other species interact with humans, like in Toy Story. But here, the fact that they're animals doesn't really drive the conflict, nor does it change the way they're viewed by the humans. It's a shame, because I could so perfectly picture the story as told in the book, on the screen, there's some really solid potential there.It might seem like I'm only complaining, and yeah, I kinda am, but I really wanted this to click with me, and the disappoinment I felt, while not enough to ruin the movie, still left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I'll rewatch this some day and realize what a masterpiece it is, but for now, I'm just left wishing that we'd got a movie faithful adaptation, or that I wasn't such a petty, nostalgia-blind fool, one of the two.",

With Wes Anderson quirky claymation style, symmetrical camera shots and the vibrant colour palette all makes this film great. Suitable for all ages, this eccentric adventure is sure to make anyone laugh with its humorous dry wit that the director is known for. This film is not at all boring due to it putting you into the action within ten minutes, and it's carries on this fast pace style through the whole film.

Basically Mr. Fox (George Clooney) spends most of his time raiding farms, but when Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) reveals she is pregnant, he makes the decision to quit. Two years later Mr. Fox has bought a new house in a tree for him, his wife and their son Ash (Jason Schwartzman), and Mr. Fox has become a newspaper columnist. The tree is located very close to the farms belonging to Franklin Bean (Sir Michael Gambon), Walter Boggis (Robin Hurlstone) and Nathan Bunce (Hugo Guinness), and his old career is soon to return. After moving in Mr. Fox's nephew Kristofferson Silverfox (Eric Chase Anderson) has come to live with them, but this doesn't stop Mr. Fox with his friend Kylie Sven Opossum (Wallace Wolodarsky) planning to steal chickens, turkeys and alcoholic cider. After the successful \"final raid\" of the three farms, led by the nasty Bean, he and the also mean Boggis and Bunce decide enough's enough, and that they should catch and kill Mr. Fox and the gang. Bean did manage to shoot the tail of Mr. Fox off, but they know that the animals are digging underground all over the place to get away, so the farmers try to drown them in the tunnels with a hoard of cider. Mr. Fox and the gang have retreated to the sewers, but they know they have to go back when Kristofferson has been captured, with only the Rat (Willem Dafoe) knowing his location. Mr. Fox sends a message to the farmers negotiating his surrender for Kristofferson's release, but in fact the animals have planned a counter attack. In the end the farmers are defeated by the cunning of Mr. Fox and the animals, they manage to get his mauled tail back, and they have accepted living int he sewers to stay safe, but they have found a pothole leading to salvation in a supermarket, run by Bean, Boggis and Bunce. Also starring Bill Murray as Badger, Owen Wilson as Coach Skip, Jarvis Cocker as Petey, Wes Anderson as Weasel, Brian Cox as Action 12 Reporter and Adrien Brody as Rickity the Field Mouse. The film is made by the old fashioned stop motion in stead of the modern CGI effects, this makes the film much more charming. Obviously the Americanisation of the story does stop it being completely British, but Clooney is great choice for the leading, and the other supporting characters are great fun too, it a most watchable family animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Music for Alexandre Desplat and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Animated Film and Best Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film.

With \"Coraline\", \"Up\", and now \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\", that \"Best animated Feature\" Oscar race is heating up. Based on the children's book by Roald Dahl, Fox (voice with sly charm by George Clooney) promises his wife (Meryl Streep) that he'll quit his thieving ways and settle down with a less dangerous job in order to support his fast-growing family. 2 years later (12 in fox years), Fox is a newspaper man living with his wife and young son named Ash (Jason Schwartzman), who is eager to please his father and jealous of his taller and much more talented visiting-cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson). Except something just isn't right. Fox needs that thrill of catching chickens and so along with his opossum buddy Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky), he sets out to steal from three of the meanest land-owners in the area, Boggis, Bunce, and the soon to be leader of the three who sets out to kill Fox, Bean (Michael Gambon). Soon Fox realizes that he's not only put the lives of his family at risk, but all the other animals as well. The stop motion animation is amazing; the bright-orangey scenery, fluidly quick character movements, and their outstanding creation are all marvelously done. Anderson has also found a good medium for his quirky sense of humor, especially in a hilarious description of a convoluted baseball/cricket-type game and an on-going gag about Kylie's eyes. George Clooney leads the way in voice casting but the all-star cast does nice work as well, Gambon playing a perfectly gruff antagonist, Schwartzman as the attention-seeking son, and Willem Dafoe very funny as a Louisiana rat. Streep, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Brian Cox also show up but have less to do. \"Fox\" is a little less than fantastic, but it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half.",

If you watch Nick Park's work on Wallace & Gromit, there is so much charm because of the attention to detail. This really does look rushed, and when ever there is a adventure or action sequences the camera cuts miles back so you can only just make out the card board cut outs. Wes Anderson could argue it's for effect, but perhaps all the budget went into it's divine A-list voice cast that there was just no money or time put in it's appearance. It doesn't look cute, in fact at times it's almost disturbing. The voice cast are fine here, the only problem is that there is just no need for these big names. Someone 10 times cheaper than George Clooney could have pulled off Fox's vocal chords with out breaking a sweat. It's just one massive marketing technique. The only voice actor here that was so vital to the film is Jason Schwartzman, his delivery is where the movie get's its greatest comedic injection.Having said all this, this isn't particularly a bad movie at all. It's really well write and the dialogue is charming a very witty. Never laugh out loud hilarious, but it keeps the viewer much more interested, seeming so there's not much else to fall back on. The plot, although taken from the novel, still isn't great, but things do pick up in the last couple of acts and as annoying and frightening it may look, it is still entertaining. It's adult for kids, to kiddie for adults, Mr. Fox really can't settle a target audience and really can't hold a worthy contender for the Best Animation Film.Overall: Far from fantastic, but it's quirky, cooky and a bit of a hoot.

Years later he's a columnist for a newspaper and is feeling middle aged. He moves his family into a new house and despite promising his wife never to steal chickens again, he begins to go back to his old ways which precipitates a war with the three biggest farmers in the country. An amusing film filled with angst and humor and Anderson's skewed view of life. If Anderson sold this as a kids film he has proved once again how dense the people in Hollywood really are since the vast majority of this film would go over most kid's heads. I like the film but I don't see it as the be all and end all, certainly I wouldn't put as the front runner for this years animated Oscar. My problems with the film stem from the films rambling nature which took up much of the first half. Once the war starts the film seems to settle down, though to me the ending, which was cribbed from Dahl's notes seems an after thought. I do like that Clooney's lead is very fallible, but at the same time he is kind of a jerk and more than once I wanted to shout at the screen questions about why everyone was still around him.

SOME parts of Mr. Fox are quite reminiscent of these previously listed movies, but somehow it is not as annoying.I had low expectations after the first few minutes. Even when the movie was over I really didn't know what to think about it. However, after letting it marinade in my brain for a few hours, I reached the conclusion that the movie was pretty good.The Good: George Clooney definitely made Mr. Fox a more intriguing character than he would have been had anyone else done the voice over. I also thought Franklin Bean was an entertaining (and quite vicious) villain. Too bad Boggis and Bunce weren't as interesting. Also Willem Dafoe was awesome as The Rat. Two great scenes that stand out to me are when Mr. Fox is making the final plan and calling everyone by their Latin names, and the part at the end with the wolf (Canis Lupus!), though don't ask me why. I loved that the movie had extremely dirty language but still got a PG rating---the solution: replace every place where a swear word was used with the word \"curse.\" GENIUS! Someone can just say \"What the curse are you talking about?\" Adults can fill in the blank and kids don't know what he meant. Very original. For a technical compliment, the music and scenery were also quite good.The Bad: Most characters that are not Mr. Fox are not very interesting. The movie is not lying about being about Mr. Fox. Was it just me or did his wife only have about 4 lines in the entire movie, all of which were extremely dry and mono toned? Mr. Fox's son was also terribly annoying as the angsty teen fox. Also like I said before, the animation is horrifying.Overall Fantastic Mr. Fox was *just* shy of being fantastic, but I'd definitely give it a recommendation, especially if you like Wes Anderson. I would probably watch it again, but not until after the nightmares stop.Final Score - 7.5/10",

Fast, fun and sharply etched with fine comedic bravado throughout (thank you again Bill Murray for your insouciant vocals) and a truly amazing tour-de-force for the stop-motion animators and production design by Nelson Lowry (seriously should be considered for an Oscar) with its autumnal palette and homemade puppetry look (waycool how everything bristles to life!)

            "content": "I have no idea why viewers at IMDb have given this movie an 8 out of 10.Well, that's not quite true. I do have an idea why. But it's not a good reason.There's a tendency in our society to rate things really highly that are different. Well, \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is certainly that. Different.That's about the best I can say for it.When you combine \"different\" - which in this case means: * stop-motion animation * deliberately dull color schemes * a mostly-incoherent plot * and quirky attempts at humorwith many of the major characters speaking in extremely familiar voices (such as those of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray and Willem Dafoe), you have a recipe for a runaway success. By \"runaway success,\" I mean that this movie somehow managed to recoup its $40 million budget.Yes, the only thing more astonishing than the fact that this plodding, (in my opinion) artless film cost $40 million to make is that it grossed more than it cost.I normally try not to give away the plot in my reviews, but there's not much worry about that with this movie. It's a looong 87 minutes.At one point I had to go and retrieve my 7-year-old son (who LOVES movies), because he had wandered away for lack of interest. It looked like something worth watching was actually about to happen. I regret that I did not allow him to go on his own way.To give them credit, they certainly tried to be \"original.\" Their approach was to go a bit further than most such films in incorporating themes more relevant to adults and older teens, such as marital conflict, teenage identity crisis, flipping real estate, the sexual reputation of Mr. Fox's wife, and so forth. The result is an awkward mix of soap opera and animated action that isn't quite suitable either for children or for adults. (Interestingly, two of the three reviews immediately before mine, both from people who LOVED the film, said almost the same thing!)The good points of this film include some good voice acting by familiar voices, and some decent music. My 12-year-old son, by the way, concurs with my assessment of this movie. His review: \"The animation is pretty bad, and there wasn't really a plot. All they did was run around in sewer pipes and get shot at all the time. Definitely a one-time-view only.\" Both of us (independently) also drew comparisons to the infamous Superbabies 2: Baby Geniuses. In fact, my son stated that he would rather watch the latter, as \"it actually has a plot line.\"If you appreciate a movie that's different really just for the sake of being different, then you'll probably love this film. Otherwise, I'd give it a miss. Honestly, I was kind of sorry I rented it. I had in mind to rent a good family movie, and since this one was PG-rated, animated, and given a vote of 8.0 out of 10 by IMDb viewers, I thought it would be a good choice. But it really isn't a good family film, for the reasons stated above.Also, even though the film substitutes \"cuss\" for all profanity, I must admit squirming a bit when Mr. Fox sighed, \"This is gonna be a total clustercuss for everybody.\" I could just see one of my kids asking me, \"Dad, what's a clustercuss?\" In short: This movie was highly-rated for the exact same reason Barack Obama was elected President: It's different from what we're used to. Unfortunately, in both instances, we can see that different doesn't always mean worthwhile. Oh, and I see the first person to rate my review rated it as \"not useful,\" probably because he or she loves this film (or Barack Obama, or both). The review is what it is: an honest assessment of this movie by someone who has seen hundreds of films (if not thousands) and has reviewed 50 of them (!) here on IMDb. It tells you specifically why neither I nor any of my family liked \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" I recognize that mine is (obviously) a minority opinion, but I don't really see how that makes for an \"unhelpful\" review. What it should tell you instead (especially when you go through additional reviews and see other 4-and-5 star ones besides mine) is that while lots of people love \"Fantastic Mr. Fox,\" it certainly is NOT for everyone. There are actually a fair number of us who simply don't agree.",

Wes Anderson's direction is interesting, with a peculiar filming style, with one or another scene coming out of the status quo. A good direction, of a good director.History (0,5 / 2): From the beginning the film try to present us with a very basic story, this is certainly not a problem, even with other animations already showing us that it is possible to do something aimed at children but adults can also watch and perceive small hidden elements behind the story. See Toy Story 3, Inside Out and etc. But even the simple \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" seems to fail to do, some points take you out of the story (ex: If from the beginning he was good at digging, why was not his first plan already?). Perhaps a small positive point here is the sense of adventure, which is present and can entertain children.Comedy (0/2): Here is probably where the movie lost me. After all, what's the point of seeing a comedy that isn't funny? And I don't say that because no scene made me cry with laughter, I say this because I didn't find any scenes if you want funny, the movie fails miserably in this matter, definitely this is not a funny movie.6/10",

The movie just moves on from one story to the next. Visually interesting but appears to be just a star role for George Clooney. Not that interesting a movie. The story has a lot of inconsistencies. The death of the rat seems rather gratuitous and out of place. No real explanation is presented on why the rat is security for the farmer or how a message is delivered from Mr. Fox to the farmers.

Having read Fantastic Mr. Fox twenty some years ago, I still had a fuzzy idea of the story. The film follows the original quite well. Anderson has expanded the narrative in ways that not only fit his style, but the added character dimensions fit the story perfectly.The stop-motion animation is a great way for a story like this to be shared with an audience. Computer animation gets better and better every year, but Fantastic Mr. Fox shows there is life left in the hand made process still.George Cloony has a mischievous luster in the title role opposite Meryl Streep's quiet confidence of his wife. While Bill Murray's Badger and Willem Dafoe's Weasel turn in well honed supporting voices, it is Wallace Wolodarsky's Opossum Kylie who steals the show. I laughed at nearly every one of his lines.After several half measures and missteps since Royal Tenenbaums (itself a movie that was either obnoxious or brilliant) Wes Anderson has directed something truly great.

Not that it is particularly crude or vulgar - it's certainly no \"Fritz the Cat,\" and even the swearing is covered-over by the characters uttering a generic \"cuss\" - but its themes and dialogue are pitched at a generally higher level of sophistication than we are accustomed to in such works.Based on a book by the beloved Roald Dahl, the story focuses on the dapper Mr. Fox, a recovering chicken thief who, at the behest of his wife, has given up his predatory ways in favor of domestic responsibility as a husband and father and a career as a newspaper columnist. What could be more respectable than that? But old habits die hard, and Mr. Fox soon discovers he must remain true to his carnivorous nature, leading him to enlist a few of his friends and neighbors of various species in a scheme to raid some local farms and make off with their poultry. This lands him and his buddies in hot water with both the owners of the farms and the heavily armed authorities who are called in to support them.Like Anderson's live-action works, \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" (co-written by Noah Baumbach) owes much of its charm to the scattered, random and quirky nature of the material and its presentation, with a narrative so full of side forays and offbeat, eccentric characters that the movie feels as if it's constantly renewing itself as it's going along. There is wonderful voice work by George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe, clever in-joke references to spaghetti westerns and \"Rebel Without a Cause,\" a funny subplot involving Fox's son and his obsession with proving his athletic prowess to his inattentive dad, and a simple, clean, streamlined look that combines a minimum of stop-motion movement with remarkably true-to-life backgrounds.It may not be a great animated film, but it is one of the more original and refreshing ones we've come across in quite some time.",

There are many elements of the original story present and correct here, but at the same time the story has been muddled and become very Americanised. I don't mind the fact that the animals have American accents (George Clooney et al) but I hate the intrusive pop music that keeps playing on the soundtrack in order to evoke emotion - I always despise films that play this cheap trick.The heart of the story - humans vs. animals - is a good one and there are a lot of funny and quirky moments, but other parts of the film left me cold. The characters of the young foxes are played by a couple of adult voice actors and the effect is a distinctly odd, and slightly creepy, one.

All of Anderson's films (see Royal Tenenbaums & Life Aquatic especially) can be called \"quirky\" or \"odd\". They are not \"feel good movies and I've not watched one of them where there wasn't a character that suffered from severe depression or some other psychological problem of some sort. This character-type, coupled with The Fantastic Mr. Fox's animation, made for a mildly creepy blend & a barely watchable hour and a half. Wes Anderson doesn't know how to MAKE a happy movie. He doesn't know how to do anything other than make films that seem to propagate the same formula: create awkward films that make the viewer uncomfortable, fill it furthermore with depressing, cynical scenarios of family & social dysfunction and try to market them as \"humor.\" Wes Anderson should market a box-set of his films and title it: \"Movies to Slit Your Wrists To\"... For the love of Pete, this guy needs therapy and a good bottle of antidepressants! I'm not sure why there seems to be a strange group of people who ENJOY this kind of dark, cynical, depressing comedy. How anyone on earth could find it ENJOYABLE to sit and watch a group of characters loathe their lives, deal with awful bosses with subhuman social skills, & family dysfunction is beyond me. MOST normal people go to a movie to ESCAPE those kinds of things and ENJOY themselves! Why ANYONE would want to spend $8 - 15 to sit and watch the same kind of depressing situations on screen that they are forced to deal with in everyday life is ludicrous to me! Clooney adds little depth of character with his voice-over for the self-absorbed, kleptomaniacal Mr. Fox, & the \"dysfunctional family routine with the quirky emo kid(s) that the father doesn't appreciate\" sub-plot was already overplayed in Royal Tenenbaums. It's tiresome. I'm sick of seeing it in so many movies in the last few years, it's nauseating -- from Little Miss Sunshine to Horton Hears a Who, to this movie.In all honesty, the movie was so boring & unenjoyable to me that I literally have it stopped in the middle and have been entertaining myself now by writing this scathing review.How I rated it: VISUALS/ANIMATION: 5 I liked the style, but it would have worked better in a \"happier\" movie.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: 2 WHAT character development?

            "content": "At the heart of Fantastic Mr Fox is a tale about masculinity, and one that is served up within the narrative of a fox instead of a human, and so the phallic symbol is instead a tail. This tail is worn as a trophy and is the objective for both Mr Fox and Ash, the less than athletic son who is living in the shadow of his father and his cousin's ability/achievements. Both these character's story lines are written well, no matter how close or far they may be from the Roald Dahl novel. And the stop motion animation makes for a great medium for these children's books which also carry heavier themes. If we can't get hand drawn animated Quentin Blake style illustrations (someone get on that) then this way is equally as good. It's all accompanied by the pleasant and whimsical score of Desplat. The mandolin, flute and xylophone combine quite well especially in the third track, and Kristofferson's Theme is a wonderfully melancholy accompaniment to the quiet whirring of the toy train which stifles a young fox's tears. Additionally, the childlike gibberish and chanting of Petey's Song by Jarvis Croker is charming and not a bad song in the slightest. At times the visuals and fluidity reaches the heights of Wallace and Gromit and The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, which is no easy feat to do. The art design is meticulously gorgeous, right down to the 12 chickens miniature meals, the scientific contraptions of Bean, the water splash effects, the spotless kitchen, the grimy television set, a miniature working motorcycle complete with sidecar! The world of across the river is beautifully and stunningly realised with loving care and detail. Given most of it was captured in live action, it retains a cinematic quality; I particularly love the lighting that is displayed in 3 separate ways in the cellar of Bean, down to the warm glow that illuminates all the bottles of apple cider. The humans are realised with a wonderful sense of character and ambition - well Bean mostly, who is stick thin yet sinister, dark yet lively. The little disappointment was the fur of the fox models, which bristled in the wind but felt a little like fake toys, especially with the fondness of Anderson to use extreme close ups to showcase emotion. The welling of tears in the eyes is well done, but looks almost too good next to the plastic strands of orange and white. The voice cast is mostly adequate. Owen Wilson as Anderson alumni was easily recognisable as the sports coach, but that did not stick out. Two in particular stick out to me, and it's a shame that they are two main characters. Firstly, Jason Schwartzman as a long time Anderson collaborator voices Ash, which I feel is a big misstep given how authentically his character is written with real pangs of jealously and moodiness as well as bravery and sympathy. These would shine a lot more had an appropriately aged voice actor be cast. Schwartzman sounds too sarcastic, too whiny, and is overshadowed by Eric Anderson as the wonderfully tender Kristofferson. The second issue is with Clooney as Mr Fox, who is immediately recognisable from the get go. His strong and confident voice is appropriate for some scenes, like when he takes the lead in digging, or when he is chastising Kylie while raiding and killing chickens. Other more vulnerable scenes he simply does not echo the screenplay, such as the heart-to-heart with Felicity near the waterfall, or the talk with Ash. It doesn't ruin those moments, but hearing how unshaken or how callous Clooney sounds is a little jarring. One of those moments is one of my favourite of the whole film, the encounter near the end with the wolf. It's a culmination of the entire narrative arc of Mr Fox's struggle with his inherent animalistic nature, which is so humorously displayed whenever they wolf down a delicacy (but not before slowly savouring in visually, which adds to the appeal of the humour). In the beginning, he attempts to woo Felicity by showing his dangerous and wild side, how easily he snaps the chicken's neck. We never find out how effective this was, because the pregnancy of Ash forces him to find another way of life. Years later (how many fox years is that?) he is unable to fight his urges and risks his life to start up again. The consequences of this are drastic, and again he must fight against feeding his own ego and appetite for adventure (watch how effortlessly he steals attention from Badger during the toast - Clooney's voice is especially great when addressing crowds and speaking of his own victories). He loses his tail and his symbol for masculinity in the process, but reconciles - another pregnancy confronts him and he decides to return to his domesticated way of life. \"I have a phobia of wolves!\" he shouts, yet we are now struck but how unafraid he sounds compared to those moments beforehand when someone mentions wolves. He can no longer run away into the wilderness like the wolf can, a beast of wild, unbridled power, but he still shares a momentary sign of recognition. He can at least speak English, unlike the wolf. And he can also gorge himself at Boggis, Bunce and Bean Supermarkets. Fantastic Mr Fox, despite its shortcomings, is a delightful little tale that hits emotional notes with surprising complexity considering its source material is a children's novel. The stop motion medium is perhaps where Anderson's picture book/painterly aesthetic shines; whether you call it needlessly quirky or not (hint: it's not). It takes talking animals and gives them a warm and whimsical tone, but not without pulling its punches when more serious moments call for reflection. I don't think that stop motion watery tears welling from a plastic eyeball could ever substitute real life sadness, but Fox sure tries its best.",

            "content": "I started watching this movie with the best intentions. I actually like many of the voice actors, and have heard good things about the director. Talk about life setting me up for a fall. It started with what I thought to be an opening sequence with some weird drawing-like images of a farm and some ugly lifeless foxes pasted on top of it, moving along with all the fluency of a powerpoint presentation. Soon enough I would find out that the entire movie would be in this style.If I were to sum the entire experience up in a word it would be boring. That pretty much says it all. The animation (though probably brilliantly done, and very artsy) just doesn't deliver. The characters look lifeless and at times even scary. This is probably partially due to the facial expressions of the characters, or rather, lack thereof. They aren't nearly sophisticated enough to put the emotions of the story across. The ''action'' scenes are anything but. The slow, boring, and unrealistic stop motion animation makes it virtually impossible to feel any sort of suspense regardless of what's going on in the movie.All of this could be forgiven if the story would be any good (and suited for this type of animation), but alas. The story is weird, long-winded, unengaging, but most of all; boring. I remember reading the book as a child, and loving it. I wish I could say the same for this screen adaptation. I don't really remember the entire story in the original book, but I'm sure it was more interesting than this.The humor, or rather, lack thereof, is terrible. I don't remember even chuckling for the entire duration of this 87 minute nightmare. Those 87 minutes must have been in fox minutes, because it felt like an eternity. Usually these animated movies score quite well in the humor department, but this movie manages to elevate the ability to not-engage an audience to an art form. It's really quite impressive.I don't even know what the purpose of this movie was. It failed to deliver on all fronts, and I can't imagine any of the people working on this genuinely feeling satisfied with the end result. At no point did I feel drawn into the movie. Honestly, I stopped watching after about an hour. I had to work really hard to even make it that far, but at a certain point I just gave up. I honestly don't care if the foxes made it out alive, or whatever happened to any of the characters. They could all be electrocuted and left to die for all I care. Steer clear.",

I found none.The dialogue is very American in style and I found it quite painful. This wasn't helped by the plot which focused more on the relationships between the unfaithful (in terms of a promise not to steal chickens again) Mr Fox and his loving wife and the one between their small weedy adolescent son and his athletic yoga doing cousin who had come over to stay. The actual exploits of Mr Fox were reduced to a poor sub plot.Usually, when I watch a film with \"goodies\" and \"baddies\", I find myself wanting one side to win. It may the \"goodies\" but on occasion, I can for example find the heroes so obnoxious or perhaps that the villains have such charm that I wish the bad guys would win. Either way, there is at least some from of desire for an outcome.In this case, I simply did not care. The slightly dysfunctional Fox family were bland. Their enemies, the farmers, may have been unable to let go of their determination for revenge on Mr Fox but, rather than having any real villainous qualities, they were about as uninteresting as the Foxes.All in all, I found the film rather pointless.",

Some work very well (Royal Tenenbaums, Rushmore) while others fall just short of the mark (Life Aquatic, Darjeeling Limited). When Mr. Anderson hooks up with writer Noah Baumbach (Squid and the Whale) to take on a Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) story, a movie lover can't help but get very excited! The look of the film is very unusual and \"fantastic\" in its own right. The fur or coats of the animals is pretty amazing and even the expressive faces are new to the big screen. What really fell short for me was the voice acting of some very impressive folks. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray all fall a bit flat and just play it too cool ... dare I say it ... they were all a bit boring! Willem Dafoe as the rat was really the only one who brought any life to his role.So while I absolutely love the look of the film and the characters, I was quite disappointed in the pace and passion of the story and the manner in which it's acted. It is probably too slow for both kids and adults, so I am not sure who the audience will be ... other than film technicians who will appreciate the look.",

However, I found the end a little too predictable, but, considering that it is an animated film, it is somehow expected.

It's beautiful to watch and every time you see the film you'll notice something new going on in the background. It bravely attempts unrealistic scenes such as when the animals are digging, and these add to the quirkiness of the film. There are no complaints in this regard, the animators have done a good job.Perhaps then you should watch this with the sound down. The script is mediocre at best. It did draw a few laughs but this was chiefly as a result of the animation rather than the actual joke. There is little correlation with the book, which in some films is needed, but it is overdone here. If Dahl was alive today I doubt he would have enjoyed this adaptation. To paraphrase Cosmo Landesman of The Sunday Times, it lacks the elements of child abuse, violence and the peril that the book captured. This is replaced by a yawn-inducing conflict with Mr Fox and his wife, in a strange attempt to make it \"relevant,\" instead adding another clich\u00e9 to the pile. Mr Fox himself is completely clich\u00e9 throughout, and I felt absolutely no doubt that somehow he would overcome the problem presented by the story-line. For a children's film this is not what we want. When the film finally limped in to finish, I greeted it with relief rather than happiness.The soundtrack is another so-so feature. There are few moments when it really fits in well, but it does the job and I have no problem with that.The main feature of controversy is the bizarre \"americanisation\" of the story. This really sucks a lot of the film's soul out. Why give the heroes American accents and the villains British accents? Oh yeah, because that's what viewers want, apparently. Another clich\u00e9 is added to the pile and led to me losing my interest even more. The addition of things American viewers would expect to find like supermarkets does this film no favours. Or should I say favor.In conclusion, should you watch this film? No. Unless you are determined to encourage the sort of rubbish the American film industry is churning out nowadays, with dull adaptations of British classics, then there is little reason to. I am being more harsh than I would normally be here because I am determined to see an end to this. A poor film that is killed by its own Americanisation.",

It is too dark for children--I very much regret taking my 7-year-old to see it, and some younger girls nearby seemed traumatized. And yet it is not an adult movie either; animated animals, cartoon violence, and no fully realized characters. A appearance by a wolf near the end is clearly meant to be a great peroration, but is set up and executed is so perfunctory a manner as to be almost embarrassing. Wes Anderson seems to think that the movie is quite ironic and clever; to me it lacks humanity and any real insight. The animation is beautiful and the music is quite well executed. There are a few scenes that are quite good, mostly involving the relationship between Ash and his cousin Kristofferson. These are the primary strengths of a movie that disappoints overall.",

They could have made it classically British by using English actors to do the voices, they could have kept the story faithful by adhering more closely to the book. But, they didn't. Instead they have used American actors and gung-ho music to make it more like an over-the-top adventure movie with some poor attempts at humour. It's obvious the market they were aiming at and does not take a lot of thought to figure it out.If Roald Dahl had still been alive I do not think he would ever have allowed this film to be made, let alone released as no real justice has been done to the book at all.

This does not however amount to the whole thing crashing and burning. Instead, there's a brilliant and controlled chaos to Anderson's lightning fast creative command.The characters all have distinct personalities, and borrow proper depth through (once again) the superb screenplay. The slightly jerky stop motion contains much care and due diligence, and brings in some extra quirk. Settings? Very diverse and detailed, the urban environments especially.Other sections deserving of praise is the lore it leaves. It conveys a genuine sense of a universe that operates on its own, consistent rules. More minor maybe but it makes it all more palatable and relatable to viewers.

            "content": "It is said that animation is the most pure way of controlling every element of a movie production, and nowhere is this proved more than in Wes Anderson's The Fantastic Mr. Fox. Viewers familiar with Wes Anderson's world (a self-defined and hermetically closed off alternate reality that remains consistent with each passing movie) are going to find themselves right at home--so much so that it's almost impossible to watch the film as anything other than warm homages to his own emotional topography. Quite literally: story? What story? We're in Wes Anderson Land, where the characters are quirky and the humor is almost always understated.George Clooney plays Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep Bill Murray Jason Schwartzmann Willem Dafoe Owen Wilson is blah blah blah. You recognize the voices and you especially recognize them from previous Anderson films. The music. Warm-hearted childhood narration with darker undertones. Okay now that we've gotten the basics covered, what's new? THE ANIMATION! Holy cuss but it's pretty! It has the same movement and feeling of the Brothers Quay and Jan Svankmajer, without, you know, the utter disturbing darkness and phantasmagoric splendor. Anderson always loves blocking his shots, as in not only deciding how the action should be blocked but literally putting everything on lateral rectilinear spaces, and the childhood shoe-box diorama feel of this thing is absolutely perfect for his vision. The movement only gets weird when the action gets fast, but otherwise it is hard not to get utterly involved with every little detail of this make-shift fantasia. This movie is at its best in close-up; people who get put off by the uncanny nature of stuffed animal eyes should probably stay home, everyone else will be drawn into them.Is it fair to discuss this movie solely as an Anderson production without taking into account the demographic it is promoted to? Well unfortunately, I'm not reading much of a positive reaction in kids. I went to see this with my friend because she was babysitting a four and a half year old and neither he nor the children of his general age-group seemed very impressed by the goings-on. Certainly I wouldn't argue that every kid who sees this was or will be turned off by it, but the audience appreciation seemed to come from the adults more in response to the detail and how the movie was made over the story and the characters. The story itself is pretty basic, and the funniest lines of dialog seem to fly right over kids' heads. Like what was expected of Where the Wild Things Are, The Fantastic Mr. Fox is really a nostalgic homage for the 20-30 something crowd, but unlike Where the Wild Things Are it didn't actually end up being a cerebral rumination on childhood, playing instead to Anderson's greatest strength: mop-headed hipsters unapologetic about their inner child and ready to watch some Roald Dahl accompanied by the Beach Boys. Of which, luckily, I am a member, which means the movie made no beef with me.--PolarisDiB",

Instead of following in the footsteps of Disney and Pixar's style of animation, Wes Anderson decided to adapt this using glorious stop motion. I have a huge amount of praise for anyone who decides to make their film using stop motion as it requires so much effort to get it right and after rewatching this film I can certainly say Wes Anderson got it right.Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of the most gorgeous animated films to ever be made. From the bright and warm colour palette of the countryside to the hair on the fox's faces and tails, this film is visually stunning. I cannot imagine how hard the designers and art team toiled to bring about the result we see on screen. It must have taken days, months and possibly years to execute everything perfectly. Hats off to every single person that worked on this film as their hard work definitely paid off.It doesn't end there as the screenplay and voice acting contribute to the experience. The script by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach is charming, funny and witty throughout with some great humour in many scenes. This is a film that doesn't just cater to kids as Anderson and Baumbach have added plenty of adult humour and jokes to keep parents and adults thoroughly engaged. The voice acting is marvellous. George Clooney as Mr. Fox works incredibly well and Meryl Streep's Mrs. Fox is terrific as they have great chemistry with each other.

So I guess you already realized that I'm a huge fan of this movie (and that I will be making some references to the book), but I still want to say this: it's not only one of my favorites from the mighty Wes Anderson but just ever, without a damn doubt. I refer Anderson as \"mighty\" just because I have yet not to LOVE one of his films. And I really admire the fact that none of his six feature films (his seventh, MOONRISE KINGDOM, will open the Cannes festival!) feels like a \"minor work\". They do share a lot with each other (just like, for instance, Woody Allen films), but so far Anderson has created six very memorable pieces and each one really stand out by its own. FANTASTIC MR. FOX was certainly the most interesting and strange project as it was Anderson making an animated picture. And the animation, I must say, is simply stunning. It's stop motion paradise, actually. Take for instance that scene of the fight between the characters of Mr. Fox (voice of George Clooney!) and the Rat (an unrecognizable Willem Dafoe). It's simply a lesson on stop-motion; I hate the word (due to its overuse) but I'll have to use it for this: creativity. They did such great work full of creativity in scenes like that fight. I cherish that stuff a lot. The character design is also quite the thing! It made me feel like a kid again since each time I saw the movie I was like \"I want the toys of all the characters!\" FANTASTIC MR. FOX is as stop-motion paradise as film adaptation paradise. Since the very beginning this is PURE Anderson. It never feels as something strange having chapter titles and stuff because we are used to that with Anderson; just think in his THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS for that. So it's always clear in the tone that this is a Wes Anderson film, and let's not forget that here we also have the Rolling Stones! One of my favorites: \"Street Fighting Man\"! So with all of this one could think Roald Dahl's book share things with Anderson's bodywork. But now that I have read the book I know that this is also a lesson on how to make yours, in the best way possible, something previously released; this is film adaptation paradise, like I said. For instance, the book is for kids and none of Anderson's films are, not even this one. For the record, I borrowed my DVD of FANTASTIC MR. FOX to the seven or six-year-old nephew of my girlfriend, thinking he was going to enjoy it. He just said that it was \"weird\". And I really can't blame him. Actually, just put the word \"wonderfully\" before \"weird\" and you have exactly what this film is. Anderson not only added things to the history from the book -a very simple and ironic story about foxes being smarter than some horrible humans- but also gave to the characters, with those additions, similarities with his very own characters. If Mr. Fox is like a superhero that everybody admires in the book, here there's much more going on around him. I remember thinking during my very first viewing in Clooney's very own character from O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? while seeing the personality of Mr. Fox (then voice acting of Clooney is a real success), and I also recall the character Dignan from BOTTLE ROCKET thanks to him! And a character that doesn't appear in the book, Mr. Fox's son Ash (voiced by Jason \"Max Fischer himself\" Schwartzman), is like the quintessential Wes Anderson character: a small fellow who suffers from being *different* (and who's jealous of his more athletic and attractive cousin Kristofferson \u2013 a complete new character as well). So I think, is what filmmakers must do when adapting a book or whatever: remain faithful to the main story but at the same time own the damn thing. Anderson's first adapted film is a true winner, and made of him a much richer filmmaker; it's simply pure \"melted gold\"!",

            "content": "Back in 2009 when this movie was first in cinemas, I turned a blind eye to this film. I didn't really watch many kids movies then. I was an all- action person. I loved action films, and still do, mind you. But over recent years (last two years?), I've found myself getting more in touch with my younger side; the side that loves animated films.I'm going to try and keep my review spoiler free, but I will mark it for having spoilers just in case something slips out. The premise follows the same as the book; Mr. Fox steals food from three wealthy and dangerous farmers, and in an attempt to kill him, they dig up his home, forcing him and his family to dig deeper and deeper underground. That's a rough outline of the storyline. There's more, I can assure you, but I'm only filling in the necessary plot details. Right off the bat, the stop-motion animation is smooth and effectively used. The characters, despite it being stop-motion, move smoothly. Acrobats and quick movement are actually quite entertaining to watch and you don't have to wait long to see some good use of stop-motion.The cinematography in this movie is used very well, making some awesome scenes. You could have one thing happening on one end, and another thing on the other end, all in one scene. And it's not just subtle. You can clearly see two things are happening at once. When they're digging away from the farmers, it gives you a side view to show you what's happening above and below. This is used really, really well!The humour in this movie can get a few chuckles out of you, even if you're the type who only laugh at adult comedies and not family comedies (note: I said family and not children's). The characters we can certainly relate to. We all know an Ash. We all know a Mr. Fox. We know that one kid who picks on anyone for being different. This makes the emotional aspect of this movie carry that extra punch.Speaking of the emotional side of things; despite it being more comedic, the film does have a lot of touching moments. These moments make this movie even more forgettable than it already is. Am I glad I watched this in the end? You're cussing right I am! Great movie for not just children, but for any movie-lover really.",

I'm not an expert in animation techniques and this movie might have brought something new in that aspect however, there was not a bit of creativity in story telling especially when compared to Miyazaki animations or even Toy Story and Wall-E.

            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wes Anderson's retro stop-motion animated version of the classic Roald Dahl novel, tells the story of the charming rogue, Mr. Fox who, through a series of adventures and misadventures, learns the value of community and family. It is a hard lesson to learn, however, and eliminating larceny from his life may be too big a stretch for Mr. Fox who, after all, tells his wife that he poaches poultry ''because I'm a wild animal.\" George Clooney is the silky smooth voice coming from Mr. Fox's mouth while Meryl Streep voices the role of Mrs. Fox. Both Clooney and Streep seem completely at home in their roles, giving the movie even more bounce and joie de vivre.Anderson, working with co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach, connects with Dahl's sensibility but expands on the story, bringing in diversions such as the game of \"whack-bat\" and a Tennenbaum-like helping of family dysfunction. The main idea of the book remains, however, that once we are sure of who we are, we have the strength to take on even the most determined adversaries, for example, \"three of the meanest, nastiest, ugliest farmers\" in the world. When a young Mr. Fox learns that his wife is pregnant, he makes a promise to stop his life of chicken thievery and turn into an honest man - 'er fox. Fast forward two years and the reformed Mr. Fox is now a newspaper columnist and has even changed his clothes from dapper to casual. He also has a son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman) whom he considers to be slightly weird because he wears a superhero cape. Looking into the possibility of buying a new home inside a beech tree that has lots of shade, he is told by his lawyer, Badger (Bill Murray) to stay far away because that tree is too close to the property of three mean farmers: Boggis (Robin Hurlstone), Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and, the nastiest of them all, Bean (Michael Gambon). Ignoring the advice of his lawyer, Mr. Fox not only moves into his new digs but plans one last bit of thievery to show the gleesome threesome who is boss. He brings back his old partner Kylie the opossum (Wally Wolodarsky) to aid in the crime but things become complicated when his athletic cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) comes to stay with the family and catches Fox's attention. Needless to say, the mature Kristofferson who also does yoga and meditation makes Ash jealous who, like most teenagers, is somewhat insecure and eager to please his dad. Fox brings the whole family together, however, to try and defeat the mean farmers in a three-part plan to steal chickens, turkeys, and spiked apple cider, taking them underground, through tunnels, and up into the streets.A bit too quirky and snappy for younger children, Fantastic Mr. Fox is more likely to appeal to teenagers with its eclectic soundtrack that includes Burl Ives, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and the Bobby Fuller Four. Anderson seems to have had a lot of fun in making the film and it shows. With the 70s style costumes and animation technique, the feeling is of watching real characters in motion rather than being drowned in a sea of graphics. Ultimately, the story is what is most important anyway, and here a subversive Dahl novel is enhanced by the even more subversive Anderson, advising us that whether we are four-legged or two-legged, we should rejoice in the knowledge of how unique we truly are.",

After the tenth time, the \"laconic comment followed by five seconds of awkward silence\" gag just isn't funny any more. Same with most of the music, it was just a placeholder for the Benny Hill Theme, because playing that over all the repetitive scenes of \"Foxy\" and his gang just moving about randomly would have been a little to obvious even for this flick.And yes, like many other reviewers I'm a huge fan of the book, but even when viewing this as a work of it's own - maybe especially then - it just does not hold up. It tries way to hard, its parts don't fit together nearly well enough, and it left me without any strong feelings whatsoever.

UP is an example of a film not really for children but childlike adults. Slumdog Millionaire got an Oscar for best film.

Mr. Fox (Clooney) used to enjoy his adventurous life as a food-stealer with Ms. Fox (Streep), but now he is a suave columnist, they have a son Ash (Schwartzman), and lead a quiet life living underground. Nevertheless, as a wild animal, Mr. Fox cannot reconciled to the quiet life which Ms. Fox urges him to hew to, he purchases a new tree house regardless of his lawyer Mr. Badger (Murray)'s persuasion because three meanest human farmers are living nearby. Later Mr. Fox's teenage nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) comes to stay with them, whose athletic bent walks away with Mr. Fox's commendation and leaves a gauche Ash pale in comparison. Recruiting an opossum Kylie (Wolodarsky) as his aide, Mr. Fox plots one-last-raid to the three farmers' respective lands on the sly, which ultimately provokes the farmers' vengeance, lead by Franklin Bean (Gambon), the meanest of them all, and endangers other species as well. Together, animals need to use their instinct to fight back and Mr. Fox must retrieve his tail which he has lost in an ambush, now becomes a fur tie wearing by Bean as a victorious token and rescue Kristofferson who is captured as a hostage. With all the animals sport an American accent whereas the evil humans with British accent, Anderson chirpily brings the mischievous pettiness into the film's autumnal palette, the story has its whimsical focus on retaining one's natural disposition and a correct upbringing every child should receive. Visually speaking, this animation has its quintessential Andersonian opulence, its symmetrical and miniature frame arrangement promisingly augurs his auteurist consummation in MOONRISE KINGDOM (2012) and THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014). So is his characterisation of the assorted anthropomorphic critters, mostly foxes and rodents, and the only villain among them is Willem Dafoe voices the rat, Mr. Fox's nemesis. When Mr. Fox and his cohort meets a wolf on their way, he must overcome his deepest fear since his inherent phobia of wolves, and Anderson lends the story such a philosophical angle of exhortation, throws in conspicuous adulthood sophistication onto the family-friendly template.For those who anticipate a more dramatic showdown, Anderson doesn't accommodate itself into a traditional story-unwinding, the film doesn't end in a thorough and edge-of-the- seat payoff, alternatively, Anderson blas\u00e9 care-freeness finishes this endearing tale with a \"we want it more\" note. The cast is pretty fetching, it is Clooney's first voice performance and he is plain fitting, but a quite despondent fact is that Streep can only pair with Clooney as a couple in an animation, in the world of live-action, it will never happen, not in a billion years. All in all, it is rather dismissive to category Anderson's work as a cartoon for kids, it competently deserves the adjective in its title and is a steadfast stepping stone for Anderson's propitious standing in Hollywood's hierarchy.",

But it also teaches good things: to accept oneself; to do your best; to unite to get stronger, and work as a team, among other things.The film goes on a good pace, it has a lot of action. Many things happen, keeping your attention. It gives the impression of being a long movie, but not because it's bad. I felt like my spent time was worth it. The different things that happen are well linked, and they go according to the characters' personality. As a fable, it works great - most fables do; and the characters are amusing.This movie also gets extra points from me due to its originality. It represents people, in a way that it contains different, sometimes conflicting elements found in most people.There are a few unnecessary scene, but they don't make this movie less fun. And a few technical elements are poor also, but one must admit that some things must be really hard to do in stop-motion. In fact, the creators did have a good amount of creativity in some scenes. Finally, I can't leave behind any comments on the graphical quality of the movie. It has some really beautiful images, and most of the others are at least very nice.",

            "content": "I always thought it was a delight to see a director step out of their comfort zone and direct a film they usually don't touch. Kevin Smith did with Red State, Martin Scorsese does it every film, but one of his most noticeable was Hugo, and now, Wes Anderson takes his indelible quirkiness and injects it into the pleasant animated film, Fantastic Mr. Fox.I hope everyone at some point read a book by Roald Dahl, whether it was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, this, James and the Giant Peach, or The Witches. It seems almost all children were acquainted with his books at one point or another. Authors like that become etched into school curriculum. Joining Dahl can be the late Maurice Sendak, Beverly Clearly, or perhaps, for elementary-schoolers, the author of Holes and the Wayside series, Louis Sachar.Fantastic Mr. Fox presents us with the story of Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney), his wife, Felicity (Meryl Streep), and their twelve-year-old son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). Mr. Fox is having a difficult time remaining collective since, well, he's a wild fox. Being that the tree that live in is very close to factories run by strict farmers and Mr. Fox has urges that desperately need to be fulfilled, him and his pal, Kylie Sven Opposum (Wallace Wolodarsky) decide they should try and steal produce from their farm. This becomes a recurring habit, and eventually leads to a war between the farmers and the burrowing foxes.The film is occupies a delightful elegance in its stop motion animation. Its characters, right down to the fur on their backs, are animated with rich and inviting colors, as well as the sets they live in clearly being meticulously detailed. The style is primitive and great to look at, and provides us with a different form of animated entertainment instead of Pixar, Dreamworks, and Disney monopolizing the field.One positive is that the film doesn't become buried under its own quirkiness so much so that we care little about the characters, which tends to happen in many of Wes Anderson's other pictures. What we have is a solid script, taken a step further than usual, along with big name actors subtly providing the voices behind these characters, so as not to throw in our face what big stars the movie has, and we continue to care for the foxes in this film, even when they do get into deep cuss.Voiced by: George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Eric Chase Anderson, Bill Murray, and Owen Wilson.

Whilst it does deviate from the source material, the story is still fairly true to the book, and even though it is a family film, there is still the snappy and witty dialogue that Wes Anderson films are famous for.It's worth adding that the contemporary soundtrack is excellent and the voice cast is A-Class and brilliant as you would expect!

It was keeping up with the source material while expanding upon it. Not to mention that it has some really adult humor which is done very well it can give you chuckles and laughs. It also has some touching moments involving Mr. Fox and his family. The pacing is very good and never has a dull moment and the music score from Alexandre Desplat (who composed the music for The Golden Compass and would later compose the last two Harry Potter films along with DreamWorks' Rise of the Guardians) fits the atmosphere of the film. The directing from Wes Anderson is perfect and the editing is very sharp.The stop motion animation provides some very good visual designs and character models along with some neat expressions. And last but not least, the voice work which by far is great. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, Michael Gambon, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, and Jason Schwartzman (who would later star in Netflix's Klaus in 2019) provide some unique personalities to their own characters while delivering the comedic moments very well.Overall, after a decade has passed, Fantastic Mr. Fox is not only one of the best stop motion animated features, but it's also one of the best Roald Dahl adaptations. Such a shame it didn't do very well at the box office because this is worth recommending to others. Go check it out! :)",

I watched Fantastic Mr. Fox at least 5 times and every time I'll notice one or two more things that I didn't notice before. The camera work is just a wonder to behold as well. Wes Anderson manages to get right down in the middle of these sets were most stop motion movies don't get. Also, many zooms and face shots are used for the characters which most stop motion movies steer clear of.The script is amazing as well. So many clever lines and jokes are interspersed throughout the dialog. Also, there are many clever analogies and points made about society and human/animal nature. Having animals behave like humans can't help but make the viewer think about how like animals humans really are when you come right down to it.Every character in Fantastic Mr. Fox is interesting and amazingly well voice acted.

George Clooney and Jason Schwartzman are particularly brilliant as is their father-son dynamic in the film.I truly have nothing bad to say about this movie and I believe that everyone should see it.

            "content": "I made a conscious decision not to see Fantastic Mr. Fox at the cinema having seen the trailers and thought I wouldn't quite like the style of animation and therefore would not enjoy this, how I was wrong.Mr. Fox (George Clooney) is having trouble settling down to family life after his life of chicken stealing, but when he moves in to his new tree, he finds three villainous farmers as his new neighbours he gets drawn back in for one last job.The stop motion animation works perfectly for this with director Wes Anderson purposely using a slower frame rate to film it in so as your attention is not drawn away from the animation artwork. The tone of the film is excellent mixing humor, and it is quite a funny film, with heartfelt sentiment of a much loved children's book.There were influences of the directors other films, most notably The Royal Tenembuams with the dysfunctional family and Mr Fox's struggle to find common ground with his son Ash (Jason Swartzman). Watch out for former Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker's cameo halfway through with a brilliant musical highlight, I also thought the use of blueberries to take out guard dogs was particularly in genius.An animation of a children's book this may be but I cannot see a child taking any thing from this as it is largely an adult affair. Over all an excellent, humorous adaptation of a Roald Dahl classic.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's adaptation of Roahl Dahl's book of the same name casts aside the CGI animation of Pixar for some old-school stop-motion animation. It tells the familiar story of the cheeky Mr. Fox (voiced with the usual charm of George Clooney) who leaves his days of stealing chickens behind him to marry Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) and settle down with their newly born son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). After buying up some new property that is situated near the land of Boggis, Bunce and Bean, three farmers with a terrible reputation, Mr. Fox is tempted into his old ways. He plans the heist of the century (in fox terms) to hit each farm individually without getting a scratch, aided by his lovable-but- dumb friend Badger (Bill Murray), and eventually his visiting nephew and natural athlete Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson).When the farmers discover what Mr. Fox is up to, Franklin Bean (Michael Gambon) unites the three and plans a revenge attack on Fox's burrow. Soon, Mr. Fox has to team up with his own gang of rather hopeless animals to escape the tractors that have begun digging up their home. They also have to face Bean's cider-loving, knife-wielding, finger- snapping bodyguard Rat (Willem Dafoe). Feeling guilty for the situation he has placed his family and friends into, Mr. Fox must come up with a plan to defeat the persistent farmers.Anderson's sense of humour that has been so present in his previous films is in full flow here. Clooney can deliver a quirky line like no other actor working in cinema today and his time working with the Coen brothers have clearly paid off. Mr. Fox is selfish, cocky and obnoxious, but with Clooney behind the microphone he is a completely lovable character. The quirkiness is upped by the presence of Anderson regulars Murray and Schwartzman, whose personalities shine through the animation and give their clay characters an important human feel. Michael Gambon also has a field day voicing the sadistic and psychopathic Bean, who in his own way is absolutely hilarious.Anderson's decision to go with stop-motion animation adds a nostalgic edge to the film. The book is clearly beloved to the director, and to many people who have read this or any of the number of children's classics by Roahl Dahl. I remember reading Matilda, James And The Giant Peach and The BFG as a child in school and being fascinated and enthralled, and Fantastic Mr. Fox brought those memories back. Of course, the film's sense of humour is not in tone with the book, but the overall feel and charm of the film really captures the spirit of Dahl's books. The opening heist has Mr. Fox ingeniously navigate his way through a farmyard in the style of Super Mario Brothers. It is super- charged, throwing reason and continuity out the window for the sake of having some immature fun, and it works.Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, Anderson's two greatest films, were two of the best American comedies to come out in recent years, and Fantastic Mr. Fox adds something different and equally impressive to an already-impressive CV. It also cements his status as a director whose films you can always look forward to. The film's giddiness and unashamed childishness elevates the film, and it's nice to see a children's story adapted without the need for flashy effects or feeling the need to darken the tone. Highly recommended.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "It's interesting to see the treatment that this story has been given. I think that if I'd been making it, I probably would have gone more along lines of 'The Snowman' (1982) and 'Father Christmas' (1992), but that is purely based on the small fractured elements I can remember of it from my childhood. My Mother used to keep reading after I fell asleep, so I probably missed quite a lot of it.It also seems quite unusual for it to have been made with stop-motion animation, especially when you consider when it was released. The style feels quite old fashioned in a world of CGI, but I wish there was more of it. Give me more Wallace & Gromit! Make Bob The Builder, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam proper again!I can't wait for viewers and filmmakers alike to realise that everything has balance and that their is room for all animation styles. The Oscars will have to have categories for Claymation films, Cartoons, CGI and Stop Motion because there will be so much variety and they will all be good and the world will be a better place of happy kids films with morals!Other than that, it's really not quite the way that I remember it. It's definitely got Wes Anderson's stamp on it and I don't mind that at all. There are some very clever bits, funny quirks and oddments and the characters personalities have all been carefully thought out, not to mention the superb voice acting from a stellar cast.It is quite cute in its way, if a little radicalised, but I just don't know how I feel about it.They have modernised it well and I like the way they say \"Cuss\" instead of actually cussing, but then there are also some slightly scary elements too, especially Bean, played too brilliantly by Michael Gambon.I think perhaps that like a lot of Wes' films, you need to be in the right frame of mind to watch them and with the right company. When I first watched 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' (2014) with friends I was in hysterics, but on its second viewing with the Mothership, it didn't seem to hit the same notes.Maybe this one would be more fun if I was watching with a younger audience, although mature would never be a word that I would use to describe my Mother or her filmic tastes.As I am in turmoil about my thoughts on this film, it has made it hard to score. It is almost in a category of it's own and certainly difficult to compare to the collection of films that I have on my list.I know I don't hate it, but I can't confirm that I liked it either, it's a tad Marmite like that.502.02/1000.",

George Clooney is the voice of Mr. Fox and his wife, Felicity(Meryl Streep) get caught in a trap while stealing from a farm. He then becomes a newspaper writer, and moves his family to a house at the base of a tree, despite the warnings of his lawyer Badger(Bill Murray). The tree is close to the farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, three very mean and ambitious men. After Fox steals food from their farms, they shoot at him but only blow his tail off. They also remove the tree above his den with a bulldozer. They wait at the entrance with guns for the animals to come out, and nearing starvation, Fox digs tunnels to the farms and takes more food. The farmers flood the tunnels and Fox and his neighbors are forced to live in a sewer. The battle with the farmers continues and Clooney's Mr. Fox leads the opposition to the very end. The animation is excellent, and although I' m not the biggest fan of cartoons, I was amused by The Fantastic Mr. Fox.",

            "content": "Fantastic is the operative word in director Wes Anderson's adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic, Fantastic Mr. Fox. The film tells the story of Mr. Fox, who gave up his life of stealing chickens to settle down with his wife, Mrs. Fox, and start a family, but when Mr. Fox relapses into his criminal ways 12 fox-years later, everything just busts loose. What the cuss! The film is a marvelous piece of stop-motion animation. Where as we all have seen stuff like Wallace and Grommet, and many have seen Nightmare Before Christmas, the stop-motion in this film is so much more clever, charming, and lovable as a form of artistic expression than any other example of the form. One moment in particular, Mr. and Mrs. Fox's conversation in front of the underground waterfall is simply breathtaking, but not only that, the design of the furry animals in the film are just so cute and adorable.The animation is brought to life, thanks to the terrific voice-acting from the likes of George Clooney and Meryl Streep as Mr. and Mrs. Fox, but it is Jason Schwartzman that steals the show as their misunderstood son, Ash, who simply wants to be an athlete and win his dads approval. In many ways, the film is like all Wes Anderson films, in that it is all about family dynamics, except this time relaying those dynamics to the entire family community. You can't help but love to see Bill Murray's Badger get in an argument with George Clooney's Mr. Fox, and the great cousin rivaly between Ash and Kristofferson (Eric Anderson), is absolutely hilarious.While Wes Anderson has made many films, this one is his finest. It includes all of the stuff that I have always enjoyed about his works, such as the dynamic of the dysfunctional family, but it sheds itself of all that has held me back in his previous works; not to mention, his typical absurdities tend to work far better in the realm of fantastical animation than it does in live-action.This really is a wonderful family film. It is easily accessible, and in many ways, it's like the old school Warner's cartoons that I used to watch when I was little, very slapstick, but also witty with fantastic dialogue. The film is fantastical in all respects, it never takes itself seriously, and that is why it works, cause even when it gets serious, Anderson pulls back and delivers some humor. When the credits roll on Fantastic Mr. Fox, you will have had such a good time at the movies, that you wont even realize how much time has passed and you will be dancing along with the characters.I give Fantastic Mr. Fox a 10 out of 10!",

The animation is well done; it's a pity that the rest of the movie isn't very good.The story is an Americanized run-of-the-mill heist story, pretty dull and uninspiring. It's hard to understand who the target audience was; the story is made up of (among other things): marriage problems, references to Mrs. Fox's mating behavior, planning a heist, and other adult topics. The characters cuss by using the word \"cuss\" that seems innocent on the surface but once \"cuss\" is being used in the context of cuss words, it just becomes a cuss word itself. Definitely not something that I'd want my kid to watch but it's also boring and uninteresting to me - if I want to watch an action movie, I won't reach for this one.I like George Clooney in general but his bored \"Ocean's Eleven\" voice is badly miscast and is a net negative for the movie. The other voices aren't significantly better even though the voice case is decent.The whole thing is unremarkable - the animation style could've been used to make an interesting, funny movie but this one isn't it. I'd suggest looking for something else.",

Yes children can watch it but the screenplay was absolutely genius, they just wouldn't appreciate it. This was hilarious. Me laughing on multiple occasions is a rare achievement for any film, trust Wes Anderson and his quirky quirkiness to win me over. This is easily one of his strongest films, both in script and technical direction. His style is so unique and inventive that it's hard not to admire it. His centralisation of characters or objects in shots are just innovative, forcing the audience to become absorbed with what's on screen. Plenty of direct address to entice the viewer which I'm sure the younger audience will appreciate. But this screenplay. Genius. Masterful. Quotable. So many nice touches like substituting curse words with the word \"cuss\". Might go over children, but damn it made me laugh. \"What a cluster-cuss\". Ha! Only Anderson could pull that off in an animation. Every character had a unique and creative personality. Mr Fox was sly and suave, his son Ash was eccentric, nephew Kristofferson was perfect in every way, heck even Mrs Fox had some personality...she's a fully independent woman *click fingers in zig zag formation*. The voice casting choices were spot on. Clooney has that suave voice that suited Mr Fox, Streep has the power behind her voice for Mrs Fox. Schwartzman was the stand out, his line execution ensured laughter from viewers...so good! The only criticism I have is the soundtrack, some of the songs just didn't work for me and I think an original score would've suited the animation better. Oh, the stop motion work was tremendous. It's a dying art, so I can fully appreciate the time spent on a project like this. Overall, this took me by surprise. Honestly. I think older viewers will actually find more enjoyment due to the adventurous script. Can't wait to watch it again.",

            "content": "Roald Dahl is an incredible children's author and his books are very British affairs, with a bit of his Norwegian backgrounds and legends thrown in. So it was worry that one of his novels was being turned into a American film, with an American director and cast. But fortunately it is a good film.Mr. Fox (George Clooney) is a successful hunter and poacher of farm animals and he has amazing abilities avoiding traps. But when his wife, Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) is pregnant, Mr. Fox gives up his hunting ways for his family. Two Years later (twelve fox years), Mr. Fox is bored with his life so decides to go for one last big score, robbing the three meaning farmers in the valley, Boggis, Bunce and Bean. But by robbing them Bean (Michael Gambon) leads the farmers one a hunt, doing everything they can to kill Mr. Fox and his family. Whilst this adventure and heist is going on, Mr. Fox's son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) develops a rivalry with his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) because of his intelligence and athletic ability and Mr. Fox ending up favouring him over his own son.The director Wes Anderson is one of the darlings of American indie cinema. He wrote and shot Fantastic Mr. Fox almost like an indie film, particularly the family drama about a son trying to prove himself to his father and a man (or this case a fox) having to fight against his nature. The way some of the sequences are shot and move reminded me of classic platformer games, particularly Sonic the Hedgehog and the undergrounds scenes showing the network of tunnels was like the first version of Worms.Fantastic Mr. Fox works as a heist film with Mr. Fox coming up with plans to rob the farmers, who is arrogant about his abilities and ignores his family because of his exploits. They is a lot of humour in the film involving the lines and dialogue and some visual gags: but this was not a film that does not have as much appeal to young children as it should have. There are still gags that children will like though. A running gag in the film is Bean giving orders over a walkie-talkie. There is a fight between Mr. Fox and Rat (Willem Dafoe) which was skilfully done when they are jumping up in the air in the darkness with lightening flashing so it was quick still images.The animation style is style and on the trailers it did look weak. But it worked in the film; the designs of all the animals and humans are detailed and I do have a soft-spot for stop-motion animation. Stop-motion allows for more real world physic and detailed characters and set designs, like the painting of the badgers. The movement is fluid, like in the platformer style sequences, but other scenes were crude and not that well done, like the digging, the flooding and the dancing looked like a student film working on a limited budget . One thing I also don't understand is why the animals are American (i.e, opossums and beavers) let the town looks like an old fashioned English town.Wes Anderson shot the film almost like a live action film, obviously directing how he knows best. It just small touches like the way the camera zooms into towards a face or the wide shots, giving the film a extra in it's cinematography.There is an excellent voice cast and both Wes Anderson and Spike Jonze with Where the Wild Things Are actually got their voice actors together and performed the film and get a more natural performance out the actors. The traditional way is for the actor to stand in a room and say the line in about 25 different ways with the director and editor picks the best version. Many of the actors in Fantastic Mr. Fox are natural comic performances and many of them had good chemistry. Clooney leads the film well and Bill Murray and Wallace Wolodarsky had a very good, funny supporting roles.Finally there is a good soundtrack in this film, with songs from the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, to banjo music and the playful score by Alexandre Desplat.",

            "content": "I've noticed that ever since The Nightmare before Christmas was released in 1993, no entirely stop-motion or claymation film (intended for children) has received mostly negative reviews. This year there were two films of this type and each will probably be nominated for an Oscar. All of these projects span multiple years and each leaves a unique legacy. Coraline, the other stop-motion film this year, was the first to be filmed entirely in 3-D. Even though nearly two decades have passed, directors can still focus on one aspect of the production at the sake of the others. Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox is the first of its type to be dialog-heavy.Anderson is as much an auteur as Burton and likewise indulges himself too much. At times, the cast of this film could be transplanted to The Royal Tenenbaums. His formula has proved itself over three films now as financially viable and clever enough to attract a sizable home audience. I won't discredit him yet, but none of his movies have left me with a lasting satisfaction. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a sumptuous candy bar of a movie. One to cherish while partaking but unfortunately one that aggravates if too much is ingested.The story begins with Mr. Fox's maudlin recollection of his previously thrilling life. He has been reduced to living in a bloody hole and working as a journalist. He longs to return to his days as a chicken thief and live a more prestigious life. The family reluctantly agrees with his suggestion that they move into a tree, and Mr. Fox begins reliving his past. The targets of his nightly visits are three disgruntled but largely incompetent farmers who vow revenge. The three stooges surround and destroy the Fox residence, but forgot that foxes can dig. As the family flees underground, they encounter their neighbors who have been disturbed by the explosion. After confronting the three farmers in a comedic war, the animals settle in the sewers and live off of grocery wares owned by the three farmers.Anderson couldn't have picked a better voice actor for Mr. Fox. George Clooney's refined masculinity imbues the character with larger than life personality. No matter the situation, Mr. Fox seems to deliver a debonair speech, a timely response, or a pithy comeback. Even other characters acknowledge his superiority by attempting to mimic his mannerisms and catch phrases. I really like how Anderson didn't feel restrained by this literary requirement. Instead, he plays it for many chuckles. Mr. Fox, being the better-than-you person he is, can notice his nephew's talent at thievery is clearly higher than his son's and takes him on missions. The conflict Mr. Fox faces is the reality that he really is fantastic but no one else is. He has to live with his own smugness while still appearing sincere. By the concluding segment, I think Mr. Fox has finally learned at least a pretend humility only hindered by his uncanny ability to get stuff done.2009 has been such as strong year for animated films that I can say that any of the big five potential nominees, including this one, could win without my complaint. Still, I think Fantastic Mr. Fox is the dark horse. The film is marketed as a children's picture but is more suited to adults. Don't hesitate to bring your children to see it. They may relate to Mr. Fox's son's inability to view himself worthy as his father's son or at least enjoy the still unusual animation.",

The movie is lined with a strong cast of acting professionals, ranging from starring roles (George Clooney, Merryl Streep) too supporting roles (Bill Murray) just to name a few. The movie sometimes goes out on a bit of a limb and while most of the time is funny and entertaining there are moments which are just plain annoying.

I'll admit to not being a fan the first time I saw this, years ago, but upon a second viewing (now a parent, watching it with my kids) I can better appreciate it. As I've become more familiar with Mr. Dahl since that time, I found the author's calling cards more obvious, a close match for the director's idiosyncratic directing style and obsessive attention to detail.Stuffed with small character moments and a warm, soft pace, it operates with an unusual cadence that takes time and effort to accept. The voice acting is star-studded and mostly effective, particularly George Clooney's turn as the smooth-talking lead with a taste for one last heist, though the actors do often get caught up by the constant long-winded, dry, breathless dialog. Many supporting players sound positively bored by that process. The animation fits the tone quite well, using stop-motion puppets that closely resemble a set of well-loved kids' toys, and that helps give the screen a familiar, welcoming atmosphere. Like walking through the door to your old childhood bedroom, twenty years on. It's a worthwhile alternative to today's louder, flashier fare.",

George Clooney was perfect as the slightly shady, endlessly charismatic lead, Willem Dafoe has a great cameo as one of the villains and everyone else's performance seems to key off that energy. I re-watched The Life Aquatic With Zissou a few months back and enjoyed it much more on my second viewing, which is consistent with most of Anderson's movies for me, and fully expect this one to get better with repeat viewings, as well. Even bearing that in mind, it was mostly charming and truly entertaining as a goofball throwback to the old school the first time through.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's adaptation of Roald Dahl's book is clever, audacious, and a lot of fun. Shot using stop animation, this one-of-a-kind movie has the elegance of both The Nightmare before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach with the quirkiness you'd expect from an Anderson film. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray lend distinctive voices to a witty, delicious script.Mr. Fox (Clooney) is an unrepentant thief until he makes a promise to Mrs. Fox (Streep) that he'll quit for good (after he informs him that she's pregnant) if they escape a farmer's trap. They do, and he makes good on the promise, moving the family from their underground home to an isolated tree near three vicious, desperate super farmers. But it's not long before Mr. Fox is pining to pull off One More Job, which turns into several more jobs, with the help of Kylie the opossum.However, the three farmers aren't your typical placid farmfolk, they're vengeful jerks, so after Mr. Fox makes off with much of their birds and cider, they vow revenge, which includes using a backhoe to remove not only the tree but also a huge chunk of the earth.There's also an interesting subplot involving Mr. Fox's son Ash (Schwartzman), who feels that his parents think he's worthless and that he can't possibly compete with the super-debonair Mr. Fox. Ash is at that awkward age anyway, so dealing with his famed dad isn't easy. Then, on top of that, Ash's cousin Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) arrives for an extended stay, and he's perfect in virtually everything. So poor Ash can't measure up to his dad OR his cousin.What makes this movie really work, though, is the magnificent animation style. We've all seen those old Rankin-Fitch Christmas classics, right? This is sort of like that, only even more stylized and fluid. The film was shot at a rate of 12 frames per second, rather than the standard 24, so that viewers could really see the actual stop-motion animation process itself. And the result is that the movie feels more organic, more natural, and more poetic.A Wes Anderson movie is usually oddly endearing anyway, but this one is exceptional in its uniquity. The set pieces are dazzling (for example, the hair on the humans is from actual human hair, from the movie's crew), and the backgrounds are meticulous works of art. Neat trivia: Mr. Fox's study is a faithful recreation of Roald Dahl's garden hut, where he wrote most of his beloved books.It's fun seeing Clooney in a role he's best suited to anyway, the devilish rogue. (One gets the feeling sometimes that he'd really like to be James Bond.) Mr. Fox is certainly not without his flaws (need for spotlight, need to be right, delusions of grandeur), but his heart belongs to his family and to the other woodland creatures. The characters are nuanced just enough for kids to grasp their intentions and attitudes while not being too simplistic for adults to enjoy.",

It's always delightful, and very well voice-acted by the likes of George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Michael Gambon. A fox/father decides to settle down, stop stealing chickens and become a respectable newspaperman, but hitting a mid life crisis the part of him that longs to steal birds can't be denied one last big heist, which leads to ever more dire (and funnier) consequences. I liked the film on first viewing, but found I loved it on the second. First, for film fans, or fans of Anderson's work, it's hysterical how he has translated his personal style, both visual and character, to animation. This looks and feels like his other films in a way that is by itself an absolute crack-up. But more important it turns out that Anderson and Dahl are a great mix, with Dahl's great imagination taking Anderson's cock-eyed view of life, and expanding it to a broader canvas. In the end, while populated by puppet animals, this is as human, touching and funny as almost anything Anderson has done. It may be too sophisticated for little kids, but any child advanced enough to enjoy Dahl's books (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, etc.) should have a grand old time, along with their parents.",

Written and directed by Wes Anderson, this movie is obviously quirky, but not in an unsettling way. It is very witty and I found its sense of humor refreshing for an animated film. It doesn't have to be vile, but has a very adult humor to it. There are many child-friendly replacements such as \"the disloyal lab partner\" and \"what the cuss\" and \"beagle ticks\". It was clever, but didn't run completely on shock value. I admire that in a script. George Clooney and Meryl Streep obviously do a great job with the voice acting, but I was surprised that Streep had a relatively secondary role. The characters are very easy to relate too. (And yes, I know they're animals). Ash is the awkward son who is trying to find his place in the world. His jealousy of his \"perfect\" cousin, Kristofferson, provides a good B-storyline. Mr. Fox is the former-thief who doesn't like the concept of settling down. His wife (who I originally thought was the tragic, stereotypical housewife) can still kick butt. This is one of those movies you have to watch twice before you can warm up to it, but it's definitely worth it. 8/10",

I'll start with the flaws of the film. I watched this film in 3 parts, considering it was about 90 minutes, about 30 mins a part, and the second part did prove to be a bit of a drag. It was slow, it had some cliche moments, and much of it had been done before in other similar movies. I also didn't really care for the conflict storyline between Kristofferson and Ash, and really just felt like it detracted from the film and its story. Besides that though, the film was pretty fun to watch. The visuals are incredibly intricate and well done, the cinematography is excellent, and the stop motion animation is quite detailed and unique making for a very fun visual feast. The film also proves to be quite quirky with how it presents itself, in perfect Wes Anderson style, and has some really funny jokes I enjoyed much more now than I did as a kid. In the end, Fantastic Mr. Fox isn't my favorite animated flick, nor my favorite from Wes Anderson, but its parts are more charming than not and its visual style is impressive enough on its own to stand as a rather unique and memorable little movie.My Rating: 7.3/10.",

The writing is a very dry humor, it's not obvious at all, which is the kind of humor I love, some very young children may not quite understand all the lines and the comedy in them since it's not obvious humor, but older kids and adults certainly will. I don't get to see this kind of animation a lot, but I'm so glad this well made film used this kind because it's very fascinating to look at. The film switches between the animals and what they're doing to the humans and what they are plotting to do about the animals. Young children will like the action related scenes, and the older kids/adults will love the dialogue exchanges and the clever script. 10/10 for Fantastic Mr. Fox! Flawless animated film.",

            "content": "\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is the story of the titular Mr. Fox, his family, his stealing shenanigans and his rivalry with the three notorious farmers from whom he stole. This film is an adult version of a children's story by Roald Dahl, as interpreted by American director/writer Wes Anderson. It was interpreted in rather old-fashioned-looking, almost monochromatic (orange-yellow-brown) stop-motion animation. The attention of my sons were not held by the slow beginning and by all the talking. My daughter was not even interested to watch it at all.I, on the other hand, quite enjoyed it. The dialogue is funny and witty, and very adult. There is even a hilarious attempt to hide all profanity with the word \"cuss\". I do not really like stop-animation movies (like \"Gumby\" or \"Wallace and Grommit\"), but their pain-stakingly detailed efforts are appreciated.George Clooney definitely inhabits the character of Mr. Fox. He appropriately channeled Danny Ocean, especially in light of the heists that Mr. Fox was pulling, complete with smug attitude. Meryl Streep portrays Mrs. Felicity Fox. I felt there was nothing really special about it. Any actress could have done it just as well. Apparently the supporting cast is composed of actors who are staples of Wes Anderson films like Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, etc. I particularly liked how Murray voiced Attorney Badger.I read an excerpt of \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" from the Roald Dahl book that we had. It turns out while the main characters and the stealing capers are similar, the rest of the movie (like the cousin rivalry, among others) is entirely Wes Anderson. I had never seen a Wes Anderson movie before, although I had long heard of his work like \"Rushmore\" or \"The Royal Tenenbaums\". But after watching \"Mr. Fox,\" I think I will check them out.",

            "content": "A pleasurable children's film sometimes over-infused with adult sensibilities, \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\" gives us plenty of charm and character, as well as a sense of director Wes Anderson poking a little fun at himself as noted art-house auteur.Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a retired fowl-thief who feels rather restricted by his new life as a newspaper columnist. When he moves to a new tree with his wife (Meryl Streep) and cub Ash (Jason Schwartzman), the prosperous farms of three mean humans prove too fat and juicy for him to ignore. But a life of crime has a downside, even for a fox as fleet and sly as the Fantastic Mr. F.As a director of wit and sophistication, Anderson may seem an unlikely candidate for bringing Roald Dahl's children's novel of forest- animal hi-jinks to screen. But Anderson has always had one foot in the water of lost childhood, and his treatment of the source material is clearly a labor of love.The film also benefits from the stop-action animation employed, giving it the feeling of one of those Rankin/Bass productions from the 1960s and 1970s. The film veers occasionally into twee territory working this vibe, but Anderson's usual directorial style of static compositions and tight close-ups seems a perfect match. At times, Anderson seems to play this up deliberately, pausing on a mealtime scene for one of Anderson's pregnant pauses, followed by the characters devouring their meals in wild-animal mode.The exchanges scripted by Anderson and Noah Baumbach also reflect this congruence:\"They'll kill the children!\"\"Over my dead body they will.\"\"That's what I'm saying, you'll be dead, too, in that scenario.\"\"Well, I'm arguing against that.\"Anderson's predilection for casting more actors than he has parts is evident here, too, but it kind of works. The usual gang of suspects, i. e. Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Wally Wolodarsky, etc., all provide sterling support as various animal characters, while Michael Gambon shines particularly as Mr. Bean, the nastiest of the human farmers.It's a more overtly comical offering than you usually get from Anderson. The school Ash goes to has a sign reading \"Co-Ed, All Species.\" The word \"cuss\" is used as a substitute for a popular profanity, as in \"This is going to be a total cluster-cuss for everybody.\" The humor may play a bit above the heads of little ones at times, but the message of accepting one's differences as strengths rather than weaknesses is cleverly developed. As morals go, it's a pretty good one.So is \"The Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" At its best, which is often, it brings out the kid in you with its easy charm and pervading sense of wonder. It's not Anderson's greatest film, but it shows why he's worth watching.",

Book - Mr fox has 4 cubs, who he loves. Film - one cub who he doesn't appreciate or seem to like. but he has a cousin \"Kristofferson\" - who is this? what a complete re-write!then the cousin gets kidnapped, and Mr fox has to rescue him... would it make more sense if one of his 4 cubs got kidnapped instead?and the other things that aren't in the story.... just feels like Wes Anderson took the book, glanced at it, and then added his own ending, not even reading it. many aspects weren't in the film.Its like having Charlie and the chocolate factory, without the chocolate. Or James and the giant peach without the peach. whats the point in basing a film on a book when you change aspects of it??then there is the cast.. Owen Wilson.. funny guy.. been in some good films recently.. yet for some bizarre reason he has a 1 minute part. probably 2 lines and then he's gone.

            "content": "Wes Anderson has been criticized for his works being too slow, and not funny enough, and for a variety of things. Like all of his other films, this is unmistakably a Wes Anderson film through and through, with offbeat characters, and quietly funny scenes, and subtle character development. This movie is quite subtle in the jokes and in a lot of lines, so children may or may not understand different parts of the film to be funny, but even if they don't they'll be dazzled by the odd, but amazing looking animation.Mr. Fox (George Clooney) has to give up his life as a chicken thief once he finds out Mrs. Felicity Fox (Meryl Streep) is pregnant. Two human years later he's working as a newspaper columnist to feed his wife and his not so athletic son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). Mr. Fox, being the wild animal that he is, grows tired of his mundane life and along with his buddy Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky), he begins robbing farms again, which angers three farmers who are dead set on killing Mr. Fox. Meanwhile, Fox's athletic nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) moves in and makes Ash jealous. Chaos ensues throughout.This movie's animation style is a style of it's own. It's stop motion animated, and has that extra dimension because of this, but instead of making all kinds of wide sets to put the characters on, everything is flat. This movie at times resembles a traditionally drawn cartoon, because of it's flat animation. That sounds like a bad thing, but it is actually very unique and great to look at. The sets and the characters and everything just look amazing.Character development is subtle...especially to kids. It will definitely either be very subtle or fly over kids' heads altogether. One scene Ash in mean to Kristofferson because he's jealous, and they bond silently over the running of a toy train. It's a sweet scene, but again development is quiet and implied. Another scene (not giving away any spoilers here), where the simple response of a creature after a long speech is to raise it's arm in an agreeing manner, is also quiet but meaningful.Problems with this movie range from some bouts of \"humorous\" dialogue that aren't overly hilarious, to strange character quirks that have you puzzled until the end, but it's still a well done, original and entertaining family film. Director/writer Wes Anderson did a good job writing like himself but keeping the Roald Dahl touch in there.My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins.

No. However, with a better script, they might have made for a good eclectic counterpoint.The script is the problem. It was obviously considered \"cute\" to add a a whole lot of \"fake\" swearing. And by that I mean using \"cuss\" instead of that four-letter expletive beginning with f. But these cuss-es are plain irritating to me (a Brit). Even more so when Michael Gambon says them. The Americanization of the story is akin to putting a giant yellow M on Big Ben. If you're an American, you may not care about this - YMMV.If this had been an original story - not an adaptation - and without Cuss-Gate, it would be another WA masterpiece to add to the collection.

When I found out further that it was to be an animated adaptation of Roald Dahl's book,'The Fantastic Mr.Fox',I was doing cerebral back flips. Wes Anderson directs a screen play written by Anderson & Noah Baumbach (The Squid & The Whale),based on the book by Roald Dahl (Charlie & The Chocolate Factory,James & The Giant Peach,etc.). The story concerns the afore mentioned Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney),who finds out from his life partner ,Mrs.Fox (Meryl Streep,last seen in 'Julie & Julia',and currently in 'It's Complicated') that she's expecting a fox pup,in a farmer's steel trap & promises if they get out,he would renounce his evil ways & make a nice life for both of them. Problem is,some years later,he gets the old itch to go out & kill chickens & steal food. In the tradition of the 'Oceans' series,he schemes one more heist from the local farmers. Problem is,one heist turns into another & another,until things get out of control. Besides George Clooney & Meryl Streep,the likes of Anderson regular,Jason Schwartzman,Bill Murray,Owen Wilson,as well as the likes of Michael Gambon,Willem Dafoe, & even Wes Anderson,himself, lend their voices to this fun little film that despite the wave of 3D-CGI animation,instead settles for old school stop motion animation (the same kind of animation used for Gumby,Wallace & Gromit,and others),which,although not the best stop motion animation I've seen,is still worth seeking out. Rated PG by the MPAA,this film serves up some occasionally harrowing action scenes,some suggested rude talk (the characters substitute the word \"curse\" for the real thing),and a bit of smoking & drinking by the humans in the story.",

            "content": "Like the pairing of Werner Herzog and Nic Cage in the new Bad Lieutenant movie, the combination of director Wes Anderson and writer Roald Dahl seems, in hindsight, like a no-brainer. Peanut butter and jam, scotch and soda. Fantastic Mr. Fox, Anderson's stop-motion adaptation of Dahl's beloved book of the same name seems from its opening frames to be an absolute classic. It's one of the best films of the year, if not the best, and more fun by miles than anything I've seen in years.George Clooney and Meryl Streep voice Mr. and Mrs. Fox, who move into a new tree-home near the farms of three cruel farmers. Their son, the diminutive Ash (Jason Schwartzman) is dismayed at both his inability to match the legendary athletic prowess of his dashing father and at the arrival of a cousin, Kristofferson (Eric Anderson). Mr. Fox, who gave up life as a chicken thief when he married, is drawn back into a life of fox-crime, but his actions have repercussions when farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean (Robin Hurlstone, Hugo Guinness and Michael Gambon) seek retribution and lay siege to Fox's den.Anderson's films from Bottle Rocket through The Royal Tennenbaums and The Life Aquatic have followed a pretty linear progression as he's become more and more the auteur: heavily stylized (to the point in his recent work of distraction) ensemble pieces about smart, odd, fracturing middle-class families, with rock music from the '60's. The problem is that as his work has progressed, it has gotten harder and harder to read his characters as in any way authentically human. That is not to say that his later films suffer in comparison, just that they're so heavily stylized and so odd that while they're dazzling displays of cohesive style and wit and meticulous planning, they lack the ram-shackle humanist charm that made his early films stand out. His later films seem less about humans than weird human simulacra that live in a weird sea-going commune or in a New York with a 375th St. YMCA.In the stop-motion animated world of Mr. Fox Anderson's stylistic quirks lose their distancing surreality and become instead marvels, utter naturalistic joys. It's a sublime pairing, and it highlights what has always been Anderson's true strength: his writing. It's funny, scary and moving, and like Dahl's work it retains its feel of coming intact from kid-land with all of the loopiness and anarchic joie-de-vivre that entails. Hilariously funny and with as much depth as any grown-up film made this year, it's not just fun and funny, it's a spectacularly well-made film. 9.2/10.",

This is the only other film from Wes Anderson that I consider to be a masterpiece. All of his movies are great but this one really wowed me! And this is my favorite from him, and my seventh favorite movie of all time.\nIt's the closest that a movie has gotten to looking like a story book. More-so than Watership Down. This is due to the fact that this was the first time Wes Anderson presented his signature doll-housey style. Wes Anderson was faithful to Roald Dahl's book. And it's stop-motion animation.How Wes Anderson directed this movie was extremely clever. They didn't have the actors perform in booths. They had them outside using real farming equipment, etc.The animation is beautiful!Classic songs and songs made for the film help with the tone and are used well!The attention to detail is absolutely insane!The voice acting is amazing!The production design is flawless!The humor is clever!The characters are likable and memorable.The casting choices are perfect!The story is self-contained and simple but very fun!Even though the movie doesn't take it self seriously it produces genuine emotion, which is very impressive.And it flies by!\nThe reason why this is my favorite from him is because Willem Dafoe is my second favorite actor, even though this is Wes Anderson's first animated film, he pulled it off extraordinarily well. And foxes are my favorite animal.\nWes Anderson is truly one of the best directors working today, and is one of my personal favorites.",

            "content": "I'll preface this review of Wes Anderson's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" by stating that I'm not really much of a fan of Mr. Anderson's films. For those who enjoy his work, though, this, despite being a bit of a departure, contains much of interest.The story (based on a Roald Dahl children's book) concerns the exploits of a group of anthropomorphic animals, principally a family of foxes. Mr. Fox is a reformed thief who's grown bored of his sedate lifestyle and is hankering for one last job. However, when he formulates a plan and puts it into practise he soon finds that the retaliation may be more than he can handle.George Clooney plays Mr. Fox and, while he does a good job, I have a thing against animated characters being voiced by instantly recognizable actors. In contrast, Meryl Streep & Jason Schwartzman are more reasonable choices and they both give good readings, especially Schwartzman, who gives the film's best performance in my opinion. Apart from these individuals, the cast includes Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon and others, all of whom turn in satisfactory performances.The script occupies a strange middle ground between a children's story and a story aimed at adults. Given this fact, I'm not surprised that the film barely made back half it's budget at the U.S. box office. I wouldn't recommend it for kids and I expect that the adult market for animation is pretty limited. Nevertheless, the script is more literate than usual for an American animated film, so therefore a welcome change of pace.Visually, the film is a sight to behold. The use of stop-motion animation sets it apart from most contemporary animated films and I really have to applaud Anderson's direction. Musically, the film is above average as well. Prominent use is made of \"Heroes and Villains\" (The Beach Boys), \"Street Fighting Man\" (The Rolling Stones) and, for the finale, the Bobby Fuller Four gem \"Let Her Dance\". None of it makes much sense in context but it's good to hear nonetheless.Ultimately, I think that \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is a well-made animated film but likely one with a narrow audience. Like Wes Anderson's other films, this one seems like it was made to appeal mainly to fans of Wes Anderson films.",

            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox is an adaptation of a somewhat famous children's book by writer Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was originally written by him). I cannot really say if it's faithful or not (apparently not very much) nor can I say how much it compares to director Wes Anderson's other works (my fan friend says you have lots of his signature touches). However, I can say that it's likely adults will enjoy it more than kids. This is a completely stop-motion picture instead of the more ubiquitous 3d computer graphics showcase. It has a certain retro vibe to it and although it's charming, often funny, you shouldn't expect the animation quality and smoothness of Nightmare Before Christmas or Coraline. The jerkiness is especially noticeable when the animals are dancing. However, the faces and the (constantly moving) fur are especially well done. Actually, I suspect the many close-up shots were used to save on the animation costs of animating the whole puppet. Most importantly, the whole movie using real puppets, props and decors has a solid \"realness\" quality to it often absent from 3d graphics. Enough about that. How's the story ? Quite delightful and entertaining with personable characters and bundles of dry and awkward humor that actually works. The running gag of the opossum making swirly eyes when he gets confused never gets old. I also enjoyed variations on the word cuss used profusely instead of the famous f word. The voice acting is top-notch and George Clooney is a perfect fit for the suave and charismatic Mr. Fox. You'll notice his voice but you won't notice most of the other famous voices unless you're a big Wes Anderson fan. The dialogue is very fine and the choice of music is surprising, appropriate and good. Fantastic Mr. Fox is pretty fantastic and because of the way it was made and looks, this might age quite well and become a future classic. Whatever you do, don't let the fact that it's supposed to be a \"kid's movie\" deter you from watching it. For interested parents, it's not overtly violent although there's poultry killing (heard, not shown) and beyond the amusing antics, it even has some morale (but doesn't hit you over the head with it).

The Blu-ray makes the most of the brilliant colours, minutely perfect detail, gorgeous surround sound and wonderful music (including The Rolling Stones to great effect). The voice actors Clooney, Streep, Murray and Gambon all turn in gifted performances. A valuable bonus is the extra 45 minutes of video which detail several aspects of the creation of the film - which makes the viewer value every second on the screen as part of two years of dedicated craftsmanship by a huge team of artists. I like that Wes Anderson has added a new prequel and sequel to Roald Dahl's original book, and that the resulting seamless \"trilogy\" has warmed the heart of Roald's widow (who appears in most of the bonus feature segments on the Blu-ray).",

            "content": "For some reason everything Wes Anderson does seems so off-beat yet so calculated, it has the same amount of the dreaded \"quirkiness\" and charm as other films, it just feels so forced and worst of all at times fake.In saying that this is his best film since Bottle Rocket.I hated The Royal Tenenbaums for the F-word above, liked Rushmore more for what it wanted to be (and perhaps what I wanted it to be), and thought The Life Aquatic a spectacular failure that had potential greatness somewhere in it - if that even makes sense.(As an aside I also watched The Darjeeling Limited and liked it, but didn't feel passionate about it enough in any one direction to have an opinion on it.)Now given that we have a director who wants to peddle charm and quirkiness in equal and liberal amounts, what better setting than the re-telling of a children's story about a cast of human-like animals told in stop motion animation?If you can come up with a more ideal scenario please tell me, I can't do it. (Better yet tell Wes Anderson!)George Clooney is (not yet Fantastic) Mr Fox.His Mrs Fox is Meryl Streep. - His lawyer-badger is Bill Murray. - (Later) His son Ash is Jason Schwartzmann.Sounds good already don't it?Early in proceedings Mr & Mrs Fox are a huntin' chickens, only a near miss caused Mrs F to demand that Mr F rethink his career path, as she is preggers.Fast forward 2 years, or as we are told 12 Fox years. >>>>>>>>>>Mr Fox is now a successful local journalist with the a young son and devoted wife, only he feels that living in the ground is somehow beneath him, or at least the ground. He wants some new digs that don't require digging, and after ignoring the sage advice of his lawyer takes residence in a tree near three dangerous-to-animals local farmers. At the same time Ash's cousin Kristofferson comes to stay with the family, which doesn't impress Ash as the newcomer seems superior in every way.While everything seems perfect from the outside, Mr Fox is toey and decides to pull off one last job, or three last jobs if you will, as he sets out to rob from each of the neighbouring farms.So with Kylie the opossum alongside for the lark, Mr Fox does exactly that, and incurs the inevitable wrath that comes with stealing from dangerous farmers.The three farmers band together to eradicate their local pests and his family, firstly with shovels, then ditch-diggers, then explosives, forcing Mr Fox to do something to both save his family, their friends and earn the kudos that come with the title of Fantastic.Stop motion animation is at once strange yet it draws you in with the herky-jerky actions, Wes Anderson obviously had a great time with the device and some of the visuals are hilarious, including a letter scene that involves many animals dancing to celebrate success, and a musical number that is genuinely charming.This is the perfect vehicle for Anderson as some of his dialogue sounds forced and unnatural when coming from a human, but for whatever reason movie-goers are more forgiving when the same intricate dialogue is said by an animal. After all, if we accept that an animal has the capacity for speech, it isn't a stretch to expect them to be witty, urbane and whimsical.Wes Anderson also has a great ear for music, and his films always have memorable and catchy tunes that don't seem to be used in other films, (and always the Rolling Stones. Always.) The music is also cleverly integrated as Mr Fox carries on his person a walkman that he turns on and off with relevant music to support his thoughts or actions.The voice acting thankfully doesn't have the distracting impact of making you think \"Hey, that's Bill Murray\", the dialogue is dry and witty and the puppets (?) spectacularly detailed and well designed.Mr Fox has amazingly long skinny legs and a great clothes designer, and the various animals that they come across are all unique yet faithful to the actual source animal, and for some reason George Clooney's voice coming out of his mouth just seems right.If Wes Anderson has the choice between making self indulgent films like Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic, or making self indulgent films like this, I sincerely hope that he goes down this path. Tim Burton seems to have done exactly that, and despite the awkward Chocolate Factory gaffe he is chugging along nicely.Final Rating \u2013 7 / 10. There is nothing awesome about Fantastic Mr Fox, but I could watch films like this every week and never grow tired of them.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",

However after escaping from a trap, Mrs. Fox told her husband that she doesn't want to steal chickens anymore due to the risk of getting trap became higher than before. Mr. Fox ending up agreeing with his wife that he'll find a new line of work in order for them to start a family. Some years later, Mr. Fox is now a newspaper writer for a column that's not very well received in the paper. Mrs. Fox spends her time doing scenery paintings. They both ended up having a son who tries to become an athlete but is too short to be fitted for sports.Everything seem good for Mr. Fox & his family, only with the exception on his career as a newspaper writer and the fox hole they're living in. So he goes to a real estate agent to check out on a tree that is on sale. The reason being is that it's next door to three big time farms owned by Mr. Boggis, Bunce, & Bean. All three of the farmers don't tolerate with wild animals or carnivores that steal their profits. Mr. Fox asked his lawyer about it, but his lawyer says it's not wise to live next to three wildlife hating farmers. However Mr. Fox ignores his lawyer's advice and has his family move in. While keeping it a secret from his wife, he plots out three plans to steal from each of the three farmers their profits. As it's in a foxes's nature to steal chickens and anything else that's editable. However messing with these three farmers would mean trouble to Mr. Fox and anyone who's connected with him. The farmers on't rest until Mr. Fox is shot and stuffed with cotton. But pretty soon, the farmers will learn that you should never try to out smart a fox.I never read the book, but I gotta say I really enjoyed this movie. For Wes Anderson's first animated film, I love the idea of the whole film made in Stop Motion Animation instead of the now commonly done CGI. That's one of the reasons this movie stands out more than the recently released animated films. I also love the story, action, & character alike. I've seen Wes's other films so I knew this movie was going to have some great moments and at least one memorable quote. Just like what was presented in his previous films. Also it has an all star cast along with people who have worked with Wes in the past.If you're looking for an animated movie that looks better than Planet 51, then Fantastic Mr. Fox is the other choice. Cause this movie is something that both kids and adults will enjoy together. To me it's a movie I'll definitely watch again and again.",

I had seen the new \"Mr. Fox\" animated film two Fridays ago.In this film, Mr. Fox a newspaper columnist living in a den with his landscape-painter wife Felicity and son Ash, wanted to do something big - \"My father died at seven and a half. I don't want to live in a hole anymore, and I'm going to do something about it.\" So he went and bought a tree-house. But his lawyer Mr. Badger warns him not to buy the tree property, because near the area, three very mean,rich farmers Mr. Boggis the chicken farmer as fat as a young male elephant seal because of eating chicken. Short and dumpy Mr. Bunce the goose/duck farmer who eats doughnuts stuffed with goose p\u00e2t\u00e9. And lean Mr. Bean the turkey/apple farmer known also for his alcoholic Apple Cider. Now these farmers are so mean, that the local children would sing a limerick to taunt them : \"Boggis and Bunce and Bean One fat, one short, one lean These horrible crooks So different in looks Were none the less equally mean.\" But despite the warnings, Mr. Fox and his family moved in the tree-house. Then (I think) a week after the move, Felicity's nephew Kristofferson, comes for a visit while his father is ill (with I don't know what). Of course for Ash, it becomes a rivalry issue in athletics and his father's praise. Meanwhile, Mr. Fox ponder over what Badger said. So despite the promise he had made to Felicity years ago (the beginning of the film), he and Kylie the opossum building superintendent, sneak out at night and steal various types of produce and poultry from one farm to another...without his wife knowing, and also three angry farmers out to get him.That's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.

James and the Giant Peach, another Roald Dahl story, was brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation as well back in 1996. Similar to the way that Microsoft took a step backwards by upgrading everyone to the inferior Windows Vista, director Wes Anderson lets this film take a plunge by getting a high-definition camera and taking half the pictures that a fluent stop-motion film would require. This results in staccato movements that distract the audience and sap all the potential magic that could have been in the film. Indeed a lot of mistakes are made in the film. Whatever cleverness that Dahl may have originally written into his story is ruined by the director's idea of an alternate ending and overall an apparent carelessness to the way the film was constructed. I'm not saying the film is complete garbage, some parts do stand out, hinting at how good the original story may have been. But somehow even the clever parts, like the characters saying \"cuss\" when they intend to swear, becomes distracting and even unfriendly towards younger audiences when you realize that the swear it's replacing is the \"f-word\", just shy of them saying \"mothercusser\". Probably the worst stop-motion film I've ever seen, The Fantastic Mr. Fox is in no way fantastic and should be left alone.",

This is not a criticism, it just seemed to me that it had all become a little too 'Americanised' (if that's a word). The stop-motion animation, the sets and everything technical about it was very well done but I felt the characters had lost the mystique they had when I read this as a youngster. I will always now hear George Clooney as Mr. Fox and to me that's all wrong (I explain why later). Here's a very brief summary of the plot, and then some more of my thoughts.Mr. Fox loves to steal chickens, ducks, anything he can eat or drink really. Unfortunately this is a dangerous business and his wife persuades him to find a safer occupation when she falls pregnant. So he takes up writing for a local newspaper. Several years later he decides it's time they moved and so they go to live in the trunk of a tree. This affords him a great view of three local farms, owned by Franklin Bean, Walter Boggis and Nathan Bunce. Unable to resist the temptation he enlists the help of Kylie Sven Opossum and raids all three farms. The farmers aren't going to take this lying down and Mr. Fox and his family, and in fact the whole community, find themselves trapped. Can Mr. Fox find a cunning way to save the day? As usual, my contract with the Spoiler Police prevents me telling you here.I love the animation of this film, I always think stop-motion gives a very unique look and it works really well here. Although I have a slight dislike for the accents, to me Mr. Fox should be a very devious upper class English accent, but hey, you can't always get what you want as the Rolling Stones once said. Anyhow, a decent effort from the voice talents of; George Clooney as Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox, Bill Murray as Badger, Michael Gambon as Franklin Bean and even Jarvis Cocker who gave us a song as Petey.So, in conclusion, visually, it's a treat, I love the look and feel of the film. Plot wise, well it's based on a Roald Dhal story so you can't go too far wrong there. I liked the choice of music in the film, a couple of Beach Boys numbers were very welcome. I think if it wasn't for the voices I would have enjoyed it more, but it's worth seeing for the animation.My Score: 6.9/10",

            "content": "While Fantastic Mr. Fox is quite definitely Wes Anderson's most commercial film so far, it treads the line between Hollywood and art-house surprisingly well, and manages to be an extremely intelligent family movie in the strictest meaning of the term - a movie to be enjoyed by both children and adults, each on a different levels. Kids will enjoy every minute, and adults will enjoy it more because they'll understand it more (watch Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are for a failed attempt at achieving that very balance). With terrific voice talents and wonderful animation, this is one of the most truly enjoyable films I've seen in a long time, and at this point I'd like to point out that I didn't use the word 'fantastic' once in this review; I'd like a reward please.",

The truth is that a fox cannot be happy without a chicken in its teeth. A fox courts danger, hunts prey, outsmarts other predators and has thrilling adventures. This is what a fox is good at. The promise and truth collide as Mr. Fox returns to the wild, carefree days of youth. Worse yet, a trio of vengeful farmers threaten to wipe out an entire community of animals to catch a fox. The animals look to their individual strengths and differences in order to survive.This whimsical, charming and brilliant stop-motion feature is delightful from beginning to end. Each frame is a treasure in terms of artistry, revelations of human (and wild animal) nature, intriguing themes and characters, wry humor, compelling stories and more. There is more going on than appears on the surface. The conflicts are as interesting and revealing as the resolutions. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe and Owen Wilson give voice and life to Roald Dahl's characters. \"It is always more fun,\" says a wiser fox \"when we did it together.\"",

Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and even Willem Dafoe as an evil farmer. They really knew who to pic for this cast. This film really brought me back to a feeling when I was younger and would watch shows animated like this in the mid day. The film gives you a certain joy and happiness in your heart and believe it or not, you feel like you need more. You wouldn't think that a film like this could make you feel excitement, but it will. You truly get an inner energy while watching. The movie is cute, funny and really has a great story. Plus there are little things that happen that make this film more original. The script has many parts when the actor should swear. But instead of swearing, they say the word cuss. So it would be something like this. \"What the cuss do you think you are doing?\" Every time that happened, it made me laugh. Also, remember that they are wild animals. So when the foxes eat, they eat all crazy like. This is a very charming and fun to watch film.",

            "review_title": "'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is cleverly executed",
            "content": "Based on Roald Dahl's children's novel of the same name, Fantastic Mr. Fox is about a thieving fox named Mr. Fox. Once he finds out his wife is pregnant, he sheds his thieving ways, raises a family and becomes a journalist. However, his old habits don't remain dormant for long and he starts to steal chickens, ducks, turkeys, and cider each night from three mean and wealthy farmers--Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Fed up, the farmers decide to try to ambush him with whatever means possible, which causes a lot of grief for his family and friends.Directed and written (based on Dahl's novel) by Wes Anderson (Rushmore), Mr. Fox has been created in the old school tradition of stop motion animation. While the creatures may not look slick and perfect like CG, they have an infectious charm of looking handcrafted, cuddly, and solid. Their facial expressions and their movements have subtleties that give a human touch you don't get with CG.When I was in elementary school, I recall a time when the teacher read us the book. I remember the story being not too complicated. It did, however, make me want to try apple cider\u2014I loved the way the author described it. Here, the plot, dialogue, and characters have been expanded to create a satiric story full of ironic touches, extra details, and modernized. These details really set the mood. The animals are all fully dressed and talk like adults, about their family issues, mortgages, and life decisions. Mr. Fox's family includes his wife Mrs. Fox, his son Ash, and his overachieving nephew, Kristofferson. The family dynamics are fun and almost sitcom-like. I suppose they could have their own TV show. The animal neighbors of Mr. Fox are equally human in their behavior, with a dash of erratic animal wildness thrown in.The three farmers play the bad guys, and while most humans aren't portrayed as complex as the animals, the meaner characters are presented with flourish. Mr. Bean (I think that was the farmer's name), the leader of the farmers, is lean, sinister-looking, covered in shadows, has a pistol in hand and eerily-lit cigarette lighting his face. The music also plays an integral part in creating various moods of the film, including a zany musical number involving banjos, and occasional retro-style soulful vocals. There are also moments that parody other films, such as West Side Story.Anderson's dialogue is clever, and Mr. Fox is quite the spitfire with words. I bet some kids will find the wordiness a little boring (although amusing for us adults). Nevertheless, it is a fun film, something's always happening, and there's plenty of breezy action. It's definitely a lot lighthearted than Where The Wild Things Are (a fine, analytical film, if not particularly focused for the kids). For those who are purists of the source material, they may find this film a little too smug and Mr. Fox too aware of himself for his own good.George Clooney in the voice of Mr. Fox is a perfect fit\u2014in fact, the role must've been tailor-fit for him. One can't imagine anyone else playing Mr. Fox. Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox and Bill Murray as Badger are fun, and Willem Dafoe as Rat (a villain role) is hilarious. Overall, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fun film that is cleverly written and executed, helped by George Clooney's star power and delivery. For some, it may seem like Mr. Fox is constantly winking at the audience, but even those who may not love the film will still find many things to like about it. I give this film *** out of **** stars.You can see more of my review updates on http://twitter.com/d_art",

            "review_title": "It might not quite reach the emotional core of Up but there is still something for everyone in Fantastic Mr. Fox",
            "content": "This animated adaptation of the children's book by Roald Dahl has Mr. Fox (George Clooney) living with his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep) and their moody son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) in a foxhole. Mr. Fox writes a column in the newspaper and provides for his family by regularly stealing chickens from crazy farmers. Yet because he has grown so unsatisfied with his life, he begins to question his own existence. Despite the objections of his lawyer Badger (Bill Murray), Mr. Fox decides to buy a new house on the most dangerous side of the river. Still not content with himself, he endeavours to perform one last master plan of stealing from three of the most dangerous farmers on the land. Through his constant scheming, Mr. Fox neglects Ash, who is desperate to gain his attention. Both of Ash's parents seem more interested in his more confident and talented cousin Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson), who is staying temporarily with the family.Wes Anderson has consistently been a director interested in the dysfunctional family. The Royal Tenenbaums detailed the way that a selfish and scheming father became disconnected from his incredibly talented children and then eventually reunited his family. The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou continued with similar themes through the way a series of dangerous sea adventures initially separated but then brought together a man and the son he never knew he had. While Rushmore, one of the earlier Anderson films, was essentially about the way a schoolboy had to find his feet, amidst his own crazy and often reckless behaviour. The continuation of these same themes throughout this film carries an air of familiarity about it. Mr. Fox's continuous need for risk and danger, even in spite of the danger it brings to his family and neighbours, illustrates his arrogance and his ego, in a similar vein to the men in Anderson's previous films. While the use of Schwartzman's voice work here, whose big break came from playing the boy in Rushmore, further echoes the similarities between his roles in both films. Yet as with nearly all of Anderson's films, it is the charm and the humour that he brings to the material as a writer and director, which makes this familiar territory still engaging for adults and well worth visiting once more. The rapid pacing of the film though ensures that the narrative and its questions of self and existence are not overstated in a way that will isolate children from the film though. There is a very solid balance between action and more thoughtful moments in the narrative.The way that Fantastic Mr. Fox has been visually constructed also reflects Anderson's appreciation for the offbeat and quirky tones of all of his films. This is a 2D film that uses both puppets and clay animation techniques as well. It may not have the sheer beauty and slickness of Pixar's Up, but it is certainly just as dynamic and exciting, particularly during its action sequences. The rapid variations in angles to a scene and the changes in perspective and depth, make this one of the most uniquely photographed animated pictures in several years. The level of detail in the houses and locations is splendid, reflecting the extraordinary amount of time and care that was taken to create this world. Much of the furniture in the film was apparently modelled on the pieces from Dahl's own home itself, suggesting there is still great intent to keep the spirit of the original author alive, in spite of the thorough expansion of the source material. The richness of the visuals is further complimented through the tremendous work of the voice cast. The use of an entirely American cast in a traditional English story is an initially skeptical decision. Yet George Clooney is a perfect fit as Mr. Fox because he is provided with sharp dialogue and focused characterisation that allows him to convey a sense of charm, arrogance and sneakiness throughout the film. Both Meryl Streep and Jason Schwartzman are thoroughly convincing supports too. Although Willem Dafoe is a bit creepy as a sleazy, kung fu fighting rat. It because of Anderson's script though, with his trademark deadpan humour, that he is able to really ignite the enthusiasm of a very strong, well-known cast.This is a rather small film with common themes and relationships from Anderson, but because of the wittiness of the script, in providing such clever writing to the cast and the audience, it remains a real pleasure to watch. The more serious and complex subtext of the narrative might be overlooked by very small children, but they will still thoroughly relish the unique look and style of the film and the very inventive and well designed action sequences. It might not quite reach the emotional core of Up but there is still something for everyone in Fantastic Mr. Fox.",

Wes has his style, and it shines even more in stop motion with increased freedom. Though I do think it could've been more playful at times.Visually there are just so many shots here that feel like you're looking at a painting. The cinematography is incredible, and it holds up due to the choice to not overuse CGI, of which there is only one shot or so. The interiors, the characters, there's details to enjoy everywhere.Characters/props/design. Incredible, the three 3 farmers are my absolute favorite. So much character, but also charm. Honestly.. I liked the foxes. But I loved the design of the humans. I kept wishing for more scenes with them, the town scene was the cherry on top. The interiors are stunning, the opening scenes with the three farmers, typical Wes but also so perfect for this movie. It just manages to encapsulate so many things, capture so much detail, at a quick pace. The foxes are great too of course, the clothes, all lovely. I can go on but there's nothing bad here. It's all fantastic.Music was nice, very fitting and light/happy tones. Some similar/same tracks that I've heard in previous Wes films. Which was slightly nostalgic. But also made this move stand out a little less. I wish it had a more distinct sound to go along with it.Voices are really well cast. Clooney has that lovable warmth. Schartzman was great, I loved his line delivery. Murray was good as always and standout was Dafoe with the Rat. Really fun scenes. Nothing to note else, just great all around.Just a really solid stop motion. I've got to see more stop motion films but this so far is close to the top.",

The high scores gave me high hopes, and it fulfilled most of my expectations.The art and stop-motion is great. It's fantastic to look at, the the stop- motion is spot-on. The scenery itself is enough to leave you wanting more. The plot is, although feeling rushed at points, well-paced in the end, as you realize how much there is to cover. It's unpredictable and interesting to see where the adventures of Mr. Fox takes him and his family. The new events that occur as the movie progresses don't drag out the movie at all, but I feel like it would have benefited from a longer run time. The movie is quite quirky and has plenty of exaggerated scenes throughout. These scenes, although unrealistic, fit well into the universe of Fantastic Mr. Fox, and really add to the whole experience. My only complaint is that it often blatantly gives in to movie clich\u00e9s that really bothered me, and as much was I wanted to call it fantastic, these scenes distracted from it. Nevertheless, I loved everything else. Overall Fantastic Mr. Fox is a heck of a lot of fun. It's well-paced, beautiful to look at, and quirky. Unfortunately it suffers from following the formula, which really distracts from the creativity of the rest of the film. Nevertheless, the movie is worth your time, and is a must-watch for any movie lover. If you did somehow dislike it, then that's really too bad. If you do enjoy it, then we're in agreement. I highly recommend you checking this one out if you haven't already.",

Stop- motion animation is one of the oldest techniques as old as Alice in wonderland in 1903 and even much before that. This film adopts the same technology and adds up a lot of speediness to make the stop motion to look real animation. So technically it is great.The content is fun, but there is a strong script over a not so strong story which is an inherent ingredient of Wes Anderson film. Had there been a stronger story, this would have been more wonderful. The voice over is stupendous and the dialogues are well written too. Above all, the humor is subtle and yet hilarious. Music by Alexandre Desplat is worth a mention as it adds a lot of weight to this film. It's a great score and gels well with the film, Wes Anderson can take a simple story and make it more than a worthwhile watch and he proves yet again with this. The art direction and the colors used are great and made the film an treat to the eye. The characterisation is one that you would find in a typical commercial film. There is a hero, a heroine, a sidekick and a villain. Together, there is a family too. So this is a perfect stop- motion family entertainer I would say.I loved this for many reasons and thanks to Anderson for bringing stop-motion back. Big thanks for his wit and sense of humor that are displayed generously in the film.A 4/5 to a great stop motion animation film.",

Wes Anderson directs, and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film. While I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man did, the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man, and if this happened to be a bad film, it would be his first bad film. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in film making, so I am going to let him off easy. I will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it, and the animation is nice, but the film gets progressively harder to get into, leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening. The characters are good, also. Jason Schwartzman voices Mr. Fox (George Clooney)'s smart ass son, Ash, and especially engaging. The film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness, but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along. I'm sure Wes Anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this film of yours was a big disappointment.",

As long as you don't have any expectations, over the course of the movie it will constantly up the ante on comedy, plot, and themes.By far, the best parts of the film are the voice acting, dialogue, and animation. The cast may seem like throw-away star-power on paper, but upon watching, the actors are all spectacular, and their star power is no distraction at all. The dialogue is so surprising, quick, witty, and humorous. And the animation is a fresh take on stop-motion animation, which was pretty rare at the time.I really don't have a lot of bad to say about the film. I hear that it isn't especially true to the source material, but I had never even heard of the Roald Dahl story. If you can shed your expectations of the film, it really is excellent.I am actually kind of worried that movies like this don't get more attention, and this film may actually be forgotten one day, despite being one of the greatest animated films of all time.",

            "content": "Neither fantastic nor a flop, Wes Anderson?s infringement on Nick Park?s (?Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit) stop motion animation territory presents an uneven mix of elements. Extrapolating from Roald Dahl?s children book the film mixes some concepts the kids will find confusing (Felicity Fox announces she is ?pregnant? twice and Mr. Fox has an ?existential crisis?) with elongated frantic chase scenes, many in tunnels, which eventually get tiresome for the adults. Mr. Fox kills ?Rat? on screen in an extended scene but during his killing of squabs and chickens the camera demurely looks away. Ultimate both constituents will find the film entertaining but unmemorable. There is a lot to like here, however, Clooney is pitch perfect as the self-centered Mr. Fox and Willem Dafoe dials up his trademarked brand of creepiness to the extent that you are happy to see the end of Rat. Anderson?s detailed set decoration lends a needed air of realism but his animation skills are not in the same league in terms of rendering characters attractive and endearing as Nick Park. In short, walk but don?t run to see it with the kids and be prepared to do some explaining.",

            "content": "When a director whose films have taken on a steady fan base decides to change direction with an entirely new genre, it's a risky move. None as risky as Wes Anderson's latest work Fantastic Mr. Fox, his animated feature film debut. I can't think of any filmmakers going behind the camera of an animated film having been this successful in live action.Well, his risk has payed off and I am confident in saying that Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of the year's best. It is based on the classic children's book of the same name by famed writer Roald Dahl. It's the story of a fox who gets the idea of stealing from three of the meanest local farmers: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. It has been many years since I have read the book, but it was an excellent read when growing up.When I saw that Anderson was making this film, I was as anxious as ever. Then I saw the trailer and all my worries went away. Anderson is able to transfer his style to animation flawlessly. His use of tracking side shots, symmetric division of the screen with his characters, colorful sets, and his amazing soundtrack with both original tracks and carefully selected tracks from other artists like Burl Ives, The Beach Boys, and The Rolling Stones.Rather than just getting a bunch of big name actors in a sound studio one at a time, Anderson devised a system where he actually the recorded the actors acting out what their characters are doing. Be it eating, rolling, or digging, the actors performed their actions along with their lines. The film features some of Anderson's stars from other films like Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Wallace Woldarsky, and Michael Gamdon, as well as two important lead performances by George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox. I love the casting Anderson chose for each character. I don't think it could have gone any better.Anderson uses stop animation wonderfully here. It gives the characters a certain edge to them and it makes them wacky enough and serious enough so that kids and adults can enjoy the whole production. It's rated PG and I think that parents will agree that some of the film just isn't for kids, and that is not a knock against the film. I just don't think kids will really get what Anderson is trying to accomplish here. It's not too graphic or inappropriate but some of the humor is a little over their heads. No worries though, kids will love it and will not be harmed by it in any way.There is so much to enjoy here. The clever writing, the beautiful sets, and the, I hate to say it, fantastic story, all add up to an impressive film that shows Anderson is a filmmaker capable of doing whatever he wants. Perhaps a black and white, silent film starring only dogs. On second thought that might be right in his wheelhouse. I have to think of a real challenge for him.",

            "review_title": "Wes Anderson's Perfect Transition to the Mainstream, and You Know They Need Him There",
            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox is technically one of the very best films ever created. That may sound like an overstatement, but only to those who overlook the few filmmakers out there who are actually advancing the art, the way an art is supposed to be advanced. Wes Anderson is one of those filmmakers, and you can't study film without seeing that his clear, playacting style of film is completely original and making waves in dozens, if not hundreds of young directors. There's a reason why Scorcese called Wes Anderson \"the new Scorsese\"- being about the biggest compliment Scorcese could give. But up until now, the cause for this compliment has only been demonstrated in a small set of perfectly crafted adult comedies like \"Rushmore\", \"The Royal Tennenbaums\", and \"The Darjeeling Limited\".Well, at last Wes Anderson has created something that we can all watch together. But what's cooler is that the decision on Mr. Anderson's part to make something for General Audinces doesn't appear at all to be based on caring about that at all, let alone having some Dreamworks-esquire Disney-envy; but upon the fact that\u2013 like Walt Disney\u2013 Wes Anderson simply has a genuine appreciation of Aesopic storytelling, and is extraordinarily good at both it, and animation. In fact, no one has added as much to the canon on how humanized animals could behave since Disney himself (note Anderson's animals' sudden bursts of raw animalistic behavior when eating and fighting, which serves hilariously to both animalize the characters more, and even build their strengths\u2013 while simultaneously satirizing certain human behaviors that can often be, humorously animalistic themselves). In fact it looks as though all can be glad because\u2013 as you'll see a lot of critics saying\u2013 if there's anyone who could give Disney a run for their incalculable money, it's Anderson. We're all impressed by Disney\u2013 that's why I always hope they have someone keeping them on their toes. But again, taking down Disney does not seem to be one of Anderson's motivations at all. Again, it's his natural, evident love for what he's done here with Fantastic Mr. Fox that makes Mr. Anderson the most likely person to succeed, however incidentally, at creating the next major animation studio with it's own thing going. And he should do exactly that, between live action films.When successful, center-buzz art-film directors like Wes Anderson get all the more artsy, with full-on stop-motion animation (which, once you quickly get past the initial movement of it with the help of some excellent storytelling, can look more real than the best cgi\u2013 because you can feel that it IS real) and the result is mainstream fare, however intentionally limited it's release, I feel like falling over with joy. And how impressive is it that a feature-length, stop-motion animation film\u2013 which, being more foreign now, requires stronger storytelling to suspend the audience's disbelief\u2013 works as well as a Pixar film; and what does that say about Wes Anderson's storytelling ability?Now, about the film\u2013 I love it when people think that animation is just for kids, so I will tell you that this is more of a family film than a kid's movie; and I'm saying that because everyone will enjoy this film more if they know what they're getting into\u2013 i.e. adults should know and not just be surprised by the fact that they are probably the film's intended core audience\u2013 because that's cool here. Looney Tunes were the same way. For example, with Mr. Fox, all of the dialogue is very proper and intelligent, and many, many of the situational and subtle humor will be less grappled by kids. It is not, however, dirty. It also involves a hilariously satirical depiction of the use of swearing, wherein the characters will begin to say sentences that overuse the word \"cuss\", in places where there would normally be even some of the spiciest language, in reality. That being said, I don't know how that can hurt kids any more than public school. And when it comes to how even little children will enjoy what really is advanced entertainment, it's still a bunch of talking animals. They freaking love it.So while this new style of animating may in a very real way compete with the best, it will do so because it's really nothing like it, especially when compared to how close the other competitors all are to each other. This is not Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, or A bug's Life, or something in between\u2013 because in spite of the fact that the characters are a bunch of talking animals, it's still\u2013 in every other way\u2013 very different than other cartoons. And if it's slightly more mature than the rest, that's because it's a Wes Anderson take on a Roald Dahl story\u2013 and both are noted for mischief, high invention, and the flavour of England.And Fantastic Mr. Fox, while being a reminder of Wes Anderson's unparalleled auteurism\u2013 which includes his firm grasp on Art Direction, Direction, Writing, Story, Costuming, Music, and about twenty other key elements in film\u2013 is, perhaps first and foremost, a quintessential reminder of just how truly, truly funny he can be. He's one of the world's greatest humorist, and we wouldn't believe it because we're living in his time. When you really stop and analyze it\u2013 all of his trademarks are chosen because of their specific power to accentuate or produce humor\u2013 the only exception being that which he implements for the accentuation or production of pure, good, old-fashioned tomfoolery. And if the latter is not for the kids, then nothing is.I love Wes Anderson's films, and in a very thought-through kind of way, I think that Fantastic Mr. Fox might just be his best one. That is saying about as much about this film as I can say. It's absolutely perfect, and I hope Anderson takes us on this kind of outing again and often.Bravo, Wes Anderson. You rule.",

Mr. Fox, a retired and apparently reformed chicken thief, becomes a newspaper columnist to save his wife and his son the pain and trouble of having to maneuver out of fox traps. But life in a hole or even in a tree upon a hill, does little to muffle the Call of the Wild within his heart. There is a great view down below of the farms of Boggis, Bunce and Bean, three of the meanest farmers around. The wheels of Mr. Fox's mind start turning again, spinning a plot with the tree caretaker Kiley. The chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese, not to mention apples and cider, are all down that hill for the taking, and before too long Mr. Fox is executing raids planned meticulously to the last detail. He even loses his tail in the process.The stop motion animation of director Wes Anderson gives the film a unique context all its own. Anderson actually chose to record the voices out in a forest, in an attic, a stable, and underground rather than in the confines of a studio. The result is that the ensemble; which includes George Clooney as Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep as his wife, Felicity, Jason Schwartzman as his son Ash, Bill Murray as Clive Badger and Willem Defoe as Rat, deliver their lines with a freewheeling spontaneity that can only be found on location and in the great outdoors. Clooney as Mr. Fox, causes a great deal of community turmoil returning to his thieving ways, but proves you can't keep a good chicken thief down for long. He rallies many homeless animals forced into the sewers, mainly because of the farmers retaliation against his own actions, into conducting raids with him on all of the three farms of Boggis, Bunce and Bean.The cutaway views of the animals tunneling underground mazes to facilitate their escapes are hilariously informative as are the charts and graphs presented by Mr. Fox for each expedition into no man's farmland. Michael Gambon as Franklin Bean, Robin Hurlstone as Walt Boggis, and Hugo Guinness as Nate Bunce, look like characters straight out of a Robert Crumb cartoon. The exhaustive plans they draw to flush out the backwood varmints threatening their livelihood are met with feral cunning and intelligence by Fox and Company. Things take a turn for the worst when Fox's son Ash, and his cousin Kristofferson, after overcoming their familial rivalry, set out to recover Fox's tail. Unfortunately, both do not make it back to safety.The farmers plan for an ambush, but find Fox and Company prepared to counterattack. There is skirmishing all over the barnyard and outlying areas, but the varmints and critters find some success and hold their own. The wild folk decide to work and reestablish their community in the sewers. But Mr. Fox's raiding days are hardly done. He discovers a drain in the floor of a large grocery store that is ripe for the picking. Leading his fellow creatures up the aisles to food aplenty, Mrs. Fox reveals to him her own surprise.This film was nominated for Academy Awards as Best Animated Feature and for Best Musical Score. It won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Animated Film and also their Best Actor Award for George Clooney. While not as dark in tone as the children's novel by Roald Dahl, in this case it might be a good thing, especially for children. The whole piece has a bright wit and exuberant imagination about it. There is definitely plenty here for parents and kids to talk about once they have stopped laughing.",

            "content": "The wonderful stories of the late Roald Dahl, from \"James and the Giant Peach\", \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", and \"Matilda\", have been adapted in plenty of film adaptations. You know, at first, I didn't think that a \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" movie was a good idea, until I saw the \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" movie, it's actually pretty cool. Based on a popular children's novel of the same name, \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" stars George Clooney giving voice to the title role as Mr. Fox, a fox who steals food each night from three mean and wealthy farmers, 'Boggis, Bunce, and Bean'. The farmers had enough with Mr. Fox's antics, and they try to kill him by digging their way into their home, without knowing that the foxes are hiding underground, and they have to live without being bothered by farmers. Aside from Clooney's hilarious and excellent voice performance, the rest of the cast includes Meryl Streep as Mr. Fox's wife, Jason Schwartzman as Ash, the son who tries to become an athlete, Bill Murray as Mr. Fox's lawyer, and Owen Wilson in a short performance as Ash's school coach. It is \"movie magic\" to watch these actors bring voice to these colorful characters. Wes Anderson seems to be the perfect director for this movie, he's always been known for making such strange and whimsical movies that fall on a dysfunctional yet satisfying level. The writing is sharp and believable, the characters are funny, and the animation is pretty impressive. The jokes are pretty cocky, and there are moments when you chuckle or cringe. I will say that is a pretty entertaining movie with sharp characters, smart writing, beautiful music, and impressive animation. Although this movie is weird and cocky, it's totally worth your time. The whole family will love it, even adults. If you're a little kid who adores the books by Roald Dahl, or if you never read the book, this is still a pretty fun movie that will totally fool your senses. \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\", in my review, \"an entertaining romp, playful and smart\".",

For example making his home a tree house made the whole point of the farmers stakeout, waiting for him to leave his hole pointless! Why didn't the story stick to the tunnel digging and final feast for the animals? I can understand cutting things out when there is just too much to include in a film but changing bits and ignoring a perfect end to the story was a big let down. Maybe you just have to accept that books are always better than the film adaptation but this is a relatively short and concise story, probably one of the best children's stories and I just can't see why anyone would see the need to rewrite it?",

I must have been 9 or 10, somewhere around there. We sat on his bed with his Mac Laptop and watched this film. Years have gone by and scenes from it still stick with me. After seeing The Grand Budapest Hotel I thought that maybe Wes Anderson hadn't made any other great movies. I thought that this was probably just an ok film that I had just loved as a kid. Boy was I wrong.I'll start with the characters. All, and I really do mean ALL of them. Are incredibly compelling. The main 6ish mainly but even the side characters are all interesting and unique in their own way. I remember seeing Ash and Kristofferson as a kid and thinking Ash was just a dick. Now that I'm older I can appreciate their relationship so much better. Kristofferson, or who I will from now on refer to as Krist. Is obviously much more mature then Ash. However, he is still a minor. Probably on the younger side of his teens. So while it may seem like he has his life together when he starts sniffling I felt for him. It's not easy being a kid and sometimes it's all too much. Ash also is just a kid, one that is living in his father's shadow when suddenly someone comes along and is better than him at everything he has worked so hard on. Ash feels different and like his goals aren't achievable and he struggles with that throughout the whole movie.Fantastic Mr Fox, or just Foxy. Is also cool. Clooney was probably the perfect cast choice for the role. The only other actor that I think could have done an amazing job would have been Tom Cruise. His arc and story is basically a dad ageing out of his glory days of heist and crime. So when he tries to relive what he did before he causes the lives of his family and friends to be put into jeopardy. Obviously he is the protagonist so he has to be a hero at some point but they really show peoples anger towards him quite well.The sound design in this film is also great. The score has a whimsical charm to it that really makes it pop and stick with you after. It perfectly encompasses how you feel like as a kid when you're playing as a spy around your house or something like that.Hats off to Wes Anderson. Every set piece and effect looks spectacular in stop motion. The cinematography also looks phenomenal and the way the camera moves around the world really feels true and like an actual real-life shot movie. The movie also leaves some things up to your imagination. Specifically how humans perceive foxes. They understand they're incredibly intelligent but they also still refer to them as wild animals and try to kill them in inhumane ways. There might be a deeper meaning to this but I don't want to try and pick the film apart to fit a meaning.Finally, I want to discuss the core message of the film. It dives a bit deeper than \"follow your dreams\" and \"be yourself\" it sort of lands somewhere in the middle. Saying something akin to, be yourself to the best of your ability, but also never stop trying to achieve a goal. Try new things whenever you can. Even if someone is better then you at them or even if you think you'll fail. You may be able to achieve your goal in a way you didn't think was possible before.Overall. Please watch this film. It's great for literally all ages. If you're a kid it's cool flashing imagery and characters. If you're a teen it can help if you feel like you don't fit in the world. If you're an adult you get to appreciate what an amazing film is.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson is my hero. No, really, I mean it! I mean, look back at all the films he's made: all the way from his debut masterpiece \"Bottle Rocket\", to his elegantly poignant \"The Royal Tenenbaums\", and even his box-office flop (but critically-acclaimed) \"The Darjeeling Limited\" and all the others in between. He's a filmmaker that takes dark comedies and takes them to hilariously high and moving levels, and his screen writing (usually teamed with another excellent filmmaker, Noah Baumbach) is among the best that Hollywood can come up with. He's a man who seems not to be able to do a superficial film, and each character he creates has infinite depth and wisdom and seems much more human than any, um, Jerry Bruckheimer could come up with (even though his films ARE good, too).Whatever. The point is that Wes Anderson has surprised me beyond limits. Here is one of the masters of dramatic, depressing comedies taking a book written by Roald Dahl (one of the most whimsical and best-selling children's' novelist) and making it into a stop-motion animated film for the entire family. Impossible, you say? I used to say that too, but after watching the end result, I can declare that Wes Anderson's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" won't disappoint any adult or child this year.Most of you already know the sinopsis of Dahl's book, but in a nutshell, the film is about Mr. Fox, Mrs. Fox and their son Ash who live a somewhat poor but content life in their burrow. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) used to be a chicken thief in his day, but after meeting Mrs. Fox and putting her in danger after discovering she's pregnant, he vows to stop the adrenaline-packed life of a chicken thief and becomes instead a columnist for a newspaper few people read. Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) seems to be okay with this, but Mr. Fox is going through heavy existential problems where his spirit is at unrest and where his animal instincts overpower him. Ash (Jason Schwartzman), their son, is a depressed and sour young fox who begs for society's attention but is usually overlooked or ignored because, let''s face it, he's unimpressive.Mr. Fox buys a beautiful, large tree from his real estate agent against the legal advice of his Badger attorney (Bill Murray), and it all seems ideal at first, but Mr. Fox is very much aware that his neighbors are none others than Bogis, Bunce and Bean, the three meanest farmers around...and also the wealthiest and the ones who farm and harvest the best chicken, turkeys and apples respectively. His instincts kick in, he begins stealing again, and soon finds himself in a heap-load of trouble. But, as the title of the film aptly highlights the word 'fantastic', this is no ordinary fox! Yes, it's a children's' story, and yes, it's a fable, but as much as it's fantastic and preposterous it's profound and intelligent. Obviously, Anderson has taken the artistic liberty of adapting the story as freely as his imagination (and his PG-restrained rating) will let him. He's omitted a character or two, he's added about seven more, he's stretched the story to include many more plot twists and he's given each character a roundness and a credibility that you'd never imagine seeing in a fox, a badger, a mole, or their likes. As in previous films, Anderson deals with topics such as existentialism, nature vs. nurture, not fitting in, dysfunctional families, excess of envy and, most of all, repressed emotion which will eventually explode in sudden bouts of depressing anger; yeah, definitely NOT topics for children...but how can I put it? Anderson has managed to tone himself down without reducing a smidgen of depth to a point where the film is adequate enough for children and marvelously moving for adults. Tell me, how many other filmmakers can do this? The dialogue is pitch-perfect, as always. The cinematography is grandiose and frames not characters per se, but entire settings; it makes the viewer feel like a voyeur including him or herself into these animals' life instead of simply an audience at a movie theater. Camera positions, cuts and dolleys add comedy to the events going on screen, and the sublimely country-ish score by Alexandre Desplat make this the perfectly-ambienced film.There are scenes of raw, heart-wrenching emotion: notice a scene where Mr. Fox fights with Rat during their second encounter, or the scene where Mr. Fox gives a toast at a supermarket; these scenes take your breath away and launch your brains into a cataclysm of thoughts and opinions about a wide array of topics. Notice other scenes, like the one where Ash is working at his chemistry school lab or where Ash and his cousin Kristofferson watch a train set in their room; these are incredibly hilarious, and speak of genius in each second of them. I think that, with the obvious superiority of Disney/Pixar's \"Up\", \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is the second best family film of the year.See it! And have your children see it too. Films don't get any more rewarding than this! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",

            "content": "I watched that movie because of all the hype that was going on around it and I have to say it was a very enjoyable film.I haven't watched many Wes Anderson films,there seems to be a bit much of a controversy around his name,everyone saying he is a \"love him or leave him\" kind of director.Same saying goes around for this movie.I believe this film is really overrated.Everyone goes like \"This is like nothing you have ever seen before\",\"Magnificent on both aesthetic and entertaining level\" and such.Personally I don't find it that pleasing,nor unique on the aesthetic level.I am a fan of stop motion animation and I have to say that I have seen MUCH MORE better works on that field aesthetically.Damn almost every stop motion movie since Nightmare Before Christmass I have seen is better aesthetically.Nightmare Before Christmass,Coraline,Paranorman,Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run,all i consider to be a better job in terms of stop motion animation.Not even talking about Kubo and the two strings...And as far as it goes for the story and everyone talking about how surreal it is...Again Nightmare Before Christmass,Coraline and James And The Giant Peach are surreal, not Fantastic Mr Fox.It's like something we have commonly seen in plain 3d animation stories only that it has many more americanized elements and a more real feel to it.Nowhere near surreal.As long as I was watching the film I constantly had a feeling like I was watching a common American robbery movie like The gang of eleven,Now you see me and other bank robbery movies compressed into a stop motion environment.All and all,it was an enjoyable film but I don't understand the hype about it.For the people saying it's a hate it or love it film I am here to disprove them.I liked it but considering I am a stop motion fan,it was too non surreal and aesthetically mediocre to love it",

It might not be a life-changing experience, but it surely guarantees 87 minutes of light-hearted divertissement.",

            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox is easily the best animated feature of 2009. It should be rewarded with an Oscar nomination (and is every bit deserving of a win) even though Pixar's Up (2009) could land the coveted statuette based on popular votes. Adapted from the beloved Roald Dahl children's book of the same name, the film tells the story of Mr. Fox and his sneaky scheme to steal poultry, especially chicken, from three nearby farms run by three nasty, detestable humans with a collective mission: to kill Mr. Fox and his family.Director Wes Anderson who is well-known for films such as Bottle Rocket (1996), Rushmore (1998), and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) is one of the key American filmmakers of the 90s to revive the low-budget independent offbeat comedy. Even though much of his works remain under-appreciated, Anderson has a loyal following claiming that he is one of the great filmmakers of our time. While that might be exaggerating it a fair bit, Fantastic Mr. Fox shows us why he is on course to being judged as such.Fantastic Mr. Fox follows the stop-motion tradition of the Wallace And Gromit films, and refutes the argument that brilliant animated films can only be made by Pixar. Anderson's obsession with detail and his mastery of mise-en-scene also means that the film is far from 'kiddish'; on the contrary, it can be seen as quality art. While children may enjoy the visuals and the odd dose of behavioral humor (e.g. how the foxes consume their meal or how they dig themselves out of trouble), parents who are forced to tag along are far more likely to appreciate the authenticity of the character and set models used, and the themes of 'family', 'responsibility', and 'collectivism' which reverberate with quiet resonance throughout the film.There is some superb voice work on show here with George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox. Supporting voice talents include stars Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Michael Gambon, William Dafoe, and Owen Wilson. An 'ethnic' influence is evident in one of the characters here whose obsession with yoga and its meditative properties recalls a certain 'spiritual' Schwartzman in The Darjeeling Limited (2007), Anderson's previous film about three brothers on a bonding trip to India.Fantastic Mr. Fox also explores the important theme of domesticity versus the wild. Mr. Fox has a lovely family and he dotes on them. In short, he lives a comfortable life in his big house under a tree. But more often than not, he succumbs to his animalistic instinct by 'hunting' for food from the farms. He enjoys the temporal satisfaction of being a wild animal, or in this case, a sly, scheming fox. In a key scene, Mr. Fox has a fleeting encounter with a black wolf. Even though suppressed by a psychological fear of wolves, he admires from distance the dark beauty of the creature, its freedom to roam the lands, to hunt, and its fortune to avoid the tepidity that is domesticity.An Anderson masterpiece of craftsmanship and direction, Fantastic Mr. Fox very much assures itself of a spot in my top ten films of 2009.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",

The voice cast is all A listers, Clooney and Meryl Streep are the main characters, and the entire movie is one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences I've ever experienced.I could keep rambling on about this film for hours but I hope I've managed to get across how much I love it.

There's still a lot I love, the music is fantastic for one, obviously the leitmotifs are very prominent and absolutely amazing, I know I talk about leitmotifs lots but I don't know I love them. The instrumentation is so unique with the children's choir which is a leitmotif in itself and finger snapping. Rats theme is probably my favourite and Rat is probably my favourite character, Willem Dafoe's performance is great, all the performances are great.Now I have some nitpicks I want to mention. The scene when Bean's wife goes into the cellar doesn't make sense, she starts it by asking Bean how many ciders he wants, Bean asks for two, his wife then reminds him that he had three yesterday, he changes his mind and asks for three, then his wife decides to give him two anyway. Why would she remind him that he had three yesterday if she was only going to get him two anyway, it's not like they care about being healthy or anything like that, it's just annoying. My second nitpick is about the conversation behind the mineral deposit, it's a great scene, but something Mrs. Fox says is a bit unclear. She's says \"this story is too predictable\", a line I really like, Mr. Fox replies with \"how does it end\", she then says \"we all die, unless you change\", but even if he does change everyone's going to die, Mr. Fox changing doesn't change anything in regards to death in the grand scheme of things. And finally when Boris Bunce and Bean are stuck on the roof out of reach of Spitz Bean calls and asks for a ladder, but what will that do, Spitz is still going to be able to attack them if they get a ladder or not.Anyway those are my \"issues\", well they're not my issues but they're the \"issues\" I have with the film Fantastic Mr. Fox directed by Wes Anderson.

The anthropomorphism we're used to in most animated movies surely gets scrutinized in this pic.As with all of Anderson's work, likably off-key, but somewhat distancing and too self-absorbed on the whole.6 out of 10 dumb opossums",

            "content": "Wes Anderson brings his unique eccentricity to this Roald Dahl tale of a gentlemanly fox who decides to pull one final heist on local farmers. The director chooses to the colorful medium of stop-motion animation which was an animation trademark for director Tim Burton, but this is pure Anderson.Dripped in a rich color palette of traditional fall colors like orange, yellow, brown and red, the atmosphere sets itself apart from other Wes Anderson worlds. The director is known for picking a specific color scheme to illustrate his films and here the fall colors set the time of year and fit with the characters of the Fox family and their associates. As usual, Anderson assembles an all star cast of actors to bring his characters to life like frequent collaborators Bill Murray as the grouchy Badger and Jason Schwartzman as Ash Fox, son of the title Mr. Fox, while also bringing in well-established actors like George Clooney as the mischievous and suave title character, Meryl Streep as the clever and loyal wife of Clooney's Mr. Fox as well as a minor appearance from Willem Dafoe as the voice of the scheming and devious Rat (too fitting a character for the actor known for playing villains). Every player in the film brings the comradeship needed between them while also being believable as a family unit or adversaries. The film takes a unique approach to language as director Wes Anderson tosses out traditional cursing and swaps in the word\"cuss\" whenever a character has to swear. At times it is evident what word the actor might actually have said and other times it's purely entertaining without replacing a certain curse word. This idea keeps the material family-friendly for any younger viewers, but provides an adult joke for all the grown-ups.",

            "content": "Fantastic Mr Fox marks Wes Anderson's first foray into animation, and he uses the stop motion process effectively. Fantastic Mr Fox has been adapted from Roald Dahl's short story, and Anderson's droll sense of humor makes for a perfect match with Dahl's offbeat sensibility. It takes a certain sensibility to do justice to Roald Dahl's tales \u2013 Tim Burton beautifully adapted his Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and gave it a suitably surreal visual style that enriched the story \u2013 and Anderson has a similar aesthetic approach here. Mr Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a lovable rogue. At the urging of his wife (Meryl Streep) though he is forced to give away his usual habits of stealing chickens and settle down with a regular job to support his family. He lands a job as a journalist. But surrounded by a chicken farm, a squab farm and a cider distillery, temptation is too great. Eventually he secretly reverts back to his old habits of raiding the local chicken warehouses at night. He is also seeking revenge on the evil farmer who blew off his tail with a shotgun. Boggins, Bean and Bunce, a trifecta of local farmers tired of his raids on their chicken farms, threaten to drive him away by destroying the woods he calls home. Mr Fox gathers together his friends and family to try and outwit them. He also has to deal with his self-absorbed slacker son Ash (Jason Schwartzmann). Ash falls into a funk when he finds himself constantly being compared to his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) who is spending the summer with his family, and who proves a dab hand at just about every activity he attempts. Anderson and his regular co-writer Noah Baumbach have expanded on the original source. While they still remain faithful to its spirit the pair have suffused the material with a layer of darkness. Anderson has stamped his own take on the story with his usual quirky and subversive wit. The insightful examination of the dynamics of the dysfunctional Fox family; is also a feature of his previous films like The Royal Tannenbaums. Anderson and his production team have created a vibrant and believable world for his characters to inhabit. The puppetry is superb, and the animals are given a real sense of texture. A superb voice cast brings the flawed characters to life, and apparently Anderson recorded them together in a sound booth on a Connecticut farm rather than in isolation in sound booths in a studio. Clooney is perfectly cast here as the incredibly daring Mr Fox; slick and very smooth his laid back comic approach reminds audiences of a foxy equivalent of his Danny Ocean character. His signature whistle and finger click becomes ingratiating. Streep is very good as his patient and knowing wife. Anderson has used many of his regulars to provide the voices for supporting characters, including Bill Murray, who plays a lawyer badger, Owen Wilson and Schwartzmann. Willem Dafoe provides the voice of a rat security guard, while Michael Gambon brings a touch of malevolence to his role as Farmer Bean. With Fantastic Mr Fox Anderson has created a beautifully constructed animated world of imagination and fancy that will appeal to all ages.",

            "content": "This film is very, very unique. It's a variation of a classic story, but so weird and well-written that you don't care. I should mention that I haven't read the book that inspired this movie, so I can't judge it's accuracy to the source material.The plot follows a fox who regularly steals from local farmers, despite having promised his wife that he would leave stealing behind once he learned she was pregnant. He and a friend take on the biggest farmers in the area, and find themselves in over their heads when the farmers retaliate and threaten his entire community.Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach craft an excellent script full of sharp dialogue that is funny to children and adults alike. The story manages to remain interesting throughout, and doesn't dumb itself down for its target audience. Anderson also directs here, and he has a visual style that is very interesting to watch. He doesn't let the animation overpower the story or his style, but in fact he allows it to work within his plot, never letting the animation carry the film. He is putting out a very different product from most animated children's films around currently, particularly Disney.The animation is stellar, and it's all the more astounding that it's stop-motion. I appreciate it in that it feels more intimate and personal than computer animation, and I feel the effort behind the product, which allowed me to invest in it more. It felt more human, despite being about animals. You can see the painstaking work and precision behind each character movement, psychedelic scene, or atmospheric shot.\nNote: Minor spoilers may be ahead, but they're related to the film's purpose and not the actual plot.My only critique of the film is its message. I think it's message was horrible. Basically, the message is that it's completely ok and acceptable to be true to your nature. The film even teases character growth for most of the runtime. Only around the third act does its true message kind of start to show, and it's finally presented at the very end in a horribly unsubtle way. I guess since it's a children's film, it doesn't want to be as open to interpretation because it thinks what it has to say is a righteous and important message that kids need to hear, but I disagree. I found the ultimate \"be true to your nature\" message to fly in the face of fundamentals of humanity. Humans are terrible, and our saving grace is that we continue to grow and evolve. Change is important to growth as a human. If you stay the same then you never learn anything. The main character acted like a child, lied to and jeopardized his family, was selfish the entire time, and faced no consequences. His behavior was validated in the end. There's even a point where his wife tells him that she loves him, but that she shouldn't have marrie him. That's a heavy moment for a children's film, and I think it's quite ambitious. But instead of following this, the film ignores it and their relationship regresses back to normal in the end. It felt so cheap and self-fulfilling, and frankly irresponsible.I may be being too scathing, but aside from the message, I really, really enjoyed it. It's fun, it's weird, it's creative, and it's different.",

            "review_title": "\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\"",
            "content": "Wes Anderson's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is a different breed of animated film. It bares a disarming emotional maturity coupled with a sweetly mischievous cartoony vitality that both renews my faith in Anderson as a director and reaffirms 2009 as a hell of a year for animation.Things were admittedly getting rocky between the indie auteur and I. \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" the perfect nexus of Anderson's flamboyant cinematic technique, borderline obsessive-compulsive art direction, and satirically bourgeois humor, was proceeded by two films with all the technical and artistic flare of his best work, though his families of dryly depressive characters, often portrayed by a stock catalogue of recycled actors, began feeling increasingly redundant and masturbatory. His follow-up to \"Tenenbaums\" was \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,\" a puzzlingly defended film distinguished by breathtaking visuals, smarmy caricatures, and unrepentant vacuity. 2007's \"Darjeeling Limited\" surpassed that film in substance, but Anderson still felt like he was running on fumes, incapable of a single wholly original character or relationship. For his grandiose symmetrical photography and audacious camera-work, the guy could be a dead ringer for Kubrick if his stories were up to snuff. Anderson needed a change, and \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is everything he and his audience could have hoped for.It's not just that the film revels in gorgeous traditional stop-motion claymation, rich with its tactile textures and charmingly rippling fur, or the magnanimity of the miniature set-pieces, or backdrops lit with the deep auburns and siennas of perpetual sunset. \"Mr. Fox\" has a story, and a pretty good one at that, courtesy children's author Roald Dahl, adapted for the screen by Anderson and Noah Baumbach. The director's meticulous perfectionism actually feels more at home in the world of animation, which from inception presents the heightened reality he strives for. The dolly shots and intricate sets suddenly service the storytelling rather than primp Anderson's aggressive showmanship.But contrary to what the exuberant color palette and genial clay critters might suggest, \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is not really a film geared to young children, though they'll no doubt appreciate it for the animalistic silliness and amiable pace. Rather it's the subtext, Mr. Fox (George Clooney) and his midlife crisis, which will resonate most with adults. The film has a surprising amount to say about our own animal nature through the anthropomorphizing of its critters, who will frequently drop their civilized countenances to hiss or snarl or gobble down food, but which somehow makes them feel all the more relatable.Case in point, Mr. Fox gives up his danger-prone life of killing chickens to raise a family (taking up a more pedestrian gig in the field of--gag!--journalism), but finds himself drawn back to his life's modus operandi for 'one last big score.' Dahl and Anderson are not afraid to portray unpleasantness, nor do they gloss over the fact that Mr. Fox does some not- especially-nice things to the birds he catches. The film never talks down to a potentially younger audience, and the difference is immediately refreshing when compared to children's films that are merely content to cast nasty creatures as pleasant surrogate humans.\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is the deepest animated movie of the year, and I think the best, if only by a hair. \"The Princess and the Frog\" is a serious contender as well, though being a fairy tale, it often doesn't pack the punch or offer the rewarding surprises Wes Anderson's film does. It actually shares more in common with Spike Jonze's \"Where the Wild Things Are\" than this year's Disney, Pixar, or Dreamworks efforts. \"Mr. Fox\" is more effortlessly charming and poignant that that commendable film, and holds its own among the year's best live action as well. It's a film that pairs adventure with a markedly fresh family drama, tenderness and love with the unpredictable and the untamed.In short, it's a wild animal.",

            "content": "If you are to invent a story about a fox family surviving all the crude farmers in the world, would you also invent a nursery rhyme for it? Of course you will. But the awesomeness in this simple story comes from many other things.The weird, slightly exaggerating human portraits plus the fairy tale set-ups and everything already gave this story an exotic touch. Having George Clooney and Meryl Streep dubbing the Fox couple certainly dumped more grown-up ingredients into it. After so many years of Wallace and Gromit or Coraline, you might just become picky about production values of clay animations. Try to sit through the first minute realizing it's not as polished as other technically-excellent animations, and it will reward you a lot more. Seeing the twitching movements and little mannerisms of Mr. Fox in classic songs is really one-of-a-kind enjoyment. simply put, you don't really need much brain to enjoy it, but you certainly need more sensibility to fetch everything intended.One thing good about fairy tale is you don't really need to explain why the protagonists are robbers, and why do they kill chickens, and stuff like that. Down to its core, it's still a very heart-warming family drama. For the record, if you don't want your little boy to adapt a crime career like Mr. Fox, you'd better sit through this fantastic movie with him because it's gonna render some great sweet family talk!Go to see it! 9/10 for heartwarming fun!",

The plot revolves around a fox who breaks a promise to his wife and continues to raid three local farmers for chickens because it's his natural instinct. The farmers decide to unite and put an end to the culprit once and for all which endangers the fox's family and friends. At this point the fox's natural instinct for survival kicks in and he cleverly sets out a plan to save his loved ones. This movie is clever, witty, quirky, heartwarming and insightful. It contains all of Anderson's idiosyncrasies. I believe Anderson is asking why do we act on some of our natural human instincts? Why can't we resist and be willing to change? I do enjoy all of his works, this is a fun filled joy ride and ranks at the top of his masterful artwork.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's cool quirks and characteristics follow him into the land of stop-motion animation with Fantastic Mr. Fox, an eye-popping, hilarious adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book.It's the timeless tale of Mr. Fox (George Clooney), who has enjoyed a life of doing what foxes do best: prowling for fowl. A prologue finds the dashing rapscallion and his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep) raiding a poultry farm. After they get ensnared by a trap, Felicity announces that she's pregnant, and our plucky fox finds himself trapped in a different sort of cage: parental responsibility. Mr. Fox, after promising his wife he wouldn't thieve anymore, settles into a humdrum life as a newspaper columnist. But he can't suppress his natural friskiness for long.In an attempt to reclaim some thrills and escape the daily doldrums, he plans \"one last heist\" (we've heard that before). The mark: a dastardly trio of farmers - Boggis, Bunce and Bean, whose delectable deposits of chickens, ducks and cider are too delicious to deny. After Mr. Fox makes a mockery of their security by plotting daring - and quite humorous - night raids of their farms, the trio combines forces and goes on the offensive to kill their furry nemesis. The critters burrow deep into the Earth and capture the attention of local media. As the farmers amp up their machinations to bring an end to their clever rival, the animal community is dragged into this war of wits and survival, as Mr. Fox tries to find a way to save his family and friends.As the voice of Mr. Fox, Clooney gives a wry nod and sly wink of a performance, while Streep slips so easily into the vocal role as his stern but loving wife, you don't notice her presence. The entire cast, that also includes Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, seems to be having so much fun you cannot help but imagine them sipping martinis during the voice recordings. While the performances make Fantastic Mr. Fox enthralling and overwhelmingly heartwarming, it's the film's splendid, old-fashioned stop-motion visuals that will win hearts. Wes Anderson's team boundlessly, buoyantly fill each frame with fine flourishes. Each intricately orchestrated frame feels like a gloriously animated page of a picture book. Landscapes resemble carpet remnants and fire extinguishers plume what looks like cotton candy. The adorable animals and the gorgeous environment displayed in the film seem like the felt patches of a children's book that are intended to be caressed against your cheek and held close to your chest. It not only looks scruffily beautiful, but it's hilariously off-balance, warm-hearted, perfectly composed and detailed and casually but meaningfully acted. This last feat is again the result of Anderson's inscrutable perfectionism.The film incorporates all the quiet, improvisational style, dry humor delivery as found in Anderson's cinema, but combined with the proletarian fluidity of the animation; the result for audiences is a gleeful trance-like holiday. Wes Anderson's stop-motion animation is perhaps the purest distillation yet of his nerveless twee cinema of quirk.",

I loved the music and it really set the mood for the movie. The animation was something special. I never expect to be surprised by stop animation and I always think I have seen it all, but there were just some fantastic shots for me. The dialog was fantastic for the most part and the writing was tight in that aspect. The reason that I give it a seven though is because I never connected with the film. I enjoyed all of the aspects of the movie, but it never came together with me. I did not connect with any of the characters and the story never seemed to flow for me with respect to the characters. My favorite character was the mother and she did not do anything and in the end did not have a satisfactory part of the story. I also did not feel any of the joy of being a kid while watching this film; not like with a pixar film. I know it is unfair to compare any movie to a pixar film, but one has to now. One of the biggest issues that I had with the movie was the use of \"cuss\". I felt like it was used to much. By the end of the movie I was getting tired of it and I wished Anderson and Baumbauch used it less and just used their wit, which they have more than 90% of Hollywood combined. I do not know why I did not enjoy this movie. I had my reservations because of the stop motion, but that was actually the most satisfying part of the movie. The biggest thing that the movie lacked for me was a character that was the emotional core of the film. There was nothing for me to connect on a human level. That is why I love Wes Anderson and without the emotional core it is just a quirky stop-motion movie that is a really good movie, but not the movie I was hoping for.",

This is film making at its best, no shiny bells and whistles, just take a story and expand on it and bring it to life. Roald Dhal would have been proud because he was a pretty warped man with a dry sense of humour. There was so much to see in this film, tiny details that if u blink you would miss. The hilarity of them digging and the premise of their lifestyle as wild animals is just genius and just works. Wes Anderson just tells story's how they should be told, there is a reality to his work that separates his films from all the trash that you usually watch. Its the sort of thing that wouldn't work with every film but when he gets it right it works so well. I have to give this an 8/10 for originality, style and overall humour. I will most definitely buy this on DVD and sit and watch after a night out with friends. I can't say that about many other Wes Anderson films.",

Everything is stop motion, from the smoke to the water; you would never notice. It is all of the small details that happen simultaneously that make it feel so real.

            "content": "(www.plasticpals.com) Wes Anderson's trademarked balance of comedy and character study shines through in this stop-motion animated adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox. I was a pretty big fan of Dahl's work as a boy, but somehow this fox escaped me. Anderson's voice cast includes George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon, and his old mainstays Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, and Jason Schwartzman. Despite the big names the film never feels like a Hollywood product thanks to its distinctly hand-crafted look, which eschews the near-CG perfectionism of recent stop-motion films like Coraline.From the first trailer I saw, I felt something about it was a bit off. The anthropomorphic animals' matted fur twitches from the animators' unseen manipulations, creating the effect of a taxidermist's nightmare.This slightly disturbing quality isn't as much of an issue once you settle into it, but is somewhat cringe-worthy in close-ups. That said, the animators were given free reign to push the boundaries of cartoon physics and speed, resulting in highly energetic scenes. Unfortunately, the illusion is broken in a few of the film's scenes due to a lack of fluidity.The story is a charming one. When he moves next to the farms of Boggis Bunce and Bean, Mr. Fox can't help but break a promise to his wife never to steal again. His escapades don't go unnoticed by the farmers, who will stop at nothing to take revenge. Meanwhile, Mr. Fox's son must deal with an unwanted rival in nearly all aspects of life when his talented taller cousin comes to stay with them. The farmers go nuts, all hell breaks loose, and soon all the animals in the area become threatened.Of course, many hilarious hijinks are had throughout, not to mention when Mr. Fox rallies the rest of the animals for one final showdown, winner take all. More so than most animated films, I feel like this one can be enjoyed more by the adults in the audience than the children (judging from the howls of laughter in the cinema).It's a classic, funny tale and great fun to watch.",

There really is so much to see and it seems impossible to take it all in with just one viewing. This film has a look to it that no other movie I can think of has. It's very fascinating to look at. I love the way that the fur subtly moved on the faces of the foxes; a very nice touch.The script is really neat too. Going into it, I was not really sure how this film would come out plot-wise, but I think it really turned out quite nicely. I have said in other reviews that Wes Anderson is my favorite director right now and this film definitely has his style and wit throughout. All the characters are quite interesting as well. One of my favorite scenes was the introduction of the three human villains. It is very memorable and the descriptions used were very impactful. This movie is not realistic, nor does it try to be. Things such as the height of the characters seems to change to fit the desired situation, but that is easily forgiven.

            "content": "As part of my flight to Boston in preparation for our camp, American Airlines had this movie as an option for in-flight entertainment. Given its placement on my watchlist, I figured I would be opportunistic. What do I think?To start with, this film is written in a way that puts it at the middle ground between children's and adult's animation. It adapts Dahl's children's novel into something a tad more heavy-hearted. I won't talk about the story too much since it succeeded in adapting the novel, but its additions (such as the capture of Kristofferson) are written in a way that actually work out in its favor. Our characters benefit from this too, with the combination of familiarity from the novel and somewhat modern twists to their personality (such as Kristofferson's flair for meditation). It actually seems that both our protagonists and antagonists can be sympathized with; out of mere nature, the former want their food and the latter want to keep them away. While the Foxes can be summed up as the usual family of 3, I enjoyed Rat's threatening demeanor, Petey's music, and Kylie's comic stare. What really strengthens the characters, however, is the believable and spot-on voice acting. It fits both the cartoonish influence of Dahl's novel for some characters and the different aim of this movie for others. The stop motion environments feel like they are very comparable to Aardman's work, with the detail on the fields and locations, the unique character models. Like Kubo and the Two Strings, the animation possesses surprising fluidity in the movements of both characters and objects, which is wonderful for its assortment of action/peril scenes.This isn't really a \"children's\" movie as much as it is a family movie. Children will enjoy the cute animals and the similarities to Dahl's work, while adults will enjoy the action, humor, and less light-hearted tone. It's worth 87 minutes of anyone's time, really, and I'll be cussed if anyone didn't end up having a good thing to say about it. OK, maybe once was enough...",

Once again I have not read this book, but as a child read other Roald Dahl books and loved them. So why without enthusiasm, well I guess the story doesn't seem to go anywhere I guess. The end was the end, and that is about that. I liked how every \"cussing\" cus word was said as \"cus\", something cute for adults that still made the film a \"kids movie.\" I also liked the ravenous eating habits as well as the animation technique. I have enjoyed all of Wes Anderson's films including \"The Life Aquatic\" (though marginally in that particular case), and I saw elements of his unique visual style translated into animation. The acting is good with an award winning cast, and the movie is very watchable for children. I am a big kid so I liked it, but I did not love it and do not think this film is for everyone out there, and think even amongst the intellectual sect there is probably much disagreement as to the worth of this film.

The story is brilliant which is to be expected since it's based on a Roald Dahl book, the animation is bright and colourful and is simply superb as it uses the original classic stop motion animation. The voice acting has no faults and the characters were beautifully written and a lot of fun to watch. It's guaranteed to leave you grinning from ear to ear after you finish watching it.When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I must admit I did have some doubts but after putting them aside and watching the movie, I could see I had nothing to worry about as this is truly a classic animation for children and adults to watch. The humour involved in the movie is great and timed perfectly. It surprised me as well because, and I don't know if this is me but, the animation looked choppy and kind of slow yet when watching the animation, it was nice and smooth and ran perfectly. Almost everything about Fantastic Mr. Fox was near enough perfect to how a family animation should be. However, nothing is ever perfect and I doubt I'll ever see a perfect movie. Having said that, this movie comes pretty close to being the perfect family movie. I really do recommend this movie to everyone as I have yet to find a person who didn't fall for the charm of Fantastic Mr. Fox. This will definitely keep the whole family entertained and adults and children will adore it. I thank the cast and the crew for bringing such a classic story to life and making it fantastic.Read more reviews on: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",

While the material might be too snarky and sophisticated for children, adults should enjoy Anderson's refreshing approach. The movie's look is pleasantly off-beat, yet imaginative with superbly designed characters and sweet ingenious action pieces. The truly extraordinary world created on screen is incredibly detailed and resonates with Anderson's style very well. Apart from being a sheer delight to watch, Fantastic Mr. Fox stands as a great story abounding with odd comedic touches and a spark of melodrama thrown inbetween.

            "content": "Out of the many books by children's authors that are adapted to film, the books by Roald Dahl mostly tend to be excellent. Save for Tim Burton's disastrous retelling of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", I have really enjoyed the movies made based on Dahl's books. Now we have another movie that I can happily say is yet another great adaptation. \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is the debut animated movie from famed director Wes Anderson and he was able to craft a movie that can successfully do some elements differently from the book while also adding touches to make the movie memorable. I'll explain why this really works out well.Mr. Fox (George Clooney) and his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep) have given up the life of raiding farms after their only son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). Mr. Fox is now a newspaper columnist and has now moved the family from a burrow to a tree nearby three farms run by three dangerous farmers named Boggis (Robin Hurlstone), Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and Bean (Michael Gambon). Wanting to conduct one last raid, Mr. Fox, his assistant possum Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky) and his nephew Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) steals items from all three farms much to the farmers and Felicity's anger. Wanting to kill the fox, the farmers come along and try to dig the foxes out of their tree only to discover that the foxes keep digging away from the danger. After having led to the destructions of their home and the homes of other critters, Mr. Fox decides to declare war on the farmers in order to fight for their survival.The thing that I really enjoyed about this movie was the script. The script in this movie written by Anderson and director Noah Baumbach was smartly written as well as very funny. Though the movie can be viewed by kids, I think adults well enjoy the movie more mainly due to how adult the film is. The characters talk like people in other movies minus the swear words which Anderson and Schwartzman simply replace with the word \"cuss\". As an example, the character would say something like \"The cuss you would,\" or \"That was the craziest cussing thing I've ever done.\" You might think it would get old fast, but it actually doesn't. I also like how the story can be both faithful and different to the book at the same time. Elements to the story are added, particularly the relationship between Mr. Fox and Felicity and I personally think it's needed to advance the story along and give the characters some depth. As for the animation, it's brilliantly crafted. It's done entirely in stop motion animation without any digital help which I found very impressive. It also included some of Anderson's style into the film as well like the camera angles being mostly centered. I also really enjoyed the characters in the movie. Where in the book they are likable though don't have a lot of personality, here they are given tons of personality and charisma to boast. Even a subplot involving a feud between Ash and Kristofferson which I thought would be the weakest part of the movie was actually really well realized and written. As far as flaws goes, the character designs of the humans did bother me at times due to how odd they were, though they were not too bad to be distracting.\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is a very smart movie with a well written story, some impressive animation and characters with lots of personality and charm to boast. Considering that this is the first animated film from Wes Anderson, I'm really impressed by how much detailed elements went into this film. I'm very eager to see if he continues to make stop-motion movies because I feel he can reach the heights of the people at Aardman and Henry Selick. We'll just have to wait and see.",

The sum of morals exposed in this movie are just too many for me to write about here, however what I can say is that they are delivered seamlessly. The art direction is one that cannot fail, from my point of view. Stop motion has always been something that fascinated me, ever since I first saw \"A nightmare before Christmas\", but that's just me. The acting is well-done and deliver, without being grating. All in all, the movie is one you won't feel pass by you, and that may or may not warrant a second viewing. Bottom line is... watch the movie. I can't say much more than that.",

Now he's a newspaper columnist, yet still gets that itch. When he scratches it, the farmers he steals from decide to get their revenge...As adaptations go, Wes Anderson's take on Roald Dahl's children's classic could be defined as \"loose\". That doesn't make the film unendurable, but it does mean that this film loses just a hint of the magic that other adaps of Dahl's work have.The stop-motion puppetry, though at times a little crude, is still deserving of applause; it's different, you don't see this kind of animation any more. The crudeness actually helps to define it as a Wes Anderson film: slightly off-beat, odd ball with a quietly delicious sense of surreal humour. Why hasn't Anderson done animation sooner? In fact, one could argue that with his style of storytelling Anderson is quietly becoming one of the few auteurs that there are in the world today. An impressive voice cast - recorded out in the real world for most scenes instead of studios - help to bring the story to life, though Anderson's attempts to flesh the characters out sometimes create more of a problem. In particular, Bean the cider farmer (Michael Gambon) is promoted to head villain, whereas in the original novel all three farmers are equal in importance and hate for the fox.The script finishes the main story of the novel two-thirds into the film, before branching out into a rescue mission for an abandoned fox cub. This actually works quite well, and is helped by good jokes, great animation and a nifty score. The music is lovely in this film throughout, including a great cameo by Jarvis Cocker.Purists wont like it, and the very young will probably feel alienated by it, something a closer adaptation might have avoided, but on the whole this is a lovely film, a great addition to Anderson's work. 7/10",

There are scenes in this movie that are still at the top of my favorites list and whenever I get a chance I try to show this movie to as many people as I can. This movie is mainly for adults rather than children, but I'm guessing children could be entertained by it too. I loved the way they skirted around swearing by coming up with a unique way to do it and my friends and I love quoting it around kids and parents, who aren't sure what to make of it when it happens. There is a particular scene where a farmer loses his temper and to this day it makes me fall out of my chair laughing. The wolf at the very end almost makes me lose it too.

This is just as adult as most of Wes Anderson's R rated features, in the sense of the maturity of the plot and character development. The only thing missing from the movie is profanity, which isn't even really that extreme in any of his movies anyway. Mr.Anderson seems to have an obsession with amateur criminals, and this is also prevalent in Fantastic Mr.Fox. Bottle Rocket was the defining movie for a group of idiots trying to be criminals, but even in The Life Aquatic you see the clumsy theft of the sea lab and the ridiculous rescue attempt. In Fantastic Mr.Fox, most of the crimes go fairly well until the consequences are made evident. Ash's attempt to free Kristofferson was an incredibly memorable scene in this movie because of the unprofessionalism that it presented. What was great in this movie was that the characters were so real that you almost forgot they were animals. My only complaint about the film is that a lot of kids will see it and feel confused and possibly not entertained due to the dry humor that it uses.

Yet, that will dramatically miss the point of this great film. The actors voices are perfect for their characters. But, regardless of the actors or special effects, what ultimately makes a movie rise above others (as evidenced by the greatness of the first three Star Wars films, for example, as opposed to the droll final three) is writing and dialog. The combination of Anderson's best dialog of any film he's written or directed with excellent interpretation and the great original story line from Roald Dahl and voil\u00e0 - a fantastic film about a fantastic fox. This simply has not been a banner year for films. In fact, there haven't been many great movies in recent years (one wonders - did all the writers simply quit permanently?).

Now, with the help of amazing Noah Baumbach - writer of 'The Squid and the Whale' and 'Margot at the Wedding' - Anderson wrote a delightful screenplay that made me cry, laugh and cheer through the whole movie. But, let's remark this: this isn't the usual animated film; this deals with real life themes (OK, you may not steal chicken), and, most important, it deals with family relationships even more maturely than most non-family films, in a very funny, imaginative and lovely way.The ensemble voice cast is one the most originally selected (although some of them are Anderson's usual) I've ever seen on films. And, each character has its, well, characteristics: George Clooney (as Mr. Fox) is a strongly passionate - and funny - voice. I cannot think of any other actor to play his role. And, Meryl Streep (as Ms. Fox) made a deliciously sly (and impressively smooth) voice work. Jason Schwartzman also did a fantastic work (as Ash, Mr. and Ms. Fox's son), he is very funny and heartwarming. Also, the rest of the cast (Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe) did an incredibly great work.The photography is amazing, you know? Kind of Royal Tenenbaums-like cinematography. The editing was, also great. And, well, the usual typography in Anderson's movies.Finally, Alexandre Desplat's fantastic score is the juicy cherry at the top of this delicious cake. Lovely, funny and tender. This is the best score of his career.Verdict: A work of utter brilliance. Enjoyable, funny, heartwarming, full of funny scenes and intelligent dialogues. 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is the best picture of the year (and a strong contender for the Oscars). Fantastic Mr. Anderson does it again!10/10",

            "content": "Wes Anderon's signature visual style is without a doubt unique and instantly recognizable in this day and age of cinema. It can be a bit much at times though, as a good part of his audiences will certainly have to agree with. While I will reach a point in most of is movies where I start to get slightly annoyed by the ever symmetrical camera settings and the constant dolly zooms, I have to say Anderson's visual language is absolutely suited for an animated film and not distracting here at all. If you have a hard time with Wes Anderson's work, this might be one for you!Also, the fact they chose stop-motion animation rather than CGI worked out for Anderson's quirky vision. The characters with their slightly rough looks and fuzzy hair have so much detail and character that they feel \"lived in\" and real - not least because of the outstanding, star-studded voice acting.This is where my main criticism comes in:.The characters are in fact so likeable that I would have loved more interaction between them. The movie is rather short and doesn't have the runtime to give most of them a chance of developing any of their potential. For instance, the fox girl Agnes was dragged along for the final scene but had nothing to say or do. This gets really noticable when Mr. Fox includes her in his final speech about being with five very fine animals. Does he even know her? Also, the adversary rat (brilliantly voice-acted by Willem Dafoe) was so much fun to watch whenever he appeared. It was a shame that it was already over after his second scene.Sadly, some of the themes here ranging from \"being different\", having to prove yourself, figuring out who you are (\"foxes are wild animals\") to love/friendship aren't really developed. I could have done without the music number or some of the chase scenes instead of a bit more character moments. Maybe this was a compromise for the kids?I have my doubts how well this works as a family movie - it is no Pixar flick at all. Like Mark Kermode once criticized, it's very talky. And it didn't really have to be at times because the detailed animation could have been enough to speak for itself and convey feelings. The self-aware wit will mostly keep adults invested but it will at times sound awfully a lot like the voice of Wes Anderson. Therefore it has a lot of humor that will go over kids' heads but there's still enough slapstick that it might keep them entertained. Even I did burst out with a laugh a couple of times.",

Only this time you'll find yourself wanting to re-watch scenes and the entire movie over and over again. Stop-motion animation will always have a soft spot in my heart for nostalgic and technical reasons. I always want to see how far they would go and they always remind me of being dazzled by them as a kid. This movie delivers in much more ways than taking you back. Filled with endless quotes and humour that will make even the most robotic viewer bubble-over.I Like Wes Anderson's movies, they always come from a different angle with what the core story is and they always have a unique human element that you can both see yourself in and appreciate. Based on a story from Roald Dahl, we join up with Mr. Fox who is prompted to change his line of work as a poultry thief when his wife, Mrs. Fox, gets pregnant. The world is very detailed and feels very familiar as all the animals interact in an almost seamless human way whilst not abandoning their animal nature. The voice talent casting is superb as all the animals seem justly matched and equally theatrical. The story is very engaging from its start but gets even more-so when Mr. Fox, bored with being and overlooked newspaper columnist decides to don bandit hats with his possum friend, Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky), for one last big job \u2013 stealing goods from the three biggest farmers in the nearby town, Boggis (Robin Hurlstone), Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and Bean (Michael Gambon). This plan, and its success, triggers the three farmers to deal with their fox friend and his family, therein putting all the wood lawn animals under siege and prompting Mr. Fox to be as fantastic as he can to rescue all the animals and get the farmers off of his back. With juggling all of this, Mr. Fox also finds himself at ends in his marriage and we get some Meryl Streep (Mrs. Fox) goodness, which is always sweet. Some fun arcs keep the fluidity of the movie both digestible and add an appreciation to the supporting characters, so much so that it makes you feel that no animal was 'just there'. For example- there is Mr. Fox's son, Ash, who tries his best to prove to his parents that he's not 'different' and has his father's athletic abilities with his efforts getting challenged by the likes of his subtle, thunder-stealing cousin, Kristofferson (Eric Anderson).I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as I didn't know what to expect. It delivers in so many ways from the beautifully illustrated environment,the nuances of each animal and their respective voice actor, the humorous dialogue, the story and the surprise depth of the highlighted characters. It feels like the cast and the production crew had fun with making this movie and viewers always benefit when that happens since glee is contagious. When you realize how painstaking it must've been to add life and unique style to all the characters and make the movie not-feel-like-a-stop-motion-movie for the viewer, the whole mood gets even more relaxed and enjoyable.George Clooney shines in his role as he brings enough cockiness and confidence to Mr. Fox as you'd expect from his stint as Danny Ocean. Wes Anderson doesn't abandon his favourite call guys either; Bill Murray and Owen Wilson both have fitting parts. Another great feature is how Wes blends the movie to appeal to both adults and kids. Its accessible world is engaging enough for the young and the wit in the dialogue is very rewarding for the adults, no one is alienated. Giving the villains the British grit adds another layer to it, especially when you remember Michael Gambon's role in Layer Cake.If there's any way you can organize a group of friends to watch this gem, do so, they will be very thankful for it and the flurry of inside jokes your group would gain is priceless.Standout Line: \"He gets a bandit hat? He just got here and he got a bandit hat? Where's my Bandit hat? Why didn't I get shot at!?\"",

I love the animation style, the color choices, the almost-touchable textures, and thoroughly enjoyed the story itself. What didn't I like? Thankfully, there are very few things I disliked; but my major bone to pick was sadly one of the casting choices. For some reason (maybe I'm just too familiar with him), hearing George Clooney as Mr. Fox himself just didn't gel with me. I just couldn't accept this voice coming from that character, and it was rather hard not to see the person over the puppet. Perhaps if I was younger and had no real idea who Clooney was, it may have set better. In any case, that's really the only serious issue I had with the film itself. The story itself is nothing short of brilliant; it really does have something for everyone without being stupid. It's one of the few \"family\" films lately that has the 'nards to toss a bit of grimness and real darkness into the mix.Mr. Fox's actions DO have very severe consequences, not only for his own family but everyone around him as well. The ending itself is rather ambiguous and somewhat poignant, which suits the tale well. This is a rare and fleeting beauty of a film, see it while you can, and add it to your collection when it comes out.",

            "review_title": "Best comedy of 2009!",
            "content": "When I first heard word of Wes Anderson adapting one of Roald Dahl's books I of course instantly was both interested and concerned. Being a Houstonian I have always felt inclined to support the work of Houston-born writer/director Wes Anderson.Thus far I've enjoyed his dry sense of humor; kind of like an Americanized version of British humor...but it is also very adult, sophisticated humor, so I couldn't imagine him doing a family movie.After seeing the movie I have one thing to say...Fantastic Mr. Fox certainly is FANTASTIC! Wes Anderson has made one of the best films of 2009; one that is just as good as his other movies, if not being his best yet! Everything, from voice-actors, to the use of stop animation: this film is perfectly balanced in what is certainly the best comedy of the year.How did Wes Anderson pull it off? Well, he honestly didn't make this so much as a kid's movie as he did make another entry in his series of odd-ball comedies- only this time cutting back mature subjects to a PG-rating. What results is a very mature comedy that doesn't resort to cheap gimmicks or slapstick for laughs (though there is a bit of slapstick for those kids who won't understand the humor in Anderson's dialog).The story centers on Mr. Fox (voiced by the always entertaining George Clooney), who is the foxiest fox who ever foxed. An expert chicken thief he likes living dangerously...that is until his lover (voiced by Meryl Streep) becomes pregnant and demands that they settle down. After getting caught in a fox trap he agrees to her terms that if they survive he shall never steal again.Two years later (which is far more in fox years) the couple is living in a hole with their son, Ash (Jason Schwartzmen). Mr. Fox is a newspaper columnist, who is fairly certain no one actual reads his column and is now upset that he won't amount to anything (like his father) so he decides they must move out. His choice is a tree, but this tree happens to be located next door to the three meanest farmers the animals have ever seen. His lawyer, Badger (voiced by Anderson regular Bill Murray) tries to talk Fox out of his choice home, but he won't hear it.After moving to the tree they are joined by their nephew Kristofferson (voiced by Eric Chase Anderson) who quickly becomes Ash's center of jealousy. Kristofferson is perfect in just about every way, spending his time meditating while practicing yoga, being naturally gifted in sports - everything Ash wishes he was.But while those trivial matters go on Mr. Fox can't resist the call of the wild, and with his opossum building superintendent, Kylie (voiced by Wallace Wolodarsky) plans a return to his dangerous life of \"cussing with\" the farmers' heads. At first this starts as simple crimes, but soon the farmers declare war against Mr. Fox and the entire animal populace! It becomes the job of Fox save everyone from the farmers' wrath...which he caused! There's also a great (not to mention HILARIOUS) bit involving Willem Dafoe as an insane, finger snapping rat-henchman under the employ of the farmers, but I wouldn't spoil that for the you! You'll have to see the movie to get what I'm talking bout.Fantastic Mr. Fox of course differs from its source material, but for what it is Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great comedy. I say \"comedy\" instead of \"animation\" or \"Family\" movie because its values really are more comedy oriented than they are trying to entertain an entire group of people. In fact, the theater I saw this movie in was full of kids under the age of 10 and very seldom did any of them laugh: the humor was just way over their heads, and I won't hold that against them.For adults and mat kids over the age of 10 or so Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fantasy comedy full of whimsical characters that will leave them chuckling, and quoting its ingenious script long after they've left the theater. Parents can also approve of the film's message of \"everyone has their own individual talents,\" be it thief, landscape artist, or demolitions expert.It won't stand up against a movie like Pixar's Up in a 'Best Animated Feature' contest, but then again I doubt it was even trying to. What the movie does is set out to be a sophisticated comedy - something that is rated PG, but is just as good as any comedy directly aimed at older audiences. Fantastic Mr. Fox is rated PG but is more adult and sophisticated than this year's smash hit The Hangover.Fantastic Mr. Fox truly is the most fantastic movie of the year.",

The visual style is, for the first few minutes, rather distracting and dated. It steadily grew on me, to the point that it became a distinct and unique feature. I can't recall another mainstream feature to use the stop motion technique in this way, in recent years. The visual trickery and inventiveness is impressive, kudos to the team who brought this to the big screen. You see the puppet's hair bristles move constantly, after their positions have ever so slightly changed.The film's big appeal is the humour, and the assembled talent delivers it in spades. Clooney is simply magnificent, completely capturing the lead character's personality, wit and charm. Able support is provided by a star line up - Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon and Meryl Streep. Plenty of jokes that will fly over the heads of younger viewers, perhaps the majority, even. Then again, letting Wes Anderson direct an animation feature, it is to be expected...The British audience I watched this with appeared to thoroughly enjoy the film, there were more single adults than families even though it was an afternoon screening, and I will be fascinated to see how this film does when it gets its Stateside release. It may be too offbeat, both visually and story/humour-wise, to appeal to the Pixar demograph but it is clearly a labour of love, and deserves to succeed.Would watch again on DVD and television.

So who better to discard CGI imagery and take one big step back to good ol' fashioned stop motion animation in order to tell Road Dahl's classic story (with a few liberties taken in the script)? George Clooney's recognizable voice is ideally cast to bring sly Mr. Fox to puppet life, and Meryl Streep, sounding a little restrained, is a pleasure as his wife - that would be Mrs. Fox. Long-time Anderson regulars (Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and - yes - Bill Murray) lend their voices to all sorts of critters. The story eases along fluidly with wryly funny - but not sitcommy - dialogue, and the scenery is so stunningly beautiful that you tend to forget how many hours of work must have gone into this little gem.

But then this out of ordinary and interesting stop motion picture goes down the drain, turning into yet another boring and somewhat stupid animation; with a climax (of this stupidity) in a form of jumping a fence on a motorcycle, by using a ramp that was placed there apparently for no logical reason. Yeah, let us just turn this movie into shallow action comedyAfter witnessing that jump scene, no sane film enthusiast should dare to speak of this cinematic endeavor in terms of having a proper script.

Indeed, after a few minutes you mostly forget you're watching an animated movie as there's little difference between this and Anderson's other films. His signatures are very much at home here and really feel alive in this new environment.It's quite refreshing to watch an animated film that doesn't rely on puns and slapstick humour. The characters are interesting and the tone was so low key that even the more ridiculous elements have a soft landing. It's a children's movie where actions have consequences while also featuring better heist planning than Ocean's Eleven. Remarkable.As film scores can make or break an animated film, it was critical for first-time Anderson collaborator Alexandre Desplat to not only deliver a quality animated score, but to reconcile that with Anderson's style. Desplat manages to do both and, not surprisingly, went on to work with Anderson on Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel.In the end, Fantastic Mr. Fox is not so much a movie that makes you feel like a kid again as it is a children's movie that's grown up.

In the end, I can't promise everyone will enjoy it as much as we did. It depends on your sense of humor re: what you think is funny. However, for us it had at least two \"laugh out loud\" moments, spontaneous laughs where you even surprise yourself.

The thing it's hard to grasp when watching this movie is the weird, unsettling mix of family comedy and slightly dark humor. It's not exactly a simple \"animals vs humans\" story. The main character is a predator, a thief, a mischievous creature reformed by his family life. Alongside him there's his unsatisfied teen son who envies his more likeable cousin, his patient wife, his neighbors. There's a pretty obvious social subtext about an underclass rebelling, about \"selling out\", the need for adventure. There's a lot of mixed emotions in the characters actions and reactions, a cheerfulness that sort of hides (or cures) a deep existential angst among all of the characters. I personally wish that these darker tones were developed a little bit more instead of being just a slight aftertaste, but otherwise this movie is a perfectly nice, fun, colorful and thoughtful adventure.",

The film's setting is clearly Home Counties England, somewhere between Reading and Cheltenham, but the half-Norwegian Dahl was such an Americanized writer that I never really thought of him as really English, so I had no problem with the American actors who played the animals.The charm of the film is in its unpretentious sets and its refusal to engage in grand themes. That movie-trailer scene of Clooney/Foxy looking at the stars and wondering why he's a fox and not a badger--that seems to be joke about all overwrought film scripts. The film ends with a dance in a supermarket--what could be less pretentious or more open-ended? I do feel it is a shame that more couldn't be done with Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox. She has nothing to do but stand around and be the wary, censorious wife. Most of the other characters are variants of the Wes Anderson stock company we've been looking at since 'Bottle Rocket,' and that's fine with me, but it makes the characterization flatter than it needs to be. The most exciting character is Willem Dafoe's rat, who never gets a chance to develop.Still, it's all very pleasant and technologically interesting, without ever hitting you over the head with techno-innovations and philosophical pain.

            "content": "Wes Anderson is an interesting figure. Maybe you've heard of him, maybe you haven't, but one things for certain: his works are amazingly unique. Sure, films like The Life Aquatic lack the coherence of other works such as Moonrise Kingdom, Fantastic Mr. Fox (hey!), and The Grand Budapest Hotel, but even at his worst, it's easy to find at least one thing to adore about his films. Now enter Roald Dahl. A prominent writer of books for Children (although, they do certainly still hold appeal to those older) who sadly passed around 2 decades ago, his style is a perfect blend of quirky. The way he tells his stories is so ingenious, and the same could be said about the characters that inhabit those little worlds. A Roald Dahl adaption by Wes Anderson is not something I realized was a match made in heaven until I saw Fantastic Mr.Fox, which, like the first word of it's title, is a kids film that should not be ignored.Wes Anderson is a mastermind when it comes to cinematography, and surprisingly, the same could be said about his hand in Stop-Motion Animation. The environments here are amazingly done, and the tone they convey is so perfect. It may be a quirky, up-lifting piece targeted at the little ones, but each location oozes atmosphere in a charming way. The presentation is nothing short of amazing, and, as typical with Wes Anderson pieces, melds so well with what happens on screen that it doesn't become a part of the movie you don't really notice, it essentially becomes a key point to notice when viewing. The animation on display is also outstanding. Puppet movement is never chunky enough for you to laugh at it for the wrong reasons, but the puppets themselves are silly enough for you to laugh at it for reasons that display just how much fun everybody invested had.Enough about the style, what about the substance? First off, the performances. There are few performances that would crumble a movie should they not be in the final product, and there are few examples that stand out to me more than George Clooney as Mr.Fox. His voice work matches up with the animation so well that I struggled at moments to envision him hunched over a microphone recording the lines given to him. Every line is said with attitude that fits deeply with the character, the enthusiasm and emotion is present to a point where it is no longer just a man pretending to be a fox puppet in some studio, but rather, a man who IS a fox puppet (as weird as that may sound). As for the rest of the performances, also amazing. I never heard a voice that I thought didn't match up with what I was seeing, and everybody in the cast seemed to enjoy what they were doing just so much. I never quite heard a voice that sounded weak, droopy, and bored.And then there's the writing. In my opinion, this is one of the best Wes Anderson films, even if it wasn't technically filmed in the traditional sense. The script, which he wrote with Noah Baumbach, is filled to the brim with charm, humor, and fun. The lines never came out as cheesy to me, and anything that might come remotely close is great, regardless. The real question that remains in a potential viewers head for an adaption, however, is simple: 'how faithful is this to it's source material?'. The book itself, which I haven't read myself in many years, is amazing, and though this film does add bits and pieces to that already established narrative, none of those bits and pieces never seemed to find a way to mess with what should be amazing. Dahl's quirky charm is almost on point with Anderson's, which works wonders as anything not originally there certainly feels like it could have been.Maybe a 10 is too generous, (I don't always see a fault where there are some, after all) but I really do think that Fantastic Mr.Fox is an excellent gateway to the works of Wes Anderson, one that excels greatly as a film itself. It's animation is, in layman's terms, brilliant, and it's perfect presentation fits that quite well. It oozes charm, and it's performances, especially that of Mr.Clooney, are notable as well. It's a brilliant adaption and a film that is, dare I say it, fantastic.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's very unorthodox take on Roald Dahl's classic Fantastic Mr. Fox really shows what animation can do. Here, fabled director Anderson, known for his hipster-esque style and dry humor, portrays the story of a fox who, going through a mid-life crisis, decides to get back into his old line of work and start stealing chickens again. Though the story is simple, the aesthetics and overall emotional appeal of the movie is astounding.Some might scoff at motion-stop, but the animation really does fit well with the film. The world it is set in is charming and colorful, and the movement of the characters is realistic when it needs to be, and cartoonish when it doesn't. The whole barrage of stars that lent their voices for this film is pretty impressive\u2014George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson. These actors portrayed their respective characters very well, making their lines sound natural and lifelike. From Davy Crockett to the Beach Boys, this film also features an eclectic, yet appropriate, range of songs.I found Fantastic Mr. Fox most memorable for all of the little things. Every gesture, every facial expression, every under-the-breath comment from one of the characters adds to the film. In just about every scene you can find something interesting going on in the background, things you probably won't notice the first run through. The movie beckons you to pay close attention so you can truly get all of its emotional undertones and quirky character nuances. These little things may not ultimately contribute to the overall story of the movie, but that's not a bad thing. It's refreshing to see a movie that includes these unnecessary details that adds depth to the characters and environment (even if they are puppets!). In fact, I found these characters to be more lifelike and relatable than those in many live-action films. The chemistry between them is great, and even casual, seemingly unimportant conversations among these woodland creatures left me chuckling (\"No you're not. You're disloyal.\"). Though a dry and somewhat awkward comedy, it can also be touching or even profound at moments, making it a very enticing film indeed.Though marketed as a children's movie, it is obvious that this film has something for people of all ages. For anyone a fan of Wes Anderson, Roald Dahl, or animation in general, I wholeheartedly recommend this vastly underrated film. Anderson is off on the right foot for this genre, making me await any animated film he hopefully comes out with next.",

            "content": "Based on the famous book by Roald Dahl with the same name, the story narrates the life of Mr. Fox (Clooney) who lives life by raiding nearby farms. When he learns of his wife's pregnancy, he decides to quit his hobby in favour of the family and their to-be child. Two years later (Twelve in fox years) Mr. Fox, Mrs. Fox (Streep) and their son Ash (Schwartzman) move to a new hole under a tree which is close to the fields of three farmers; Boggis (Hurlstone), Bunce (Guiness) and Bean (Gambon). When Ash's cousin Kristofferson (Anderson) comes over to stay over the weekend, Ash feels insecure when everyone praises him and his capabilities over Ash. With Mr. Fox feeding his family with his nightly jaunts, the farmers are tired of the thefts and decide they need to get rid of Mr.Fox once and for all. The movie is made in stop-motion animation technology which gives it a good childish look and feel. Roald Dahl wrote books for children and the movie too aims to target the same segment with the movie. However, in spite of the movie being made for a younger audience the movie can still be very entertaining to the mature mind too. It is a great wholesome entertainer that people of all ages would enjoy. This is what you call a well-rounded entertaining movie.",

            "content": "When I see movies, I simply shoot for story's that seem worth telling and one's that seem to be told well. I don't give much thought to the genre or target audience of the film. Thus, I was initially surprised to see several children in the theatre for this movie until I remembered the source material. By the time the end credits were rolling, I wanted to ask the kids in the theatre whether they enjoyed the movie or not. I couldn't help but wonder how I would have felt had I seen it when I was 7, 8, or 9. It would have had an odd effect on me, indeed.This is not a traditional animated film, even if it does use one of the more traditional forms of animation. It is not always straightforward and direct nor does it even try to keep the senses fully satisfied during every second. In fact, the soundtrack can be very quiet at times with only simple, low level foley effects added in to what would otherwise be silent stretches with no music to dictate the emotions with. I can imagine that I probably would not have enjoyed it as a child, because my taste was limited to what fulfilled my superficial expectations.But kids should be taken to see this just so they can experience something different, yet in a familiar format. There is a lot that's expressed with these characters. Much of the narrative deals with finding one's identity. Mr. Fox asks:\"Why a fox? Why not a horse, a beetle, or a bald eagle?\"But nevertheless he is a fox, and in his attempt to live up to his desire of being \"fantastic,\" he does what he does best and hatches up a master plan to steal from some rather mean farmers who in turn seek vengeance. This gets not only Mr. Fox, but the surrounding community running for their lives. Meanwhile, his son deals with insecurity after the arrival of his perfect cousin.The script is witty, at times hilarious, and layered and Anderson makes nice use of the photography. His quirky direction is fitting to the main idea presented: we are all different, but \"there is something fantastic about that.\" We have our abilities and inabilities and I suppose we can change how we feel about them. In the end, we just are who we are and do what we do and sometimes it might mean that no matter what we do to redeem ourselves, we are just another dead rat behind a Chinese restaurant.",

Fantastic Mr. Fox is a really unique type of animated film. It's stop-motion and it wouldn't be the last time director Wes Anderson using stop-motion. Isle of Dogs uses the same technique (look forward to seeing a review of that soon). This film also uses a lot of wide shots throughout its runtime. I'm not complaining since it helps create and how \"fantastic\" this film is.Voice actors give great performances as their characters. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, the list goes on! Such a unique cast for a really unique awkward but funny movie. I hope to see them in other movies by Wes Anderson. I adore this film of its quirkiness and creativity and this film is a really underrated masterpiece.Overall, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a really good animated movie! I love the story, cinematography, voice acting, and the quirkiness of this magnificent fantastic story. Feel free to leave your thoughts on the comments below!",

            "content": "First of all, I've never gotten into Wes Anderson's work. I mean, he clearly has the talent and the smarts to direct a film, but his meticulously designed set-ups and dry humor and wit just sort of makes me feel unsatisfied and longing for something more whole and meaningful after the movie is done.So, as you can guess, I was really surprised to be impressed by this film, which stays close to Anderson's usual motifs and quirks without becoming too alienating for young children, or too repetitive compared to his other films such as The Darjeeling Limited. Not only that, but's it's made in old-fashioned, 70's-esque stop-motion animation which clearly wears the time and loving care went into it on it's sleeves.All the main characters are likable, with each of them getting equal screen time. None of them are complete idiots which is so prominent in today's animated cartoons and feature lengths. Also, they're all so nicely dressed in neat little human outfits, which gets the film bonus points.The dialogue is laced with clever jokes, puns, quips, conservations, and arguments that reflect the film's \"hipster\" atmosphere.The music is amazing, and clearly influenced by bluegrass, folk, and Eastern music cultures. With that, I suggest you get the soundtrack after seeing the movie.Without any doubt, this is the best out of all the animated movies this year. Actually, it might be this year's best movie PERIOD.9/10",

These two natures are always in balance in this movie, so the spectator doesn't forget that while acting just like humans, they don't stop being wild creatures. This film reminds you that even if we live in a civilization with many rules, we have dreams and deep desires that we must satisfy. That is something that every person needs to do at some point of their lives, and that is what Mr. Fox does.",

The members family test each other in trying times and find redemption in the end, though that is where the similarities end. The cinematography is rich and colourful, very Wes Andersonish (whatever that means). I left the theatre feeling content and reflective.

We are the parents of a typical 10 year old boy and a typical 7 year old girl (and a 2 month old baby, but he doesn't exactly watch movies at this point haha). We are all fairly well educated, but not excessively literary or critical. We watch plenty of movies, but we also miss lots of movies.Okay, we really really liked this movie. At first, I was worried because it seemed a little strange in the first few minutes. I was concerned about the animation, and the colors. I have never read any book related to this story, so I went with pretty much no other expectations. The movie is excellent. The character development is fantastic, the voices and voice acting were spectacularly done. The animation was really pleasant, and their funny little touches and attention to detail really make this an excellent movie.My kids also really enjoyed the show. There was plenty of humor, and true-to-life situational humor to keep you chuckling almost all the way through the show. But at the same time, you really find yourself liking the characters, even the bad guys.In a way, I feel that the show picked up on a lot of that which was good in early cartoons (like Bugs Bunny or Wile E Coyote), but in a modern, highly entertaining way. Not that this movie resembles those cartoons at all, because it doesn't ... just that there is an element to the humor that was used in those old shows that seems to be missing in most of the cartoons these days.We all enjoyed this movie, and ARE recommending it to everyone we know.",

            "content": "There are many criticisms towards Wes Anderson films, mainly, that they are pretty to look at but do not have much beneath the surface. To that I respond if you do not see anything beneath it's because you are not looking. Fantastic Mr. Fox is like many of Anderson's past endeavors: The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Darjeeling Limited. It's centered around the importance of family and what you will do to protect them.Mr. Fox is fantastic, as his wife and his children, but being fantastic sometimes isn't enough. Tired of the inertia of daily life Mr. Fox steals from the top three farmers in the area in an effort to reclaim some of that, \"pure wild animal craziness\". Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) seeking a responsible husband to take care of her and her children wants no part of his coop-raiding days and seeks an end to all of it. Unfortunately Mr. Fox does not heed her advice and Boggis, Bunce and Bean launch an all-out war against Fox and his family.George Clooney was perfect casting for Mr. Fox, the suave, sly and often persuasive head of the Fox family who realizing he is reaching up there in years decides to just be what he is - a wild animal. Uncharacteristic to most of Mr. Clooney's roles, however, is the emotional vulnerability he lends to Mr. Fox. Despite the smooth polished exterior he has created, Mr. Fox is not all that different from his introverted son, Ash.Anderson's latest brings back some of the fun of Rushmore that Darjeeling lacked and it shows. The earth tones used to create the home of the characters evoke a warm, friendly feeling and ground the story in a way that sometimes The Life Aquatic did not. It really is a pleasure to see stop-motion animation revived and done so well.Led by an excellent voice cast headed by Clooney, Streep, Schwartzman, Dafoe and Murray(see 9, this what an actual ensemble animation film looks like) each character is fleshed out effectively to avoid cardboard cutouts.",

            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox is not just the ultimate Wes Anderson film; it's also one of the most unique works of art ever released, an instant classic for kids, adults, hipsters, and the rest of us at large. It captures a magic that few, if any filmmaker has ever been able to find, and moves Anderson from beloved to genius.Based on the classic Roald Dahl tale, Anderson's take follows Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) through his mid-life, or 7 year-old crisis. Once a talented and adventurous bird thief, he now finds himself living in a hole with a dead end job, a beautiful wife (the perfect Meryl Streep) and a disappointment of a son (stand-out Jason Schwartzman). After an impulsive move into a larger home within a tree trunk and a visit by his talented nephew Kristofferson, Mr. Fox finds himself drawn back into his old ways and into the chicken coups of big box farming operators Boggis, Bunce, and Bean (Michael Gambon).Like all Anderson movies (most notably The Royal Tenebaums), this film occupies a strange mental and physical space that's both beautiful and intriguing, always evoking a nostalgia that you can't quite place but know deep in your heart. But unlike his other films, it's as if everything that is Wes Anderson was finally allowed to fully germinate and blooms in this entirely stop motion film. Every shot contains an inventive touch that hearkens back the genius of Chuck Jones' Looney Tunes and the twisted beauty of Dahl's England, the town and interiors mirroring Dahl's own home and village. One of the most beautiful and haunting scenes is a glimpse of a wolf across the road; an iconic image that has forever been burned on my brain. The scene pictured below is another example (especially when the boys turn off the lights and switch on a play train that slides into the \"real\" train on the outside), so rich in atmosphere that it leaves me smiling every time I get a glimpse of it.Anderson is known for being an obsessive, difficult, and anal-retentive director, all characteristics that allowed him to complete such an impressive work. The film is flawless in its execution. Close-ups on the foxes' faces are expressive and incredibly lifelike. Smoke and flowing water feel real and visceral even if they are just a few cotton balls strung together. Most importantly, the foxes and celebrity voices melt into their surroundings, allowing the film to shake off any box it might have been forced into. Combined with the hilarious, snappy script by Noah Baumbach (Anderson fanboy of The Squid and the Whale fame), you forget you're watching animals or Clooney on screen and fall in love with each character independently.The music is the final piece of the puzzle. Anderson throws a mix of Beach Boys, Burl Ives, and The Wellingtons among others, my favorite being the inclusion of the love story from Disney's Robin Hood (which starred two foxes).I don't know what else to say, other than it's utterly, indelibly, and totally fantastic. You'll just have to see it yourself.",

George Clooney, Meryl Streep and small parts from Anderson usual's, Murray and Wilson make up the extraordinary cast. The characters are unique and develop throughout the film. Mr. Fox is a animal trying to find freedom from his boring, monotonous day, and Badger is a hot-headed lawyer. The writing is top notch, and never gets boring, and the music is perfect for the movie.

The technical work and cinematography was great as well.

If the next words out of your mouth is \"No cuss, Sherlock, it's real figures being photographed\" you saw the film and you're a fan after my own heart). The fur was surprisingly well done.

Wes Anderson is definitely a director who carries specific traits to all his films and although I enjoyed \"The Darjeeling Limited\", and \"Rushmore\" wasn't BAD or anything, I still don't get the fuss over \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\" (is it the ironic surreal \"humour\"? the soundtrack? Bill Murray?). To sum up Anderson's tac to film-making is simple: \"off-beat, ironic, absurdist sense of humour\". However, it often fails, and in the case of \"Fox\", the frequent (yet sparsely successful) stabs at humour arguably get in the way of what could (and again arguably should) be a whacky inventive narrative. Despite this, the film was an interesting experience - most notably because I initially persisted to attempt to view it as a child's film - when on the whole, it really isn't and it's plain to conclude from a number of conversations that it really wanted to be 'adult' and swear and talk about sex. Considering the reputation of the title's original novel, this is a reality that ultimately couldn't materialise - which is a real shame because I think the humour might have actually worked if it could. I wasn't entirely impressed by the soundtrack either sadly. If perhaps Anderson had asked Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo to write music like he has done on so many occasions already (suitably a veteran in soundtrack-writing for children's programming -repeat 'children's'), I could be claiming different. I won't say the movie's bad because honestly, it isn't really. Most Roald Dahl stories, no matter how wide a film treatment can be, always seem to wind up finishing excellent and though I probably wouldn't choose to watch this film again, it has its place.",

            "review_title": "Typical Wes Anderson quirkiness, this time in stop-action.",
            "content": "Even though Fantastic Mr. Fox was a stop-action movie allegedly meant for children, you could still tell undeniably that it was a Wes Anderson production. It's fair to say that throughout the years Anderson (who is only 40!) has garnered a strong cult following (other notable films of his include: The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Darjeeling Limited). Though his movies are often offbeat and a bit funky, I think they pack a lot of heart. They give a perhaps skewed yet sincere perspective on the world and on basic human relationships. Since I'm a sucker for strange movies, I'm a fan; I have a lot of respect for his interesting, unique style and I was pleased that Fantastic Mr. Fox kept the same feel.One of the most obvious reasons Fantastic Mr. Fox is similar to his other movies, is that the same ever-present group of Anderson's favorite actors made their appearances (albeit in cartoonish animal form this time): Bill Murray as a badger-lawyer, a Wilson brother (Owen this time) as a gym coach, and Jason Schwartzman as Mr. Fox's son, Ash. These friends help make Anderson's movies what they are and I can't imagine not having them.In a similar vein, I was impressed by the number of other big names doing voices (George Clooney, Meryl Streep, William Dafoe, Michael Gambon AKA Dumbledore). This probably points to the fact that Anderson is getting a lot of street cred in Hollywood these days, as he deserves, and people are really taking him seriously. Though I'm sure everybody in LA has known he's a genius from the very beginning.As far as dialogue goes, Fantastic Mr. Fox retained Anderson's subtle humor and cool-headed/almost passive/laid-back observations of life. How can I explain this? Sentences are short and super-condensed. They are to the point. There were many quirky obsessions, like the word \"cuss.\" Though naturally there was action and drama, the way the characters talk makes it seem like everything is under control. Or maybe it's that all his characters have resigned to the fact that life is life and we can't change things. Do we take it seriously or can we laugh at it? Both maybe:Ash: You should probably put your bandit hat on now. Personally, I- I don't have one, but I modified this tube sock. Kristofferson: You look good. Ash: Yeah, I do.Finally, even though it was via a new medium, the movie maintained Anderson's interesting way of shooting scenes. I may also lack an accurate way of describing it, but I certainly know it when I see it. His shots are slow and the camera stays in one place and lets the small things happen. In a way, we see things in the same way his characters talk- quiet/still.Which brings me to another interesting point about this movie: Stop-action animation. The eyes of the characters were strange. It felt like the color scheme was brown and orange, making it seem straight from the 70's. Most films using this medium are meant for children. And, although there were lots of kids in the theater, I'm not so sure they connected with this story as much as they would, say a Disney movie. I think lots of the subtleties of the dialogue and many of the jokes were lost on them.The story was amusing and felt like an old fashioned fable with a lesson involved (something the kids may have been able to pick up on): don't be greedy. Also, be yourself. So, I for one enjoyed watching this movie, quirks and all.",

            "review_title": "A Cuss of a Good Film",
            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.I am a big fan of stop motion animation, but that medium is not universally enjoyed. This is one of the best stop motion movies I have ever seen, and it is clear that a tremendous amount of effort was put into it.Stop motion is a difficult medium of filmmaking, with each frame needing to be individually posed which can cause movement to appear unnatural. However this film manages to avoid this at most points. The places where flaws are most noticeable are also scenes in which it is intentional. It's clear a great deal of care was put into this movie with each model being beautifully detailed and even somewhat informative of the characters personality.The camerawork is surprisingly good for a stop motion movie and feels as fluid as a traditional movie. The great camerawork coupled with the lovely scenery work together to create a movie that is visually stunning for a stop motion film.Despite the great detail to the visuals, the best aspect of this movie is possibly the writing. The plot is fairly straightforward, with the main characters having at least some form of development. In this case the simplicity works well, as it provides a means for the character motivation and development.The movie is accessible to all ages, and works well as a family movie, but unlike many movies of that type is not simply a children's movie. The movie handles many concepts (which other family movies may shy away from) in a charming way. For example: the word \"cuss\" is used in place of any potential harsh language. As someone who doesn't like the sanitization of children's media, I actually felt this was a great substitution. Rather than remove the effectiveness of swearing in language, the substitution makes it acceptable for younger children but not boring for older audiences. I was actually quite impressed by the balance achieved between media for younger audiences and older audiences.One of the strongest aspects of this movie, is its accessibility. Most people could find something to enjoy in this movie, but in the most genuine way possible. Many movies which try this end up lacking direction or become annoyingly predictable, yet Fantastic Mr Fox does not fall into this trap. This is achieved through the family dynamic, which is both believably complex yet easy to understand.Ultimately this movie offers an enjoyable family experience, and its family status does not cheapen the experience for watching it outside of the family setting.Final score: 96/100",

            "review_title": "Works for all the family",
            "content": "Context: Saw this at a kids showing on a Saturday morning (quid each), with the whole family hoping that Mr Fox crosses the demographics correctly, entertaining my three year old son and four year old nephew as well as me, an established fan of Wes Anderson's work and my wife who neither loves nor loathes his other films.The kids: Well by the end of the film the kids were still sat there and hadn't become bored or restless. My son particularly liked Mr Fox's whistle clicky thing and attempted to replicate it at every instance. The animation was easily entertaining enough to hold their attention and have them laughing along, commenting and shouting out what was happening on nunerous occasions.As for me, I was more than happy with the pacing of the film, the characters within and the overall message. Controversial as this may be, I didn't think too much to Life Aquatic and I still haven't seen Darjeeling, so after hearing bad things about this one from most commentators at the time of its release, I was apprehensive. The dialogue between characters had Anderson's stamp all over it and gave all the characters the depth that they required.I liked the overall theme of the film; the animal characters seemingly representing independent retailers: mere mortals up against the conglomerates realised in this film through the form of the big farmers. All evil in their own right but led by one particular cold blooded, cider brewing machine-farmer. This all sounds very clich\u00e9 at the minute, which is all fine but things that follow the structure too definitively often bore me a little too much and end up too average. I think this film really drifted from this when approaching its conclusion. Mr Fox wanted out of the life he was in and wanted bigger things; the usual message here would be for this to fail and him to go \"oh yeah, everything was fine before and I should go back to that with my tail between my legs\". Well this film does neither this nor have his new vision a success, instead a new outcome is reached. The animals live in a new environment: a sewer that can easily be seen to represent a modern urban setting. What this means to me is that individuals/society can rise from a traditional and more recognisably natural level, whilst not succumbing to 'the man'. They can live in a new setting, not growing the way that people envisage they should just because that's how people did in previous generations, being defined by class and the family skill set that you are born into; you can decide who you want to be and create your own little narrative. This does not mean that you have to sell your soul, benefiting only yourself and thus lose your humanity. Nor does it mean that you reject the idea of skilled individuals in a society being masters of their class and contributing together for the benefit of society as a whole, hence the fact that all these tradesmen: the lawyer, the tailor, etc all live in this sewer environment. The part that tops this off, the icing on the cake if you will, is that it does not look down upon the establishment of the farmer (conglomerate) owned supermarket, rather it shows that free individuals can exploit these resources rather than being dictated to by them.This overall message celebrates the state of contemporary western society rather than being hopelessly and nostalgically conservative. It shows that there are flaws but that this is how we are, we have got to this point by following our hearts, rather than doing what others consider to be the right thing. Just as Mrs Fox condones Mr Fox's irrational actions that jeopardize the lives of his friends and family; she condones this because she understands that to suppress one's real life is far worse even if it is the safer option.www.destroy-apathy.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Forced to watch this movie as part of a school project after reading the book, I was not particularly looking forward to this one. I ended up liking it, however. I have a deep respect for stop-motion animators, not only because they laid the groundwork for the mind- blowing special effects of today, but also because of the countless hours they put into their work-- and it shows here. The best part of the movie is undoubtedly the animation; unless you're a huge Roald Dahl fan, that's the reason you're going to watch this. The film also has a star-studded voice cast and an enjoyable, if eccentric, score. The film almost certainly would have won Best Animated Feature if the near-flawless Up hadn't come out in the same year. Kids should be reasonably entertained, and adults will be charmed as well.On the negative side, the film adds to, shuffles around, and changes the source material drastically, but even the most die-hard fans of Dahl will admit that there wasn't a whole lot to turn into a feature-length film to begin with. Some of the additions work, and some definitely feel tacked-on and unnecessary. The film also markets itself as being \"hilarious,\" which it is not; it is occasionally humorous at best. There are also a few glaringly obvious CGI insertions at times, which take the viewer out of the experience a bit.Overall, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fun family film with outstanding animation and plenty to entertain audiences with for its 87-minute run-time. Get the kids and some popcorn, and enjoy this visual treat.",

The idea of pinning on bits before and after the time frame of the book, and the addition of more storyline about the Fox family was well done, too.As per usual, the music in the film was well chosen and added to the fun element.

Clooney and Murray are both very funny - I thought Meryl Streep was pretty flat. A lot of the visual gags and the witty, modern script is funny for adult viewers.I have 2 beefs with this movie: 1) It strays very far from the tone and conception of the book. Probably any attempt to turn a short children's book into 90 minutes of screen time requires lots of padding, extra characters, story, and scenes. The characters are all turned into hip modern (sub)urbanites. If you haven't read the book, this won't bother you.2) This film is marketed as a kids movie, or at least \"family-friendly\". Unless you're comfortable with a lot of transparently-veiled swearing, you may conclude (as I have) that this movie is not for family viewing. As stated in the parent's guide, \"Instead of using profanity, characters say sentences that would contain a swear word, but the word is replaced by the word \"cuss\". What is not stated is that not 5 minutes goes by in this movie without a swear replacing \"cuss\" for f*** (apparently Anderson has an infatuation for the f-word). Also, the characters use the same tone and inflection as if they were really swearing - \"What the cuss!?\" \"cluster-cuss\", etc. The ratings board was really asleep at the wheel giving this film a PG rating with all the transparent swearing going on. Ruined an otherwise good movie for me.",

HIs movies were no longer making me feel anything, they were just eye candy and no more.Boy, has he got it back his mojo. More than ever.I was a fan of this book when I was a kid, and I just loved what he did with it. Great casting, amazing visual, and so much warmth and meaning along with all the great visuals and music. Style AND substance. George Clooney and Meryl are just perfect, and Jason Schwartzman and Eric Anderson are funny and subtle as two young foxes. I didn't want it to end. Wes, you're the greatest director living.",

            "content": "Roald Dahls written work has taken on a life in the form of film. His stories are often darkly comedic and occasionally find themselves bordering the morbid. But that is the beauty of Dahls storytelling, he does not flinch from the notion that children can be adult and adults can be childish. Nowhere has this been more evident than in Wes Anderson's adaption of Fantastic Mr Fox. The film dives into what it means to be a father and husband, and the relationship of his family, and also explores issues of class struggles. Wes Anderson presents the film to his audience with his old-school stop motion animation, it's beautifully portrayed. There is a constant use of warm colours which were used to depict the humans and animals in the film, the colour scheme is also involved with the characters and their costumes. Anderson also uses wide camera shots, to make the movie easier to watch, while using the rule of thirds, having the most important element in the middle of the screen. Wes Anderson has a flawless filming style and a beautifully shot film.",

Once you sink into it though and you enter the imaginary world its a blast. Its great to watch a film that appeals to adults and kids and isn't dumbed down. There are actually some parts that may freak out or perplex some children, but on the whole its very accessible to all.George Clooney is likable as the conflicted Mr Fox, who just cant stay out of trouble, Meryl Streep puts in a solid performance as Mrs Fox and Bill Murray is his usual droll self as Badger, Fox's lawyer. Jason Schwarztman is also memorable as Fox's emotionally strained son. Anderson regular Owen Wilson makes a cameo and his vocal inflection is actually perfect for this form.Having not read the original book I entered this with a fresh perspective, my friend who has read it numerous times still enjoyed it. It serves as a fun ride on its own and a nice progression in Wes Anderson's career. A great start to the 2010 film year.",

            "content": "I don't do this very often anymore but I feel this review needs to be written.Let me start off by saying that I'm a big Wes Anderson fan. I've seen every movie with the exception of two until today which leaves me with just Isle of Dogs to watch next to catch up on all of his works.Everything about this movie is perfectly done. It's a very difficult film to critique negatively and even in the scenes where you can see the reflections of the guys doing the stop motion photography in the windows, it fits just fine. Again, everything was done well. You have the proud and highly successful father stifled by the responsibility of practical adulthood, the mother with a past, a child of seemingly little significance but incredible mental resilience but is relentlessly mocked and ignored, a relative child that is perfect at everything that gets virtually all of the admiration from the world in every moment, and a character that seemly exists purely to break the 4th wall in every scene. You also have a wonderful cast of supporting characters with their own clearly defined traits and skills to aid in the progress of the story. As the story progresses each character experiences growth in a realistic way; friendships are formed, fights start and end, disagreements about decisions arise, and neighbors quarrel and makeup. Throughout the film we see the characters battle through adversity and go from being distant neighbors in the wide open country to close friends packed into the urban setting. As they become physically closer they also become more reliant on each other and more recognizably part of each other's lives in a positive way.The animation was done flawlessly, the actors chosen to play each role were chosen perfectly, the acting was immaculate. The way that swearing without swearing was written in was one of the best gags I've ever seen in a movie because as a kid you're just hearing them say the word \"cuss\" without being able to fill in the blank; as an adult you know what they've said and more or less hear them say it only to have to remind yourself that they only actually said \"cuss\". This is a movie that anyone can sit down with anyone else of any age and it's going to be safe and fun but it'll have something for everyone. Even when CG is used, it is used properly as an effect to enhance rather than the core of the animation in the film. It seems like they did everything in their power to do everything as a practical effect. And in today's day and age of doing everything in post, that's a huge plus for me.I've gotta say, I think this is the perfect family movie.10/10.",

From the wolf scene (all those who already watched the film will understand what I mean)to the ending 'war' scene ,all scenes which were not in the book, it is an innovative and outstanding achievement to all those involved. All those who read the book know how almost impossible it was to write a screenplay for this movie but this team succeeded with flying colours.Thank you for showing me that movies can still be an art form where originality is still somewhere to be found.

The animation was really good and it at least made it so that they didn't look like robots.(But I guess it was made only 13 years ago so what do you expect)The story was really child-friendly except for the death of a sewer rat. I liked how they developed the story by using different things.

I actually own a copy of the book (which seems somewhat uncommon these days) since I was a child.When I first saw the trailer for it, I was quite intrigued. It wasn't quite what I had imagined. There is quite a different style of animation at play and while I didn't like it straight away and it made me a little uncomfortable given how it looks somewhere between animated and life-like. However, I really enjoyed it and thought it suited the movie quite well.The music was interesting, quite fitting. I don't remember any of the songs that were playing or whether or not they were in the book. The most distinctive thing I can remember is the children's chant of 'Boggis, Bunce and Bean'. I didn't really like that either when I first heard it but by the end of the movie I couldn't get it out of my head.I like the typography of the film - how there was the name of each chapter of the book shown on screen when it appeared. Despite not reading the book in ten years, some of the titles brought me back to that time. I don't remember the story being the way that it was, however. But perhaps it's just me or it could be a twist on the book that was pretty straight forward.My favourite part was the way the three farmers' farms were laid out and the way that the farmers were introduced which brought back memories. I'm pretty certain their descriptions were straight out of the book.Rewatch value: I'd voluntarily watch it again a few more times. It's not something you put on in the background. All in all, it was a good experience. Definitely different in terms of animation but I quite enjoyed it. I would recommend it to people to watch at least once.",

Mr. Fox, once a professional chicken stealer, decides to settle down with his wife after she becomes pregnant and instead take up a career in writing. After moving to a new home in the trunk of a tree, Mr. Fox takes notice in three massive fowl and fruit farms. Risking everything. Mr. Fox decides to embark on one last big job \u2013 stealing from all three farms. What happens after that can only be described as pure confusion and debauchery.As with most Rhold Dahl stories, the book Fantastic Mr. Fox works to both excite kids and humor adults. As a result, the original short story is considered a classic for many families. Though some adaptations of Rhold Dahl classics (see BOTH adaptations of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) have strayed from Dahl's dry, quirky humor, the film version of one of his best loved stories have honored this side of Dahl's story, projecting a humor perhaps more suited to adults than children, but creating an overall story that will appeal to all. This movie would likely have been impossible without the work of numerous wonderful voice actors. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Owen Wilson all provide voices in the movie, among other lesser known but still wonderfully talented actors. As a result, the voices blend beautifully into the animation. Instead of feeling like characters with a voice shoved in, the voices and the characters are one. The animation is perhaps the most appealing aspect of the movie. The script and humor works with the animation in ways traditional or digital animation could not. In many instances, the animation itself provides part of the story. By using a more traditional method, Fantastic Mr. Fox is also able to provide very specific quirks and personalities to each character, something often lost in newer animation. Adding to the animation is a muted, fall palette of colors, giving the entire film a homey, comforting feel.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's 2009 film, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a stop motion animated film that reminds us that there is nothing wrong with being different.The stop animation is nothing short of fantastic in this film because it is very fluid. Wes Anderson demonstrates how precise the stop motion picture is when Mr. Bean begins flailing his arms and knocking things from shelves, ultimately destroying his office space. However, the expressions that the Foxes are molded in to can make one feel a little unsettled, to say the least. When Mr. Fox finds out they are going to have a son he gives his wife an unconvincing grin by baring all of his sharp teeth. The stop-animation can be unsettling, but I believe that in this situation Wes Anderson is trying to emphasize that Mr. Fox is processing that he is going to have a son, so his character looks strained.Wes Anderson uses his characters and witty dialog to remind adults and children alike that it's okay to be different, no matter the context behind it. Throughout the film, characters such as the Fox's son Ashe, Mrs. Fox, and Kylie are referred to or refer to themselves as being \"different.\" The animals in the film do a funny hand gesture when the word \"different\" is said or implied to emphasize that many things make one \"different.\" I believe that Wes Anderson intended to remind the audience that what we feel makes us different is nothing to be ashamed about because \"different\" is never defined in this film. Being different could be approached positively as embracing your own \"self,\" which happens to be the case if you pay attention to Kylie's character.Kylie is an opossum who has primal instincts that symbolize anxiety and being different in Fantastic Mr. Fox. This opossum is introduced to us when Mr. Fox is looking at a new home and see's the handyman, Kylie. We get the idea that Kylie is \"different\" because his eyes spin when he feels the need to defend himself, or is put in situations where he could become anxious. Kylie is considered \"different,\" because he plays dead due to his species. Opossums play dead to protect themselves because they are a prey animal. Kylie could be considered zoning out or differentiating in a human versus animal context which relates to mental health and representation of anxiety in Fantastic Mr. Fox.While the target audience was intended for children, I find that Fantastic Mr. Fox can appeal to young adults as well because many of us struggle to accept what is \"different\" about us individually.",

            "review_title": "Amazing movie! (contains some spoilers)",
            "content": "The film Fantastic Mr. Fox was an amazing film. It is full of action, adventure, and family values. Throughout the film, there is one running theme that sticks out to the viewer. That one theme is that sometimes you have to break the rules for those you love. After Mr. Fox steals from the farmers, the farmers begin to hunt down every animal that lives in the forest. This forces every creature that can to go underground and hide because of what Mr. Fox had done. When Mr. Fox is confronted, and everyone blames him for being starved he comes up with a plan to help save his friends by once again outsmarting the farmers. Mr. Fox once again steals from the farmers, but this time out of necessity in order to save everyone from starving to death. This teaches us that sometimes the wrong thing is actually the right thing to do. He could not just sit back and watch everyone starve, so he found a way to feed them. Sometimes, a person might have to break the law or do something they are not supposed to in order to save the people they love.\nOne negative comment that could be made about this movie is that it is advertised as a kid's movie when, it is more centered towards adults and older teenagers. There are several scenes throughout the movie that use very adult content that children would not understand. It could be considered adult content not because it is inappropriate or vulgar, but because it is very mature feelings and discussions. There is one particular scene from the movie after the animals are chased underground that exemplifies this very well. Mrs. Fox asks to have a word alone with Mr. Fox, and she losses her temper with him. She slaps him across the face and begins to open up about just how upset she is with him. This argument is a very good representation of why this film is actually meant for adults. She talks about how he lied to her and how by doing so he had put his entire family at risk. Another example of this would be when the rat dies towards the end of the movie. They say that he has redeemed himself, but that he is basically just another dead rat. This part of the movie is very much aimed towards older audiences, and it truly shows that Wes Anderson did not intend to capture the attention of a younger audience. Overall, this movie is dark at sometimes, but at the same time it is also wholesome. It teaches the audience not to judge a movie before they actually view it, because the content and depth may actually surprise you. It also teaches us that sometimes we have to go against our better nature or societies laws for those that we love.",

            "content": "The film Fantastic Mr. Fox by Wes Anderson is a marvelous piece of stop animation cinema. From its Whitty lines to its elaborate plot, the movie is a great watch for kids as well as adults. The story line involves many intricate layers, including a major heist, a short-lived rivalry with a rat, and an interesting ending with a surprise hero. Although some viewers have shown their displeasure towards the differences in Anderson's version compared to Roald Dahl's book, there is still plenty of reason to enjoy the film. Many movies steer away from being exactly like their book counterparts, especially those created by different people. This simply adds to the story and allows opposite viewers to enjoy. For example, a reoccurrence in the movie is the line, \"what the cuss?\" or \"cuss this\", Etc. Dialogue like this allows the younger viewer to enjoy an animated movie while the older audience can still receive satisfaction even if the viewing of the movie wasn't really their choice. The stop animation in this movie makes it a creative masterpiece alone, even if the puppets are a little creepy to some. Despite the puppets and differences between the movie and book, Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox is a wonderful movie for the whole family with more to the story than your average fairytale.",

            "review_title": "Wes Anderson goes to extreme measures to add unsurpassed detail!",
            "content": "A childhood favorite is turned into a movie masterpiece by an loving fan, Wes Anderson. Fantastic Mr. Fox is elegantly directed, animated, and performed. After many years of imagining what the film could be Wes Anderson partnered up with Revolution Studios to make a stop start animation. An ambitious fox and his family's journey that led them from a hole to the wrong side of three farmers guns is turned to a captivating story by Wes and his team. Wes Anderson goes to extreme measures to add unsurpassed detail to make Fantastic Mr. Fox a special experience for all viewers.Fantastic Mr Fox is a uniquely animated film, nothing like any other movie you have ever seen. It is made similar to countless classics using stop start animation, a technique only used by directors and animators with tremendous care and preparation. The animal figurines designed and meticulously shaped by various specialist ranging from people who designed the clothes to people that engineered the many pliable metal plates that go into the face and joints of each figurine. All of the figurines were designed and constructed the same except for the bunny and mouse, who were made custom due to the bunnies' large ears and the mices' small stature. Mr. Fox has his tail shot off by a farmer out to get revenge. His son makes a noble attempt to steal back the tail, being used a a tie by the farmer. While in the farmers there is a moment where the Ash, the son, pauses giving the viewer and opportunity to study the set. The wood grain and small trinkets scattered about are a great example. The detail shown in the house shows that Henry Selick, the animation director, did not just want the job done. He wanted the job done right.Even though the film is animated; nothing feels flat: texture and depth is added at all possible stops. The set designers do a wonderful job of adding tremendous character to all of the senses. By using tints, hues, and tones to shade and highlight the background, the animator helps provide a sense of realness to the film. For example, the animators add emotion throughout the sewer scene toward the end where all of the animals are crammed into a tight space. They do so by layering various blues, blacks, and greys symbolizing sadness and a loss of hope. The white flickering light in the halls adds a sense of false security. For a few seconds every thing is lit up, the second the light goes out the unone is suddenly a major threat. After suffering in the sewer Mr. Fox finds a grocery with a sewer opening in an isle. His family enters the store and the scene is immediately filled with bright colors: reds, yellows, white light, ect. These colors symbolize a new found sense of hope and happiness. Going from dark to light symbolizes beginning a new chapter in life. Revolution Studios did a great job making an intriguing set that any viewer can appreciate.Unlike many other directors who use personification, Wes Anderson makes an effort to add a wild spirit to a humanized natural predator. He is portrayed as a father, a husband, and a writer: not a wild animal. After being served breakfast he mutilates his food without ever glancing towards the silverware. Foxy being savage rather than sophisticated is ironic because it shows his true nature, wild and free. Nothing like the friendly and human like facade he puts on. In the next scene Mr Fox is house shopping. He is tired of living a boring life, having to crawls out of a hole every morning. Hoping to expand,Mr. fox contemplates moving in to a real, above ground house. He is led to a captivating tree by his realtor. Some of the selling points sound oddly familiar but with a twist: original dirt floors, great neighborhood, and conveniently located near a chicken farm. This wich to move illustrates Wes Anderson's urge to create a relatable scenario while the \"original dirt floors\" reminds us that Mr. Fox is an animal, a fox, sort of just a prop.Wes Anderson's attention to detail makes is clear that he cared tremendously about the viewing experience and the quality of the final product. Every aspect of the preparation and recording process was done for the same reason, to make a powerful film. With Wes Anderson and his team there is no stone left unturned.",

After this initial watch, I abstained from seeing it entirely until 2020 when I revisited Wes Anderson's animated masterpiece. Once I came back though, I fell in love.I love this movie. Everything about it from the animation, to the casting, and even the character design makes me enjoy this movie more with each watch. Wes Anderson does an excellent job making this movie rewatchable, and really hits on allowing this film to be enjoyed by all age groups. The star-studded cast in this film really adds to the story, and even smaller roles like Willem Dafoe as Rat and Eric Chase Anderson as Kristofferson shine and add to the feel of this film. Wes Anderson's stop-motion style is amazing, and the array of colors in this film add to all of the other elements that make this movie wonderful. In all, I would recommend this movie to almost anyone who enjoys watching movies and would give it a 10/10; in my opinion the greatest animated movie ever created.",

Lacking the dark edge of Dahl's book and of his writing in general, Fantastic Mr Fox is not so good as an adaptation, however on its own terms it is wonderful. It is an endearing and hugely enjoyable film.\n\nOne thing that stood out was how the film looked. Instead of the CGI rendered effects, Wes Anderson opts for a more old-fashioned stop-motion effect. This decision worked, because the visual look is outstanding, not just in the beautifully detailed backgrounds and sets but in how the characters move as well and the small details such as the armchair in his writing hut.\n\nI like Alexandre Desplat's music quite a bit. His score for Fantastic Mr Fox is no exception, it is quirky yet still has the minimalist style that makes Desplat stand out. The story is sometimes slow in the pace but because of the humour and how it looked, I never found the film boring, besides the story itself is so good. The writing is great, the humour is more adult but a vast majority of it is very funny with the odd touching moment too.\n\nThe characters add a lot. Mr Fox is one of my favourite titular characters in a book and the film did little to change that, and while some are slightly underused they serve their purpose well. The voice work is fantastic. I wasn't sure about George Clooney, but he does do a bravura job, and Meryl Streep is quite touching. Michael Gambon is sterling, as is Bill Murray as Badger.\n\nIn conclusion, hugely enjoyable and one of my personal favourites of 2009. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Reminiscing back on this fantastic experience back, I have to admit that I may have approached this movie with hopes a little bit too high. For example, when Mr. Fox was buying a new home, he encountered a strange badger that seemed to blank out in the oddest of ways, which was sort of unsettling. Not only this, but Mr. Fox has continuously made use of strange terms such as \"You cussin' with me?\" or that peevish snap and a whistle (which is apparently his \"signature move\" or supposed \"trademark\"). However, I have to give the movies huge props for extending the plot, since in the story they left the reader hanging worrying about how long the hunters waited for the animals to come out. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it to my friends because there are tremendously quirky aspects of this film that normal people - if anybody - will ever understand first hand. Maybe I'm just not brilliant enough in the liberal arts to process what the film directors were thinking when they made Mr. Fox, but maybe I'm not the only one that would think this way.",

Then Mr. Fox sees a trap and gets curious and ends up trapping himself and his wife in it. Then all of a sudden, two years pass (no explanation of how they got out of the trap) and they have an adolescent son, then they have a young cousin visit when his father is ill. In the meantime, Mr. Fox got a job in the newspapers and they move from their old hole into a tree home, even though they are located near disreputable farmers.\n\nMy description makes the movie sound more interesting than it actually was. Where there should have been laughs and/or excitement, there are none.

            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox: A Work of Art.\nThis week I watched the highly enjoyable film, Fantastic Mr. Fox. Directed by Wes Anderson and adapted by him from the book by Roald Dahl, it also stars George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray. The film tells the story of Mr. Fox and his family and their attempt to evade the farmers Boggin, Bunce, and Bean who seek to kill Mr. Fox for stealing their crops. The thing that struck me most about this film and the thing I was fully expecting to strike me going in was the immense amount of color and craft that went into the visuals of this film. This Movie is truly a work of art in every sense of the word. Every scene is packed full of insane detail and color all of which is handcrafted in every respect. It's almost off putting at the beginning the unique and original style that the film presents. The film opens on a signature Wes Anderson symmetrical wide shot that, while having ample dead space, features a single tree at the center that sits atop a round hill where Mr. Fox is standing and eating an apple in the orange light of sunset. The quick jerky movements of his character display for all to see that this film is animated with stop motion. Each character handmade and moved frame by frame on a miniature set to display the action. All throughout the film we move from one gorgeous set to another and with Anderson's unique style of cinematography catch the action in a fun and artistic way that is not hindered by the constraints that stop motion usually present. The colors and characters provide a life to the film that is all its own. The thing that can be said most about this film is the way it really does stand apart if only for the incredibly unique and beautiful way it tells its equally unique story. There is, however, more to the film than that. Even though the movie is like looking at a masterpiece in multiple arts at the same time for eighty minutes and even though it's made for children and is lighthearted and comical, the film does have substance under the show that shines from behind the visuals and makes them all the more radiant. Simply a joy to look at and full of humor and family values, Fantastic Mr. Fox is not just an example of how kid's movies should be made, but is a gold standard of how great films can be made.\nThe thing that really stands out about Fantastic Mr. Fox is its chaotic and colorful world that only Wes Anderson could provide. My mind was blown away by the amount of movement and detail in every frame of the film and especially in the long tracking shots and many other unique angles that it explores. Stop motion animation is not an easy thing to pull off in general but it seems that Anderson was born for it. Even in his live action films the action on screen is very deliberate and explosive; with each movement and line of dialogue carefully timed to create the right flow in the scene. In the stop motion medium, Anderson is able to use this style to the full and in typical fashion completely sells the odd nature of the film we are watching. He also takes the opportunity to saturate Mr Fox's world with rich colors and intricate design and artistry. Not a single frame is boring to look at and each one is a work of art in its own right. The opening shot (as I mentioned before) the apple cellar and the sewer waterfall are all excellent examples of how much craftsmanship and care was put into making these tiny models and sets really come to life. As if the match between Wes and stop motion wasn't clear enough, even his signature style of Cinematography blends perfectly with the medium. With long symmetrical wide shots and perfectly horizontal tracking shots, Anderson's style lets the animation really speak for itself with frames full of color, action and artistry while still lending an attitude of quirkiness to the camerawork that every other aspect of the film has in droves. Unlike many pioneering films, Fantastic Mr Fox is not hindered by the massive amount of work and innovation that went into its creation but embraces its style, with all its pros and cons, to the full and thus creates an experience that works on all levels.\nAs for theme, I think I need to say before anything else that this movie is just plain ridiculous. Everything it says or tries to say is done tongue and cheek or with a punchline. As lite family entertainment it doesn't really push a message to the forefront (the closest it gets is the subplot about Ash being \"different\" and how that's ok) but like all good stories, it does present some interesting Ideas that can and should be considered. At the center of the story is Mr Fox (obviously) who finds himself going up against his own primal instincts. At the very start of the film, Mr and Mrs Fox stage a heist together and they get caught. When Mrs Fox rather casually reveals that she is pregnant and requests that he find a \"new line of work\" the film cuts to two years later where Mr Fox lives peacefully with his wife and son in an underground house and is now a columnist for a newspaper. He expresses a wish to live again to his wife and mentions that he wants to buy a house above ground since he won't have much more time to live. This is the first in a series of \"rebellions\" that Mr Fox stages in order to relive the days before he became domesticated. All goes well at first and he robs the first two farmers with no issue and he keeps telling his partner Kylie that he'll stop after the next robbery. However the second robbery causes the three farmers, Boggin, Bunce and Bean to lie in wait for Mr Fox and they spring on him while he re-enters his house. Mr Fox escapes minus a tale but the farmers resolve to dig him out and kill him once and for all. This causes the entire animal community to go underground into the sewers to hide. Mr Fox must learn to do what he should rather than what he wants to do. Even though it seemed to be paying off to go back into a life of stealing (the animal community even resorts to stealing after going underground) it causes much danger and inconvenience for all those around Mr Fox. Mr Fox never really does learn his lesson about stealing (the film ends with him and his family robbing a grocery store) what he does learn is that reliving the past is not worth jeopardizing what one has in the present. In a way, Mr Fox must go against his primal instinct to be wild and wandering to live a life of domestication in order to protect his family. It parallels, in its own unique way, a mid-life crisis story (one can make comparisons between Mr Fox and Mr Incredible in the Incredibles for instance) but though that is the core conflict of the film, the truth of the matter is that the movie is there to have a good time and man does it deliver.\nFor the protagonist and antagonists of the story, their actions are based intrinsically on their wants. Mr Fox wants to feel alive again after 12 fox years of calm domesticity and it's only after an all out war with Borgin, Bunce and Bean that he realises his mistakes and comes around to being devoted to those around him instead of thinking of himself. As a polar opposite are the three antagonists: Borgin, Bunce and Bean who start out similarly motivated by their wants but their want is to kill Mr Fox for good so he can no longer steal their crops. Again with a tongue in cheek attitude the film depicts their relentless battle against Mr Fox which includes digging a giant hole where his house stood, laying siege to that hole and literally holding his nephew Kristofferson hostage. Even though their actions are over the top ruthless they still display what a juggernaut desire can be and how dangerous it can get. When someone is willing to do anything to get what they want then they are in a rather dangerous position in life that might cause them to do terrible things. In between this central conflict are Mrs Fox and Ash. Mrs Fox, more than her husband initially, provides the noble want that stands in contrast to the three farmers. She does everything she can to provide for the well being of her family and provides a moral compass for Mr Fox. He knows he isn't following this compass when he performs his first robbery and thus hides the fact from his wife until the secret finally comes out. When it does, Mrs Fox provides for her husband the questions of introspection that ultimately bring him to the right and final course. Ash is the moody and reclusive son of the Foxes. Dubbed as \"different\" in the very first scene with him, at first he seems like he just wants to be left alone, especially when his \"perfect\" cousin Kristofferson comes to stay. As we get to know the character better however, it becomes clear that he doesn't want to be different. He wants to be as good as his father and his cousin in whack bat, he wants to join his father on his heists and he doesn't want to be little. His Mother and his Father explain to him near the end that there is nothing wrong with being different, it doesn't make him worse than everyone else and being unique is a strength not a weakness. Ash even gets his own little payoff when his being little helps him to save his cousin from captivity. Bolstered by a strong cast and masterful character animation, this is a film with a real core and compelling, if not oddly quirky, characters.\nFantastic Mr Fox is good clean fun but also a dazzling work of art. These two elements, so rarely coupled together, put it at masterpiece status. It is a masterclass in the art of stop motion, with each element meticulously handcrafted to create a film incredibly unique and simply a joy to drink in. Colorful, snappy and even stylish, tiny details and brilliant composition abound throughout the film. As a kids movie, the messages or deeper meanings are not in focus but that makes them all the more poignant when discovered and discussed. Not quite an allegory while still not being quite applicable in subject matter to real life, it exists primarily as a fairy tale and plays the part masterfully. The characters are larger than life and delightful, filling up each frame with vivacity and life. The diverse and colorful voice cast complete the picture by adding a special kind of animation all of their own that is so pivotal to stop motion. Fantastic Mr Fox is art. Somewhat high art admittedly but it is so full of charm and life that anyone, even a child, can connect with it and all ages and people can appreciate its appeal. It is truly timeless and a masterpiece that all can enjoy.",

I watched it in the movie theatre when it initially came out, however, honestly, I didn't remember any of it. So, I finally rented it and put it on, and what a ride. The movie is really fun, I've never read the Roald Dahl novel, but that really didn't bother me. Being a children's movie, the plot was whimsical and fun, but it also had some very prominent adult themes. Being a fox in a world straight out of a fairy tale, but also being able to add in the element of a mundane average life being flipped on its head is really what this film is. Being Wes Anderson's first animated feature, it's easy to see how he translates his typical visual style into the animated medium. The voice acting is great and the plot makes for a fun take on the heist format. Still, somehow, all of that doesn't help the movie from some of my big problems with it. Although the plot is fun, I felt that some of the emotional beats didn't work, I have noticed that this has somehow become one of my largest problems with Wes Anderson't movies. Some of the character arcs didn't come to the right conclusion either, and being a fan of strong characters, this did annoy me, as the characters were great at the beginning. But cuss it, the movie was a lot of fun, and I'm really glad I watched it. 8.7/10",

The stop motion animation flows incredibly smooth and all the character and sets look organically crafted. The same is said for the villainous humans who, in proper Wes Anderson form, are just people trying to live their lives and dealing with a desk who is harming their industries. Deep character moments, fantastic supporting cast and characters, and many inner conflicts make this a more mature animated adventure, and a true Wes Anderson film.

Anderson is known for having a unique flare in filmmaking with his bright colors, witty dialogue, and memorable characters. This entry in his filmography is no different. Based on the book by Roald Dahl, the movie captures much of the charm from Dahl's writing. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, and Jason Shwartzman lead a great voice cast that enhance their characters with their ability to deliver their lines so well. The dialogue is charming and hilarious. The choice to replace every curse word with \"cuss\" made for some funny moments and is one of the more memorable things in this movie. The story is about a fox who gets into trouble by deciding to fall back on old habits. This movie is fun and the plot moves along nicely. There is really never a dull moment in this picture. The pacing is great and everything seems to have a pay-off by the end of the movie. Mr. Fox's son, Ash, might have the most change as he comes to accept himself as he is, but also that he can still do athletic things even if they aren't as great as his father or cousin. His change is what I thought was most impactful. It is a bit of a downer that the main character, Mr. Fox, isn't overly fantastic or interesting though. All he does is cause trouble and really doesn't see any consequences to his actions that are permanent (other than tail loss). The animation, done by stop-motion, is great. I'm not sure how many images there are in this movie, but there has to be an insane amount because every little movement in the characters or scenery is an image and there is a lot of motion throughout the movie. This movie is a fun one to watch. This movie is very good, but it does fall a bit short of fantastic. Overall, I give this movie an 8/10.",

            "content": "Ocean's Eleven meets The Secret of NIMH.\n\nWes Anderson's stop motion animated comedy film Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) is a joyful family feature for everyone. Wes plays off of the Western and heist genres. The whistles and snaps in Alexandre Desplat's score are straight out of Western music with the empty street encounter showdowns as well. Anderson takes Roald Dahl's delight's children's book and brings it to life with resplendent claymation and adorable optimism. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a story about love of family and achieving your potential. I think any child could learn about working together and communicating your feelings better like Mr. Fox. It's a wonderful kids movie and a fine piece of filmmaking from Wes.\n\nWes Anderson's direction is stellar with fast pacing and silly humor for this pleasant 87 minute picture. Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach's script is full of clever references and criticisms of capitalist farmers with no regard for the animal life surrounding them. I love how the animals talk. They're personified, so that viewers can relate to their family drama regardless of their furry state of being. Tristan Oliver's cinematography matches Anderson's early symmetrical framing and with plenty of fun wide shots. I like the brave close-up shots that showcase how detailed the puppets are in fur and eye realism. Their expressions are lifelike to people. I really have to hand it to Wes' animation team. They crafted one of the greatest animated features ever.\n\nGeorge Clooney is brilliant as the sly Mr. Fox. His sense of humor and good nature come across his splendid voice work as the lead wild animal in Wes Anderson's magical little comedy. Clooney plays Mr. Fox as completely cool and calculating like he's Danny Ocean with fur. Meryl Streep is phenomenal as Felicity Fox with her stern mood, rising temper, and tender affection as Mr. Fox's beloved wife. Jason Schwartzman is fun as the moody and jealous Ash Fox. Bill Murray is excellent as the scolding Clive Badger. Willem Dafoe is strange and threatening as the complex Rat. \n\nFurthermore, I like the relaxed Owen Wilson as the passive aggressive Coach Skip. Wallace Wolodarsky as the shy and steadfast opossum. Eric Chase Anderson is excellent as the skillful natural Kristofferson Silverfox. Michael Gambon is fearsome as the cruel farmer Franklin Bean. Wes Anderson himself is fun as the real estate agent Stan Weasel. Juman Malouf, Wes' wife, is sweet as the quiet Agnus the fox. Roman Coppola is the squirrel contractor and Brian Cox cameos as the reporter's voice. Who else could you want? How about Adrien Brody as an adorable field mouse?",

The actors are perfect in their roles, especially George Clooney as the title character, the brings his natural intelligence and charisma to the role, so even when Fox is doing bad things, you can't help but like him.  Behind the camera, Wes Anderson makes one of the best adaptations of a Roal Dahl book to date, thanks to innovative stop motion animation and witty script, that expands on the original children's story while staying true to its spirit (the rest of the animal characters are nicely fleshed out, with Bill Murray of course stepping in as Fox's badge lawyer).  Just a delight form beginning to end, and this plus \"Isle of Dogs\" makes one think Anderson so only do stop motion films.",

Although it appears the target audience is children in my opinion it is better suited for adults. Don't worry, there is nothing in this movie that is inappropriate for kids but, if you are looking for a typical Disney movie for family time this might not be the best choice. With a realistic animation style and a washed-out color scheme you might find it difficult to maintain a child's attention. But if you are an adult looking for a fun movie to watch I think you have found your film. As mentioned before the setting of the film and the characters are different than the soft featured animation done by DreamWorks or Pixar. The almost realistic look of the animals in the film might be a little too much for a small child to handle. This paired with a dull and desolate setting might prove to be boring for some children. Aside from the visual side of the film some of the topics in the movie are more relatable to adults. Examples are things such as Mr. Fox having a financial and legal advisor that is addressed several times throughout the film and several instances of inebriation. This movie addresses several big topics as well such as deforestation, unplanned pregnancies, and possible LGBTQ+ issues depending on the viewers interpretation. Lastly the over all theme of the movie is about Mr. Fox and his need to live among the elite which ultimately leads to the destruction of his family and the relapse of a kleptomaniac lifestyle.",

The film stars George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Jason Schwartzman as Ash.\n\nThe voice acting in my opinion is really strong. I personally don't very much like George Clooney, but I have to say that he does one of his best performances yet as the fantastic Mr. Fox.\n\nThe characters like the voice acting are also really strong and memorable. I also personally really like the villains Boggis, Bunce, Bean and Rat.\n\nThe cinematography like most of Wes Anderson's films is very good with some really nice shots of the characters and scenery.\n\nThe animation in my opinion is great and really vibrant. The animation also works incredibly well with the style of the film.\n\nThe film also has some very sound and beautifully designed settings from a tree house to various farms.\n\nLike most of Wes Anderson's films the style is exemplary from the colour scheme to the character design. \n\nThe film also has some very sound and violent action especially for a children's film.\n\nThe dialogue in my opinion like most of Wes Anderson's films is delivered really well with great timing.\n\nThe music is also really strong and fits with the film extremely well.\n\nThe story though changed from the original story by Roald Dahl is still very strong and enjoyable to watch fold out.\n\nWes Anderson in my opinion has a great way with comedy and it shows here. From the jokes to the timing the comedy is pulled off near perfectly.\n\nThe film at points also has some really good atmosphere.\n\nThe film I also think is incredibly enjoyable and something I could watch everyday and never get bored with.\n\nOver all I think this film is a masterpiece. Over all I give it a\n10/10\n100%\n5/5\n\nAs perfect as a film can get",

The work went behind the stop-motion animation is just marvelous especially to pull it off on such large scale and to speculate it with such nuance that it leaves the audience in an awe of it. \n\nThe acts distributed in here and the way they shift from one to another is bizarrely ingenious and extremely powerful. It is eerily fast paced yet aptly cooked characters that offers enough depth for the viewers to dig in and explore. \n\nThe writing is sharp, to- the-point and explicit with tiny tactics installed in here that not only is infomercial but hilarious too. Such dysfunctional family might have been familiar to the audience but with a perspective like this, the clock starts from zero. \n\nIt is rich on technical aspects like its up beating background score, amazing songs, metaphorical cinematography and fine editing that paints the picture brighter. The voice cast fills in perfectly in this wild world and has done a hilarious work especially by Clooney, Streep, Murray and Wilson. \n\nAnderson's strong script matches its brilliant execution where you know that you have surrendered to his surreal world when he draws out emotions from these characters and pours it like rain over the audience. The three dimensional characters, satirical humor, moral conflicts and thought provoking policy that is genuinely effective are the high points of the feature. \n\nFantastic Mr. Fox is a forced to be reckoned with, that not only shows potential in such animation but also the structure of the script.",

With most of the books I read at home back when I was in seventh grade as you Americans call it being written by the late Roald Dahl otherwise known by Screen Junkies as \"Creepy Dr. Seuss\", I wanted to see the film adaptation of the book. Back then, all I saw was a decent comedy that ended far too quickly and managed to extend its source material to great new heights without succumbing to what I like to call \"The Dr. Seuss Movie Curse\". Now that I've grown up a bit I notice it has a more adult-oriented apporach with still enough charm to appeal to children. This movie and Coraline were actually refreshing movies to watch in 2009 since we got to take a break from CGI for a while. There were actually some really great shots thanks to the fewer limitations of animation. It sometimes even feels like a 2D side-scrolling video game. The movie's funny with slapstick jokes such as Mr. Fox and his opossum friend to dialogue-based jokes an example of which is Bill Murray's description of the three bad guy farmers and Advertised Extra Owen Wilson describing a fictional sport with complicated rules. And George Clooney nails it as Mr. Fox. He really does, I'm not saying that just to be polite or anything. Since this is my first Wes Anderson movie, I can't praise his sense of humour as heavily as in his other movies. So, if I were to write a definition for this movie in Urban Dictionary, what would I say? Fantastic Mr. Fox: A stop-motion movie released in 2009 that no one saw because...it's not CGI, I guess? Which is a shame because the movie's hilarious with a clever plot, witty humour and great voice-acting with George Clooney doing a great job at delivering a \"click-click\" noise that serves as the Fox's trademark. If you haven't watched it, go see it now. And I have severe doubts that reading the book will make you say \"THIS MOVIE FREAKIN' SUCKS!!!\" after watching the movie for a second time. Satisfaction guaranteed.",

When I was at the city library, trying to copy something, I realize that I should rent some movies that I wouldn't be able to watch on TV unless it's actually now playing them. So I got myself some Sofia Coppola films and some Christian films as I heard they are terrible, and I wanted to torture myself for fun. Then I tried to think of another film to watch, and once I was thinking of my best friend, I knew that I wanted to rent this movie as this is one of her favorites, and I haven't seen this in a long time. So of course I watched this first, and I find this a lot of fun to watch. The voice acting is fantastic in this, which is kind of funny to see George Clooney and Bill Murray's characters go at each other by just growling at them. The animation is amazing that even the big things that it does in this film look so simple and easy, which I know that the animators worked very hard on it, and the effects show in this. The characters are very enjoyable to watch, especially Kylie who's played by Wallace Wolodarsky, which I didn't know he was an actor as he's a writer in some of the early Simpsons episodes, and wrote the third Wimpy Kid movie, and he plays the main character's accomplice which he sometimes just stand there dazing and not paying attention, which always makes me laugh for some reason. The script by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach is very witty and hilarious that I was enjoying almost every second of this film, and it didn't felt quirky for the sake of being quirky and nothing else. Fantastic Mr. Fox is an excellent film that is probably one of my favorite stop-motion animated films.",

            "content": "I still have significant issues with Wes Anderson and the way he tells stories. There's this matter-of-fact way that people behave and talk that is off-putting to me. I can't count the number of times someone just tells you exactly what they are doing or are planning to do. And whenever something out of the ordinary occurs there is rarely a reaction, everyone behaves as if every moment is exactly what they expected. The one good thing about this style is that it prepared me so that I wasn't in the least bit surprised when the humans and animals just started communicating with each other as if they all spoke the same language. \n\nThere were some humorous moments in Fantastic Mr. Fox that did work for me. I laughed occasionally at the physical humor and some of the running gags. I should also give a lot of credit to the skill that I know it took to make the stop-motion animation work. I've never been the biggest fan of how stop motion looks, and this is probably my least favorite ever. The fur on the animals looked scratchy like everything is made out of straw. I'd rather look at old Rankin/Bass Christmas specials than this stuff. Still I recognize the art that goes into this style of film. It takes so much talent and patience, so I feel like a jerk for not loving it. \n\nThe story of Fantastic Mr. Fox worked better for me than Wes Anderson's typical movie. It seemed a little more clear cut and there were actual motivations for all the characters that made sense. I just wish I liked the characters more. I mean, Mr. Fox might be on my list of least sympathetic protagonists ever. I don't think there's a single thing he does in this movie that redeems him for me. They certainly try to make us forgive him, but it never worked for me. Then his son, Ash, is a jealous bully. That also makes me want to scream. So, a strong story with some effective humor, but with unlikable main characters and odd style. I'd say Fantastic Mr. Fox is definitely not a film for me.",

And I hate Epic Movie. I was so disappointed by this movie, so glad The Grand Budapest Hotel was better.",

The distinctive quirkiness of Wes Anderson's direction suits the material just fine, but because the movie is populated with Anderson-esque characters of dubious morality, it's tough to care about anyone, with the exception of Mr. Fox. An animated film done by a live-action director serves to showcase how style can become a gimmick. While Woody Allen didn't direct Antz, it was still a Woody Allen film, and it was harder to watch than the vastly superior A Bug's Life. As far as Fantastic Mr. Fox is concerned, it's ok to sit through once, but I don't think kids or adults (unless they're Wes Anderson fanatics) will sit for repeat viewings.",

However, the issue with this, is that the beginning of the film brings much more comedy and the latter half of the film is much more serious, and not as interesting. While the latter half is still great, it drags on a bit more after multiple viewings. This is only because Anderson has established his world so much. It almost makes you want to forego the plot just so you can sit and enjoy his world, without changes made to it, just a bit longer. Almost everything about this film clicks so well even mixing of the audiences, whether you viewed it as an adult or a child, was done almost flawlessly. The themes represented, including: self acceptance, ego management, and mid life crisis, means that people of all ages can find a reason to love and attach themselves to this film.

Felicity reveals to Fox that she is pregnant and pleads with him to find a safer job when they escape.\n\nTwo years later (twelve in Fox Years), the Foxes and their sullen son Ash are living in a hole. Fox, now a newspaper columnist, moves the family into a better home in the base of a tree, ignoring the warnings of his lawyer Badger about how dangerous the area is for foxes. The tree is located very close to facilities run by three mean farmers consisting of Walter Boggis, Nathaniel Bunce, and Franklin Bean. Soon after the Foxes move in, Felicity's nephew Kristofferson Silverfox comes to live with them as his father has become very ill with double pneumonia. Ash finds this situation intolerable; his soft-spoken cousin is apparently superior to him at almost everything, and everyone, including his father, Mr. Fox, is charmed by Kristofferson at Ash's expense.\n\nFox and Kylie Opossum steal produce and poultry from the three farms. The farmers decide to kill Fox and camp out near the family's tree. When Fox emerges, the farmers open fire, but manage only to shoot off his tail. They then attempt to dig Fox out. After demolishing the site of the tree, the farmers discover the Foxes have dug an escape tunnel.\n\nReasoning that the Foxes will have to surface for food and water, the farmers lie in wait at the tunnel mouth. Underground, Fox encounters Badger and many other local animal residents whose homes have also been destroyed. As the animals begin fearing starvation, Fox leads Clive Badger, Mole, Beaver, and Weasel in a digging expedition to tunnel to the three farms, robbing them clean. While the other animals feast, Ash and Kristofferson, beginning to reconcile after Kristofferson defended Ash from Mr. Beaver's son, return to Bean's farm, intending to reclaim Mr. Fox's tail. When they are interrupted by the arrival of Bean's wife, Ash escapes but Kristofferson is captured.\n\nDiscovering that Fox has stolen their produce, the farmers flood the animals' tunnel network with cider. The animals are forced into the sewers and Fox learns that the farmers plan to use Kristofferson to lure him into an ambush. The animals are confronted by Rat, Bean's security guard. Fox and Rat fight in an electrical room until Fox pushes him into an electric generator, severely electrocuting him. Rat confesses Kristofferson's location before his death.\n\nFox asks the farmers for a meeting in town near the sewer hub where he would surrender in exchange for Kristofferson's freedom. The farmers set up an ambush, but Fox and the others anticipate it and launch a counterattack. Fox, Ash and Kylie slip into Bean's farm. A much-matured Ash frees Kristofferson and braves enemy fire to release a rabid beagle named Spitz to keep the farmers at bay.\n\nThe animals become accustomed to living in the sewers with others considering moving in. Ash and Kristofferson settle their differences and become good friends. Fox leads his family to a drain opening built into the floor of a supermarket owned by the three farmers. Celebrating their new food source and the news that Felicity is pregnant again, the animals dance in their aisles.",

This film is everything a Dahl film should be. Its deliriously funny, completely incomprehensible and astoundingly crafted. Wes Anderson, I say this to you now, this is not only an achievement in stop motion but an animated masterpiece. And who the hell on God's green earth cant love the fabulous voices of George Clooney and Meryl Streep? The screenplay is tender, charming, witty and first and foremost enjoyably sensational. Not since The Nightmare Before Christmas (excluding claymation) has stop motion been so splendid. It seems, like James and the Giant Peach, Dahl's books are best for stop motion. This is competing against Up for best animated picture at the oscars and I know I gave it the same rating, but this is simply that little bit better and more nuanced. Anyone who says that animation cant live up to the standards of live-action is bloody kidding themselves. And this film prooves that in spades",

Disney films, with only some as an exception, have taken familiar a formula to drive almost all of their films with only a minor set of tweaks, hoping it would be enough to create a sense of originality. In the hand-drawn animation department, Studio Ghibli is winning the battle with their bold and graceful artistic choices, fuelled by a sense of imagination and hidden symbolism. Pixar has established themselves as the leaders of three-dimensional computer graphic animations to create wonderful stories that deliver multi-generational accessibility and richly appealing characters and worlds. Fantastic Mr. Fox belongs in the underrated category of stop-animation films, which is an area of animated filmmaking that rarely gains a large audience, as some feel it lacks the realism and wonder that other modes of animation could deliver, and the difficult process of creating such a feature does not entirely justify the benefits of the finished product.\n\nI believe that animation should not be limited by its two popular options. There are gems found in a stop-motion animated film that easily becomes lost when told in another medium. If Fantastic Mr. Fox was told through hand-drawn animation then all of its three-dimensional charm is lost, creating flat characters and a world lacking in complexity. Using three-dimensional computer graphics could achieve that extra dimensions that the hand-drawn animations lack, but they tend to give that smooth texture that keeps the film from seeming life-like, also the comedic aspect of the film wouldn't have been achieved as effectively if told in this way. Stop-motion animation may not be the most deliver the smoothest of movement from its characters, but it doesn't have to because what we are seeing are actual living objects that are interacting with one another, which is hard to convey with the other two options.\n\nThe film was under the direction of visual director, Wes Anderson, and what he brings to this is a sense of style that is certainly familiar to the fans that have been long following his work, but it also brings something entirely different and unique to the realm of stop-motion animation; the film is leaps and bounds beyond Chicken Little and the Wallace and Gromit films. Anderson's visual and artistic trademarks are here and they are on full display, giving the characters and their world a sense of strangeness and eccentricity, gaining a sense of escape during the experience; but since Anderson is handling fictional characters rather than human projections, their personalities do not seem as odd or intense as his previous films. It actually allows it to become easier for a person, who is unfamiliar with the director, to come into this and still feel like they just experienced another run-of-the-mill animated film; and Anderson knew his target audience and what their expectations were. If he decided to crank up his usual style to maximum, just so the film would really stand out from its peers, then it\u00e2??s going to have people turn their heads and probably lose the natural charm that made the film so appealing.\n\nI cannot note in this review whether the film remained true to Roald Dahl's novel, as I have yet to read it; therefore do not expect any comparisons here, and everything I would state or judge on the film's story would be purely based on the film itself. Wes Anderson returns as the film's screenwriter, collaborating once again with his friend Noah Baumbach to create Fantastic Mr. Fox. I was a little sceptical on whether or not I would find myself pleased with the film, as when they both worked together previously on The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, I was left disappointed and so far I have regarded it as Anderson's weakest film. After watching this, I was a little stunned on how much I actually enjoyed it. It provided a simple and accessible story, but made it feel mature and complex in its core relationships. They treat the film's characters with effort and respect, demonstrating layers that shape their outer personality and acts as drives to the logic of their decision-making. Dialogue is another thing that the film does wonderfully well, with characters seemingly distinctive and back and forth chatter that is not only hilarious but also thoughtful; it coveys its themes through the intentions and values of its characters, ensuring that the film is about them and not something much larger, like what was done in The Darjeeling Limited. The film also manages to be risky in its choice of words, bringing up themes that seem inappropriate for a young person to hear but hidden cleverly enough behind their hilarious remarks and witty substitution of particular words. They achieve all of this while also providing, assumingly, a faithful interpretation from the source material. Anderson and Baumbach have delivered a screenplay that is both superficially entertaining and emotionally insightful.\n\nThe film starts off as a fox couple who live their lives as bandits, benefiting from the riches of their loot, then suddenly Mrs. Fox announces her pregnancy which forces both of them to turn their life around and become a settled and honest family. From there, years later Mr. Fox decides to get back in the game and do one more grand scheme, but then things get out of hand and their entire community becomes affected by his actions. His journey was fun, wild, and tense; there were sequences in here that I would probably never forget, but the film is not really about the spectacle, it's about the relationships and drives of its characters. Mr. Fox is an individual who is driven by his ego, who basks in the glow of success. His sudden change to a \"normal\" life was manageable at first, but as time went by, it becomes much more difficult to live such a mundane and tedious life where no one even appreciates the writing contributions he brings to the local newspaper. His personality and high expectations also contributes to the dysfunction between him and his son, which is something Anderson treads on frequently with his films. He expects his son to be naturally talented, similar to himself, and passively shows disappointment when he isn't able to fulfil his expectations. It is relationships like these in the film, that makes these characters feel real and complex, rather than empty vessels who's aim is to push the plot forward; it also gives the film naturally earned emotions that aid in the growth of its characters.\n\nAlong with its themes of ego and family dysfunction, the film also touches on the idea of adaptation. The film shows us by the end of the film, the determination of these characters to survive in such a difficult and selfish world. In whatever habitat that these animals are put in, they are able to make the best of it, and slowly in their own way fighting and taking back from humans what is rightfully theirs.\n\nRobert Yeoman sadly does not come back here for Fantastic Mr. Fox, and that is understandable as it would take a person who has deep experience of stop-motion animation, and who better than Tristan Oliver, who has previously worked on films including Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. He is able to do this while still staying close to the vision of the director, emphasising the centred shots and the sudden push-ins and pull-outs. I also cherished the film's orange-brown warm glow to its image, giving it that earth-like feel to it. It was also disappointing to find that Mark Mothersbaugh did not come back to compose the score for Fantastic Mr. Fox, and instead done so by Alexandre Desplat. Desplat is an amazing composer, and his so-far three films with Anderson have been fantastic but there is just something about a long-time collaboration that makes it seem more connected and fantastic. Mothersbaugh brought a lot of charm to Anderson's films, and because of him a lot of his early films sound and feel beautiful. Desplat has a different approach, it has this magical, larger than life quality to his scores, and Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of his more grounded and child-like works, which suited to the film's story and characters. I don't know why I even decided to make a comparison if Desplat did an equally strong enough job in this film. I think I just cannot help but wonder on what the film would have sounded like if it Mothersbaugh was under the role instead.\n\nThe film's cast was fantastic, as expected, with new members joining Anderson's troupe; George Clooney and Meryl Streep. Both were perfect choices of casting, demonstrating effective and heavy chemistry between the two, allowing the emotional scenes of the film feel natural. The rest of the cast are familiar members of Anderson's filmography; Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, Adrien Brody and Brian Cox. All of them do a wonderful job with their characters, especially Jason Schwartzman.\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox feels like a refinement of Steve Zissou, executing character-driven stories with large and ambitious action sequences; laying the groundwork for his audience of the direction of his future as a filmmaker.",

His sudden change to a \"normal\" life was manageable at first, but as time went by, it becomes much more difficult to live such a mundane and tedious life where no one even appreciates the writing contributions he brings to the local newspaper. His personality and high expectations also contributes to the dysfunction between him and his son, which is something Anderson treads on frequently with his films. He expects his son to be naturally talented, similar to himself, and passively shows disappointment when he isn't able to fulfil his expectations. It is relationships like these in the film, that makes these characters feel real and complex, rather than empty vessels who's aim is to push the plot forward; it also gives the film naturally earned emotions that aid in the growth of its characters.\n\nAlong with its themes of ego and family dysfunction, the film also touches on the idea of adaptation. The film shows us by the end of the film, the determination of these characters to survive in such a difficult and selfish world. In whatever habitat that these animals are put in, they are able to make the best of it, and slowly in their own way fighting and taking back from humans what is rightfully theirs.\n\nRobert Yeoman sadly does not come back here for Fantastic Mr. Fox, and that is understandable as it would take a person who has deep experience of stop-motion animation, and who better than Tristan Oliver, who has previously worked on films including Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. He is able to do this while still staying close to the vision of the director, emphasising the centred shots and the sudden push-ins and pull-outs. I also cherished the film's orange-brown warm glow to its image, giving it that earth-like feel to it. It was also disappointing to find that Mark Mothersbaugh did not come back to compose the score for Fantastic Mr. Fox, and instead done so by Alexandre Desplat. Desplat is an amazing composer, and his so-far three films with Anderson have been fantastic but there is just something about a long-time collaboration that makes it seem more connected and fantastic. Mothersbaugh brought a lot of charm to Anderson's films, and because of him a lot of his early films sound and feel beautiful. Desplat has a different approach, it has this magical, larger than life quality to his scores, and Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of his more grounded and child-like works, which suited to the film's story and characters. I don't know why I even decided to make a comparison if Desplat did an equally strong enough job in this film. I think I just cannot help but wonder on what the film would have sounded like if it Mothersbaugh was under the role instead.\n\nThe film's cast was fantastic, as expected, with new members joining Anderson's troupe; George Clooney and Meryl Streep. Both were perfect choices of casting, demonstrating effective and heavy chemistry between the two, allowing the emotional scenes of the film feel natural. The rest of the cast are familiar members of Anderson's filmography; Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, Adrien Brody and Brian Cox. All of them do a wonderful job with their characters, especially Jason Schwartzman.\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox feels like a refinement of Steve Zissou, executing character-driven stories with large and ambitious action sequences; laying the groundwork for his audience of the direction of his future as a filmmaker.",

He decides to go back on his vow to his wife by performing three last chicken heists against the most dangerous chicken farmers in the land. The jobs, though successful, cause the farmers to be vindictive and attempt to destroy everything Mr. Fox loves. Now with his dishonesty in the open, he not only finds himself and his family endangered but the entire animal community as well unless he can change who he is and use his cunning wit in defense of others instead of his own personal gain.\nClever, witty, and pretty humorous. Though the animation and comedy may not appeal to some, the messages that I thought were present should ring a bell with many families. Responsibility and family over personal desires, accepting yourself if you're in the shadow of someone \"greater\", treating family with love and respect, revenge being more hurtful than good, etc etc. George Clooney was fantastic (pun) in this role. Character traits are well developed and the script was really well written. The humor was frequent, but not over bearing. The best part was seeing how Mr. Fox can change without giving up his traits that truly makes him \"fantastic\". Awesome movie. I would watch it again multiple times.",

And honestly the trailer just didn't really impress me the first time I saw it. \nBut like most of Anderson's trailers, the final product ended up being much different from the trailer, this one being for the better. \nThe script is very fast paced and fun, giving each character room to say something important or funny. The humor was also great for adults and kids to understand. I also really enjoyed how during the climax quite literally everything began falling apart. It helps show just how drastic things were getting. \nThe character of Mr. Fox is kind of a mixed bag. You will either love or hate his mischievous ways. Some of his running gags last a bit too long but I personally liked him. He's charming without overdoing it. He (for the most part) realizes when he's made a mistake and tries to fix it or do what he can with what he's got. The side characters are very fun and quirky from the goofy Kristofferson (great name by the way) to the evil farmers, who also get a couple of good laughs (\"You wrote a bad song, Petey! \") By the way, props to Desplat for another great soundtrack. \nThe animation, although tough to get used to at first, looked great and unique. This is a film that, like most of Anderson's works, sets itself apart from others. It's animation, characters, camera work, and script all make this movie one of a kind. Whether or not it's unique in a good way is up to you, but personally this was a tasty treat that was wonderful to watch.\n\n8/10 Amazing",

The models are fantastic, the voice casting is great, and watching this movie, like Rotten Tomatoes says, is a \"Delightfully Funny Feast\". The hate thing is, that this is a Wes Anderson movie, and not really a adaption of the beloved book. Now Wes Anderson is a wonderful director, probably one of the best and most original directors living today, its just that he probably wasn't the best choice for a film adaption of this beloved book. It seems like Anderson tries to make the movie different from the ones he has done in the past, but he really just couldn't. \n    The film is a bit chatty, and might lose the interest of some younger children, but anyone over that will probably love this movie",

In this fantasy, we watch an amusing open war between 3 wealthy human farmers and alpha male Mr. Fox. After stealing poultry from 3 farms to satisfy his wild beast whims, Mr. Fox and his family have to dig for their lives when faced with the farmers' vengeful fury. Fortunately, this fantasy determines that the personified animals are as smart as people and in the end sly fauna takes the upper hand over Men. \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is worth for the great visual beauty, for the rich characters and the very entertaining humor. Wes Anderson's steady hand in the direction and playful pathos prevents this movie from falling into mediocre territory. I would like to see substantially more facial expression from the animal characters, there were moments of emotional or otherwise persuasive agenda that didn't quite grip me as they could. Technical limitations, I suppose. Small distraction in such a colorful and lively movie. But then again, Wes' characters are never garish in their facial expressions. I was very curious to see how the director would forge his animated subjects and, unremarkably, they are not too different from live-action counterparts. Fun and beautiful animation movie, recommended.",

The story is about the war between a fox and three farmers who got robbed of their animals. The film has a retro stylish look and is very suitable to watch with the kids. With the voices of George Clooney (From Dusk till Dawn, Ocean's Eleven), Meryl Streep (The Hours, Death Becomes Her), Jason Schwartzman (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, The Grand Budapest Hotel), Bill Murray (Lost in Translation, Ghostbusters), Owen Wilson (Meet the Parents, Zoolander), Willam Dafoe (Spiderman, Antichrist), Brian Cox (X-men 2, Troy) and Adrien Brody (King Kong, Predators). \n\nTwo years (12 fox years) after Mr. Fox (Clooney) and his wife Felicity (Streep) have given up their job of raiding farms, they live a normal boring life in a hole in the ground with their son Ash (Schwatzman). One day Mr. Fox decides to move to a luxurious tree, situated on a hill overseeing three farms. Every night he sneaks out of his home to raid one of the farms with the help of opossum Kyle. But it doesn't take long before the fat chicken farmer Walter Boggis, the little goose farmer Nathaniel Bunce and the tall turkey farmer Franklin Bean join forces to hunt down the thieves. Unwillingly Mr. Fox has endangered not only himself, but also his family and neighbors...",

What book?

It's full of life, fun, intricacies that just blow your mind. Whats even more amazing is that even though this is an animated outing, you genuinly feel like your there, with the cinematography being constantly on the move, follwing the insane plots/manuevers that Mr Fox gets us into, its a work of genius. Mr and Mrs Fox, played by Clooney and Streep (Wonderfully i might add), spend their time hunting down chickens from farms and doing what foxes do. One day while on the steal, Mrs Fox confesses to Mr Fox she is pregnant and that this way of life must stop. Flash forward 12 years later, they have a kid called Ash, Mr Fox is a coloumist and everything seems hunky dory. However discontent with his lack of wealth and letting his nature take over, Mr fox decides to hatch a plan to raid three different farms, the results, not only destroy the animal community but also put Mr Foxes life and family at risk. The animation is so fresh to see in this day and age, this is a dying form and its so good to see it being put to good use here. The voice acting is astounding and hilarious, for the first time in an age Clooney gives a performance we were so used to from yesteryear. The usual people show up in smaller roles, trade mark Murray, but its absolutley fine and none jarring due to the animated nature. Willem DaFoe's rat however is just the pinncacle of hillarity at one point during the film, i wont spoil. I genuinley dont have a single bad word to say against this movie apart from its seems about 5 minutes to long, that however is barely a gripe. Excellent piece of cinema and animation, forget your toy stories and your Up!'s this, my friends, is where the magic is at.",

Often square to the subject occasionally moving in a single direction. Or it's the detail crammed into every scene. It could be the no-nonsense dialog and the impeccable comic timing, or all the above. What ever it is - you 'get' it, and love Wes Anderson films. Or you don't, and you can't stand them. It's not a measure of intelligence. You either do or you don't. Happily for me, I 'get' his movies. They click, and that makes me happy! :-)\n\nThe Fantastic Mr. Fox is no exception. The stop-motion animation is superb, and really suits Wes Anderson's story telling style. The whole production is so bloody charming! Mr. Fox can't seem to control his basic animal instincts, and repeatedly (despite Mrs Fox's objections) snatches livestock from three neighboring farms. This then leads to a retaliatory strike by the farmers. Retaliation leads to escalation as the Fox family and their many friends escape the farmers and try to help themselves to everything the farmers have!\n\nIt all moves along at a great pace, and the script is sharp, surprising and always funny. I do however think this is going to appeal to big kids more.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you remember the book by Roald Dahl, be warned the movie adds to the story. If you 'get' Wes Anderson's work then you're likely going to enjoy this too. The darker tone and humor in this story may not appeal to younger kids.\n\nBest Format:\n\nIt is a visual treat, so a HD showing at home with the family could be fun.\n\nBest element for me:\n\nI loved the scenes with Mr. Fox's son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman.) A great character, trying to find his way out from under his fantastic father's shadow. He just gets the funniest dialog.\n\nAsh: You're supposed to be *my* lab partner.\n\nAgnes: I am!\n\nAsh: No you're not. You're disloyal.\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

I love the original fan of the story and when I heard that they where going ot make a movie based on it, I was excited. The cast was great (to a certain extent...explain later) the visuals seemed to accurate with the tone of the book. So you might think that it is perfect...not really. It follows the book to a certain extent and they did add scenes that were unessecary and characters that were never in the book at all. The actors were great but I didn't see a character I saw/heard the actors being themselves. George Clooney plays a self centered fox that is boastful and a jerk. Sound like George Clooney to me. and the list goes on. It seemed like Wes Anderson took the source and tried to make it one of his dysfunctional family stories like he always does. Some of the dialogue and scenes seemed akward and bland. Overall its not that bad at all, it just seems bland and akward at times. The opening is boring, now big introduction (I am not saying like a musical number or anything) but it just starts off like a powerpoint slideshow. Some scenes looked like they were rushed and never finished and I think this was a product of Wes Anderson self indulgent. He directed, wrote, acted and almost seemed like he did everything so it was Wes Andersons movie and he even stated that he loves this book so of course he went crazy on it.",

            "content": "Fantastic Mr. Fox is an impressive, and very different animated film, brought to us by the clever and bizarre Wes Anderson. The movie is a fully realized adaptation of Roald Dahl's book of the same name.\n\nThe story follows Mr. Fox who lives with his wife, and his young pup Ash. As soon as Mr. Fox learned he would be having a kid, he decided to get out of the chicken stealing business for good. Although, he missed it, he took up work as a columnist for the local newspaper. One day, Mr. Fox announces how displeased he is with being poor, denouncing the absurd idea of living in a 'fox hole'. Soon, Fox and his buddies team up to rob the three big farms in town of all their chicken and alcoholic apple cider. The schemes are smart and sly, but draw enough attention to initiate all out war between the animals and the farmers.\n\nThis is easily one of the more interesting animated movies I've seen. First off, the story is nothing ground breaking. It's a funny one, but nothing that's completely outside the box. That being said, it's still a good story. The one thing you first notice with Fantastic Mr. Fox, is it's awesome animation style. There are a lot of beautifully 3D rendered animations coming out all the time, but it's once in a blue moon a filmmaker comes out and injects something new into the same old song and dance. Not only that, but Wes Anderson gives the film a great balance of humor that caters to both children and adults. All great voice overs from Clooney, Streep, Bill Fucking Murray, and Schwartzman.\n\nAlong with his familiar cast, Wes Anderson did not forget to bring in his style when creating this one. It's a Wes Anderson through and through, and by now his style has helped create a name for himself. It's abstract, weird, awkward, and clever, with razor sharp banter like dialogue. The writing is one of the stand out key elements beyond the great animation and art direction. I love the style of this movie though. It's like Wes Anderson didn't decide to just make a movie about Roald Dahl's book, but made it his own. He put the Anderson stamp on it, and it feels like every one of his other movies, which is awesome. It's like if Scorcese one day decided to create a cartoon film about the mafia crime scene. It might be a toned down cartoon, but you know who made it even if the form of film is not traditional to the filmmaker.\n\nAlthough, the movie is great in many aspects, I didn't feel the heartwarming vibe it tried going for. There's a moral to this story, but it's somewhat squandered beyond the constant dry joking character interaction. It's subtle and deadpan humor, that kind of fails to insert that loving, moral bit. The movie could go on even longer than it did, although that could possibly ruin it too. It's a short, fun, cartoon, that could make anyone smile. That's the one thing that makes this one fresh.\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox is an innovative, awesome looking animated flick with the bonafide style of  Wes Anderson in it, that benefits from great characters, writing, and direction.",

There are a fair share of silly jokes which is right up my alley while even some of the not-so-hilarious content seems funnier due to the well executed quick paced dialogue from the voice actors. The story itself moves at the same quick speed as well which works great since there is practically no useless filler material, making it very hard for anyone to lose interest. They often use different camera angles for the escape/rescue scenes which adds another dimension to the storytelling while also invoking a few more laughs. Much like Pingu (anyone remember that?) or Robot Chicken (anyone heard of that?), 'Fantastic Mr Fox' uses stop-motion animation. This distinguishes it from what has become your bog standard cartoon animations of late, allowing it to implement its own unique styles of visual humour. \n\nYou may be sick of hearing them giving birth in your garden 4 times a week or leaving a mess on the street after rummaging the bins for your fried chicken leftovers but this is one fox that should leave you happy.",

The script captures the whimsy of both Dahl and Anderson, the dialogue is witty and snappy, and the characters are well-rounded and well-formed.

Fantastic Mr.Fox the movie adaptation itself is fantastic. I guess I could argue that a lot of scenes that weren't from the book were added to the movie to make the film longer but that's just nitpicking. Overall this movie has it's target audience handled well and the film itself has spot-on animation and unbelievable voice-acting. Fantastic Mr.Fox gets a 9.5/10.",

Each deliver amicable performances which can be deemed acceptable by any standard.

            "content": "I'm deciding to give this a more positive review than I'm used to giving films that I didn't enjoy. The problem with this film is that it's good aspects equal it's bad aspects and so it really doesn't feel right with me. There are three categories that I'll talk about, and each one I'll have reasons of why I liked parts and didn't like other parts. The three categories are \r\n\r\nVisuals - I'm not going to lie, I LOVE stop animation films. Nightmare Before Christmas blows my mind with how well animated it is, and I honestly couldn't tell that it was stop motion the first few times through. Fantastic Mr. Fox is clearly stop motion, and sometimes that works to it's advantage, other times no. For example, the style of the action scenes makes it kind of funny, and when characters get electrocuted, it has a stop motion comedic appeal of seeming like it was poorly made. The film also has visual appeal of never really having a boring shot. The cinematography is excellent. However, the problem with the film lies in emotional visualization. It's hard to tell how a character is feeling based off of the expression on their faces. They have flat expressions and their mouth movements also hurt the ability for characters to LOOK how they feel. This will immediately cause problems for some if not most viewers, as it makes it awkward to watch. It's kind of sad that a skeleton from 1993 has better visual emotions than a fox from 2009.\r\n\r\nWriting - Writing for me does not include plot development and character progression, but this is limited just to writing dialogue and scenes. The dialogue has it's good moments and bad moments too. It falls into a comedic trap that makes the film not very funny. This trap is actually a formula for jokes in the film. Here's the formula -\r\n\r\nSomebody does/says something, usually illogical\r\nSomebody else questions the logic of the previous person\r\nThe first person tries to defend/explain themselves, etc.\r\n\r\nBasically, I could have written every joke in this movie just by watching one scene, because that's how it feels. I think Wes Anderson believes that comedic situations in films like this can only come from a self-awareness, and that's a major problem with this film, everything feels too self aware. If you watch (and this is an odd comparison) an episode of Spongebob Squarepants,SPECIFICALLY earlier episodes, you'll notice that it hardly ever breaks self-awareness, and when it does, it's usually a character like Squidward or Plankton and nobody else questions it. An example - the episode where Squidward throws Spongebob back into the kitchen, and then all of a sudden Spongebob is back with him saying \"this is serious!\"... Squidward is shocked that Spongebob was able to get there so fast, but nobody else notices. It's funnier this way when nobody is actually aware that they're actors in a crazy cartoon. \r\n\r\nFantastic Mr. Fox, however, does it all wrong in that sense, by having the characters constantly question logic decisions of other people (of which the decisions might even be movie cliches, thus giving Fantastic Mr. Fox a sense of \"meta\"). We know the universe is illogical, we don't need you to constantly be a voice of reason. Comedies are funnier when there is NO voice of reason, and the only potential voices of reason are treated as unimportant or even crazy, or just ignored altogether.\r\n\r\nA positive of the writing, however, is that things happen quick often, requiring people to pay attention. What I'm saying is that it got it's pacing right, but it's jokes usually fall flat. \r\n\r\nPlot and style - The film's visual style is ok, but it's choice of music is all wrong. The film feels like it has way too much nostalgia for the 70's. Of course, this is to feed the machine of hipsters and older viewers who care for that kind of thing, but it's unnecessary. I mean, yes, it's an adaptation of a 70's book, but if I want a Dahl adaptation with a 70's feel, I'll go watch Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which was MADE in the 70's. I'm not saying that I want it to be full of people texting or whatever, but there's such a thing as timeless appeal, and if you're going to make a timeless movie you have to not date it so. Willy Wonka, despite all of it's 70's dated looks of characters, still kind of exists in it's own world. The factory is timeless because no matter what era you're from, it's still an odd factory, and the parts outside of the factory definitely don't give off a strictly 70's vibe. The film still feels fresh because it never openly said \"this is the 70's\", whereas the REMAKE happened to feel dated for much the opposite reason, making it TOO obvious what time period it was supposed to be, and also having CGI, which usually makes something look dated.\r\n\r\nBasically, what I'm saying with Fantastic Mr. Fox is that it lacks the clear timelessness of many other \"family films\", simply because it tries to feed the indie audience by giving it a strictly 70's vibe, which alienates viewers who AREN'T fans of The Beach Boys or The Rolling Stones (keep in mind, I know that the songs used are pre-70's, but they would have been played on the radio during the 70's anyways). The film's style just lacks an inclusive feel. It's exclusive to the hipster/indie fanbase and it kind of makes it hard for me to watch.\r\n\r\nThe plot progression I actually thought was decent. The beginning portion of the film was \"meh\", and the end was \"meh\", but the middle portion was good. Of course, Roald Dahl's book is just the middle portion of the film, but I'll give credit to the film-makers for doing a good job adapting the book in that sense, giving it a proper pacing and so on.\r\n\r\nThe characters are sometimes bland and other times decent. Mr. Fox is not the most interesting protagonist, and I honestly don't understand why they follow him, although they show that he's definitely the best fit to be a leader, so it's excused that he seems somewhat dumb (his plan that he develops to grab all of the farmer's supplies while they have all of their men out of the factories was something I came up with long before Mr. Fox came up with it). His wife is also bland, a boring \"you shouldn't do it\" character. His son is kind of bland too. His nephew was interesting to me, albeit a character I've seen plenty of before (the character being the person who has done nothing wrong but still creates a strong amount of jealousy in another character). The possum was a good character as was Franklin Bean. The rest I was indifferent to.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, after all of that, why am I giving it a 70%? I seemed to not like it that much. Well what I'm saying is that I haven't quite seen a film like it, although elements of it are just treading the same water that I usually hate. I can't stand the indie film scene, because a large amount of it is warm-hearted manufactured BS that gets away with praise because of being indie and stylistic. I've seen too many happy ending stories and throwing in quirkiness like indie films do doesn't somehow make it better that I'm being manipulated. I prefer films with realism to their craft, such as Kubrick's films where it's not necessarily winners or losers, and it's not necessarily the ones we want to win who do. I'm not against happy endings, but it has to have a sense of realism to it. A great example of a happy ending that works is This is Spinal Tap, where it's not necessarily the infallibility of the characters or the lesson learned or the ridiculous luck of survival that leads to a happy ending, but instead an agent of circumstance. I prefer happy endings to not force their way into a plot, but instead ease their way into a plot by having the characters ACTUALLY develop. The sense of realism has to start from the beginning and work it's way to the end.\r\n\r\nI know it's odd to talk about realism with an animated film, so I'll shorten my review to this - the film has it's problems, and is generally another \"indie\" film that falls into indie cliches in order to make the film seem unique and quirky. I don't like that, but I appreciate the efforts of the people involved and I wasn't mad watching it, I just happened to not laugh. It's not a very funny movie, although it can be somewhat funny at times, but I recommend it as a great visual piece with elements of actual GOOD film-making mixed in between the expected indie quirks and sub-Pixar animated phoniness of character development.",

            "content": "I wondered, \"How on earth is George Clooney gonna be a convincing voice actor?\" Well, Fantastic Mistuh Fox is surprisingly matched with a dexterous screenplay, almost as if it were catered to the adult crowd -- in other words, George Clooney was a perfectly well-casted gentleman. Funny thing is that although its fixated to please adults, the style is so artistically over-the-top, wild, and comical that this adventure is a lot of fun for the kids as well. \n\nNow, by how \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" has been described so far, it should seem like the narrative would be executed in a sort of clustered but calculated way, right? Nope, Wes Anderson rightfully keeps it clean and linear: it's the perfect balance of whimsical dialogue and themes, and the eccentric personality. Luckily, this linearity's coupled with good-hearted themes and a soft heart. And what a tribute to Roald Dahl's book; rendered to an almost complete picture-book-esque style, the cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The composition, the stop-motion technology, and the colors really pop out of the screen. The style is so overbearingly superb, the narrative just doesn't reach the same caliber throughout. Yes, the pacing is even and the voice-acting is all around great, but the entertainment value of the entire picture doesn't quite manage to deliver the same affection as its style. No need to worry-- it's not overbearingly fixated on art-house visuals that they complete alienate the children. \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is still a lot of fun, but compared to many animated movies out there, it's on the short end of the stick.\n\n\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is a fantastic (sorry, had to do it) art-house animated movie that's firing on all cylinders; it's got a great ensemble and an atypical screenplay coupled with eye-popping visual flair -- just don't expect this to be a wild ride as you would imagine a wild ride to be. The VISUALS are wild and eccentric, and there may be quirky moments within the plot, but \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" keeps its composure throughout.",

But after 12 years, the bucolic existence proves too much for Mr Fox's wild animal instincts. Soon he slips back into his old ways as a sneaky chicken thief and in doing so, endangers not only his beloved family, but the whole animal community. Trapped underground and with not enough food to go around, the animals band together to fight against the evil Farmers - Boggis, Bunce and Bean - who are determined to capture the audacious, fantastic Mr Fox at any cost.\r\n\r\nThere have been many of Roald Dahl's books brought to the movie world. We've had movies such as James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches, The BFG and now Fantastic Mr. Fox, which has proven to be quite the diamond. The story is brilliant which is to be expected since it's based on a Roald Dahl book, the animation is bright and colourful and is simply superb as it uses the original classic stop motion animation. The voice acting has no faults and the characters were beautifully written and a lot of fun to watch. It's guaranteed to leave you grinning from ear to ear after you finish watching it.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the trailer for this movie, I must admit I did have some doubts but after putting them aside and watching the movie, I could see I had nothing to worry about as this is truly a classic animation for children and adults to watch. The humour involved in the movie is great and timed perfectly. It surprised me as well because, and I don't know if this is me but, the animation looked choppy and kind of slow yet when watching the animation, it was nice and smooth and ran perfectly. Almost everything about Fantastic Mr. Fox was near enough perfect to how a family animation should be. However, nothing is ever perfect and I doubt I'll ever see a perfect movie. Having said that, this movie comes pretty close to being the perfect family movie. I really do recommend this movie to everyone as I have yet to find a person who didn't fall for the charm of Fantastic Mr. Fox. This will definitely keep the whole family entertained and adults and children will adore it. I thank the cast and the crew for bringing such a classic story to life and making it fantastic.",

The film was fiction film. The film lasts for 1 hour and 20 minutes. The film came out in 2009. The main voices are Georg Cloony and Meryl Steep. I had never seen those characters in any other film.\r\n\r\n Mr. Fox is cunning, clever, swift, wild, and selfish. Mrs. Fox is generous, kind, aggressive, helpful, and artistic. Boggis is fat, mean, selfish, hates animals. Bunce is short, white, mean, angry, and ugly. Bean is scary, tall, smart, bad temper, mean. The characters were good because they were funny. There were lots of special effects. There is music in the film. The film was about the foxes that got a new home. It was a fantastic movie. The film started like this Mr. Fox and Mrs. Fox went to get chicken then they got trapped in a cage then they went home Mrs. Fox was pregnant then she had a boy called Ash then they had breakfast then Mr. Fox got a new home then Kristofferson came to swim with Ash then it was dark then Kristofferson   was crying under the table then Ash turned on the train then Mr. Fox went out with Kylie to get chicken then they went again in the dark with Kristofferson then they heard something  then they were digging underground then they another  noise came then they had to dig again and again and again then they saw something digging in a hole then it was the badger and all of his friends too then the badger got mad at  Mr. Fox then they heard another noise then they were digging a hole again then they stopped then Mr. Fox made a plan then the people put water in the hole then Ash and Kristofferson went to get Mr. Foxes tail then they went to eat then they ran away then Kristofferson got captured in a cage then they went  to get Kristofferson then the dog was tearing Mr. Foxes tail then they went home and was dancing in a store The End.\r\n\r\nI liked this film overall it was funny and it doesn't remind me of anything. I liked the part when the badger got crazy eyes, my favorite part was the badger had crazy eyes then Ash went swimming and Kristofferson was sleeping under the table and I didn't like the part when Mr. Fox lost his tail I would like this film a lot if the film was longer and funnier. I think that little boys and girls would like this film. I recommend it to my brother because he never saw fantastic Mr. Fox  before, I think I would give this film a mark out of 5.5",

George Clooney voices a likeable Mr Fox but as with most Roald Dahl tales, it's the evil doers who are the most fun.  The three farmers are the most memorable and interesting characters in the movie, as well as their henchmen, Willam Dafoe, in fine voice as an effeminate ninja rat.\nThe films script is amusing and guaranteed to raise a smile, even if the joke of inserting the word 'cuss' every time a character swears does grow old after the first half of the film.\nThe animation style will not be to everyones tastes.  It does take some getting used to.  There are times when you feel like you've almost got to squint at it to see what is happening which gets a little distracting.  It's a bold move to use this stop motion animation style rather than a straight forward cgi/Pixar style but it's a bit much for a whole hour and a half.\nFantastic Mr.Fox is an amicable enough movie.  It's not likely to be supplanting Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory atop anyone's favourite Roald Dahl films but it's a nice, empty half term afternoon killer.",

It's chock full of great character moments and some very funny one-liners, all while managing to keep a grip on the story mechanics and the actual reality of it all. My only complaint, as if there could be any, is that it all goes by so fast and feels too short.

Not everyone admires Anderson's style in his films, and his style does translate directly into Fantastic Mr. Fox. The combination of this style of animation, Wes Anderson's filmmaking, a solid voice cast, and a children's story makes Fantastic Mr. Fox into one refreshing whole. Its nice to see a film (or animated film for that matter) have a level of creativity that surpasses most films in release today. \n\nHere's an interesting suggestion: what if Anderson collaborated with Pixar on a film? What would be the result? Chances are the movie watching population will never find out, but it poses some thought on the possible results of an unusual collaboration in Hollywood today.",

The voice acting was easily recognizable (Clooney and Streep as the leads), and most of the WA crew make an appearance (Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman), which is a plus. It feels much more like a Wes Anderson original rather than a Ronald Dahl adaptation. It took me a whopping 10-15 minutes to go from hating the worn and dull stop motion animation to loving it, so I guess it grows on you. Oh, and the slang humor was absolutely hilarious: they took your average Wes Anderson film, which usually gets an R rating for some language, and they replaced the swears with the word \"cuss\", i.e. \"You scared the cuss out of us!\" Now that may not sound funny here in writing, but trust me, it works. Laughed every time. Plus that helped turn it into a family-friendly film. I used to think The Life Aquatic was his best and my favorite. Perhaps Foxy takes the throne...for now.",

            "content": "Here's a movie with a boastful title that truly lives up to its name! Adapted to our wit's end by film nerd Wes Anderson and fellow director Noah Baumbach from a Roald Dahl children's story, FANTASTIC MR. FOX is such a joyous movie viewing experience that my face hurt when its all-too-brief running time came to an end. I was smiling that much.\r\n\r\nWes Anderson is a well-loved director in film snob circles, but I have to confess that, until now, I've always appreciated and respected him far more than I've ever enjoyed him. His filmscapes are so meticulously created down to the finest detail that they have felt vacuum-sealed, devoid of air. His quirky characters have all circulated in worlds of white, Holden Caulfield-like privilege: boarding schools, families detached by their own wealth, pasttimes of the rich. I have always had a hard time getting into these stories, and yet I've always noticed a genius comic timing and a batch of discussion-worthy, quirky and insecure characters absent from the majority of films in need of them.\r\n\r\nFANTASTIC MR. FOX has all of the comic timing and quirkiness, but this time, Anderson focus his anal-retentive eye for details on the art of stop motion, to the point where he slows down the film's frames-per-second to specifically draw attention to the medium itself. The result is, frankly, pure genius. Tempered color palates and visual symbolisms, sly dialogue, symbolic mise-en-scene.\r\n\r\nBut this fox is truly a sly one. It is, at times, silly to the point of being giddy. It will remind audience, I'd suspect, of a Wallace and Gromit cartoon, with the misadventures of animals on display for humans to enjoy. But Anderson takes even further the notion that we are truly spying on the animals' world. These are not Disney animals, made to personify human character traits. Rather, they are busy and fussy creatures who are irritated by us humans, and they are no longer willing to sit by idly without doing something about it.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know the basic story, Mr. Fox used to pull off some sneaky heists in his day but is now a domesticated father and husband who welcomes his nephew for an extended vision. But - as the film reminds us more than once - he is still a wild animal, and his urges have never left him. One more heist, he insists. The classic heist film convention...this is my last one. So Fox rounds up a few helpers but unloads a ridiculous plan. The heist will be three-pronged, seeking revenge on not one but three local farmers who have in some way or another terrorized the local animals.\r\n\r\nPlayed by George Clooney, who does little to affect a different cadence or sound than the George Clooney of any other film he's in, is perfectly dry here, resulting in gut-splitting hilarity in moments such as when Anderson and Baumbach replace the typical foul language of adults with the word \"cuss.\" The joke never got old. Clooney inserts \"cuss\" in every part of a sentence just as we creatively use the f-word today.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the vocal cast is equally great, with Meryl Streep (what a year for her!) as Mrs. Fox, Jason Schwartzman (an Anderson staple) as their son, Ash, and Bill Murray (another Anderson favorite) as a badger.\r\n\r\nThe script is Award-worthy. It is ridiculously clever to a fault, pure joy from start to finish. I can't type enough superlatives about it. Nor can I do justice in words to compliment what was clearly a daunting feat of artistic direction. As with all Anderson creations, the images in the film don't exist simply to tell the story. They are pictures to be mined for information on repeat viewings, rich with symbolism and cultural psychology.\r\n\r\nI would have to say that FANTASTIC MR. FOX was not only my favorite animated film of the year, but perhaps one of my favorite films, period. It has made me want to dive back into the Anderson filmography and, perhaps, give some of his stuffy, formalist comedies another shot.\r\n\r\nWere you planning to skip this one? The cuss you are! See it NOW. You will fall in love, too.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson's films are traditionally quirky and full of complex themes, and his adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox is no different. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's animated (stop motion); this material is not targeted at children.\n\nWhen we join the story, Mrs. Fox (Streep) is telling Mr. Fox (Clooney) that she's pregnant. The two proceed to rob a chicken farm and narrowly escape capture. Mrs. Fox makes him promise to look for other work now that they are about to become parents. Mr. Fox agrees and finds a job writing a newspaper column.\n\nMr. Fox settles down in his new life, but always regrets giving up his old ways. He's also tired of living in a hole in the ground and wants a better home for his family. He goes to see Badger (Murray), who advises him about properties for sale in the area. Fox wants a house near three local farms, but Badger suggests that the neighborhood is too dangerous. The local children even have a rhyme about the farmers:\n\nBoggis, Bunce and Bean\nOne fat, one short, one lean\nThese horrible crooks\nSo different in looks\nWere nonetheless equally mean\n\nFox is aware of the danger, but yearns for his former chicken-stealing days. As Anderson regularly reminds us, these are wild animals. Fox can't deny his nature and buys the new house so that he can be close to the three farms.\n\nHis decision goes directly against his promise to his wife and that was his first mistake.\n\nThere's a lot of humor in the film, but it's generally quite subtle. The family sits down to eat dinner and they eat like wild animals. The food is gone in seconds. Their son, Ash, is moody and craves attention from his father. He spits on the floor when he's angry or disappointed and he clearly has problems. When his cousin Kristofferson comes to stay, the situation worsens. Fox seems to favor Kristofferson over his own son and compliments him constantly.\n\nForget that we're dealing with animals for a moment and think about the story. If that happened in a regular movie, we would be dealing with a typical family drama. Husband and wife break promises and have trust issues, while their son is being raised by parents who don't understand him. This is not the kind of story that small children would understand, although some of the scenes are funny and contain action that would appeal to a child.\n\nFox enlists the help of Kylie Opossum and the two steal chickens from Boggis. The action is typical animated fare and the way the two sneak around is funny. They lace blueberries with a sedative to get past the dogs and the way the dogs react is also funny. They successfully steal from Bunce and plan to stop once they steal cider from Bean. For the final robbery, Ash wants to come along. Fox won't let him, but allows Kristofferson to take part. He seems to have very little idea that such a decision could hurt his son's feelings.\n\nThe robberies are fun to watch, especially when the animals wear bandit hats. It reminds me of the robbery in Bottle Rocket when the participants decide to wear similar hats even though their victims have already seen their faces.\n\nAsh yearns to be an athlete and wants to emulate his father's success at Whack-Bat (a game which parodies cricket). Kristofferson is a balanced individual who regularly meditates and knows karate. Ash is extremely jealous of his cousin and his ability to win his father's approval.\n\nThe three robberies annoy the farmers, so Bean (Gambon) decides to organize the trio and plans to kill Fox. This is where the film starts to take on a more serious tone. Mrs. Fox discovers that her husband has been lying to her and scratches his face in a fit of temper. This scene annoyed one of my friends who expected the film to be lighthearted and suitable for the whole family. Mrs. Fox acts like the wild animal she is. There's another scene in which one of the animals is maimed. Although it's presented in a humorous way, it could disturb people.\n\nThe remainder of the film deals with the three farmers finding ways to threaten the existence of Fox and his friends. They escape by tunneling deeper, but face the threat of starvation if they don't find a solution. Some of the other animals resent Fox for putting them in such a dangerous situation.\n\nThere's considerable peril which could worry small children, and a lot of humor which would probably fly over their heads. It was only given a PG-rating, but be aware that not every child will like this harsh world. The animals are true to their nature.\n\nThe reason I like the film so much is the style of humor. Like Bottle Rocket and The Darjeeling Limited, the characters speak with a sense of irony or sarcasm and most of the humor is tongue-in-cheek. It feels similar to Tarantino or the Coen brothers at times. There's no swearing, but every character uses the word \"cuss\" in situations in which they would normally swear. I found that particularly funny. One animal questions why a ransom note was made using words cut out of a magazine when everyone already knew the identities of the kidnappers. That's also funny to me. The missions all have elaborate titles and remind me of the way Tarantino uses chapters in his stories.\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox is an exercise in style. Mr. Fox himself is very stylish, dressing smartly and using his trademark whistle when he thinks he's being clever or cool. Clooney was a great choice for the part and the other actors all do a good job too.\n\nThe story is essentially about a dysfunctional family and shows how Ash attempts to come to terms with his existence. Will Mr. Fox eventually become a better father? Will Ash grow up and take responsibility for his own actions? Do Mr. and Mrs. Fox strengthen their marriage, or will the trust issues tear them apart? There's a lot going on beneath the surface.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson directs a visually remarkable adaptation of Roald Dahl's children's story Fantastic Mr. Fox. It's funny how I never read that book when I was a child; I was more akin to the world of Willy Wonka or the discombobulated domestic abuse of The Twits. But Dahl certainly had a style of extravagant surrealism and almost frightening hyperbole. In Fantastic Mr. Fox, the scenario is no different. Combined with Anderson's zest for black humor, this is one animated film that I'm proud to say pays homage to Dahl's legacy. \n\nThe story follows the sly Mr. Fox (cynically voiced by George Clooney) who promises his wife, Felicity, that he'll subside from a life of larceny and settle down in the farmland world. This is of course all highly fabricated. Animals cannot drive motorcycles, eat breakfast cereal, or pen columns in the local gazette. But this is Roald Dahl, not Watership Down. It appears that Anderson was truly compelled by Dahl's universe; he never pulls the punches for a second. The farmland animals are brought to life by an all-star cast, and fortunately that talent shines through. Bill Murray makes a hilarious badger, and Anderson regular Owen Wilson shines in a cameo as a gym teacher. There's also this possum named Kylie who was probably one of the finest examples of comic relief I've seen in a while. I'm still not sure what his loony eyes mean...\n\nThere's a zaniness that pervades  this film and it is not one to be trifled with. Every movement, breath, and idiosyncrasy is heightened by the stop-motion puppetry. There's a particularly evil triumvirate of farmers whom Mr. Fox rattles, and while their villainy is gratuitous, it is appropriate in this story. It's interesting to hear Michael Gambon grimace and grovel in a voice I had previously established only as the kindred Dumbledore. \n\nFantastic Mr. Fox is not entirely without flaws. The protagonist himself, because he is a fox, has little redeeming qualities. He admits that he's flawed but his species prevents him from learning from any mistake. For a children's story, I'm not quite sure what sort of message is trying to be conveyed here. The progressive absurdity that ensues (like rescuing fox Kristofferson from an attic) occasionally falls victim to petty gags. But Anderson's visuals are ubiquitous. They never cease to impress. \n\nFantastic Mr. Fox is a hilarious black comedy that adds a witticism to a children's story. For that reason, I think both adult and child audiences can find resonance in it. The children are sure to get a laugh out of the slapstick humor, the extravagant visuals, and the movement of the characters. As for the adults, they'll be asking themselves, \"What the cuss was that?\"",

The story has no problem getting from start to finish, making this one of the quickest animated films out there. Unfortunately, the film's dry sense of humor gets in the way of the story. The characters are likable, but the film lacks heart. While many critics have praised the film for being \"heartwarming\" and \"touching\", the film was actually kind of hollow. The attempts at adding character development work, but they ultimately make the film slow down. The father-son relationship seemed rushed, but the relationship between the son (Ash) and his cousin (Kristofferson) was a nice subplot. Aside from those flaws, \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" has a lot going for it. The art direction captures the autumnal setting of the film, and the character designs are creative. The scenes where Fox and Kylie steal from the three farmers are exciting and well-conceived. The soundtrack is a nice mix, including some 60s rock. (Although The Beach Boys' \"Heroes and Villains\" has nothing to do with foxes stealing squabs on a farm, ditto The Rolling Stones' \"Street Fighting Man\", which was used on the scene where the farmers use tractors to dig out Fox's burrow) It's a very quirky film and it gets a lot right, but the story needed a little work. Otherwise, it's a creative film that deserves recognition.",

From a technical standpoint the style very effectively matches the story, sound effects are comedic and appropriate, lighting is appropriate for mood, and the effects are suitable to the movie's fantastic nature. \n\nVocal casting is overall well done. I loved George Clooney as the voice of Mr. Fox who adds a feeling of \"smooth\" cockiness while maintaining the ability to garner the audience's sympathy when needed.

'Fox' crackles and sizzles with so much life and humor.  It never lets up!   It should have won for best animated picture that year.  Sadly, not many people saw it, as it only made about $21 million at the box office (compared to the over $200 million that 'Up' made) I know I'm a couple years behind as this came out back in 2009, but I am glad I finally rented it!

The animation firstly, is probably nearly the best i've ever seen and the voice acting by George Clooney and Meryl Streep is pitch perfect. I particularly enjoyed Willem Dafoe's performance as Rat. The film respects the book to the fullest much better than Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory. If Roald Dahl was alive to see this, i'm almost certian he would be proud.",

            "content": "Wes Anderson not only proves himself yet again as an auteur, but that he also has a knack for animation, because Fantastic Mr. Fox is nothing short of fantastic. Fans who are worried about this peculiar transition in Anderson's career need not be, as his stamp is surely on everything. \r\n\r\nWe are entertained with a light-hearted and playful story that remains always faithful to the children's book and the great Roald Dahl's vision, wild and quirky characters, and a beautiful setting bustling with imagination. Mix in the clever and often hilarious dialogue, all the heists, bandit hats being passed around--or the modified tube sock substitute--and you have a movie of pure delight that anyone of any age can enjoy immensely. I could not take my eyes away from the screen, and maintained a smile all the while. \r\n\r\nIt's refreshing to see George Clooney take on the voice of the sly and spunky Mr. Fox, as opposed to his more numerous, Oscar-praised performances, and who better to follow his lead than the most talented and most respected Meryl Streep as his wife, Mrs. Fox. If that doesn't have you yearning to see it, there's also Billy Murray as Badger and Mr. Fox's lawyer, Wallace Wolodarsky (who wrote for The Simpsons during the first four seasons) as Kylie the opossum and Mr. Fox's partner in crime, Jason Schwartzman as Mr. Fox's son, Ash, who spits whenever he is annoyed and is constantly trying to get his father's approval, and a nice surprise by Willem Dafoe as Rat, the night watchman of the alcoholic cider. Owen Wilson has a small role as Coach Skip--Hotbox!--and Wes Anderson even lends his voice. It's just an overall fun time watching Mr. Fox and friends use their specialties to stop three conglomerate farmers from destroying their homes; and why not off with some poultry and cider along the way? \r\n\r\nFantastic Mr. Fox is a stop-motion romp that has endless personality and vigor and is a feast for the eyes. Pixar's Up is going to have major competition for awards this year, and I'm rooting for something different. With dry humor the likes of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and the craziness of The Royal Tenenbaums, Wes Anderson has incorporated his style into every aspect of this movie, making it the best animated feature of the year. What the cuss are you waiting for? See it!",

Mr. Fox (George Clooney) is a reformed bird thief turned newspaper man, who despite a devotion to his wife and son, yearns for the excitement of his glory days. When the fox family moves into their new home (tree) near three prominent farms, Fox decides to embark upon one last heist.The Fox family dynamic is altered by the arrival of Mrs. Fox's nephew Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) who lodges in the Fox home while his father battles \"double-pneumonia.\" Fox's twleve-fox-year-old son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) is jealous of Kristofferson's talents and stature, and his father's blatant admiration thereof. As Fox squares off against the three sinister farmers, Boggis, Bunce and Bean, and tries to hide his illicit activities from his suspicious wife, (Meryl Streep) Ash struggles to outshine Kristofferson and makes his father proud.\n\nThe plot is whimsical and exciting, but as in all of Anderson's work, what really shines are the characters. Each is beautifully animated and brought to life by wonderful voice work by a cast including Bill Murray, Adrian Brody, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, and Michael Gambon.\n\nThe dialogue is hip and crisp without being gimmicky, and the timing of the interactions is pitch-perfect. There are some poignant moments, as well as some that made me laugh aloud.You'll find yourself quoting this movie for days. It's rife with brilliant and bizarre one-liners.\n\nEven if you've never seen any of Anderson's work, including \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" and \"Rushmore,\" you'll immediately identify his offbeat aesthetic. Fantastic Mr. Fox is made using stop motion animation, but Anderson's lovable visual trademarks are all here - deliberate and methodical cinematography, vintage style, vibrant color, and prominent on-screen typography. The construction of the characters and sets is charming and novel, and every frame features a stimulating palette of color and texture.\n\nRounding out the experience is a raucously excellent soundtrack, featuring The Rolling Stones, The Wellington, and Burl Ives. There's even an original tune by the on-screen avatar of Jarvis Cocker. The mix of off-kilter animation and washy 60s rock is a pure delight.\n\nI don't have much in terms of summation here, guys. Every element of the \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is fantastic, and the final product is nearly without flaw. It's poignant, funny, and a joy to behold. Simply put, it's one of Anderson's best. See this movie, folks. You won't regret it.",

In fact, one would wonder why anyone would bother making a stop motion movie, as opposed to a CGI movie.  The reason, is that stop motion has an odd, old fashioned, hand made feel to it.  And somehow, that feel has been captured and placed into this movie, and it's not just evident in the animation.\r\n\r\nFantastic Mr. Fox is inspired from Roald Dahl's picture book by the same name.  The film follows the story of Mr. Fox, who starts stealing farmer's merchandise again, without telling his wife.  Mr. Fox has been planning some \"great heist,\" despite his promises to his wife, claiming he would quit.  Soon, the three meanest farmers of them all (Farmers Boggis, Bunce, and Bean), decide to end Mr. Fox's reign once and for all.\r\n\r\nThe film's dry humor is both witty and hilarious.  No movie in the world can stand up to the unique humor that Fantastic Mr. Fox displays.  \r\n\r\nI give points to the outstanding voice talents (namely for George Clooney and Meryl Streep), and the comedic score by Alexandre Desplat.\r\n\r\nThe animation is spectacular.  By far the best I've seen in a stop motion film.  It's truly fantastic.  Even for stop motion, it looks incredibly good fashioned, and that is a very good thing.\r\n\r\nUnlike the book, however, this is not a piece of entertainment I can recommend for younger children.  It's too dark, and they probably won't get many of the jokes (they may get a kick out of all the fuzzy animals, however).  This is more of an older kids and parents flick.\r\n\r\nFantastic Mr. Fox is fun, entertaining, unique, and visually wonderful.  It is not hard to understand why they call it \"Fantastic\" Mr. Fox.",

Even though there were even more questions that I didn't mention here, I did that so I could get to the point. After this movie was over, I was thinking about giving it a bad review, but then I thought \"Hey, I think I like this movie!\".

This movie was a total package from music to the casting.  Let's not forget about the animation which was very refreshing and engaging to watch.  The relationships of the characters were balanced just right that they were fun to watch, but were not over done or forced.   Mr. Fox's charm and personality came through as he was caught up in situation after situation.  The creativity of the film was great, when it came to eating, fighting, and their use of strong language.  the way they used the animation to work for them instead of trying to make things too perfect.  I thought the film did pretty much everything just right, except it slowed down at parts too much, for a little too long.  Although I think I'm just trying to find some flaw so I have an excuse to not give it 5 stars.  I was also happy to see Jarvis Cocker (\"Pulp\" frontman) make an appearance (Petey), as a song man and adding a bit of music.  Not to mention other songs that made cameos by The Rolling Stones, the Dave Fuller Four, and more Beach Boys!  My ears give this movie a 5 star rating for sure!  I'm not sure what took me so long to see this movie, but I'm very glad I did.

Fantastic Mr. Fox is based on Roald Dahl children's novel of the same name about Mr Fox and how he outwits his farmer neighbours to steal their food from right under their noses.\r\nThe stop motion animation effects used in the film were superb and really fun to just watch. The environment and characters looks were made so realistic, their fur and eyes, probably everything were so detailed. \r\nThe movie's plot focuses more on Mr. Fox's relationship to Mrs. Fox and his son, which is pitted against Mr. Fox's desire to steal chickens as a means of feeling like his natural self. The movie adds scenes before Mr. Fox attacks the three farmers and after their bulldozing of the hill, as well as a slightly altered ending and more background on Mr. Fox's past life as a thief.\r\nDevelopment on the project began in 2004 as collaboration between Anderson and Henry Selick (who worked with Anderson on the 2004 film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) under Revolution Studios. In 2007 Revolution folded, Selick left to direct Coraline, and work on the film moved to 20th Century Fox. Production began in London in 2007. This film is also director Wes Anderson's first animated film and first film adaptation. Wes Anderson did an amazing job in directing this visually beautiful picture that left me impressed knowing that this is his first time working on an animated film and more amazed, in stop motion animation. Great work indeed. Anderson directed it with a great sense  and reveals his own style of story-telling with animation, it is just entertaining from start to end. I don't find myself getting bored of the film at all, the direction and animation will keep your eyes glued on the movie all the way, and that is all that matters. \r\nVoice acting in the film was absolutely great. Hands down. George Clooney voiced as Mr. Fox, great voice acting performance given out by the Academy Award Winning Actor. I personally find that Clooney is the best choice for the voice of Mr. Fox. Meryl Streep voice as Mrs. Felicity Fox, Mr. Foxs' wife. All voice acting performances were great. Nothing to point out on it. Other voice actors includes, Jason Schwartzman, Eric Chase Anderson, Wallace Wolodarsky, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson and Michael Gambon.\r\nI am impressed throughout the whole movie. I am pretty sure that anybody would be, when they watch this family friendly adventure film. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a beautiful film that has a variety of elements in it which includes, friendship, love and adventure. One of the best animated films I have watched in a while. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a 90% FRESH for me. Visually stunning stop motion effects, amazing directing by Wes Anderson and great voice acting performances by it's cast. A great animation film to enjoy for one and all. :)",

With an amazing cast consisting of Clooney, Streep, Schwartzman, Murray, and Dafoe just to name a few.\n\nAnderson has made something that will last in my memory forever. Most people see animation purely as an outlet for children. This film, while I would let a child watch it, is much more adult in my eyes. Both the child and the adult in you will love this for different reasons.\n\nHe did things in this film that I have never seen done with stop motion. There are amazing shots that will take your breath away. Beautiful sets that you can tell took so much time to make. He has outdone himself on this film.\n\nIf you haven't seen this yet then this is a must see.

With the help of some fellow critters, Mr. Fox and his merry gang of rodents unleash a plan of revenge.  \n\nIf you couldn't tell from the trailers, Fantastic Mr. Fox is unlike anything out there.  It's use of claymation and stop-animation is simply breathtaking, especially in an age of CGI powerhouses.  One downside I have is the fact the humor, hilarious as it is, is far too dry or far too high brow for kids to enjoy this.  They are better off sticking with Toy Story or something, but if you are old enough to get this film...you will be in for a treat.\n\nI absolutely adored this film.  I can't describe how much I enjoyed it actually.  I was literally smiling the entire time from just sheer enjoyment.  I laughed constantly and left that film feeling more than satisfied.  This is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen, animation or not.  If you can handle its style of humor and its visuals, you are in for one of the most amazing films I have seen this decade.  Fantastic Mr. Fox is simply...fantastic.",

            "content": "Yeah, probably my favorite animated movie. This is a complete delight, Wes Anderson expands his mediums while retaining his stylistics. Anderson has never been a cookie cutter or assembly line director, he has kept his esoteric style and humor beginning with his first gem Bottle Rocket. He is aquatinted with co-writer Noah Baumbach who co-wrote The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and afterward directed The Squid and the Whale. And in Fantastic Mr. Fox Anderson's style is emulated and even made better by the stop-motion animation. The tale follows Mr. Fox, (Clooney) a professional chicken and squab -whatever that is- thief who continuously goes on runs with his wife Felicity (Streep). On one occasion they are both trapped in a fox trap and Felicity reveals she is pregnant, and demands that Mr. Fox promises her to give up his current profession if they escape so they can settle down. Mr. Fox does settle down with his family, but the urge to get back to his old ways progresses then eventually spills over, and thats when the 'cluster-cuss' begins.\r\n\tThe movie is less successful at being a children's movie, but is very successful at being a crowd pleaser. The humor could be too high brow for some kids, but they will be entertained by the vivid imagery and the ambient characters. Adults would most likely enjoy the wit and charm in the writing as well a the performances by the voice actors. A higher admiration can be held  for the amazingly detailed and unique set pieces and stop-motion.      \r\n\t The usual Anderson suspects are here as well and they serve to season the Anderson flavor and put distinction into their characters. Jason Shwartzman voices Ash, Mr. Foxes son who is inept at sports and puts all his effort into becoming an athlete, while competing in the spotlight with his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) for his fathers attention. Shwartzman infuses the 'snarkyness' and quirky wit that made his character from Anderson's Rushmore so appealing. This movie is a interwoven gem through out and it's rare to see movies like these anymore as stop-motion is a rarely directed medium. \r\nYep, High fives all around Mr. Anderson and Mr. Baumbach.",

Unlike Crockett, who opposed Franklin Bean(Michael Gambon), a manufacturer of apple cider, is no Davy Crockett, but he, as well as his farmer friends, are not the men in black hats; are not in actuality, on closer inspection, the bad guys. Unlike Crockett, who opposed the removal of Indians from their homestead, Bean wants the animals off his land. (Note: It's the wolf who's the stand-in for the Native American, not the meadow animals.) Although it's only natural that you, the moviegoer, should side with the talking critters, don't overlook the fact that it's the foxes who start the war, in which the landowners are forced in a position to defend their respective livelihoods. Interestingly enough, the filmmaker uses The Beach Boys' \"Heroes and Villains\" during a scene where Mr. and Mrs. Fox(voiced brilliantly by George Clooney and Meryl Streep) steal chickens. The Brian Wilson-penned song calls into question the role of the foxes as either being heroes(the natural assumption made by the audience), or anti-heroes. Despite being adorable and wryly funny, they're undoubtedly the latter, as the sequence is preceeded by the opening scene's uncanny resemblance to the one in Fred Zinneman's \"High Noon\", where the posse of gunslingers congregate while being scored by a Tex Ritter ballad(\"Do Not Forsake Me\"). There's a juxtaposition at work, as the song reflects the protagonist's desire to see \"Frank Miller dead\". Likewise, \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" uses \"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\", and Davy Crockett is not Mr. Fox: it's Bean. In both cases, the protagonist's song humanizes the villain. The filmmaker pays homage to the imagery in \"High Noon\" where one gunslinger is approached by his associate on horseback, as Mr. Fox is joined by Mrs. Fox in a meadow before they they plunder a squab farm. The foxes are lovable, but they're thieves, and worse, don't have the excuse of being indigenous creatures, because they're civilized, a cut above the wild animals(like the wolf). (The badger, played by Bill Murray, is an industrialist; he owns a flint mine.) Most notably, Kristofferson(voiced by Eric Chase Anderson), the foxes' charge, arrives by train, as Frank Miller does in the Gary Cooper film, and like the \"High Noon\" antagonist, this slightly effeminate visitor is targeted for death. The filmmaker references this fact, arguably: Ash(voiced by Jason Schwartzman) owns a train set that he demonstrates for Kristofferson, which is followed by a cut to the actual train he arrived on.",

The symmetric world of Andersonto speculate it with such nuance..Fantastic Mr. FoxFantastic Mr. Fox is a character driven animated comic drama about a fox that fails to act against its nature and gets into trouble along with his family. The symmetric world of Anderson never fails to delight us and the primary reason is it being brimmed with fine details that speaks volume. The work went behind the stop-motion animation is just marvelous especially to pull it off on such large scale and to speculate it with such nuance that it leaves the audience in an awe of it. The acts distributed in here and the way they shift from one to another is bizarrely ingenious and extremely powerful. It is eerily fast paced yet aptly cooked characters that offers enough depth for the viewers to dig in and explore. The writing is sharp, to- the-point and explicit with tiny tactics installed in here that not only is infomercial but hilarious too. Such dysfunctional family might have been familiar to the audience but with a perspective like this, the clock starts from zero. It is rich on technical aspects like its up beating background score, amazing songs, metaphorical cinematography and fine editing that paints the picture brighter. The voice cast fills in perfectly in this wild world and has done a hilarious work especially by Clooney, Streep, Murray and Wilson. Anderson's strong script matches its brilliant execution where you know that you have surrendered to his surreal world when he draws out emotions from these characters and pours it like rain over the audience. The three dimensional characters, satirical humor, moral conflicts and thought provoking policy that is genuinely effective are the high points of the feature. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a forced to be reckoned with, that not only shows potential in such animation but also the structure of the script.",

They won't get most of the jokes that Wes put in. In fact, he had to add a censor word to replace what were originally swears(the word is Cus) He did this because it was based of a kids book so he had to make it kid friendly. If you haven't seen it yet, see it on DVD.",

It shouldn't be taken as a book adaption or a genre-defined movie. The realism of the closeness to the averageness of it is what drives Mr. Fox to look for a way out of the dull life he is in. There are many deep emotional levels that appeal to the heart of human nature and the dark side of business as seen by nature. Some things seem underplayed, but the story is solid. Don't go looking for something that makes you laugh every second especially if you have a close-mind. This movie is 50% opinion and 50% art.",

To give some context for my review: I totally loved Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic. For me (my sister violently disagrees) the Darjeeling Limited and its prequel, for all their magical sets and wonderful details, was just recycling the previous movies, and I found the Fantastic Mr. Fox, for all its amazing, unique animation, even more recycled. For a movie all about delightful detail, why do we have an opossum in Britain? a pair of foxes with only one cub? beagles without a trace of beagleishness? a rat the size of a fox? The reason is that this is not a movie about animals, it is a movie about people, and in fact this is a movie about people we've already seen in previous Wes Anderson movies. Several times I had an eerie (and not necessarily negative) feeling of deja vu, feeling that Anderson had literally recreated scenes from his live-action movies in puppet form. Roald Dahl is nowhere to be found (\"The Fantastic Mr. Fox,\" which I only read out of curiosity after finding the movie so un-Dahl-ish, was for me not anywhere near the top 10 best Dahl stories, but I was interested to see it was almost completely different in its sense of humor and its priorities--it was really about a fox, for one thing, not a human in a fox's clothing). Anderson's characters' lack of animalness stands in sharp contrast to Pixar's recent terrific movie \"Up,\" where the bird and dogs are wonderfully real and beast-like--even though clearly imaginary.",

Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox is very different from the tale , yet, still manages to feel the like the original, bizarre i know, while also expanding on such a small, modest, kids tale into an elaborate sophisticated story and character driving thrill ride full of charm and wit, which is all i ever ask for within a film, Charm, Plot, Characters and Wit, when all of these are done with the utmost care and compassion while trying to stay close to the source material yet also breaking it into something more, you know by now that i absolutely adored this film.\r 10/10",

The story is never too childish and Dahl's source material rich and -frankly- bizarre enough to keep adults guessing- with a good amount of near-cussing thrown in too.

It may be stop motion animated and based on a classic children's book, but it's as slavish to Anderson's style as Rushmoore or The Life Aquatic. Prime amongst it's qualities is the familiar off kilter humor and gentle catharsis that made his previous works such essential viewing.

Stop motion has always been one of my favorite art styles and the thing I don't like about it nowadays is that people prefer all slam bam in your face cg effects, and nothing organic, and it is getting very old, but when you see something like this it is just fantastic. And this is a dying art to filmmaking, think about it it has been 3 years since another Wallace and Gromit film, and 2 years since a Stop Motion film has had a theatrical release, and thats why I think this is a dying art. I love all the details that are put into the characters, like how the fur on the puppets constantly moves throughout the scenes, plus the voice acting is really, really funny and entertaining. I didn't know who George Clooney was until this movie and im happy it introduced me to him, plus this movie i think has the biggest all star cast ever for a stop motion film, Bill Murray, Adrian Brody, George Clooney, Owen Wilson, even the small part characters have big actors.",
