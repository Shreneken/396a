            "content": "The most remarkable thing about this Berlin Silver Bear directing (Asghar Farhadi) winner is that despite all the suspense and tension, what it is about is so ordinary daily life that it could easily happen to anybody, anywhere. What is gripping is the way the story is told through a volatile camera and how the underlying human characters and emotions are explored.The follow recap of events up to the first 45 minutes of this 2-hour film is technically not a spoiler, as I wouldn't even reveal details of the major incident that is the crucial turning point. And yet, it is a spoiler in the sense that some of the background only come out in the second half of the film, simply through dialogue of the character, that is, no convoluted flash back or time scramble which apparently still hasn't gone out of fashion in Hollywood.11 people (4 man, 4 women, 3 kids) from Tehran drives to a seaside (the Caspian) resort for a 3-day holiday. There is however a hidden agenda. Seven of the adults are close friends \u0096 2 couple, brother-and-sister pair and a single guy Ahmad (Shahab Hosseini) who just got divorced. The wife of one of the couples, Sepideh (Golshifteh Farahani), invites a pretty young woman along in the last minute, a match-making gambit for the divorced friend. Elly (Taraneh Alidousti) the attractive outsider is Sepideh's kid's teacher at the nursery school. It turns out that Sepideh doesn't even know her last name. What Sepideh does know though, is that Elly is engaged, but willing to come along because she is trying to get out of the relationship with her fianc\u00e9 (Saber Abar). This Sepideh hides from everybody. In the first 45 minutes, the audience follows with mild interest the progress of this modern, middle-class group's seaside vacation and gets to gradually recognize some of the character, obvious starting with Elly and Ahmad. But something happens, switching the tone of the film quite abruptly, and the audience follows the film with gripping attention to the end.I must re-emphasize that there is no convoluted plots, credibility-stretching events and the likes of such that flood Hollywood movies. Everything that happens, as well as the people's reaction, is something that you and I can relate easily to our ordinary experience. The power of the film is derived from the way in which some of the facts unfold, to the audience as well as to the characters in the film. This is drama, suspense and tension in real life.The acting is excellent although the cast is unknown, with the exception of Golshifteh Farahani who acted opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in \"Body of lies\" (2008) as the charming nurse his characters falls in love with. The Iran depicted in this film is modern \u0096 except for the headscarf, the women are no different from what you'll find in any big city in the Western society. People's emotions and reaction to event and situations are quite universal. The human nature probed in this film, therefore, can be easily empathized with.",

            "content": "To say the most important thing first: 'All about Elly' requires unmitigated attention from the viewer. I actually watched it in the Berlin Festival last year, but didn't think too much of it as I was distracted. Since it won the Silver Bear and was voted by Iranian critics the best national film ever, I decided to give it another shot on DVD, and as it works sometimes, I realized that this film is not only a true gem, but one of those rare, timeless classics that may help to explain to posterity the reality of generations past.What lulled me into a mistaken sense of boredom upon my first viewing was the unassuming start of the film. The simplicity of the plot - a group of young Tehrani couples going on a seaside weekend trip, with one of the wives trying to act as a matchmaker between a female colleague and an expat on vacation from Germany - is presented in such low-key fashion that if you don't know what's coming (and I didn't) it's hard to focus on the subtle hints of possible conflict. Also, while I've been to Iran and consider myself vaguely familiar with the complexities of life there, of course as a mere visitor you can catch but a fraction of what things mean, and since this is very much a jump into an unknown society, you really have to blank your mind to catch the drift of what the characters say.Ironically, that's a stark contradiction to the usual Iranian festival fair: Kiarostami works a lot with metaphor (which he often endlessly repeats to drive the message home), Panahi with situation developments (which he exploits to the utmost degree to drive the message home), and therefore their works do not require much background info, though it sure helps. Farhadi's film asks for a bit more audience participation, as much of the conflict in the second half of the film stems from Iranian social reality, I would think. That is what, on my second viewing, convinces me of the timeless quality of this film: never before have I seen a director pull so much substance out of so little plot and setting.Just because 'All about Elly' appears to be simple at first, it is actually really deep; once I suspected that every frame in this film means something and is not just there, I entered an alternate visual language, which then communicated the urgency of what Elly's disappearance meant to me. I felt that this film thereby manages to tell me emotionally what I could rationally never fully comprehend: what it means to actually live in a country like that. No other film from Iran has ever done that for me, and I've rarely seen a film from another culture that managed to do so. So I would assume that Farhadi has taken directing to another level here.What's more: this isn't just a very artistic way to convey a message, it's also very entertaining. For once I was drawn into the characters, their sense of alarm and suspense kept me on the edge until the very end. There's a decent dose of Hitchcock in 'All about Elly' as unreal as that may sound. That's the real charm of this film: although it's demanding in terms of familiarity with the setting, it's international in its depiction of emotions anyone from anywhere can relate to.In conclusion: Definitely not to be missed if you are just as much as remotely interested in Iran, or have a sweet tooth for excellent direction (though the French term 'mise-en-sc\u00e8ne' hits the mark in this case). This is the kind of movie that should become part the curriculum of film students around the globe.",

            "content": "With Chaharshanbe-Soori (Fireworks Wednesday) and now Darbareye Elly (About Elly), Asghar Farhadi has shot right to the top and joined an elite club of Iranian film makers, such as Kiarostami, Majidi and Mehrjui, whose films are appreciated worldwide. Farhadi's films are truly world class and full of nuances and deft touches not usually found in Iranian movies.About Elly starts deceptively simple. A group of married couples, some with children, have come to a seaside town for a short break. The only single people in the group are Ahmad (Shahab Hosseini) who has recently separated from his German wife and Elly (Taraneh Alidoosti) who is a nursery teacher to Sepideh (Golshifteh Farahani)'s child. Sepideh has organized the whole trip, as well as playing matchmaker to Ahmad and Elly.The film really takes off when, in an apparent attempt to rescue one of the children from drowning, Elly disappears. Was she drowned? Did she just leave because she was embarrassed by the group's snide remarks about her and Ahmad? There are echoes of Antonioni's L'Aventura here but there is a big difference between the two films. Wheras in L'Aventura the missing girl quickly became forgotten by the group, here Elly becomes center of attention. The group realize how little they knew her; they don't even know her full name (Elly is a shortened version of several names). The questions keep surfacing: who was Elly and why did she agree to accompany a group of relative strangers for a few days in another town? (something highly uncommon for a single girl in Iran). About Elly is a worthy follow up to Farhadi's Chaharshanbe-Soori (Fireworks Wednesday). Again, as in that movie, Farhadi examines the consequences of lies and deceptions. He shows that even mundane lies of convenience, if piled on top of one another, can lead to unforeseen events. In addition to his insightful scripts, Farhadi clearly has an ability to draw top notch, and often career best, performances from his cast. All the actors here are superb but special mention must go to Golshifteh Farahani, Shahab Hosseini and Saber Abar. Like Chaharshanbe-Soori, About Elly demands and repays several viewings.",

            "content": "\"About Elly\" seems like a rough sketch for \"A Separation\" (2011), one of the best films of the current century IMHO. In both cases, Farhadi's focused on social lies and deceptions and the ways they come back to bite us--as well as on the contrasts and contradictions between the lives and aspirations of contemporary Iranians and the restrictive social norms of Islam--but \"Elly\"'s not as tightly plotted or as involving. In many ways it's like typical film-festival fare from a non-Western country; it's a little hard to keep track of the characters at first, and it's not always clear why they're behaving the way they do.... The setup's intriguing: old college friends from Tehran--three married couples and their kids and a recent divorc\u00e9--and a slightly mysterious plus one, Elly, share a clapped-out weekend cottage on the Caspian Sea. At first everyone's acting goofy, singing and busting little Zorbalike dance moves.Then something happens--two things really--and everything changes. The sky darkens, the sea gets rough, and husbands and wives are (almost literally in one case) at each other's throats. Suddenly these 21st-century sophisticates are chattering about evil portents and lost honor and fear of shaming; several layers of deception have to be unwrapped before the film's ambiguous ending. Expert cast (including the husband from \"A Separation\" and Nefertari from \"Exodus: Gods and Kings\"[!)]; the performances seem a little over the top at times, but that may just be a cultural thing; great cinematography. Certainly worth watching, prob'ly more so if you've already seen \"A Separation.\"",

            "content": "A group of middle-class friends travel from Tehran to spend the weekend at the seaside. Sepideh (Golshifteh Farahani) invites Elly (Taraneh Alidoosti), who is the young teacher of her little daughter, to travel with the three families in order to introduce her to their recently divorced friend Ahmad (Shahab Hosseini) that lives in Germany. Ahmad will spend a few days in Iran and asked the cooperative Sepideh if she can find a fianc\u00e9e for him. On the next morning, two women go shopping in the town and the Elly tells that she will return to Tehran since her mother has been recently submitted to a heart surgery, but Sepideh asks her to stay and hides her luggage. The children are playing in the sea and one mother asks Elly to watch them. Out of the blue, Sepideh's daughter calls the men that are playing volleyball to rescue one of the children from the water. They rescue the little boy and they seek out Elly, questioning whether she has drowned or returned to Tehran. What has happened to Elly? \"Darbareye Elly\" is a spectacular Iranian film, awarded with eleven wins including the Silver Berlin Bear in the category Best Director and with six nominations. The realistic story is impressive, giving the sensation of a documentary through a handy camera. The heartbreaking story makes sense in the values of the Iranian society, where adultery might be punished with death sentence through stoning. The discussion about the \"status quo\" of Elly, who can not call off her commitment with her fianc\u00e9, is a brilliant panel of the thoughts and judgment of their society. I am a fan of Iranian cinema, but \"Darbareye Elly\" has overcome all my best expectations and is among the best Iranian films I have had the chance to see and I will certainly recommend it to my cinephile friends. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"\u00c0 Procura de Elly\" (\"Seeking out Elly\")",

            "content": "A few years ago, A Separation won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. This Iranian movie was exquisitely acted and director Asghar Farhadi must have been justifiably proud of his work at the helm. Not surprisingly, another one of Farhadi's films has just been released to theaters in the States. However, oddly, it's actually a film he made before A Separation! About Elly is from 2009 and once again features superb acting.The film is set during a holiday in Iran. A group of friends have decided on a brief trip together and are using it to try to set up their friend, Ahmad, with a pretty young lady named Elly. Most of these friends don't know Elly--but Sepideh does and thinks she'll be a good match for the guy. The first portion of the film seems pretty mundane with the usual banter you'd expect during a holiday getaway. However, things turn dark when one of the small children nearly drowns. The boy is saved but after the confusion dies down, everyone starts to wonder where Elly got to. Perhaps she jumped in the water to try to save the boy and drowned herself or perhaps she just left. After all, she DID insist on going home the following morning...and it was the following morning when the boy nearly died. What's next? See the film.This movie is an interesting character study as well as a cautionary tale about lies and half-truths. Once again, Farhadi did a wonderful job with the film and the actors really deserve kudos for their realistic performances. In particular, I noticed that the children really seemed scared when they should have been and the adults later begin to show definite signs of stress. It was hard to tell that they were really acting--as if Farhadi actually did something to the actress playing Elly!Despite my loving the acting and direction, I'll admit that this is certainly not a film for everyone. Some folks don't like films with subtitles, some will find the subject matter a bit too mundane and some might be a bit put off by the ending. I didn't mind the first two minor concerns but I, too, thought the ending was perhaps a bit weak. Still, the film is a marvelous showcase for the folks involved and deserves to be seen. Well worth your time if you can find it in your local theaters--which isn't always easy with foreign language movies.",

            "content": "2010:Reading a leaflet from a local art house cinema,I was disappointed to find that I had just missed a screening of an Iran New Wave (INW) Thriller. Looking for the movie on DVD,the only result that turned up was one without English subtitles.2016:Finally getting the chance to see Asghar Farhadi's work in the haunting Drama The Past,I was thrilled to discover that the BBC were to show one of his earlier works,which led to me getting set to at last meet Elly.The plot:Going on a three day holiday,school friends/ couples Sepideh,Amir, Shohreh, Peyman, Nazy and Nazy's husband Manuchehr decide to take their children along on the trip. Aware that the recently divorced Ahmad if flying in from Germany to join them on the break, Sepideh pushes her daughters kindergarten teacher Elly to join them,in the hope that she will woo Ahmad. Arriving at the beach villa,the gang find the place to have no phone reception and to be in the middle of nowhere. Wanting to keep things secret,Elly travels to town and calls her mum to lie about what's taking place.Fearful that Elly could run off early, Sepideh hides her bags. Wanting to spend some time on their own,the gang ask Elly to look after the kids on the beach.Relaxing,the gang is shaken by the scream of a child floating away on the sea,and the discovery that Elly has disappeared into thin air.View on the film:Keeping what awaits them at bay,co-writer/(along with Azad Jafarian) directing auteur Asghar Farhadi & cinematographer Hossein Jafarian give the opening 45 minutes a laid-back attitude,where the camera drifts along to snippets of casual dialogue.Riding the waves of dread with INW tracking shots cracking over the ocean, Farhadi breaks the calm with an atmosphere running on high anxiety,as stylish camera moves sweep the ocean for any sight of Elly. Making a sandcastle for his major visual themes, Farhadi lays the villa bare,subtly matching the bare soul of each guest,caught in draining close-ups and clipped dialogue out of earshot, capturing the emotional,darkly thrilling waves.Initially looking like a nice holiday to the beach, the screenplay by Farhadi and Jafarian chips away at the calm and taps into the pure Noir terror,brilliantly bringing the fracturing state of each relationship to the surface. Finding no sign of Elly on the sea,the writers' strike a chilling mood with an expert deconstruction of Elly's disappearance leading to powerfully raw questions on treating words with a minimal value and the drastic measures people will take to keep a lie in place.Twisting Elly's arm to come along, Golshifteh Farahani gives a divesting performance as Sepideh,whose face is drawn by Farahani in lines of disperse,and a desperation to grasp any sign of hope. Flying in from Germany, Shahab Hosseini gives a magnificent performance as Ahmad,by Hosseini keeping the lingering sting from Ahmad's divorce very real,in a film about Elly.",

            "content": "Based on my opinion, this movie was even better that A Saparation, an award winning Farhadi's film. Farhadi proves adept at controlling the tone of his film. By slowly setting up the situation and the complex nexus of relationships between the characters, he lulls the audience into thinking the film will continue in a comic mode until Elly's disappearance. From then on, the film takes a serious tone. Lies come back to haunt the characters, and the consequences of these are unforgiving. Some of these lies were told due to particular proprieties necessary within Iranian society. The brilliance of Farhadi's script and direction becomes most apparent in the latter stages of the film. As one secret after another is revealed, Farhadi deftly maps out the shifts in the perceptions and behaviour of the characters toward each other as well as the viewer's perception of the characters. Farhadi's cast is uniformly excellent, especially Farahani, who compellingly registers Sepideh's shock at how her seemingly innocent matchmaking has taken such a tragic turn, as well as the way her character, like others in the film, is revealed to not be what it initially appears.",

None of those smart-mouthed little brats here. Nearly-every-American-sitcom-in-existence, take note.And the story... STUNNING. Events occur as you'd expect they would in the all too real central predicament, as each reason for their friend's disappearance is ticked off the list and panic slowly but surely creeps in... leading to the sad but inescapable conclusion. It's just like watching a fly on the wall documentary of an epic tragedy... and not the made up ones you see on TOWIE. Boo hoo, some bimbo's broken a nail.

From that moment on to the final credits, the movie runs at a frenetic pace, throwing one twist after another that eventually results in confusing & challenging the morals of its viewers by the same degree as its characters.An ordinary story told in an extraordinary manner, About Elly is not only one of the best films offered by the Cinema of Iran but is also a respectable motion picture that world cinema can proudly brag about, and just like any real masterpiece, this film will continue to endure the test of time & is gonna age like wine.

In first look, the film is a simple family adventure, three Iranian families go to trip and everything seems perfect that accidentally becomes a sad drama. It begins with a simple lie and then by missing Elly, hiding truth ruins everything: morality, humanity, loyalty and suddenly you ask yourself: \"What do they think about Elly, Really?\" Storytelling is simple but professional and the cast are great, especially Golshigteh Farahani(Sepideh) shows that she is one of the most talented Iranian actresses.And all, I highly recommend it for who likes to see a modern \"L' Avventura\" and modern \"Antonioni\".",

            "content": "Yet another masterpiece delivered by Asghar Farhadi of 'A separation' fame. This movie depicts a simple, Orthodox, shy Iranian girl Elly being called out to spend 3 days of nice vacation time with a bunch of lucky go happy friends from Tehran. Sepideh(who knows attractive Elly from being teacher to her daughter) knows she already is being engaged since 2 years but Elly tells she is about to break up with her fiance, so Sepideh intends to play her matchmaker with Germany returned friend Ahmad. Sepideh is as common at lying frequently as any normal person which is shown how she with held the fact that room wasn't available for 3 complete days but she still felt it could be manageable somehow on arrival.During her first night stay with the group Elly learns how it feels to be in a much progressive middle class elite group away for some time though from her simple, cultured, conservative social situation which awaits her soon after departure from this temporary joy.\nShe is not used to feel-free attitude her new found group of friends are accustomed to or how they make offensive jokes at each other lightheartedly. Through eyes of surprised freedom which other people can afford she simply walks out evidently giving glimpses of dissatisfaction she has in her own life and curtailed expression of joy or heartache she got within.When she gets lonely time in car with her potential match Ahmad during grocery run. Ahmad says how his German wife left him with movie defining statement 'A bitter end is much better than a bitterness without ending'.Elly's life is accurately same as the line. She is stuck between a conservative and oppressive system involving her mother and fiance on one end and joyful progressive elite class friends whose closeness reflects her own misery and pushes her towards breaking the shackles. But she just simply can't denounce the present and hug the desired future as intended. Her life and the system doesn't allow her that comfort.Choice is only a luxury of a few social elites which she can't afford.While left to look after kids she is asked to fix the kite by little girl.While playing with the kite she forgets her complicated hopeless life for a moment and learns to live at present with free willed joy filling her heart out of the agony all around. She does denounce the bitterness of unending life by succumbing to a bitter end on her own. Finally she lived a moment of carefree life she longed all life like a little girl. She didn't had choice to live but die on her own terms.Around her suspected disappearance grows many lies.Each lie to cover up their own moral shortcomings. All the facades of the so called progressive friends fall short with passing minute and growing nervousness. Honour, truth, social stance, cliched orthodoxy, social status suddenly becomes top priority over progressive humanity. Each character tries manipulation to justify their innocent role in the outcome for self consolation. Suddenly other then themselves others action around Elly is questioned and marked offensive. Ultimately Elly's character, her cleverly manipulated lies to her mother, fiance, the bunch of friends comes under scanner just to hold her the antagonist. And freeing themselves, society and status out as not guilty conveniently.These series of miscalculated unnecessary manipulations of a simple situation leads them nowhere towards solving the mystery and finally when her body is found everything falls in place. All their complicated overthinking of a simple girl's life put under question who just wanted freedom from patriarchal Iranian society which made her oppressed and doesn't allow to have what she truly desires and live with joy like rest according to her own choices.It's a profound analysis on human nature and how all moral standards are broken under circumstances. Facade of progressive mentality only remains until we can afford it. Not everything is complicated at the face value. Human life is ruled by simply situations which gets sometimes overwhelmed even among the best of us.",

            "content": "This movie seemed to have a lot of promise early on showing the everyday lives of a group of Iranians friend on a weekend holiday on the Caspian Sea. This is not something seen often in movies so it was a welcome change. The acting, cinematography and music all were first rate. The early scenes with Elly were all understated and her uneasiness with the group hinted that something was not quite right.The scenes leading up to and including the climatic near-drowning scene were well scripted and choreographed.But after that, the film went downhill fast. There could have been a satisfying film just based on the aftermath of the tragedy and the revelation of Elly's full story and the consequences of forced marriage, the idea of an individual's right to choose etc.But instead the story went into an almost comedy of errors based on the lies which had been told, and continued to be told throughout the remainder of the film.I personally have a rule which I call the \"Three's Company\" rule, whereby it's hard to feel any sympathy or any type of strong bond with the characters if the only reason they're in the predicament they find themselves is because of their own poor decisions.This, unfortunately, is such a case with this film. The lies that Sepideh told to get Elly there in the first place along with her being less than truthful about the accomodations were bad enough (and GolshiftehFarahani as Sepideh did a fanastic job expressing her guilt over the incident), but the casual lies that the group told Elly's family and fiance, for no real good reason were just unforgiveable, and made the situation worse than it otherwise was. I don't know if that is supposed to be a comment on Iranian culture where people lie constantly to each other, both between husband and wife, between friends and to strangers, on such a constant basis, to the point that they need to teach their children to lie, but if so it's a terrible commentary on Iranian society.This aspect marreed what was up to that point a promising film.",

            "content": "This movie strikes me as belonging to that regrettably burgeoning category of \"movies that are made for the sake of making a movie\". Obviously I can't comment on the motivations of the director but it bears all the hallmarks of a movie that was made up as it went along. In my simplistic mind a good movie can achieve 2 results \u2013 it either entertains you or it presents some hypothesis of the directors for consideration. The later category can be implemented in two ways \u2013 it can ram the message down the audience's throat so that the message is abundantly clear, or it presents a few clues from which the either the astute viewer can work out the puzzle or the less astute viewer can get confused or bored and turn it off. As a provider of entertainment this movie fails \u2013 while provides an interesting glimpse into the lives of a group of affluent Terhanians there is no plot per se. As a provider of a message it also fails. The other reviews on this site document at length theories about \"lies\" and the effects they can have. This seems to me to be no more than trying to pin depth and meaning to a movie which is simply not there. Sure, one of the characters (Sepideh) seems to be a hair's breadth away from being a pathological liar, and from time to time other characters also lie in quite bizarre ways for reasons that are difficult to fathom \u2013 for example why would you tell someone their fianc\u00e9e was injured in a car crash rather than drowned? But these lies do nothing to effect the outcome of the movie other than to drag it out and provide some sort of confusion that presumably is supposed to manifest itself as tension in the audience. None of the lies resulted in Elly's death or had any material effect on the outcome, such that that was. This is not a bad film, but it is a lazy one, the director not bothering to provide a real story and trying to pretend there is something deep and meaningful hiding behind some manufactured pretext. It is a shell trying to pretend it has substance, a \"Waiting for Godot\" where nothing worthwhile, honest or profound is revealed during the wait. As others have commented the acting was excellent, especially since it has the feel of a movie that was substantially improvised.",

            "review_title": "Darbareye Elly",
            "content": "Is the space in About Elly about merely a class divide, or does it also concern sociopolitical difference? Certainly Asghar Farhadi's representations will challenge what little and genuine coverage of the middle east we have in the west. He assigns the three middle-class families on vacation atypical cultural markers which aim to familiarise: their rambunctious hollering and yelling from their cars in a tunnel, the sporting of sunglasses on foreheads, the way they dance and play pranks with a bathroom door missing its lock. Although the women still wear their headdresses, these moments seek to de-mystify and wave away the inbuilt modesty of Iran that we may be more accustomed to. The boy overseeing the villa observes them with a strange curiosity as if he was mesmerised at the apparent freedoms they are afforded (and willingly flaunt). They joke about how wives have surpassed their 'masters' - western domestic scenes will find the same humour in the imagery of a ball and chain. But later Amir might as well wield the whip and tassel himself as the arguments turn physical. It seems that their modern guise may be little more than a slip-on. The openness and immodesty of these introductions may lure an viewer into a false sense of security, believing the characters and setting to have freed themselves from the implicit cultural codes of propriety and honour that still rule modern day Iran. A closer glance reveals lies that are offered easily because of certain situations, and how little white ones enlarge and begin to swallow them. We see how Elly conceals the purpose of her trip to her mother, and how this later takes on a more deceitful tone. Sepideh likewise partakes in this practice, using it as a tool to barter for their accommodation, but the lie reveals other lies that may have already become truth in her mind. Is the partnership that she has set up already becoming a betrothal in her eyes? Is it merely a matter of time between the young teacher and the handsome divorc\u00e9e? What Farhadi does is merge these questions of class and culture into a typical mystery, and expose how little we know and understand these characters beyond their surface. Slowly, the dialogue and interactions unveil the more conservative mindsets that rear their head when push comes to shove. Ideals of womanhood and femininity are warped and bargained; they tease each other about their domestic duties and place, and make reference to the virtues of the fairer sex (\"A woman must come\", \"Better if a woman calls\"). See how Elly shrinks to what she believes must be her default state in the household, shunted into corners, into backseats, offering to clean, not quite comfortable with the ease of her companions (especially the female ones, as they later interrogate what seems like an offhand comment). In one moment they are playfully rubbing Arash's head for his contribution in charades, the next propping him up like a toy and probing him for answers (and when that does not reveal more, mistreatment comes into play). Jafarian visualises the sudden disconnect through his blocking, where the group, once bunched together on the couch, and able to face each other in circles, are now separate individuals, leaning against walls, wandering away off the path, storming in and out of rooms to conduct their own conversations and investigations. His greatest achievement is the follow shot that captures Elly's last living moments on screen; the camera tracks her as she flies the kite, never allowing her to leave the confines of the frame, and holding and holding until her peals of laughter become uncertainty. The shakiness of the camera and the cuts becomes more and more erratic, and Jafarian merges form and content into a visualisation of Elly's shocking realisation that a kite, however freely and gracefully it rides the winds, is still tethered to its holder via string. Farhadi is known mostly for his Oscar winning A Separation, one of the great films of the 21st century that pondered struggles of religion, class and gender within the context of personal predicament. One of its greatest strengths was its utter refusal to create bias and take sides - we are able to survey the events from the perspective of all its participants, and understand even the actions that we most ardently disagree with. Some of the figures in About Elly are harder to empathise with. We are not quite sure, for example, exactly the type of monster that her fianc\u00e9 may or may not be, and how this factored into her choice. The film has been compared widely to L'Avventura, and in forming these comparisons I have come to see that the best films about the mystery of a disappearance forgo the cold logic and process of a thriller and instead survey the effects on those surrounding the event. Antonioni's modernist masterpiece began with the same premise, but descended into a harsh exposure of the shallow excess and emptiness of its characters' existences. Spoorloos, or The Vanishing, another foreign film in the same vein, reveals its murderer and motive early on, but is more interested in investigating the evils and pitfalls of curiosity and guilt over time. Similarly, About Elly is not wholly concerned with solving the mystery, but instead focuses on how its characters partake in lies and deceit, and how this unearths older, buried issues they have tried so desperately to discard.",

The storyline is about a group of young people - friends, family, and offspring - who gather together for a weekend of fun at a beach house. However, disaster strikes when a child is washed into the sea and one of the women goes missing. The first thing that strikes the viewer is that ABOUT ELLY is a very well made film. The cinematography is excellent with lots of beautiful shots both of scenery and actors. The acting is of a realistic standard and despite the drama of the storyline there's never any melodrama or over the top emoting going on.Writer/director Asghar Farhadi uses the film's narrative to explore questions of what it means to be young and carefree in modern-day Iran. In particular, gender relationships are explored in detail, particularly when it comes to permissiveness and the like, and to what extent a young woman has freedom in society to do as she wishes. It's all highly interesting, giving western audiences a chance to find out something about what a little-known country is really like for the people living there.",

No one quite knows where Elly has disappeared to, or whether she is alive or not, but they try to tell Elly's fianc\u00e9 Alireza (Saber Abbar) the sad news, while at the same time trying to absolve themselves of responsibility. Inevitably the whole facade of untruths they concoct comes apart at the seams, leaving Sepideh and every one of her friends tarnished. ABOUT ELLY is an ironic title; no one really wants to know about Elly at all, but rather looks after themselves alone. Hence their propensity to tell lies to save themselves. All the protagonists lack a sense of responsibility to the wider community; they are far more interested in maintaining a respectable face, both to themselves and the world they inhabit. Director Asghar Farhadi suggests the decline of their world through suggestive shots, especially the use of a hand-held camera that pursues the characters as they desperately try to cover their tracks. An unsettling film shot in stark colors, with little or no music on the soundtrack, forcing us to contemplate what the characters have done.",

This movie is another gem he gave us before the last one.It's really a great movie with a stunning plot. I recommend this one for those who look for movies which address their minds and spirit. Don't miss this gem. This is an extremely well made film; it is both beautifully shot and directed. The acting is all top notch and the camera work is such that it has a fly on the wall feel at times as this was clearly not shot in a studio. The emotions are very intense and whilst it can be off putting to be a voyeur on someone else's grief, this is just more compelling because of it. It is in Iranian with good sub titles, only on my copy they were right at the bottom of the screen making some hard to read, but that in no way detracts from the quality of the film.

Banned in Iran, this is a deceptively simple enough film on the surface. But like most films emerging from Iran, About Elly contains a wonderful subtext that explores the divisive nature and repressive political structure of contemporary Iran, and the film is especially critical of its social strictures that deny women rights and an opportunity to have a say in their own lives.

This excellent movie has been presented as a mystery, but I don't see it that way. I see it more as a film about the interaction of group of friends getting away from the constraints of Tehran to a vacation area on the Caspian Sea. The only person who is not part of the group of friends is a kindergarten teacher, Elly. She teaches the daughter of one of the friends in her class. A member of the group is back from his home in Germany, and has asked one of the women to help him find a wife. The unofficial leader of the group--Sepidah--suggests that Elly come along to meet this man. Elly is reluctant--for reasons we don't understand--but she finally decides to go along with the plan. However, after the first day, she wants to go home. What happens next isn't so much a mystery as it is a study of a group of friends responding to what may well be a tragedy.Taraneh Alidoosti plays Elly. Alidoosti has been named the greatest Iranian woman actor of the decade. (She may also be the most beautiful.) However, the real star of the movie is Golshifteh Farahani as Sepideh. Sepideh is obsessed with keeping Elly at the resort, and when things turn sour, she is obsessed with trying to hold the group together and make the best of the situation. Whether she will ever again be accepted as the group's unofficial leader is uncertain. Whether the group will even keep together is another uncertainty.My spouse pointed out that the ensemble acting in this movie is amazing. We expect it from \"Friends,\" because that group of actors worked together year after year. But how did director Farhadi get such superb acting from a dozen actors who have never acted together as a group? I assume the answer is an immensely talented director working with highly skilled professional actors.The person who introduced the film is from Iran. She pointed out some very important facts that we would not have otherwise known. For example, the Caspian Sea is renowned in Iran as a attractive, exotic resort area. On the other hand, the surf is extremely treacherous. So the area is not only beautiful, but also dangerous.The introducer also remarked how difficult it is for sophisticated, educated people to maintain a sense of identity in the repressive culture of theocratic Iran. One aspect is that people lie easily, because telling the truth can sometimes lead to serious trouble. Everyone lies easily, even on minor matters. (They don't lie very well, but they still lie all the time.)We saw this film in the wonderful Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum in Rochester, NY. Some of the sea scenes will work better on the large screen, but the film will work on the small screen as well. Find it and see it!P.S. As I write this review, About Elly has an excellent IMDb rating of 8.1. I love to see a great movie appreciated by the IMDb audience.",

At first it looks as if they won't be able to stay as long as planned but when they claim that Elly and her potential match are newlyweds a house is found. On the first evening they all enjoy themselves singing, dancing and even playing charades. The next day Elly explains that she must return to Tehran but her friend tries to dissuade her. This is soon forgotten when one of the children gets in trouble in the sea; the adults come rushing and manage to save him\u0085 only afterwards do they realise Elly is missing. Did she leave for home during the drama or did she try to save the boy and drown? As the others struggle to come to terms with the possibilities they realise they knew far less about her than they thought!When one thinks of Iran one tends to think of a strict society where people aren't like people in the west\u0085 anybody watching this would think they are just like everybody else as the story could have been set almost anywhere; we see people having fun, arguing and worrying about people they care for. While it is nice to see a more human side to this country what matters more is whether or not it is a good story\u0085 it most emphatically is. The early scenes serve both to introduce the characters and lull us into a false sense of security. The scene where it looks as if the boy has drowned was tense and things only got tenser as we first learn that Elly is missing and then learn more of her back story. The more that is learnt about her the more it threatens to tear the group apart. The cast did a great job and director Asghar Farhadi did a great job keeping things tense without excessive action scenes or even the use of music; we just had the constant lapping of the waves which served to make it more real. Overall I'd say this is worth watching by anybody who loves a good drama and especially those interested in seeing films from a country such as Iran.",

That story is a tale of young Iranians who take a weekend away at the seaside, but after the pivotal episode, their carefree fun descends into a mixture of grief, guilt and self-serving blame; there's also a nicely constructed mystery confounding them, as it's actually unclear if any tragedy has actually happened. One thing that's particularly noticeable is how chauvinism comes to the fore once the tension mounts, easily displacing the pseudo-equality we saw on display earlier. The fact that the women all wear head-scarves doesn't make the world on display at the start of the film seem very different from any portrayal of recent graduates in a non-Islamic country; but while the chauvinism we see in the second part certainly has parallels with chauvinism elsewhere, it retains a shocking aspect. By the end, I thought that the plot had possibly been spun out just a little too far; but the naturalistic feel makes the audience believe in the characters, fundamentally ordinary people hit by, and unable to deal with, a terrible event.",

The story is simple, the events are tragic, the characters are wretched, mendacious and judgmental about an unfathomable misfit, the beginning is celebratory, wild and self-congratulatory, the ending is mournful, sepulchral and recriminatory and the whole is superlative and deserving of a quarter-of-an-hour standing ovation for the now great Iranian director Asghar Farhadi.Three Iranian families set out to the Caspian Sea for three days. Accompanying them are Ahamd, the excellent Shahab Hosseini, who has come back from Germany as a widower to stay in Iran for a short time seemingly looking for a wife and Elly, Taraneh Alidoosti's character, who is a kindergarten teacher and unhappily engaged to somebody back in Tehran which is unknown to every body but Sepideh, the brilliant Golshifteh Farahani. As a matchmaker, Sepideh brokers the introduction between Ahmad and Elly. Everything goes smoothly except for a little hiccup in the villa arrangement which results in them nicely settling in an abandoned villa with broken windows, with no proper toilet, without a cell phone signal reception and precariously close to the sea as the families have three recalcitrant children. They joke, make fun of each other, mime, play volleyball until the news that Arash, Peyman's little son, has gone missing in the sea is broken. That is when the bubble bursts. They manage to reclaim him from the sea alive. No sooner are they relieved of the overwhelming shock than a second news flash comes relentlessly: Elly has disappeared into the thin air. Has she drowned in her altruistic and heroic effort to rescue the soon-to-be-dead boy? Has she abandoned the band unawares? And questions of that ilk which are left to be answered by the rest enlisting their judgmental prowess about the character and background of a person even whose name is a total mystery. That is where the inner layers of the characters crawl out of the patina of suavity and are laid bare. With their illusions punctured and hopes dashed, they give a back seat to their gentility in favor of a peer and marital slanging match, fracas and recrimination.Thanks to the taut and tightly knit script, all is compelling, limpid and cogent. The virtuoso camera-work is also a particular boon which helps drag the audience all along and leave them mesmerized and quizzical. When they hear of Arash having gone missing, the initial bacchanalia and revelry turns into a real hell and in a helter-skelter search for him, they dash to the epicenter of the disaster while the camera follows them intensely and with such a frisson as if it were an involved party and were about to stumble.Part of the appeal is also the inspiring performances turned in by each and every one of the actors. In a bravura performance, Farahani effortlessly disappears into her character and weaves a web of lies to paper over the cracks developed as a result of her indiscretion. This knack for churning out lies convinced Hollywood talent scouts to choose her for Ridley Scotts' \"Body of Lies\".About Elly is a movie which preserves some of its flavor for a second viewing as some scenes make more sense only in retrospect, especially the pantomime scene which reminds me of the scene in Antonioni's \"blowup\". With this movie, Farhadi has opened up new horizons for the Iranian cinema industry. I tip my hat off to him.",

            "content": "maybe it was funny but the movie \"Darbareye Elly\" or \"About Elly...\" is the most different arty film you ever seen from Iran. i mean comparing to Abbas Kiarostami, Majidi & others' films. I love Farhadi's works from \"Dancing in the dust\" and \"The beautiful City\" TV serial to \"Firework Wednesday\" movie and now at the top of this social genre he is with \"About Elly...\" I recommend this movie to everyone... please... please watch it!But about the film: the whole view of the film is different from other Persian movies... in this film Iran is a modern country with modern people and modern problems but there is a bigger problem that is very old and it is the LIE... whole parts of the story makes you to follow it or maybe I would say it makes you to be in the story... 3 middle-class Persian families with their friend AHMAD (acting by Shahab Hosseini), that is newly divorced from his German wife and came back to Iran, travel to the shores of the Caspian Sea on a three-day vacation. Three couples include Sepideh and her husband Amir who have a little daughter. Shohreh and her husband Peyman who have two children including their little son Arash. Nazi and her husband Manoochehr are the third family. And Ahmad is Nazi's brother. But there is another person with them. The kindergarten teacher of Sepideh's daughter. Her name is ELLY. 'Elly' is our and their all information about her. Sepideh brought her to introduce her with Ahmad but didn't say to Elly that he is a widower of a German wife. (1st Lie)Sepideh (acting by Golshifteh Farahani that is known in the west by acting in the movie \"Body of Lies\") in this movie is the statue of telling Lie. She didn't even told to 3 family that Elly is coming with them, even to her husband!!. (2nd Lie) They want to take the villa that Sepideh has booked from Tehran but the owner going to come tomorrow and they just can stay for one day, not three days. But the people said that they booked it and the 3rd lie of Sepideh was that, to bring everyone specially Elly and Ahmad together. after a while they went to a seaside villa but although Shohreh wasn't agree because of her son, Arash, she didn't say anything. After a day Ahmad and Elly fell in love and want to marry but Elly should go back home because of her mother but Sepideh doesn't let her. Sepideh and Shohreh went shopping. men were playing volleyball and Nazi was in the villa. Little girls were playing at seaside and Arash was swimming. at this time girls came and said 'Arash isn't at sea side'. men went and rescued him but who was the children's guard. Nazi said: 'Elly, of course... but where is she?'Because I want readers to watch the movie so I'm just going to talk about Sepideh's Lies, the fact reason of Elly's disappearing.whole 3 family, of course Ahmad too, looked for her but nothing. Even the Caspian Rescue Team couldn't find and said they are looking for her almost an hour and if she was in the sea she is dead. Police came and asked 'What is her name'. 'Elly...' people answered. 'But what is the full name... Elham, Elmira, Elnaz, Elizabeth, ... What?' Policeman asked again and no one knows even Sepideh that gave her child to Elly... Policeman asked them to bring her Identification Cards... Oh my God ... there isn't Elly's bag here maybe she was gone... 4th lie of Sepideh is hiding Elly's bag from they... and the mobile phone ... Sepideh has it too ... because this shock, Amir got wild and punished his wife, Sepideh... they called one of the phone numbers saved on Elly's mobile... his brother was... Sepideh said Elly doesn't have any brother or sister... so who was he ... yes... the 5th lie of Sepideh was, not to tell them that Elly had a fianc\u00e9 ... So why was she with us ... she wasn't going to marry him ... the man came there but he understand whole story when the rural woman said all about Ahmad and Elly... and the last lie of Sepideh was to say him nothing about their knowledge of Elly's fianc\u00e9 to make her a Bad girl ... 'it is not important' whole families said 'Elly is dead and what will happen if we make a lie? she was a bad girl that came here to be introduced with Ahmad when she was with some one else.' ... Sepideh didn't said even Elly anything about Ahmad (7th lie) but what will the man think about Elly...? Yes ... Sepideh made another lie at the end and all the people went back to Tehran... there was just the newly found body of Elly and her sad fianc\u00e9.What do you think about Elly? ... Most of you think that she went to sea to rescue Arash but herself didn't came back ... but maybe in the road back to Tehran someone rubbed her then killed and put in seaside because she was found in very far place... and Maybe many other things ... What happened to Elly? ... What do we think about Elly? this is the main question that make you think about this brilliant movie for a while... but What would happen if Sepideh didn't say any lie? ... why do we say lies with no matter?... In Islam, telling Lie is one of the biggest sinsMaybe because of that some people said its name should be \"About a lie...\"",

Totally not about Elly, \"About Elly\" is an amazing movie, with great direction, amazing acting and a superb plot, that has so many layers, so many surprises and so many little details that you will not be able to stop watching.And it all starts in a quite relaxing manner, so relaxed that it wouldn't be a surprise if in the first 10-15 minutes you thought this was a 'realistic' movie of some families having a short holiday at the beach. But then things start to happen, and then more things, and if you didn't have enough, more things. The plot relies a lot in secrets within secrets, and in the actors capacity to deliver the dialogue with grit and authenticity. And the whole cast those an incredible job, with Golshifteh Farahani's Sepideh at its center. Farahani's interpretation will make the viewer worry and suffer with her character, till they are grabbing their hair in desperation at all that is happening on these holidays that were supposed to be so much fun.\"About Elly\" is a drama and a mystery, an incredible tense movie, and an superb study of human psychology.

One of the major league reviewers said \"the less you know about this film going into it the more shocked you will be.\" Or something like that.Huh. Well, here's what it amounts to: 30 minutes of an aborted house party. One guest goes missing. Another guest hadn't properly represented the missing guest. 90 minutes of panic, bickering, dissension among the other guests. The end.I think the fact that Elly, the missing guest, is secretly engaged and attending this house party under the auspices of finding another husband is a lot more subversive in Iranian culture. It just doesn't hold that much gravitas in the U.S.The performances are good but I expected more drama around the other characters and while this occasionally surfaces it's mostly all speculation about Elly. I'm also a bit tired of every critic flipping over with their paws in the air every time a film makes it out of the Middle East that's not complete dreck. About Elly's biggest problem is its geocentric script and tone-deaf sense of pacing. The over the top accolades it's getting are just ridiculous.",

The two points are for the music and for one scene in which the matchmaker's husband finally has enough of his wife's lies and goes about giving her a thrashing, which, of course, you should not do to a woman if you're a man but, at the same time, he does not do it for himself and instead against the tiring repetitious lying he and all others have been subjected to. Why did she not just break up the engagement, one asks? That would have been the decent thing to do instead of beating around the bushes! She somehow tried but she did not, keeping her fianc\u00e9 still warm and in reserve, so to speak. And the matchmaker goes along with it. Disgusting. I would probably have given the film 6 points if it were not for these 8 points that it really does not deserve. After all, it take a moral stand, somehow and that's, after all, commendable.",

            "content": "Sepideh (Golshifteh Farahani) has invited her friend Elly (Taraneh Alidoosti) to join her friends and family on a three-day vacation. One in which she planned to try to match Elly with Ahmad (Shahab Hosseini) since he is recently separated and saw them as a good match. However, during one day at the beach, everything goes wrong. Thus leading to Sepideh having to reveal more about Elly than she cares to, and her being forced to take responsibility for the lies and actions she hid from the group. PraiseAs I find myself increasingly watching more and more foreign language movies, I find myself seeing more similarities to English counterparts. However, with About Elly, there is a spin here dealing with the fact the cast is Muslim and it brings certain cultural specific thoughts, issues, and circumstances. All of which make this slightly more interesting than if it was another English American movie, but only but so far.CriticismWhen it comes to issues with this film, honestly it maybe more so me, in terms of what I like as a movie goer than the film itself. For, as can be seen in many a criticism, once a film goes over an hour and a half, 9/10 I will note the film overstayed its welcome. An issue which undoubtedly is in About Elly since it lacks any sort of intriguing drama at all. For even as Sepideh reveals her and Elly's secrets, and we meet someone from Elly's life, there remains this complacent tone which makes you feel sleepy and drowsy.Something which isn't helped by how difficult it is to uniquely identify most of the characters. For while the men can be slightly identified by their hair grooming, and some by their weak story lines, the women largely are ghostly figures. Which isn't to say they don't have a place in the film, for Sepideh and Elly are the two main figures, outside of Ahmad, but unless you take notes I'd say it may take longer than it should to know who is who of the cast.Overall: Skip ItIs there anything seriously wrong with this film? No. However, there isn't much done with this film to really constitute you investing 2 hours of your time, and the price, to see it. For while the acting is decent, and the story is OK, this really has no selling point besides it having a Muslim cast. Take that away and you have your usual melodrama which doesn't really take advantage of the many avenues it could, and it just leaves you drained and kicking yourself for wasting your time. Hence the Skip it label for while it seemed like it could have been interesting, I finished the film sorely disappointed.",

Along with them they bring two unattached individuals. Ahmad, the brother of one of the wives (played by Shahab Hosseini, the working-class husband in A Separation), who is coming from Germany, having recently divorced his German wife. Elly (the beautiful Taraneh Alidoosti), a sweet rather shy girl in her early 20s, is a teacher; one of her pupils is Morvarid, the young daughter of one of the wives, Sepideh. Sepideh has talked Elly into coming along in the hope that she and Ahmad may link up. Since Iranian law forbids the cohabitation of unmarried couples, Sepideh lies to the landlady, telling her Ahmed and Elly are married. However, Elly has some secrets in her life, which are better not to reveal now, since they will be key points in the plot (people having secrets and constantly lying to one another is an insistent motif in this film; this movie could have been easily named Secrets and Lies).The first half hour of the movie is a bit misleading, we see the men and women playing around in the villa (their sometimes obnoxious behavior at one point make me almost walk out of the film). But then a tragedy happens and the rest of the movie becomes a gripping mystery.",

            "content": "I believe that in ancient Persia telling the truth was the central virtue. Obviously Iran has come a long way since then.I thought this came out in 2015, since that's when it hit theaters in the US, but I see it's 2009. Why a 6-year wait? Because the director's other two films, \"Separation\" (which I loved) and \"The Past\" (liked, but not loved) came out later, and someone is looking for a big payday?Let me talk about the press conference at the Berlin Film Festival, which is on the DVD, first. Farhadi, the director, acted like a politician--he didn't answer one question directly or truthfully. Not only was he evasive, he even gave answers that had nothing to do with the questions. When the actresses were asked directly if Farhadi \"imposed his vision\" on them, they sucked up big time and talked about how collaborative it all was. Right. I need to sell them a bridge. There were no fewer than three questions about the film having a \"problem\" in Iran. What the problem was is never discussed. The director denied there was \"a problem.\" I can see why he directed a movie where everyone lies! He wouldn't know the truth if he fell over it.At one point the director talks about trying to make the movie \"universal.\" Really? Constant lying? Treating women like dogs? That's not universal. And the first scene--some slot with something being put in at intervals. \"What the hell is that?\" I said to myself. In the Q&A in the press conference, Farhadi explained it was an alms box that travelers put money in before a trip to ask for a safe trip, and yes, there was some dialog about Elly putting money in an alms box, but I never connected it to the opening scene. How can it be \"universal\" if the opening scene is a strictly Iranian custom that no one else knows about????Also, I see that Golshifteh Farahani (\"Sepidah\") was exiled (i.e., threatened with bodily harm) from Iran in 2012 and now lives in Paris. She's going to be in the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean, so obviously it's hurt her career\u0085 (more sarcasm). Good for her.OK, now the movie. You know those horror movies where all the people do really, really stupid things? And you yell at the screen, \"Don't go into that room!\" That's exactly what happens here. Everyone--yes, everyone--tells lies constantly. Why? Is this some sort of metaphor for Iran? A country where you have to lie constantly to get along? I don't know. The woman are treated like crap: \"Get the salt.\" \"Get the tea.\" \"Watch the children.\" \"Clean the house.\" At least in the subtitles there are no \"Pleases\" or \"Thank yous.\" Then there's the scene where Amir throws his wife Sepideh to the ground and starts beating her. Charming. And then when thing start to go wrong, everyone blames everyone else in an infinite chain. Lovely. Gosh, I want these people as my friends!! (more sarcasm.) Then they talk about the \"honor\" of Elly\u0085what, because she bundled up in a ton of clothes and went for a day at the seaside with friends? And of course the women plunge into the ocean with all their clothes on. They would drown in less than a minute--the wet clothes would drag them down. Then there were the multitude of \"holes\" in the movie--they're covered on the message board threads, so I won't list them all, but there were lots and lots. Stuff that didn't make sense, stuff that had no meaning but just \"happened\" to be in the shot. This is supposed to be \"art\"--everything's supposed to be there for a reason. Again, see the message boards. And if you notice, at the end of the movie all the adults are in the house discussing what to do, what their next lie should be, etc., and where are the children who almost drowned the previous day? Oh, they're playing in the ocean. What kind of parents ARE these? The final scene: everyone trying to push the car that's stuck in the sand. This does sum up the movie--why pull the car out with the 4-wheel drive vehicle or jack up the rear wheels and put something under them? No, that's too easy. Let's all push. Dumb and dumber.I will say the acting was excellent. However, they deserve to be in a better movie.",

            "content": "About Elly is a stunning surprise package, profound in utterly unexpected ways - a tragic drama of manners that casts its lens at the often capricious dynamics that take over when a group is faced with a threat.Ahmad, a recently divorced thirty-something expat, is back in Tehran for a brief visit. His coterie of old college friends - three married couples along with their kids - try to cheer him up with a weekend getaway at a beach-house. To spice things up, Ahmad's closest friend, Sepideh (a wonderfully devastating portrayal by Golshifteh Farahani), decides to play matchmaker and bring along her friend Elly, to discreetly set her up with Ahmad. It's an ostensibly innocuous opening by director Asghar Farhadi that seems to do little more than build a believable world which these characters inhabit, leisurely setting up the group dynamic, never tipping its hand as to when the plot will kick into gear.After the characters enjoy some initial merriment, disaster occurs when the titular Elly vanishes. As a frantic search transpires, questions emerge about Elly's whereabouts. Friendships shatter and fingers point in the ensuing chaos and uncertainty, even as lies multiply. Before it is too late, Sepideh begins to divulge crucial information to the rest of the group about Elly, which brings blatantly misogynistic social norms deeply ingrained in even the most liberal, secular portions of Iran to the foreground, while also remaining a deft examination of trust, guilt, friendship and the far-reaching implications that even the smallest of lies can have on a more universal level. The mystery of About Elly ultimately moves past Elly's disappearance and who she was and onto the moral underpinnings of the various ways the characters react to the ambiguity of the situation and the social breaches that were made.Emotional intensity is Farhadi's m\u00e9tier, and to see About Elly is to revel in his skill. As with all his films, Farhadi patiently reveals one layer after another creating a rich palette of swirling emotions and interpersonal drama that is handled with his typically subtle, evenhanded style. Having put us at ease through the first act, he introduces tension in the second and then something frightening happens in the third. Abruptly, not once but several times, the movie changes tone as a rolling series of crises amplify the seaside tension exponentially. As we are pulled in deeper, the tightly structured story takes drastic turns as deceit by multiple characters is exposed and mistrust grows.As with all his films, Farhadi refuses to exaggerate his stories with cinematic trickery. His characters may lie as much as they breathe, but as a filmmaker, Farhadi couldn't be any more honest.",

After everyone pitches in to clean up a rundown seaside rental, it's all fun and games for awhile, as we see kids playing along the shore, the preparation of a meal, and a game of charades. There are three couples who have three kids between them, and one of the women (Golshifteh Farahani) has invited along her daughter's teacher (the titular Elly, Taraneh Alidoosti) in order to introduce her to a newly divorced friend (Shahab Hosseini). There is a nice sense of conviviality between all of the friends, and though it's a bit awkward for Elly amidst the wink-wink references of trying to set her up, she goes along with it as best she can. The next day, however, she tells her friend she'd like to leave, because she only committed for one night, and isn't feeling a particular love connection. Things turn tragic when she's left alone with the children, but I won't spoil it, except to say it made for some heart-pounding viewing.Under great stress, we soon see the amiability between the friends break down, with everything from people second-guessing little moments to outright blaming others for what's happened. The men who seemed so mellow and cool get regressive with their wives, treating them in a lot of ways like children, and in one case doling out physical abuse. The veneer of progress is stripped away and we're either seeing these characters for who they really are, or perhaps just what strain can do to the better natures we try to cultivate. The truth is elusive in a lot of ways here, as director Asghar Farhadi gives us lots of options to consider as to what happened, and the characters consistently tell white lies or withhold information to avoid conflict, which just seems to make things worse. It actually gets a little frustrating at times because of all these deceptions, but I believe that was part of the point, and regardless, Farhadi did a great job of making me feel how frantic and exhausted these characters are. Great camera work, strong performances, and an emotional film.Quote:\n\"A bitter end is much better than a bitterness without ending.\"",

            "review_title": "Establishment of an unofficial court structure",
            "content": "I will discuss how an unofficial court structure is built within the narration and how the trials are processed and reflected within the visual language in About Elly.\nAbout Elly tells the story of a group of friends in their 30s. There are three couples some of which have kids and their friend Ahmet, a recently divorced man coming from Germany for a holiday. The purpose of this trip is to arrange a marriage between him and Elly, the teacher of the kids who is a stranger to everybody except Sepideh, mother of Elly's student. The arrangement is planned by Sepideh, yet everybody follows the plan including Elly and Ahmet. On the first day, they have a pleasant evening playing some games and conversing nicely. On the following day, however, one of the kids gets lost in the sea while playing under the watch of Elly. While he is rescued eventually, Elly cannot be found, story unfolds and the judgmental process begins.\nIn About Elly, establishment of the trial cannot be clearly understood until the mid of the film. The movie begins with the introduction of the characters through their decisions or the conversation that takes place between them. During this process, we are commonly induced to think how modern and democratic this group is. We see female characters in pants. Their hair is half covered as the modern Iranian women do. We immediately have a sense that this is a story about the modern part of Iran.\nThe very initial scene where the democracy is established in \"About Elly\" is when the group votes for staying in the particular house that is assigned to them. This scene contradicts our conception of Iranian society because not only the decision is made by voting in a country known to lack certain human rights in the eyes of Europe, but also woman are involved in this voting with the same rights as man.\nThe voting issue is a bit exaggerated in a following scene where we see an ironic reproach of Ahmet saying that he will marry Elly if the majority votes as yes at the end of this trip. Even a private matter that is out of public consideration is open to voting in a society that is governed by Shariat where the Islamic rules are the highest legal rules. This is also ironically mentioned in the scene where they play charades and the name of the one of the films is \"Long Live Students at Law School\". Here, we see how controversial concepts come together and exist harmoniously.\nAfter we have a sense of this democratic group where we are confident of their civilization level (!), the incident happens and Elly gets lost. The rescue squad cannot find her which I see as a sign of incapability of the governmental side in the establishment of an ending. Then, the police cannot solve the problem, either and moreover scold the group. It is clearly stated the government is above the individuals, yet how just is it? The conclusion of the governmental party is that the sea gives back what it took in the first place, so that the power is relayed to the nature from the governmental resources. Here, we see a black representation of governmental side. This representation is intensified in the eyes of the audience with lower light shots and use of colder blue colors. The coldness of death, the moment of ambiguity, fuss that the characters experience is visualized in this scene. The warm yellows in the first half of the movie disappear after this scene.\nThen, the establishment of the justice is laid on the individuals who may be black or white individually, but become grey when they are together. The very initial help comes from Ahmet who suggests looking into Elly's hand bag to find her ID. Not finding the bag gives them the hope that she might have returned to the city. However, Sepideh announces that she hidden the bag before the incident strengthening the possibility of Elly's death. Here, the eyes are turned to her. Now, they have a person who knows more than the rest hence a person to blame. Then, the trial of Sepideh begins in the eyes of the group.\nNow, the concern of the group is how to elude out of this mess. For that, an imitation court is established. Who is being judged is Sepideh. There is a public prosecutor of the case: Sepideh's husband, Amir. He immediately suspects that Sepideh is hiding something. There is a lawyer: Ahmet. We later on realize that there was a reason why Ahmet defended Sepideh. There is a jury that argues about the trial for the rest of the movie: the others in the group. Finally, the witnesses are the children.\nThe prosecutor and the lawyer are black are white sides of the trial. However, the jury is much more greyish. Peyman and Shohreh is one couple and Naazi and Alireza is the other couple in the jury. In the former, we see Peyman as the whiter character in the sense that he is more constructive and a solution seeker, while in the latter, we see Naazi in this position. Alireza is not even very engaged in the matter. However, when they come together they make a complete jury that is composed of different colors and is eventually grey. They do not immediately pick a side, and instead they try to reveal the truth. They reconsider which events happened up to that point. They try to analyze the case and find out their role in this escape or death. They question the witnesses. The seriousness of this court is emphasized when Peyman asks witnesses to behave as if this was a real court.\nThe tension in the trial increases so much, so that the prosecutor, Amir, even beats the accused, Sepideh. This scene is shot with a hand held camera that increases the tension of that moment even more. He tries to prevent the witnesses, the children, from witnessing this event saying that \"Morvaid go inside honey\". This increases the intensity of the dark representation of Amir. I think, until this scene, the prosecutor and the lawyer put forward their accusations or defenses, made their claims. But then, the story shifts a bit.\nHere in the middle of the movie, a new character is introduced to the movie: Elly's fianc\u00e9 or so called brother. Now the real plaintiff joins the trial. His entrance put the trial in even a more critical position because now they have to make a decision in a shorter time. They even try to manipulate the witnesses, the children. They panic! Here we see how greyish the jury becomes. As a further proof of this, we see the false testimony of Naazi to Elly's fianc\u00e9 in a following scene.\nAs their time shortens, they cannot pass a judgment on the case and the pressure on them increases. Moreover, this results in the confession of Sepideh that she insisted Elly to join them even though Elly initially refused. During the whole judgment she was more passive than the prosecutor, the lawyer, or the jury in the manner of making a conclusion. I think until that point, she was trying to accept the burden of her conscience. Eventually, she resolves and reveals the truth. After a shot where we see her while she is looking out of the window, at that exact moment I think, she decides to tell the truth. Here, the background is a sea which may represent freedom that is apart from Sepideh with a fencing. I think Sepideh is looking for a way to the freedom out of her own conscience here and she is deciding to get there telling the truth. We see her desperate determinism here. Telling the truth in her understanding is accepting the crime. So, the accused turns out to be guilty.\nOne interesting thing here is that the darkness of the prosecutor and the whiteness of lawyer blurs. Amir, the prosecutor becomes right at blaming Sepideh, while Ahmet turns out to be the accomplice of Sepideh. He was not innocent, either. This is not surprising, though because blurring the characters is a common feature in Farhadi movies.\nAfter the confession, they are relived, I think, because they can make a conclusion. They vote for telling the truth or not hence restoring the democracy. They decide to tell the truth, but what is the truth? The truth is that they did not know Elly was engaged, and only Sepideh and Ahmet knew that, yet they knew the trip was to arrange a marriage between Ahmet and Elly. One thing that is ironic here is that the witness now is the Quran. The testifier is divinized and governmentalized. The jury escaping from governmental justice is now basing its supporting structure to the governmental resources again. They are indeed controversial.\nThe ending is very touching when the plaintiff and the accused meet. Sepideh cannot tell the truth even though voting demanded the truth. We see the collapse in both the plaintiff and the accused for one telling a lie, for the other learning a betrayal. Now, they have to carry on this way. We see a rainy background behind the fianc\u00e9. The window behind Sepideh is minimized now, and it is so small as if it is by force pushed there. And the rest of the group is trying to get the car out of the mud. This image is like the summary of the whole film.",

            "review_title": "No Happy End of an attempted matchmaking",
            "content": "I liked the movie, although it was no easy entertainment. It had no Happy End, but a Tragic End. The story starts very relaxed, showing three young families (including Ahmad, brother of one of the women, who just came from Germany where he divorced) spending a weekend at a seaside cottage at the Caspian sea. The three families have the silly idea to bring together the lonely Ahmed with the baby-sitter Elly, although they know that she is engaged with another man in Teheran. Whereas all the three couples and Ahmed start to make stupid jokes about this plan, laugh about Elly when she is not around and all appear very superficial to me, Elly herself is much more closed. She is a girl with some mysteries, she keeps secrets and does not like the continuous jokes about the attempted matchmaking a lot. She tries to do the job that she was officially hired for: looking after the little kids of the three families. She frequently calls her mom, who is ill, and after one day she decides that it is better to return to Teheran. The three couples don\"t want to let her go, they hide her luggage and her mobile phone. She says that she has to leave and would even walk home. The three couples and Ahmad ignore her and start to play Volleyball and go shopping. Elly helps the kids to fly a kite, but suddenly one of the little boys falls into the water and almost dies. The three man interrupt their game, suddenly get panic and jump into the sea, so finally the boy is rescued. But after some minutes they realize that Elly is missing. And suddenly, the relaxed relationship between the three couples and Ahmed turn into aggression and hate. Everybody accuses the others of being responsible for the disaster.After one day, indeed Ellys dead body is found in the sea: She obviously died while trying to rescue the little boy. The three couples now have to inform some relatives of Elly about the accident, and they can only find Alireza, the man to whom Elly was engaged since three years. They find out his telephone number and ask him to come, claiming that Elly is just ill. When he arrives at the site, finding out that she in fact died, he breaks down. The three couples don\"t want to admit that Elly was only invited to this weekend trip to match her to the divorced Ahmad. They try to make Alireza believe that Elly was hired exclusively as a baby-sitter. So they want to get around the conflict by adding more and more lies on top of each other. You can feel how their only concern is to get away with their responsibility.I think Asghar Farhadi, the movie director, tried to show that this practice of organizing relationships for somebody is bad. It is based on an arrogant belief that relatives know what is good for their son or brother or daughter, and they can easily find a suitable partner. It is obvious that Elly hates this, since she is not sure about her 3 year long engagement with Alireza. But the three stupid couples and Ahmad think, that they have the right to interfere with her emotions. They make impolite jokes about Elly, they lie, and they don't respect her privacy. They are to superficial to see, that Elly is full of doubts about her future, and that she does not want to be pushed into a new relationship. She has thoughts that are not for the public, emotions that she does not want to show around. At the end, this stupid idea of pushing two person together leaves behind two victims: a physical one (Elly, who dies) and a mental one (Alireza, who breaks down emotionally). The bad think is that the three couples continue to lie to Alireza although they see how much he suffers from Ellies death: They tell him that Elly knew from the beginning that the weekend-trip with the three families was intended to bring her together with Ahmad. By insisting on this lie, the three couples so cruel leave the mourning Alireza believe, that his girl-friend Elly was searching for an easy adventure with another man. But Elly, in fact, never agreed with this, she said she only joins the company to look after the kids.",

            "content": "Yet another example of fine writing and exceptional craftsmanship from Asghar Farhadi, whose films I've grown to love. The man often takes the simplest of simple plot-lines and concocts a tale where the ball is set rolling due to the occurrence of certain events. Here too, the case is similar. There is a lot of layering and essential subtext that a viewer would not likely be able to grab hold of, on initial viewing. The film is a thought-provoking account on how lies can at times hold greater might than the truth.The movie deals with a bunch of individuals who are taking a trip to the seaside in northern Iran. Elly (one of the kids' teachers) is however the complete outsider in the group. What I love about Farhadi's films is the way he projects the various character arcs and how he never attempts to spoon-feed the audience. It takes quite a while even for the ardent viewer to understand the behavioral traits of each character and how they relate to each other. The first half an hour is pretty much the typical 'picnic movie' with the usual archetypes. When Elly goes missing under mysterious circumstances, things start to go haywire. Some of the characters (especially Sepideh) come across with startling revelations which the others don't take too lightly to. Another interesting aspect to note is how Farhadi lets his characters behave rationally at any given situation. The viewer never given a chance to go into \"Why the hell did he/she do that?\" mode. Again, the dialogues are so believably written and the performances predominantly natural that the audience is likely to feel the dampness themselves. The roaring sound of the sea acts as a metaphor for the overall fidgety mood. Just as each wave would bring unseen particles to the shore, Sepideh (played magnificently by Golshifteh Farahani) elucidates certain undisclosed information on Elly which doesn't go down well with the rest of the group. Another depiction would be that, regardless of how big a sand-castle you build or how large a writing you make with your hands/feet on the shore, one strong wave alone is enough to undo all your efforts (similar to how the events pan out in the film - lies appearing to be stronger and more believable than actuality!). Farhadi-regulars Shahab Hosseini and Peyman Moaadi also play key roles. Saber Abar delivers a solid performance, as Ali Reza. The less revealed on the plot details, the better the viewing experience.'About Elly' requires multiple viewing, similar to Farhadi's other films. There is indeed a lot of subtlety on display and one needs to keep an open mind in order to comprehend the subtexts. One of the stunning psychological thriller pieces you'll ever lay your eyes on!",

Having viewed \"A Separation\", I was encouraged to see his previous work \"About Elly\" which he made a couple of years earlier. Again he is both writer and director, again it is a domestic drama, but this time there is a larger cast of characters and a more serious turn of events.A group of middle-class Iranian friends travel to the shores of the Caspian Sea on a three-day break. There are three couples and their children, together with a single man looking for a wife and the eponymous and mysterious Elly. There is much subterfuge and lying before we find out what happens to Elly and the impact on those who thought they knew her. It is a rather slow work and I was looking for a more dramatic conclusion, but it is a refreshing change from much thoughtless Hollywood fare.",

Asghar Farhadi's Masterpiece 'A Seperation' is one of my favourite foreign language film from the last decade so i was looking forward to watch his other flicks. That's how Darbareye Elly came into my watchlist while the other reason being High IMDb rating which is Farhadi's 2nd best after 'A Seperation'. The film follows a disappearance of a teacher who was at sea beach to enjoy the weekend with fellow travelers. The group begins searching and then realises several facts about her which was hidden by one woman of them and it creates some issues between them. Farhadi's writing kept me hooked for almost 2 hours, it was simply sensational. A quality piece of writing coming out of simple and real sort of situation unluckily didn't recieve the proper finale. Some of very important questions remained unanswered and the accidental conclusion never makes sense in Realistic proportions to me. If you are showing a realistic family drama and adding thrill in it then make sure you end it on satisfying note where all humanly rose questions are answered and have made a general philosophy as well. Nevertheless, About Elly is a cinematic gem because of powerful storytelling by Farhadi who never lets you guess what would happen next. Many unexpected quarrels take place and you find each and every single one plausible. The mood shuffles from happy to sad to intense and to nervous and this is why Farhadi's direction makes a solid cinematic experience. The entire cast is terrifically involved in the narrative from the scene (which was very common) to the last. Cinematography and Background score makes you feel that we're actually there at the beach with them. Overall, a Very Good Family Drama that should be watched atleast once.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

They aren't in the way the Hollywood films depict them, and this fact eased me. In fact my knowledge of the Iranian people is rather poor, but judging by the habits of the ones depicted in the film( Narguilha smoking, playing Volleyball and mime playing game) they are likely from the middle-class. The actors are unknown but they did very well their job. Also liked the soft green lightning, used in the entire film. This drama/psychological thriller starts slow but surely it has unpredictable 'twists' that may shock the less attempt of the viewers. I thought that it was a realistic portrayal, since that i met people with that exact same behaviors. As i said previously, it's not a Hollywood portrayal, that usually makes the Muslim people looks like terrorists.Overall, a good watch. 7.0/10",

About halfway through the weekend, she disappears. There's reason to believe that she may have left without telling anyone, but there's also reason to believe that she may have drowned. As the remaining folks look for her, and further consequences of her disappearance are revealed, cracks in the relationships are revealed and deepen. As with \"A Separation\", Farhadi takes a genre procedural plot and turns it into a drama about the morality and consequences of our decisions.",

            "content": "Please feel free to skip reading the text that follows this paragraph even though there are no spoilers... This film is best enjoyed immersing yourself in the film and not knowing anything much apart from the title and the director behind it. \nThe audience gets treated to a fine ensemble of brilliant performers that the 21st-century Iranian cinema has to offer. Farahani, Alidoosti, Zare'i, Azadivar, Hosseini, Haghighi, Maadi, Mehranfar, who all gave top-notch performances in what is very much a character study where the audience is presented the complications that arise when someone introduces a stranger to a close-knit peer group and that someone also hides some info about that person that could get them in trouble, and trouble got to them indeed.They all traveled together as a group for a vacation but there is a misunderstanding regarding the accommodations they have booked, the caretakers thinking they were only staying for one day instead of three, and the owner of the lodging set to use it the day after. They then instead had no choice but to take a dilapidated seaside lodging that they have to clean up themselves. Farhadi inserts in this film his commentary regarding the Iranian society's norms that has been unanimously deemed oppressive to women around the world nowadays, regarding traveling restrictions imposed against unmarried couples and the engaged woman seemingly ALMOST a property of her fiance and have to ask permission for everything she does. The audience sees how the characters react once they realised they have trangressed those rules, the gravity attached to such a situation. And these same characters will also display the same regard and urgency to the things people with Western sensibilities believe in. This is why I believe Farhadi belongs to the group of magnificent cinematic greats these days, juxtaposing these cultural elements to evoke empathy from the non-Iranians. Some of the performers in this movie also figured out in Farhadi's other films: Hosseini and Alidoosti in The Salesman, Maadi, Hosseini and Zare'i in A Separation, and I have yet to see Alidoosti in Fireworks Wednesday and The Beautiful City.One heck of a rollercoaster of emotions, this one. I'm a sucker for these kinds of films. Wish Farhadi continues to make more of these kinds of films.This film is, in every way, an antipodic equivalent to Antonioni's L'Avventura.",

This is the third film I have seen from this director, but it is - without a doubt - the worst. I can only imagine the quality of the other contestants at the festivals where he was awarded. Because this film is absurdly disappointing. A group of friends, with husbands, wives and small children, will spend 3 days in a rented house in northern Iran with the aim of - among other things - arranging a relationship between a boy in the group - single - and a girl, friend of one of them. Well, everything goes wrong in the planned house and they end up going to a house falling apart near the sea. There is an incident, where one of the little boys almost drowns and Elly, the intended one, disappears. Everyone searches here and there and apparently she had run away because in fact she was engaged to another boy for 3 years and wanted to get rid of him, as he was very violent. There is a great tension in the air and our expectation was that she had run away. But no, she drowned and died. What a horrible thing. This film is similar to another one, by the same director, \"A Separation\", the worst film we had seen so far. The curious thing is that another film by him, \"The Salesman\", was excellent. What a mystery! What a terrible movie!",

It's always a little bit challenging to watch a movie with subtitles. It takes extra effort, one must sit and watch and read. So, you should get an extra reward, an extra pleasure. Don't worry, you will with Elly. Beyond language is emotion and behavior that is common to all of us, of our species. Make sure when you make plans to watch that you set aside enough time.

In the first part, the 45 min, I didn't think much about the movie. But when the movie had a turning point and the boy, Arash, was about to drown as well as the disappearance of Elley, it really became interesting. I think this movie shows how hard it's to keep on a lie that have killed another person. It's a movie full of emotion and keep you want to watch more of it, at least after the turning point. I think the morale of the movie is to think about your consequences before you do an action. This is shown through Sepideh (Golshifteh Farahani) and her role throughout the movie. Overall, I thought it was a splendid movie with an awesome plot. This movie is a very typical \"not judge the book by it's cover\" movie. So as you also see and maybe can learn of not skip a high-rated movie before you have watched it throughout. But, my main reason for writing this review is to ask a question, maybe a FAQ (frequent asked question), and since it wasn't available to do it on the FAQ panel, I thought the best way was to write a review and maybe someone would take a look at it. Anyway, my question is: Why did Spideh decide to be a matchmaker for Elly and Ahmad? Because Spideh obviously knew that Elly had a fiance, Alireza. It's true that she did't wasn't in good terms with her fiance, but that doesn't mean she didn't like him anymore. Because if I have understood it correctly, the call she had in the car was with her fiance, not with her mother, as she told Ahmad. If she could casually talk to him, why being a douche and try to spearate them. Why did she try so hard, by hiding her bag and phone and by lying in the end to Alireza about her wanting to find a new man (which was understandable to her cause she would end up in prison and would be terrible for her family), to end their relationship after they had been together for 3 years. It just doesn't make sense to me. What was her good intention for doing so? Because all I saw was her regret for doing it and it just doesn't make sense. Because obviously it wasn't good for Elly too, so why invite her to someplace she doesn't want to be at? If anyone have an excellent answer to my question, I would really appreciate it. And lastly, thanks for reading my review. ^_^",

Honestly, I kept the movie as a kind of a reward for myself knowing pretty well that this is simply a masterpiece.I would not like to repeat the numerous superlative reviews of the movie. The plot is just amazing, the suspense/ mystery is magnificent, the dialogues are extremely well constructed with the right timing and weighting of the words, the cinematography is remarkable... Probably there are 2 moments of slightly exaggerated camera shivers to pass over the stress intensity (the drowning incident and the moment the fiancee acknowledged the truth) but this is more than forgivable.In addition, I can say that I don't remember to have watched a movie with such a cast of actresses - not only the beauty and charm but a wonderful presence in the roles. Merila Zare'i as Shohreh resembles - I would not like to do a blasphemy - the Christian's Saint Marie.I would like just to share what I think is the core message of this great movie. The focus is without a doubt in the women's right of a free choice of a partner, the right of a divorce or separation.However, the biggest question for me is the following: is the call, the thrill to fly free as a kite allowed when we are bound - again as a kite - in a relation with another person?The movie presents in a more than wonderful way the cultural contradiction between the oriental/ Middle Eastern/ Asian/ old custom concept of belonging, loyalty, \"a partner for the whole life\", \"learning to love/ the art of loving\" (reference to Erich Fromm) and the Western liberal gender equality, the sexual revolution of the 1960-ies, polygamy, frequent separations/ divorces, etc.Making the spectators think and raising burning questions - who can do this better than Mr. Asghar Farhadi?And yes, the right questions seem to come without an end. What a drive for freedom can bring to us when we are in a relationship? Would it be suffering and death? Wouldn't it be much healthier and better for everyone, if we simply remain humble, accept the reality and devote to the partner? At what price can we remain loyal? When and why the love disappears? Should't we impose on ourselves to love our partner? Can we afford ourselves to stop loving? Can we build skills, can we learn to love? Does a relationship create a feeling of being a property or it is just a loyalty and faithfulness?At the movie's open end - a Farhadi's specialty - the fianc\u00e9e seems to tend to preserve the dignity of Elly taking the responsibility to inform her family about the tragic incident himself. Love will probably prevail over the attempt of freedom?The movie clearly shows that liberal attitude and behaviour in a relationship can bring misery, therefore, can we really allow ourselves not to love?",

(2) and what will happen when they get there?3) Colour theme: we can touch this in (About elly) by the change of the colour, the characters clothes and even the weather getting rainy and dark, and all those collected together to build up a really sad atmosphere.3) Soundtrack: he's not using soundtrack when it comes dark, this will translate to the audience that this is not acting, this is true, hearing cough, scratch, and walking sound get you in the middle of the event.",
