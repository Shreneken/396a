            "content": "S. Darko is one of many sequels that has no reason to have been created at all. But even if one puts the original film out-of-mind, and only look at the sequel on it's own merits, the movie still falls completely flat.The film picks up 7 years after the original left off, Samantha Darko and her friend Corey are on a cross-country trip heading for Los Angeles. When car problems leave them stuck in a little town by the name of Conejo Springs (which is populated by a community of horribly written character's), the girls are forced to mingle with the townies, and Corey finds herself at home with the boozy losers, while Samantha, still in pain over the death of her brother (Donnie), finds herself drawn to the Outsider by the name of Iraq Jack, a disturbed Gulf War vet who has learned through bizarre visions that the world is coming to an end on July 4th, 1995.It seems that Nathan Atkins is a fan of Richard Kelly's work (including Southland Tales because the character of Iraq Jack seems similar to the character 'Pilot Abilene' & the end of the world date being on 'July 4th') But Atkins can't write believable dialogue to save his life. And the director 'Chris Fisher' doesn't seem to understand what made the original film so good, which was the feeling of being able to connect with the characters going through something this crazy. And if the audience doesn't care about the characters on-screen it becomes very hard for them to feel any effect of the narrative structure.S. Darko is a hollow cash-grab by producers who must have never understood what Kelly was going for, but they now control the rights to the Darko universe, and they're hoping to collect any profit from this wannabe Donnie Darko replica.",

            "content": "As soon as I had heard about this hybrid sequel (and it is a sequel), I immediately thought that they had gone and done it again, I thought they just couldn't help themselves, I thought that it was just another money spinner and it was produced to simply draw in the gradual pulse of Donnie Darko fans.After watching it though, it really didn't disappoint, my initial gut instinct was right. This film follows in the footsteps of other previous solo films that they just couldn't leave alone.This film has so many Donnie Darko clich\u00e9's, it's unbelievable, the visual effects (which I could have done myself), the stylised music of the time, the time lapse scenes (which are OVERUSED), the times caped school scene (with Tears for Fears)... Everything... Everything that made Donnie Darko the artistic and visually spectacular film it was, has been transposed to this and it has been transposed, woefully.They have even cast a couple of Jake Gyllenhaal lookalikes for some of the parts, and there is NO way this is an accident, because they act so badly, they must have been cast on their uncannily resemblance to J.G.It's a bit like when Dennis Leary, Ripped off Bill Hicks, it's rather sad seeing someone else trying to imitate someone else's joke, you still laugh at it for a minute, but afterwards, you just want your money back.This film is a bit poo, I can't even comment on its \"plot\", because, you can see \"the plot\", has been moulded around the model of Donnie Darko, you can see that the plot was the last thing they thought about, which funnily enough, in a Donnie Darko fashion, was probably the first thing though about in Donnie Darko.I don't know though, for some strange reason, this feels more like a bad re-make, than a sequel, and people probably will say something like \"You have watch this movie, independently, don't think that it's a sequel to Donnie Darko, try to see it for what it is.\", okay, that would be a fair thing to say. But as soon as you release a movie, with one of the same actors from the original, with the same title as the original (nearly), with the same freaking emblem as the original, pfft... well... You can't cook a cookie from a recipe and say it's your own.Now, let's get to the acting. The acting is awful, there really doesn't seem to be any interACTION, between the actors, it just feels as though they are saying the lines to each other, it really does, there doesn't feel like there is any co-character development, there doesn't seem to be any rapport at all, and more importantly, there doesn't seem to a distinguishable emotion, throughout the movie, honestly, watch it... The best actor throughout, is one of the actors who hardly has a scene John Hawkes, from, From Dusk Till Dawn and Identity.There are also 2 shady looking characters in the film, who don Men in Black attire. They look like two bloody elephants in a fridge, they really do, they look SO out of place and so uneasy on the camera, that they were probably just picked from the town that they filmed in, either that or they are two tecchies from the production team.As I've said before, the production looks shoddy, it really does, the effects from Donnie Darko, looked much better and that was.. what? 8 years ago? And 8 years, is a long time in technological terms. Even in one scene (this is supposed to be set in 1995), you can see post 95 produced Cars in the background, and an up to date Budweiser sign.(I wish I could do the time travel thing and go back in time and NOT watch this film.)All-in-All, this film is bad, I suppose my advice could be to watch it with an open mind, but I would be misadvising you, this film is obviously aimed at making a few quid from Donnie Darko fans and with that in mind, I just can't get past the audacity of the reason for this film. It is a much asked question of films, especially sequels, but I am going to ask it anyway.Why?I have given this film a 4/10, and that is primarily because I think that the lead is hot, she walks around a hot state, with practically nothing on most of the time and the fact that she looks like Jessica Biel, that is how skin deep I feel, after watching this film, which is no doubt, how the producers thought throughout the process of making this film.If you are thinking of buying this on DVD for a present for someone you know who is a Donnie Darko fan, then don't, A. It will disappoint them and B. It will only spur on, more crap like this.And as for one KILLER line in the movie...\"Like... Drugs and Anus Sex!\" Best line in the whole movie.",

            "content": "What? Oh S Darko? I thought you said Donnie Darko. Oh...well that changes things. Um... Let me take all of that back then.OK on a serious note there are a lot of posts on here that will say that they A.) Were huge fans of Donnie Darko B.) Thought the girls were hot and scantily clad C.) Thought the effects were not so special d.) Thought this was kind of rehashed I agree with all of these statements. I also tried looking at it like it wasn't involved with the first movie at all and you end up with a no so brilliant, watered down less than mediocre movie. The problem is this is a Donnie Darko movie. You have fans who have watched the original over and over, read countless summaries of not only the movie but the \"mechanics\" of how that universe worked and then came to your own conclusions. You have fans that (myself included) donned (no pun intended) the skeleton costume and grey hoodie for Halloween. When you try to add to a cult phenomenon like Donnie Darko, unless you do your homework, you are going to fall flat.To me this movie felt like someone watched Donnie a few times, wrote down some key elements from the movie in a notebook and then tried to incorporate it into a new movie.As a huge fan of the original I can't find myself \"hating it\" in the same way that I can't hate the Star Wars prequels, so I gave it a 3 out of 10. I don't want to betray it even though it betrays the original and its fans. It was by no means one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but it is a let down of a sequel. I also gave it a 3 because I understand what this movie was trying to do (involving others in the timeline plot to change destinies) but I don't think it was done well. You still have some of the mechanics involved in the first, although altered. Even the characters are somewhat the same (the sexual deviant priest vs the sexual deviant motivational speaker, etc)Even some of the lines used are to try to get a reaction from original fans. It just comes off as a bad rip off.When you were done watching the original, you felt as though you wanted to watch it again and learn more. You felt a sense of witnessing something special.",

            "content": "S Darko. Yeah they really made it. If you liked Donnie Darko, you will hate this. If you never saw Donnie Darko, you will have absolutely no clue in hell whats going on in this movie because the filmmakers don't explain anything and assume everyone knows Donnie Darko like the back of their hand. And even if you know every last detail of the first film, understand tangent universes and own a copy of Roberta Sparrow's time travel book, you will be totally confused as well.Samantha Darko and her friend are driving, somewhere and they wind up in this town with all these really unconvincing people. It's funny that some parts of this movie tried to be scary, but the most unnerving thing of all is the MISCASTING. Iraq Jack is supposed to be this crazy Iraq war veteran, but he looks like he just skipped class in highschool and wandered onto the set. There's this nerdy guy who tries to hit on Sam, except he looks way too pretty to be a nerd. Everyone in this movie is PRETTY. And all the guys have long hair and look really phony. Even the costumes look like they were picked up at Goodwill. Daveign Chase herself wears nothing but her underwear for pretty much the entire movie. Not that I'm complaining though.Did I mention there is a TON of secondary characters, all of whom do nothing but tell Sam she has a destiny and that God is watching and blah blah blah. It's supposed to sound deep and meaningful, and some of it is well written but it never amounts to anything. All of the actors are pretty terrible, but Daveigh Chase herself is really bad. She looks good in front of the camera, but mumbles her way through her lines at several points. Ed Westwick should get an award for never moving his face during this entire movie. I'm serious, I don't think he blinked. Elizabeth Berkely shows up as a devout Christian housewife, with some completely idiotic dialog. She also looks totally haggard every time she's on screen.The mystique of Donnie Darko has been totally lost here. The story of the original was supposed to be left open to interpretation at the end, and this is a really bad interpretation of that story. Somehow since Sam dies in one flow of time during this movie, she can become a manipulated dead... while she's SLEEPING? She goes around as this pale ghost self and changes some things. She makes someone burn down a church for no real reason other than to mirror the first film. And apparently she 'doesn't dream' according to the words that open the movie. She can create unicorns running in the clouds with her mind though. And somehow characters in this movie can simply go back in time at will, and something about a glowing blue feather. Doesn't this totally go against what happened in the first movie? Donnie Darko didn't have 'powers'. They tried to explain everything that was ambiguous in DD, and by doing so they confound all continuity with the original while leaving nothing to the imagination, simplifying the themes and creating nothing original of their own.The plot of this movie is basically just ripped from the first movie. Iraq Jack has to get crushed by the meteor in order to close the time loop, pretty much the same as Donnie. This is about the only thing that really makes sense. Both the female leads wind up dead at points in the movie, but there's no emotional weight to this at all because we KNOW they will come back to life. The nerdy guy appears to have a flesh-eating disease that is never explained. Then his face turns all black and weird like a demon. Did I mention Iraq Jack is Roberta Sparrow's grandson? What's the point of this and why does he create a Frank mask? Who locked the two kids in the cave? All in all, a very sloppy film with almost no redeeming values. A lot of it probably looked good on paper, and there are some promising scenes, but the execution is just lazy. Daveigh Chase in her underwear almost makes it worth watching. Almost.",

            "content": "I just had one thought running through my head while watching this . . .WTF? Seriously, that was pretty much the only thought running through my head as I watched this movie. Every time something happened, I thought, WTF does that have to do with anything? And I don't mean that the movie is mysterious, I mean there's a lot that just doesn't make any sense.Okay, Donnie Darko is my favorite movie of all time. Even after watching Donnie Darko the first time I didn't quite understand everything that happened in it, I was wondering why certain things happened and how some things affected other events. So the first time I watched Donnie Darko I was also wondering: WTF? But even with that I still understood the idea that Donnie went through this whole movie so that in the end he would sacrifice himself for the sake of the world. (It also made me obsessed with Mad World).Having said that I don't understand what the whole point S Darko really was. In S. Darko, (Here comes the spoilers, but trust me it may be better to read about it than to actually waste your time watching it) the whole thing starts when a dead version of Samantha appears before a man who goes by \"Iraq Jack\" and tells him that the world is going to end. (Another messed up thing about Iraq Jack? He's the grandson to Roberta Sparrow, what bearing that has to do with anything? I have no clue).Anyways, Iraq Jack gets obsessed with the dead version of Samantha (and even more messed up is that Samantha apparently turns into her dead self at night when she sees a glowing feather . . .WTF?) So this dead version of Samantha tells him that the world is going to end, and he goes about making a mask that is supposed to replicate the look of Frank the Rabbit from the first movie, apparently she shows him a drawing that Donnie did of Frank the Rabbit and he creates a mask that looks like the drawing.Now . . .There's a problem with that. Okay, Donnie first meets Frank the Rabbit on the night when the Tangent Universe opens when Frank calls him outside to avoid being killed by the jet engine. When he goes back into time to save the world, he goes back to exactly the same night that he was called outside and therefore the tangent universe never opens. So, unless he decided to randomly draw Frank the Rabbit while waiting for the engine to crush him (Oh, and storing it somewhere in his room where it won't get ruined by the said jet engine), that drawing shouldn't exist. (Except, of course, the sketches that Frank had, but I doubt that he knew Samantha well enough to give her a copy).So anyways, he creates the mask that invariably kills Samantha later on (which actually Samantha dies twice in this movie, but I won't get into that too much, because the first time is actually quite pointless). So now, the world is coming to an end, Samantha is dead, and the dead version of her springs Iraq Jack from jail so that he could go back into time and die by the meteorite.Okay, so they're pretty much replacing Donnie with Iraq Jack (who happens to be Roberta Sparrows grandson, but really, who cares?). Here's the problem with that, Donnie was a pretty messed up kid, but the experiences he goes through in the movie moves the audience to feel for him when he does actually die. This doesn't work for Iraq Jack, because quite frankly no one cares about him. Seriously, the only shots you see of him are him rambling like a lunatic, or him digging through trash, or other random shots of him talking to the dead Samantha.No one cares for him, the audience doesn't care about him, so when he does die (smiling and waving at the meteorite like an idiot) it doesn't have any effect on the audience. It's like watching someone step on an insect, no one cares.That's just the main plot, but then you have some other stuff in the movie that's just completely inane. Like, for instance, this random rash that (I don't even remember what the name of the character was, seriously he was that unimportant) some dude got from the meteorite, that apparently ate away at his skin and also made him super aggressive. WTF? Here's another thing that didn't quite make sense. Samantha has the Philosophy of Time Travel book. . .Why? For those that don't know or maybe for some reason or another might have forgotten, Donnie receives the book from Dr. Monnitoff, his science teacher, when he starts asking him about time travel. His inquiries are all brought on by the fact that Frank the Rabbit talked to him about time travel, so if Donnie went back in time to the point where the tangent universe opened and died, he never received the book. So that means that Dr. Monnitoff should still have it (or if you go to the Donnie Darko website you find out that it was actually given to the Library of Congress Rare Books Division after Dr. Monnitoff died in a car accident.) These are just some of the things that I've noticed, but right now I don't think I could continue to rant about this movie. I think instead I'm going to find Nathan Atkins (the guy that wrote the screenplay for S Darko) and I'm going to get a refund for what I believe 2 hours of my life wasted on his piece of crap movie is worth.Don't waste your time.",

There is also the \"Mystery of the Missing Boys\" to be solved (spoiler: it's not) and a gaggle of weird characters to meet; the drunk teen who is brother to one of the missing boys, the nerd who is infected by a meteorite, the aforementioned crazy vet, the creepy motel manger, the priest with a shady past and his freaky girlfriend. The movie rewinds the time line twice so that we can see things happen differently, with no real logical effect or reason, and the second time is just a big f*ck you to the viewer who has just wasted 100 minutes of their lives watching this piece of crap.

It really seems like the writer and director got hired for the job, watched about half of the first film before they got bored, and then set off to make something roughly similar. Awful dialogue, careless (and painfully obvious) anachronisms, and some jaw-droppingly bad CG effects. I'd be willing to bet they had more money to make this than Richard Kelly had to work with on the original, and none of it's up on the screen. Maybe it cost them a lot of money to license \"Hobo Humpin' Slobo Babe\" by Whale.*cough* Anyway, as far as cash-grab sequels go this has to be one of the all-time worst. A suggestion: tape an episode of \"One Tree Hill\" or \"Gossip Girl,\" then put on some red-and-blue 3D glasses, and pretend one of the cast members is saying stuff like \"Remember the future\" and \"My farts taste like cherries.\" Then watch the show on rewind for about twenty minutes and do it all over again.

So is this film bad enough to be #88 on the list? No...while it IS a terrible film in many ways, there are definitely many worse films that this one...not exactly a glowing endorsement.The biggest problem about the film are the two female leads. Both play characters who are annoying jerks....and any film with annoying jerks in the lead faces an uphill battle. In addition, the acting of many (including one of the male leads) is terrible. They or the director seem to think that talking monotone and emoting very little is the epitome of cool. Instead, I just found the acting (like the characters) to be super-annoying.As far as the plot goes, there are a lot of weird dream-like warnings about some pending apocalypse in a rural town in the American West (it was filmed in Utah). The special effects were very interesting...but the story was confusing and silly.Overall, a film that I didn't like at all but TECHNICALLY it isn't completely terrible.",

I couldn't bring myself to believe that there were people stupid enough to make a sequel to a movie like Donnie Darko, when there was no indication at the end of the film that a sequel could even be made.If you've seen and enjoyed the first movie, you'll know how unique and one-of-a-kind it is. The sequel, however, is a pile of messy, incoherent trash that obviously and thankfully was not worth sending to theaters, despite the fact it's a continuation of a cult-classic, cult-following film.The \"story\" follows Samantha, the least developed character of the first film, played by the same actress. And let's just say, her acting as a nine-yea-old was better than her performance here. She's on a road trip with her trendy Maggie Gyllenhaal look-alike friend, when their car breaks down and are saved by a hip, cool-as-ice boy played by Ed Westwick, whose most notable role prior to this movie was Alex, from Children of Men. His character, Randy, likes to act cool, meaning he has no interesting qualities other than his adequate good looks. He brings the two girls to a motel in his sleepy home town where a meteorite strikes a windmill, and another Gyllenhaal look-alike predicts the end of the world. What ensues is crappy writing, drama, sub plots, and characters, all which add their own flare to this piece-of-junk movie.The only redeeming quality about this movie is how they got a little bit creative with the main character, making her not the living receiver, but the manipulated dead. But that's it! There's NOTHING interesting about this movie, and it's nothing but a rip-off of the first one, creating nothing original, but creating quite a bit of similarities. A sequel is supposed to be it's own movie, as well as a continuation, but S. Darko failed at that. Plus, it was an unnecessary sequel, sent straight to DVD where it belongs.All-in-all, I don't recommend this movie. It's boring, poorly-paced, and just a terrible piece of work.

The only other interesting elements, whether technical in filming style or plot-wise of this film, were ripped straight from the first film. What was cool in Donnie Darko is merely imitation here.The plot is weak and has logic holes which fail the Donnie Darko/tangent universe test from the first film. As fans of the original we cannot help but compare the two films because s.Darko centres on characters and memories from the first one and rotates on the principles that drove the original as well. How can you not compare the two? What almost borders on insulting in this film are the straight repetitions of acts, scenes and quirky characters from the first one replicated in this one. I don't want to spoil the film if you are drawn to sit and endure it but you'll see what I mean, you cannot miss the weak, formulaic repetition, especially if you are a fan of the original.Basically, s.Darko is the same model car like Donnie Darko but has different paint colour and chokes along on a four-cylinder engine whereas the first one rumbled along on six.",

            "content": "First off, I want to say I love the original Donnie Darko. The plot of creator Richard Kelly's Donnie Darko was confusing (leaving doors open and making the audience thinking for days after viewing), the acting and characters were colorful, the dialogue was crisp and unique--all which paid off and made it great film. Casting was great, though early in his career he appeared as Billy Crystal's character's son in City Slickers, I don't remember seeing Jake Gyllenhaal in a movie as an adult until Donnie Darko (nothing memorable anyhow.) The overall tone of the movie worked wonderfully. And a healthy Patrick Swayze in a triumphant, yet disturbing return\u2014great stuff. s. Darko's answer to a comeback is Elizabeth Berkley (aka Jessie Spano) with a not so much a victorious return to the screen in perhaps her worst movie (and she starred in Showgirls.) Once I got over viewing the movie, I watched the making of s. Darko special feature. First off, Chris Fisher states that he hasn't even seen the final cut of the movie. How does that happen? I think it says a lot when the director doesn't even watch his huge mistake. The funny thing is that most people involved in this movie seemed to know and are willing to admit they were making a tragic mistake getting on board for this what people kept referring to as a \"continuation\" to avoid the Hollywood cussword, \"sequel.\" One of the co-producers, Jennifer Connelly (not the actress), even comments about her hesitancy to become involved and mentions how \"sacred things should not be toyed with by unfamiliar hands.\" She should have stuck by that statement and steered clear. Perhaps if Richard Kelly was involved, instead of allowing others to play in the universe he created, the movie may have had some redeeming qualities, but obviously he knew it was a bad idea or he would have been there. If you want to watch a bunch of Hollywood professionals squirm, watch this special feature, it's much more entertaining than the film itself. To sum up the ridiculousness of the plot of this movie, actor, John Hawkes, makes a funny comment about asking him what s. Darko is about. His answer, \"it's about an hour and forty-five minutes or something like that and, and I know it's in color.\" In s. Darko, the screenwriter, Nathan Atkins (who implied in the making of special feature that he was hesitant to write this because he is a huge fan of the original and seems somewhat ashamed by the outcome. He even asked himself when the idea was brought to him, Why do this? I guess the answer is money.) In his \"chapter of the saga,\" (hopefully the final chapter) Nate uses many of the cool elements of the original, the infamous creepy rabbit head being, the stream of CGI liquid that leads the characters (their destiny spirit), and the concept that water and metal are essential to time travel, but it's all done awful, and he too often tries to explain things that were left to the imagination of the viewer by Kelly to no prevail which I feel is a big no, no and a kick to the Dick. If Kelly watched this movie and ran into Nathan Atkins on the street, he would deserve an apology. I don't like to hold the writing completely accountable, because I know there are so many elements to making a film work and a lot of the time the story looks great on paper, but when it's made something goes terribly wrong. Here it's the overall story for me. Set in the mid-1990's (in order to correlate with the original film or O.F.), Sam (Donnie's younger sister that shook a leg at the dance recital of the O.F.) and her friend, Corey, are driving to Hollywood when their car breaks down and they are stranded in a small hick town--a plot point that's had to be in at least a million movies by now. Sam has hallucinations that warn her that the end of existence is near. Some weird guy from Desert Storm is rummaging through dumpsters and just plain old being weird. Another dorky dude's got strange sores going on. All the characters speak in clich\u00e9s and over explain plot points. I'm not explaining anymore of the ridiculous, uninspired plot.Using the idea of time travel from the O.F., s. Darko fails to come up with anything innovative. The characters are blah. The town is tired. The dialogue is laughable for bad reasons. The wannabe trippy effects are not worthy of a video game. ZZZZZZZZ. Then I woke up and started it from the point I remembered last seeing and nothing changed--just another bad sequel to a movie that should have been left alone. In real life and in any movie, people should never wake up and start all over again (except in Groundhog Day.)That is bad storytelling and a cop out which the original had done tactfully without dumbing things down. I was really hoping to have at least something good to say by the end of this disaster, but now all I hope is that True Romance, Dark City and Fight Club never spawn a sequel. Though my review for this film is bad, I admire anyone who creates a movie, Chris Fisher, Nathan Atkins, the cast. Keep making movies. That's why I give anything a chance. So why get so fired up about a movie that sucks? A. Because without bad movies there can't be good ones and without comparison there is nothing learned. After watching the making of featurette, I think everyone involved in this mess will turn down working on a \"continuation\" or sequel of another film they love; then again, money talks. I bet they all feel dirty now. Some great stories don't need to become sagas and should just R.I.P. unlike poor unfortunate Donnie.",

It absolutely completed the story and left the viewer to ponder the meaning and philosophical implications of the work quietly to themselves. There was no antagonist to be reviled from the dead to fight again and no antagonist, having saved the world once to be brought out of a failed marriage and rehab somewhere to save the world again. I do not mind watching movie series even movies such as Saw or Rocky. But Donnie Darko is not the type of movie that could possibly lend itself well to a series and it doe not deserve to be put in a category with those types of movies and the attempt to do so is a complete failure.",

This one is all over the place but just doesn't seem consistent. It's like the writers wrote down a bunch of scenarios and just decided to mash them all together in a incoherent and in a manner that is not very clever. I think they first tried to get Maggie Gyllenhaal who played Elizabeth Darko to play a part in this movie. But I guess she smartly declined. And now this revolves around Samantha Darko who is Donnie's youngest sister and it takes 7yrs after what happened in the first \"Donnie Darko\" film. It started out like it might be a watchable flick but as the movie started to progress it got worse and worse. And my gosh the special effects are just freaking awful, even for a straight to DVD movie. Movies like this goes to show that if you don't have a creative or good idea for a sequel, don't go for it!

It is just a shame that they did not put any thought into the script, the characters, the casting, the effects......all they did was rehash the best of Donnie Darko - BADLY!!!!! The scroll at the beginning sets it up when it mentions about the jet engine being untraceable, from the first movie....HALLO!!!!!! That matter took place in the Tangent Universe....the investigation in the Now Universe was never portrayed on screen!!!! Why has Samantha got the Time Travel book? Why does Samantha die - twice?? Why are the cast so two-dimensional that we don't really care about them or their actions?Why would Roberta Sparrows grandson be involved?There are numerous references to the first film - rehashed as I mentioned - basically word for word dialogue that seems so contrite as to not make sense, even in the context of this shabby movie. The effects are not up to scratch - what exactly are the meteorites for? How come the water spears are acting independently of their hosts, when they should be tracking the hosts path into the near future (as in Donnie Darko)? Why would there be a water barrier between Iraq Jack and Samantha atop the water tower? (Is she a Manipulated Dead at this point? Probably - but then she comes back to life!)Maybe in time and with several viewings under my belt I will come to appreciate this film more - I rate it at a two from ten film, purely for the audacity of the makers thinking they could match the original!

In fairness, though, there may be some things that make S Darko a little less incoherent. The basic universe of S Darko could be the tangent universe of Donnie Darko. The universe problem in the first film is not that the tangent universe cannot and must not exist, but that any universe cannot be contaminated by a tangent universe. My interpretation may be completely wrong, but the tangent universe plane engine in Donnie represents the contamination that must be corrected. Otherwise, why did Frank wake Donnie? If the ongoing reality in S Darko is that Donnie was killed by a still unidentified engine, then S Darko is an exploration of that tangent universe that Donnie saved us from. In DD, it has to be that the engine that killed Donnie is from the real universe, and from the plane that WOULD HAVE been carrying Sam and her mother had they gone to the competition. Donnie accepted death because that is how our universe should have unfolded. Maybe the rest of Sparkle Motion died, or maybe none of them went. Unfortunately, this probably suggests that in the tangent universe, Sam and her mother are both dead.That said, the S Darko filmmakers were too intent on maintaining the rules and structure of DD in this film, and rather than an homage they made a very unconvincing re-make. They painted themselves into a corner. Exploring Donnie's tangent universe would be OK to do, but it should have opened up new levels of reality rather than to cram us into the old ones.",

            "content": "First of all, I saw this movie being advertised and thought I'd like to watch it, especially as I'd always intended to watch Donnie Darko, but never got round to it. So this was my impetus. I watched Donnie Darko one night, then the next night watched S. Darko, so I had a head full of Darko knowledge when I watched the sequel. This actually made the movie worse as the crap aspects of the movie making were magnified by the fact that sequel to the franchise actually decided to disregard many important standards set by the original. Let me explain.1) In Donnie Darko, Donnie should have died, but he doesn't, and as such, everything he did from that point on, everyone he came into contact with was affected by his survival. In S. Darko it's some war veteran who survives..........who YOU DON'T SEE FOR 90% OF THE MOVIE. Ergo, he doesn't have any effect on people, so why should snapping back time to when he should die have any effect?***SPOILER ALERT****2) In Donnie Darko, Frank, who dies as a result of Donnie's survival, visits Donnie, coercing him to do stuff, which ultimately leads him to 'the end of the world.' It's Samantha who does this, and yes she dies as a result of the veteran (his mask), but its also because of the weird rash nerd guy, and also please explain to me why she is allowed to die twice!***SPOILER ALERT***3) More people in this one are aware of the time tunnels and portals. I'm referring to Corey here. No pretext or explaining reason for this. And so she can change the past then.........apparently.There are other incidents which I don't have time or room to go into here, but believe me, you will be confused and cursing at a screen which proclaims to follow a movie when they break all the preset 'rules' set by that film. Its OK to bend them a bit in a franchise, or add a twist. But don't break them without warning or reasoning.Finally, the awfulness that is the movie making. I shall give only one example, and the others you can discuss and cringe at for yourselves. The OVERWHELMING use of the 'lightening + person appears' trick. First couple of times you jump....fair enough. When you get to occurrence number 15 and 20, you feel you can almost predict when it will happen, and could click your fingers to cue her movements.I would say enjoy, but I don't think that's possible.

OK, I never stop to write reviews about anything, but that movie was just plain bad / wrong, whether you're a fan of the original Donnie Darko or not. I read a few comments beforehand (given the 4.0/10 rating) and thought to myself \"Well, people are always very critical. It's never as bad as they say / write.\" Well, I was wrong. Daveigh Chase has amazing eyes; that's the ONLY good think about this movie. Therefore, it is my role as a human being to warn you.I thought this movie was going to talk about the original story seen through the eyes of Samantha (I never read the summary)... but NO! It's much worse: seven years after Donnie's death, Samantha falls victim of HER OWN \"Time travel\" experience. Oh, I get it: the first movie seemed so likely to happen in real life, they figured \"Well, why not just have the EXACT same thing happen to two individuals from the same family? That's got to even out the odds!\" They try to mimic EVERYTHING from the first movie, but SLIGHTLY (and I insist) differently. Elements from the first movie reappear for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. They could have AT LEAST given the poor girl her own story... I mean, after all she's been through! Oh, did I say story? There IS NO STORYLINE!!! It's not even obvious who's supposed to play which role in the movie. Manipulated living? Manipulated dead? FORGET IT! Don't even try to guess: I think they just switch randomly!*** SPOILER ALERT PAST THIS POINT *** : I think they were aware that the \"story\" was bad and they just decided to shove three \"stories\" into one.OK... and the final straw. Remember Roberta from the first movie? It's the old woman who always checks her mailbox and wrote the book about \"The philosophy of time travel\". Well, believe it or not, Samantha ends up in this small secluded village (where the entire movie takes place) and Roberta's grandson actually lives RIGHT THERE... in that small secluded village! That's awesome, isn't it?! Yeah, and he even has a MAJOR role in the outcome of the events and has been chosen to resemble somewhat Donnie. How unlikely is that?

            "content": "The original is a cult-favourite that has really grown a fan base, and the independent straight-to-DVD small-scale follow-up \"S. Darko\" feels more like homage to it than a straight-forward sequel. Although it's not without its problems, but I didn't find it as terrible as it's labelled to be. Still it's disappointing. Where as I found the \"Donnie Darko\" to feel fresh, snappy and intriguing\u0085 \"S. Darko\" was glum, ponderous and overcooked. It's much darker, but in that case it lost the personality that shined through \"Donnie Darko\" that made it easier to connect with the characters in mundane suburbia. That's not saying \"S. Darko\" is all bad, as I found the performances acceptable (even though no one really stood out) and the soundtrack / music score builds up that airy, melodic emotional attachment that also favoured the original film. It's stylishly done by director Chris Fisher with dynamic camera-work, which captured the beautiful Utah locations and the fashionable use of sped-up visuals gives that feeling that time does move fast despite not feeling it. It's visually appealing (namely the unconscious sequences), but during stages the mellow tailoring can leave the pacing to meander.The story continues seven years later with Donnie's younger sister Samantha on the road, trying to leave behind her past but it comes back to haunt her as car trouble causes her and her friend Corey (a spunky Briana Evigan) to be stranded in a small, quiet desert town. There she becomes entangled with the local inhabitants, in which through certain circumstances cause a chain of events that leads to the countdown to the end of the world.The past repeats --- the apocalyptic visions are back. Writer Nathan Atkins spins up some new angles, but also conjures up numerous links between certain story arches --- adding onto or evolving what we learnt from the original but never too much to take away from its mythological and open nature. It's just as knotty, but some sub-plots being a little too convoluted or thinly explained (like the missing children angle). There's even an unpredictable POV change in the story's structure which is jarring, but fits well due to the possibilities and ideologies created from this world of wormholes and time-travel cemented in teenage angst. The communication between the manipulative dead and living receiver is starkly done, but at times quite flat --- even the creepy bunny mask makes an appearance, but it just isn't the same. Daveigh Chase is rather good in the lead as she harbours such a solemn presence for her character Samantha. Someone longing to break away from the past, but she finds it catching up. However while she might be the main protagonist, be it sleepwalking while having trouble figuring out what's real and what's not, she remains clueless (\"wake up\") to the disruptive flow affecting the universe, as for other characters (like her friend Corey, town lad Randy and especially Iraq Jack) paths are chosen. These people seem to control their own destiny with their choices of making things right (mainly sacrifice) going on to affect Sam, as they see hope in her. Everything must happen for a reason, in what seems like larger forces at work.This all might read interesting on paper, but the execution isn't that compelling as it could have been. Some instances are simply rehashed (repetitive dialogues and actions) and the small town dramatics caught under a magnifying glass never truly engages in its crazy, unusual situation. You seem to be waiting for things to happen, then in natural progression. The lesser characters feel quite hollow and trivial to the actual scheme of things. The neurotic special effects are clunky, but still have that novel touch about them towards their use in the surreal story-telling. The young cast feature the likes of Ed Westwick, James Lafferty, Jackson Rathbone and also appearing is Elizabeth Berkley, Mathew Davis and an enjoyable John Hawkes.Tries hard, but I guess like someone stated \"Death comes to us all\".",

Darko takes place seven years after the event of Donnie Darko. The film starts with Samantha Darko (Donnie's sister who was ten in Donnie Darko) and her friend Corey on a road trip to Los Angeles but their car breaks down just outside of a small town called Conejo Springs, Randy, the local dark and moody kid, gives the pair a ride to the mechanic. Corey becomes immersed in the town's party scene with Randy. From there the movie just tries to recreate the mood of Donnie Darko and dramatically fails. They even parallel some the memorable lines from the first one \"Why are you looking at me funny?\" \"Why do you look so funny?\" It is clear director Chris Fisher saw the original film well enough to make a copy but didn't follow the depth or meaning behind any of the original movie.The acting was definitely sub par, it seems the casting crew went for beauty instead of talent which is not what Donnie Darko was ever about. Surprisingly the special effects were pretty standard, nothing to ridiculous but nothing to write home about either. This movie followed the typical teen movie guideline, hot chicks, crazy stuff and action.S. Darko will fall short of Donnie Darko fans expectations.

It's weird, twisted and totally surreal science fiction about time travel and a revolting bunnysuit-clad man who warns a teenager in the eighties that the world is about to come to an end in a few days time. Yeah, I never said it was an easy watch and, if you're a fan of David Lynch's films, this should be for you.However... and it's a BIG however, it's 'sequel' (in name only) just doesn't deliver. Its biggest problem is that it doesn't add anything new. In fact, you could almost consider it a 'remake.' It's story follows the original beat for beat, only with a sense of hollowness about it. Despite the actress who played Donnie's younger sister 'Samantha' (hence the 'S. Darko' title) returning, now much older, and experiencing the weird and sinister world her older brother once did, this one just didn't capture the same magic.It's certainly not the actors' fault this film doesn't succeed. They do their best with what's given to them. It's worth noting that this isn't written or directed by the man (Richard Kelly) who did the first one. Therefore it lacks the original's sense of visual style and flair, meaning the whole atmosphere just isn't there, along with the classic eighties soundtrack that 'Donnie Darko' possessed.All the 'weirdness' is just copied - seemingly - for the sake of it, as if it's desperately trying to be 'out there' and 'deep and meaningful,' but really just coming off as bland and incomprehensible. Yes, the original was odd and many people ended up wondering what it was all about, but even if you didn't understand 'Donnie Darko' you felt like it was an experience worth investing your time in and it was definitely entertaining. My advice: just stick to the original.",

I don't remember anything about it so this review is coming from someone who has a relatively fresh aspect on this.This movie is bad. Really bad. No plot, no excitement. I had a few jumps in the beginning when the dead girl appeared here and there, but that's about it. The best part of this movie was the skin shown due to some unknown pajamas addiction the main actress had. I understand that sequels are ten times better after watching the original or prequel but, shouldn't they still make some kind of sense? A sequel or follow-up is not going to be good just because the original was awesome. All good movies, sequels or not, have a few things in common . . . a) they make sense b) the characters win your heart or interest c) they make sense d) there's a freaking plot somewhere buried in the movie! Throughout the entire movie I was waiting for a flashback or miracle or ANYTHING to appear that would make sense of this compost pile of a movie. Bad, bad movie and bad, bad movie makers. If my fingers weren't too busy clawing out my eyes, I'd give you a thumbs down.",

After having seen Donnie Darko about 5 times and every time getting something different out of it I knew a sequel could never reach the original. Honestly I was expecting a total disappointment but most of the movie worked pretty fine visually. BUT here is the problem... everything that made this movie worked was an exact clone of Donnie Darkos visual and sound design ideas as well as the basic plot.Imagine... Some years later Donnies little sister (remember Sparkle Motion... they even put one flashback in) goes on some road trip with a girlfriend to end up in some small town to relive the strange occurrences Donnie witnessed. Now imagine a movie starting with Samantha sitting in front of a dark Mountainscape. Check. The incredible slow-mo school sequence switched to a party and with a 90 song (Hobo Humpin slobo babe ... honestly the only song in the movie that fit the 90s feeling) instead Tears for fears. Check. A tangent universe opened twice by a meteor and a car tearing loose from a tow truck (the latter is an obvious rip-off to the jet engine). Check. Regular eerie dream sequence with a cheesy Samatha Ghost and some dead kid instead of Bunny-Frank. Check. The bunny mask inserted for no explainable reason whatsoever and a Donnie Lookalike guy with post-traumatic war paranoia to relive Donnies Sacrifice. Check. Another person sacrificing herself just like our war psycho with no positive outcome. Check. The watery vectors, references to Grandma Death and her Book, the slow-motion sequences of people dropped in regularly, A cinema with 90s movies and burning church instead of a motivation trainers manor. Check. Last but not least the \"Mad World\" Outro reproduced exactly but with a happy note in the end. Check.Yep... they really did it as extreme as written above. Visually it was watchable although many things seemed to make no sense. Everything new they squeezed in seemed like subplots dropped left and right... a kid trapped in a cave, a guy mutating to some kind of super-alien, regular references to them and looks to the sky and showering meteorites. Kind of like Donnie meets the X-Files. On top of that you get a dark and down-key Sam Darko (at least we are told that, yet she doesn't come across that way) and her girlfriend walking around half naked and teasing which made the main characters rather hard to feel for.If they didn't steal the moody stuff, visual effects and mysterious plot outline this movie would basically be nothing. I wonder why today every in some way successful movie needs to have 2-3 sequels, prequels and whatever. I can understand Richard Kellys anger about this project because in a way its like Scary Movie 3. So... you can watch the movie, be entertained by some of the mysterious occurrences but I guess no one really needed this movie and it didn't add much to the Darko Universe except the bad feeling that Tangent Universes can occur every 9 years and then even within each other. Prepare for S.Darko II to VI... Tangent Universes in small towns all across America.",

Their car breaks down leaving them stuck in a small desert town in Utah. There is something a little strange about the town; there are posters of a missing child and talk that he isn't the first to vanish and a Desert Storm veteran, Iraq Jack, who seems more than a little troubled. Sam is suffering from blackout and Jack is visited by a 'future Sam' who warns him that the world will end shortly before saving him from a meteorite strike. Things only get weirder after that.I had heard that this film was disappointing but hoped low expectations might lead to a pleasant surprise... sadly it didn't. Having really enjoyed 'Donnie Darko' I really wanted to enjoy this but unfortunately it is a real mess. The original was weird but it had humour and ultimately made sense; this lacked wit and left me somewhat confused. Elements are taken from the original but with little obvious explanation; there are also key elements that reminded me of an inferior nod to the fun German film 'Run Lola Run'. Daveigh Chase is the only actor to return from the original film is decent enough as Sam and the rest of the cast are okay given what they are working with.

The makers of \"Donnie Darko\" should be embarrassed that they called this a sequel and it is a good thing Donnie (the character) is not around anymore so he doesn't have to watch this monstrosity.

Twenty minutes into this film you can tell right away why it was a straight to DVD release. This movie would have been so much better if they just used the \"Donnie Darko\" script and put Samantha Darko in Donnie's role instead. It might have been confusing but at least it would have made more sense, be more believable and not a waste of time. Instead the director Chris Fisher tries to do something new and different but fails miserably. They're both seeing things (why is Corey even seeing things? It's stupid.) like Donnie did and that's what I gathered before zoning out of the movie because it was all over the place and incoherent. For some reason the just needed to put Frank the Rabbit in this movie even though he really has nothing to do with Samantha and shouldn't be in this movie. This movie is so ridiculous they even have Elizabeth Berkley (Famous for playing Jesse from Saved by the Bell) making an awkward local townswoman appearance. PLEASE DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE, it truly is awful.1 out of 5 starsCool Factor: The same actress (Daveigh Chase) that played Donnie's little sister plays the same character in S.

NOTHING MORE.The movie completely fails in any attempt to evoke or fabricate any sort of emotion thru the whole thing. Yes, it tries so hard, it instantly makes you feel bad for wasting your time with slow motion crane cameras, characters looking into nothing with dumbass faces, bad acting, convoluted plot, total lack of meaning in any action and interactions, all characters are total gloomy posers and 1990s alternative music.Just as an example, like doonie darko, after the actress tries to show that she falls asleep, she sleepwalks, that pretty much gives an excuse for her to appear anywhere in town by a simple scene cut, dressed in her pajamas and conveniently close to the next nonsensical interaction with whomever.

The movie as a whole tries way too hard. It reminds me of one of those straight to DVD Disney sequels like the little mermaid 2 or lady and the tramp 2; those really crappy sequels that recycle the same plot with different characters. That's what S. Darko does except that the recycled plot has more holes than swiss cheese! It also misses the entire point of the original and takes all of the elements that made Donnie Darko great and turns them to meaningless crap. You would never know it was made 7 years later.

            "content": "Given one of the most dubious and potentially pointless tasks in movie history, \"Make a sequel to Donnie Darko,\" I feel the filmmakers did a thoughtful and somewhat marvelous job.It's no Donnie Darko, don't get me wrong \u2013 the original is one of my all time faves, but this story of Donnie's little sister Samantha isn't meant to be and shouldn't be taken as a \"continuation,\" despite taking place a few years later. Rather, it's more of a flipside \u2013 the Darko universe, where timeslips can cause ripple effects that destroy reality, as it relates to the \"manipulated dead,\" who are charged with the task of at least attempting to mend the damage. Whether they want to or not.Frank the Doomsayer Bunny in the original Darko was one of the manipulated dead \u2013 this time, Frank's POV is examined as his task falls on others (note the plural \u2013 S. Darko isn't just the story of Donnie's sister, even if it seems to be during the first hour or so\u0085it's that sort of Serling/M Night/O Henry/D Darko turnaround of all you thought you knew that allows S. Darko to successfully capture the feel of the original, while telling an altogether different story).I recommend that S. Darko viewers listen to the DVD commentary, and you'll see what I mean about the careful thought and consideration put into it by the writer and director. Every little detail in their film fits perfectly into world(s) portrayed in the original cult classic. They are clearly true fans of Donnie, and they truly understood (as well as anyone can) the universe created for the characters to exist within --- Part of S. Darko's appeal, for me, is the LOOK \u2013 filmed with a new \"red camera\" technology that allows for digital film that still closely mirrors 35mm, I was astounded by the Utah landscapes and the way the characters and their dusty little town appear so crisply delineated, yet still so warmly rendered, with a depth of field that flatters and beautifies both inanimate objects and the charismatic cast, all of whom are outstanding.I'd single out S. Darko herself, Daveigh Chase, reprising her original sparse role in the original as Donnie's little sister Samantha, as particularly riveting. Not just because she's lovely, but for her wandering and ethereal portrayal of a lost young woman whose fate \u2013 in life and beyond \u2013 is something she seems to already know that she has no control over.Samantha even keeps acting out her fate in various ways, as if rehearsing for a play she's never read and doesn't even know exists, before it actually happens to her, remaining aloof and apart from the world around her, even as events in her life illustrate her integral (if involuntary and possibly unwilling) role in saving that world \u2013 Some people in the Darko universe have the power to change the future \u2013 but, perversely and sadly, others are doomed to play supporting roles that ensure the big-picture events play out fated. Else the universe could be destroyed.SPOILER 'GRAPH (most obvious spoiler, anyway): Great to be the essentially superpowered (or at least super-evolved) Donnie \u2013 except you have to die to save everyone. Bummer to be his sister, or to be one of the Manipulated Dead \u2013 except their role in saving the universe is no less important, perhaps even more so, else the powerful Donnie(s) would never know what to do or how to do it (or even that anything needs to be done at all).OR, think of it this way \u2013 gotta have apostles, even tho there's only one Jesus, and he gets to call the shots AND gets all the glory. But every single thing we (think we) know about the Jesus story comes from the apostles, doesn't it, and how could Jesus' have happened without them???? ---- Sher, there are some \"red herring\" bits that never really pay off (and may in fact be continuity errors) in S Darko \u2013 same with Donnie, tho I admit it's more of a challenge to piece together what you've just seen after viewing S. However, I DID find myself thinking about S a lot after viewing, reaching several \"aha\" conclusions that may or may not be valid or intended. Just like after I viewed Donnie the first time (and the second, third, and fourth times).And the new metal bunny head, obsessively created and worn by Iraq Jack even tho it makes his head bleed, totally rocks! THIS is a bunny that'd get my attention \u2013 and inspire my life-changing and world-changing action \u2013 a lot quicker and better than the fuzzy dime-store Frank of the original Donnie! I have to wonder if someone saw S. Darko who was completely unfamiliar with Donnie wouldn't find it a fine movie? Maybe they'd love S's ambiguous and thought-provoking story and cast a bunch, just like so many as they first see Donnie.If someone's first Planet of the Apes movie they see is Escape From the Planet of the Apes, the third entry where the entire story is flipped upside down, they'll probably like it fine, perhaps even better than the Heston original once they finally see it. The original is great, sure, but Escape \u2013 tho completely different \u2013 is also a great flick. Same universe, a couple of the same characters, but a wholly different take and setting --- I wish more people would give S. Darko a chance. It's no Donnie Darko, sure \u2013 but it's a fine Escape From the Planet of the Apes.",

Darko Spoiler Alert! Darko Spoiler Alert! OK, enough. Donnie dies in \"Donnie Darko\" in his free-will time travel flight to deviate the powers of destiny. Well, time has passed since Donnie Darko's closed chapter. So I am dumfounded why the powers that don't see, decided to visit the Darko sequel side. \"S. Darko\" follows the travels of Donnie's younger sister Samantha in an incongruous, insubstantial way. There was no reason to play it again with Sam! Daveigh Chase does play it again portraying Samantha. But this time she is not the bratty 10 year-old she was in \"Donnie Darko\". Samantha is portrayed in \"S. Darko\" in her late teens as an adventure-seeking drifter doing some road trip time travel of her own with her BFF Corey. Their car breaks down in a small rural town, and before you can say \"here comes another rabbit test\", the infamous \"Frank the Bunny\" appears, but not in the same surreal way as in the original Darko. Only his loose head appears in this sequel and becomes an earmark symbol within the strange ordeals that occur in the rural town. Director Chris Fisher and Screenwriter Nathan Atkins try to reincorporate all the original Donnie Darko elements in \"S. Darko\" but to no avail. The Atkins diet of light scribing and the Fisher direction of bait-less audience man-trappings was a Darko catastrophic event that should have been put in a time machine to avoid this cinematic monstrosity. \"Donnie Darko\" Director Richard Kelly wanted no hand in this sequel and one can see why Kelly shied away, and probably furious upon witnessing the cinematic crime of \"S. Darko\". Let's now take a little ride in my movie review time travel machine and go back to the \"S. Darko\" plot (sorry!): Samantha & Corey suddenly come into contact with the small-towners as if they were significant fixtures of their past which includes the archetypical: cool guy, nerdy science guy, hypocritical priest, quirky hotel manager, ruthless cop, and maniacal young veteran. The ensemble acting of \"S. Darko\" also did unfortunately demonstrate the dark side of abysmal thespianism, with only Chase as Sam and Elizabeth Berkley as religious zealot Trudy giving mediocre turns.

IF you wanted a story as good and as interestingly done as Donnie Darko.. this is completely NOT it. This sequel is much softer and has two female leads, one is Donnie Darko's sister, who has a date with destiny, as do several other people in the town they get stranded in while on a road trip. Several trippy scenes that use the same old special effects in the original without really anything NEW to add, just new ways of showing the same thing, mainly with chicks instead of a dark haired troubled male as the lead. There is a Donnie Darko lookalike- Iraq Jack, an interesting character but overall the movie is a bit pointless but it's at least entertaining to revisit the universe of Donnie Darko and the time distortion idea. No sex to speak of, not a lot of nudity if any.",

            "content": "Let me start by saying, this film is the sequel to the brilliant Donnie Darko but don't make that reason force you to watch this. My advice is to avoid it at all costs.The film tries to be its predecessor but over complicates it, eradicates all sense of emotion and drama and casts actors who just cannot act. So basically the exact opposite to Donnie Darko. Sure that was complicated but the end sewed most things up and also it leaves so much lose that you want to watch it again and again with intrigue. This film however I barely made it through one full viewing. It is seriously bad.Right, it is about Donnie's sister, Samantha (Chase). She is in the first film but is eleven years old. Now she is eighteen and run away from home as her family has dismantled after her brother's death. As her and her mate Corey (Evigan) drive across country their car breaks down, leaving them stranded in a desolate town with weird town's folk. In this town lives a homeless Desert Ops veteran who has been having visions of Samantha telling him the world is going to end. When he sees her he tells her this and she begins to think about what this means. Next thing you know Samantha is killed but her mate is given the chance to go back in time and alter it so that she survives the car accident. I'm going to stop there for a second as this was a huge problem in the film. Her friend goes back into time but instead of preventing the car accident, she saves her friend and remains in the car that crashes. If she knows the outcome why doesn't she get out the car or even tell the car to go the other way. To me this was one of many major plot holes.Continuing on, Samantha is now alive and her mate dead but she isn't given the opportunity to save her friends life. We then interweave all the crazy sub-plots that involve a pointless town rebel, who has a brother who went missing along with another child, the town geek falling for Samantha and doing all he can to get with her and a man attempting to sell Christianity to her as well as having a strange relationship with one of the lost boys mother. What the hell! Donnie Darko had sub plots but they all related to the main plot. These ones just don't, and if they do the film could have done without them. Samantha then finds the missing boys although now dead, gets the veteran arrested and then has a date with the geek who seems to turn into an alien during a meteor storm. Then she rewinds to the beginning and decides to go home before this happens again. What a crock of pony. This tries to outdo the original and it really, really, epically fails. It is so bad.Nothing in this film makes any sense. Throughout I was puzzled as to what the hell was going on and at times I was even bored. All the characters are stereotypical and clich\u00e9d. They turn up at a desolate town and we have a geek, intact with glasses and high pants, the typical rebel, with sports car and beer and a weird religious nut. We also get a cameo from Elizabeth Berkley from Saved By The Bell, and her role is just pointless.Seriously never, ever, ever consider watching this film. The brilliance of the first one could be tarnished because of this dire sequel. We even get a reimagining of the bunny from the original and in this film it has no place, they have just brought it back to tie something in with the first. The director of the first reiterates that he had nothing to do with this film and has stated he wouldn't work with any of the actors who starred in this. If you haven't seen the first, watch it, you'll be intrigued, but don't bother with this. There is a very good reason it was released straight to DVD.",

I was actually looking forward to watching this film & saved it for a special moment to savour. Fool that I am. Well if I could travel through time, I'd certainly change that. It's not just that this film has thoroughly dislikeable characters, trashy dialogue, uninspiring locations, an abysmal soundtrack, amateur special-effects, and no plot line, its' real crime, which is truly horrific, is that it offers absolutely nothing new. There is not a single original idea in this film. Everything is taken from its' predecessor and I mean everything; - direction, characters, sub-plots, principle events...everything. This is a shameless remake for a teen audience, (although It's unlikely to be able to compete with the appeal of Twilight there).

So unique that you can't even find that one particular good song from the movie on YouTube. Usually soundtracks are everywhere for free but not this one.It had a lot of parallel action with Donnie Darko, and I appreciate that.Definitely worth the watch if you are an open minded Donnie Darko fan or if you have never watched Donnie Darko and don't intend to.

They meet an estranged loner, a slick hot car riding male and a too-good-to-true priest. What ties it all up and meant to put all the pieces together are the old Darko time travel motifs and references, including the old disturbing images of the costume bunny.Despite a fair start and some good acting from the main characters, it comes over as a poor copy which only the most intrigued may take something from. For many others it is simply a poor cash-in. Following up the original was not going to be a good idea, it was quite unique and idiosyncratic, but it's been done now.A film which is best left for the most dedicated of the original but even many of them will not warm to it (and will simply loathe it).",

Darko may as well be a carbon copy of the first film in terms of setup and execution (although I'm not sure if it's meant to be a true \"sequel\", so it's hard to call it the second film of the series). Basically you've got a group of actors whose job it is to appear wooden and bland while certain elements of the story are rewound for no reason and changed. I guess i just don't see the point in having certain events happen just so they can be backed up and changed via \"time travel\" or whatever the hell the plot vehicle for this is supposed to be. I mean typically you watch a movie things happen and you commit them to memory so the rest of the story makes sense. You might as well not do that here because there's a good chance it's not going to matter later.Basically the end of this movie just left me wondering what the point of it all was.

There's almost nothing that's good in this film.I will say, however, that the opening five or six minutes are promising enough. The premise itself is promising, too, but just about everything goes wrong after the first five minutes, with all the details fleshed in, which... There's no way to understand this film. I'll say that. Oh, it's simple enough, but there's no way to understand the logic behind most of the characters' actions regarding the tangent universe. How they know what they know is just... Eerie, or the writers being lazy.I figure I'll go ahead and talk about the story instead of just bitching about its shortcomings, although shortcomings are more than abound. Samantha and her friend are stuck in Utah and the strange events from the first film are thrown in just for kicks. While the world slowly, steadily comes to an end, there's a kidnapping, or maybe that was before they came to town, and there's a party or two with music that nobody at a party at that time would listen to (another complaint that I've got is the soundtrack; Donnie Darko had an amazing soundtrack, whereas this... doesn't).The bottom line is that this film can't stand with Donnie Darko because it falls so short, but it can't stand on its own because it relies so much on the previous film, which isn't even logical at points, for reasons that anyone unfortunate enough to see this film can figure out for themselves. This is a terrible movie. It's sh!t.

Darko does provide a more or less satisfying follow-up and although I don't believe that all who are in the Darko cult will be pleased, I for one enjoyed this little outing.Chris Fisher, who has worked done more work on television than in movies, handles the material reverently and makes a fair attempt to extend upon some of the Philosophy of Time Travel mythos from the original movie. One notices a fair amount of similarity in the shot compositions and effects (lots of slow motion, several \"force field\" scenes, some \"Abyss\"-esque chest worms) and I would have to say that the storyline itself is nearly as (pleasantly) incomprehensible as the first film. There are no deeper answers or insights here, but I was content to go along for the ride anyway.The acting was less than stellar, although I really enjoyed Ed Westwick as \"Randy\" and I'm sure we'll be seeing more from him soon. His performance was very reminiscent of Dana Ashbrook's portrayal of \"Bobby Briggs\" in Twin Peaks. In fact, I think there was something borrowed from the Lynch bag of tricks in terms of sheer weirdness and atmosphere. There were definite elements of the same soap-opera like tendencies in S. Darko. The characters all tend toward exaggerated caricatures: The devout but shady church lady (Elizabeth Berkley), the minister that you just can't help but get a creepy vibe from, the party girl with a secret, the troubles war veteran and town scapegoat \u0085. If they come off as two dimensional, I think it boils down to the intentions of the writer and director. This is an allegory after all; a morality play where characters represent various aspects of the humanity in an overt way.The movie will not captivate the audience in the same way that Donnie Darko did, but that doesn't mean that we should treat the original as some sort of sacred cow that is too perfect to explore through the eyes of a different director.",

Well, the original took shots at liberal politicians, and cast a New Age guru as a child-porn peddler. Can't have that in Hollywood. So, true to Hollywood spirit, we take shots at a) the military: the veteran has returned a dumpster-diving paranoid schizophrenic, and the only person who verbally endorses Operation Desert Storm also thinks that the adjective for a society which studies meteorites is \"meter-logical;\" B) Independence Day celebrants, who are apparently all violence-prone bullies, and have LA-style pool parties in their small, Midwestern town; and C) Christians, of course--the the targeting of whom is cause celebre of Tinseltown. In this case, it is a group of Christians who are child-molesters, murderers, and enablers. Of course, the writers bothered to learn so little about Christianity that they have the same characters making half-hearted Signs of the Cross AND spouting Protestant theology.There is nothing to recommend this movie.

            "content": "When I sat down to watch \"S. Darko\" I promised myself that I would approach it with an open mind and watch it as an individual tale separate to the original \"Donnie Darko\" albeit set in the same universe. Reviews were mixed. At best it was ranged somewhere between enjoyable, confusing and inferior. Reviews at their worst described it as a downright abomination. I remember seeing the original \"Donnie Darko\" at a special screening back in 2001. Not many people got it back then either. I felt at times I was one of the only few who understood its powerful message and feared it would be another wonderful movie underrated and lost among the multi million dollar trash that Hollywood would churn out that same year. Flash forward two years later and suddenly everyone was in love with \"Donnie Darko\". It had found a new life and a new appreciative audience on DVD. It suddenly became a modern cult movie. Everyone was talking \"Donnie Darko\". Now we could all re-watch it over and over, make up our own minds about it and scan the Internet for theories and explanations to back up our own way out philosophies. Funnily enough, I feel the same fate awaits \"S. Darko\".SPOILERS\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085.\"S. Darko\" starts its story in 1995, seven years after the events of the original \"Donnie Darko\". Now teen-aged, Samantha Darko (underplayed beautifully by the originals Daveigh Chase) is midway through a road trip with her best friend Corey and literally on a journey of self-discovery. We are told of her disconnection with her family since the death of her older brother Donnie and quickly learn of her inability to remember her dreams and her odd sleepwalking habits. As fate would have it their car breaks down just outside a small Utah town and it is here that Samantha begins to unravel the mystery of the visions that we see plague her nightmares. If you are familiar with the original characters Donnie was a \"living receiver\" and the \"Manipulated dead\" was Frank the Bunny whose future deceased personality communicates with the \"living receiver\" to help them discover the path that destiny has laid out for them and in turn save the deceased from dying. Here the roles are switched around. Samantha has become the \"Manipulated dead\" which explains why she cannot remember her dreams where her future deceased personality guides a \"Living receiver\" known as Iraq Jack, a young veteran of the Gulf War who's odd behaviour and rambling conjectures are passed off by the townsfolk as someone living with post traumatic stress. To say anymore would ruin the overall outcome of the movie but suffice to say that it does share a similar plot line with the original, at times even mirroring its eccentric characters. I have a feeling however that there is also a lot more to come in the \"..Darko\" world. There was a reason why Donnie sacrificed his life to save Samantha from the plane crash and her journey is far from over with this film.Other elements worth noting are its beautiful cinematography, which captures the strikingly odd landscape of the Utah desert and its score, although not dissimilar to the original, is haunting in its own inimitable way. Although arguably inferior in style and structure to the \"Donnie Darko\", like its brethren, \"S. Darko\" will slowly but surely grow in mass appeal.",

The fact that it went straight to DVD only made me feel more skeptical and the only reason I ended up watching the film was because it was given to me. Thank God I didn't spend money on it. This movie takes all the good bits of Donnie Darko and tries to make a new movie out of them. However, the ending result is not an excellent film but feels more like a fan made feature. This may have something to do with the fact that Chris Fisher, director of the first film, had nothing to do with the sequel but nevertheless, the film does not stand on it's own. Some sequences actually feel like you're watching a deleted scene from the original film. The plot has essentially been copied from its predecessor, complete with the world ending, wormholes, time travel and even Frank, although he's represented by a metal mask. The acting does not redeem the film either. For most of the movie's running time, Daveigh Chase looks like she's struggling to show emotion. and for the most part, her and Brianna Evigan spend most of their time running around in skimpy dresses and shorts and alternately time travelling. They also share a line that is easily the worst in the film; it's only said two or three times but each made me wince. A hint is that it uses the word immaculate. The supporting characters are by far the most interesting, although that isn't really saying anything. Jackson Rathbone, as local science nerd Jeremy, is adorable and plays his role as the awkward geek fairly well, although he goes through a transformation at the end that is more than a little bizarre. So, for those Donnie Darko fans out there who have been contemplating seeing the movie, save yourself the pain. S. Darko is not worthy of bearing the moniker \"a Donnie Darko film.\" This isn't a sequel to Donnie Darko; it's a rip-off, sucking all the parts out of the original movie that made it brilliant and dumbing them down. Save yourself the one and a half hours. Just don't bother.",

Darko has received a mixed-to-negative reaction from movie reviewers. My review is mixed, but it is also positive.This time we follow a teenage Samantha Darko (Daveigh Chase) and her rebellious friend, Corey (Briana Evigan). The two young girls are having an adventure to escape their \"boring\" life in Middlesex, Virginia in 1995. Samantha is troubled by her past, she has changed a great deal in the seven years that passed since the death of her older brother in 1988, Donnie. While their, they witness a meteorite crash and they are all plagued by bizarre visions.I liked it, but didn't love it. This follow-up wasn't anything special, but deserves a higher rating than a 4.0, at the most a 6.3. The acting wasn't great in some parts but it is made up for by amazing special effects and a decent storyline.Some parts of this film are repetitious but they didn't bother me. Don't be mislead by all of the negative comments, half of these people hated the movie from the beginning and some hadn't even seen it. S. Darko stays true to the original film. It doesn't totally leave it, but is told from a different angle than the first film (in which you are getting the point-of-view of the \"living receiver). There is no bunny, but does Roberta Sparrow ever mention in The Philosophy of Time Travel that the manipulated dead will be wearing demonic bunny suits? I missed Frank, but I found the dead pretty creepy. Don't be mislead by the rating, most of the votes were made over a month before the S. Darko was released. I'd rent the movie first if I were you, even though I bought it at Wal-Mart, because you will either think it is okay or you will hate it. I say it is worth the watch.",

What isn't clear, is how I could POSSIBLY give this movie a 6. But before I can answer that, I have to go into it more.Donnie Darko, the cult classic, was one of the most original films I have ever seen. At the time, I had become a fan and gave it it's worthy 10/10, so you can understand the hype for the sequel for the fans who, knowing it definitely won't be as good, were hoping for some sort of closure; something that could at least keep fans happy for a while. What we got, was, expectantly disappointing. When I say this, I mean, even though people were anticipating this sequel, they knew it was going to be terrible. Even I knew it. But I still wanted to see a movie that was anything like the original, something familiar that I could at least consider a tribute. And honestly, I got what I expected. I didn't mind it, but I only didn't because I was such a fan of the original, and many people seeing this with no or little interest in the first would consider it one of the worst films to have ever been created. I can definitely see how people can say this, and I agree, but it doesn't stop me for liking the attempt, this attempt at a sequel which is impossible to pull off for a film like Donnie Darko. If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean.S. Darko is just formula writing. This can be seen in an endless amount of film series' that won't die but need to (Saw, Friday the 13th and any other slasher film series). It's predictable, but at the same time not. The film itself doesn't even know exactly what's going on, but it keeps churning out explanations for different things that are never really cleared up.The film is unnecessary, but without it, fans would've have been pained to not see anything related to Donnie Darko, so in a way, it was necessary. It was a useful tool to let people know that there cannot be a worthy sequel to Donnie Darko, and there probably won't be. I did hear there was going to be a 3rd, and it would be directed by Richard Kelly (Director of the original), but this died after a while, sadly, and it seems like Donnie Darko 3 will not see the light of day.Finally, S. Darko is only a film to be seen by hardcore Donnie Darko fans. Otherwise, stay away, you will be very displeased.",

I really liked how Nathan wanted Samantha to live in this movie and not die like her brother Donnie.I think it also made the movie better by adding little twists turns and views of the Tangent Universe.I liked the cinematography I even thought the special effects were pretty good.Now let me also say that there is many things in the movie that I did not fully comprehend which is great! Because if you actually think about it even after watching the original Donnie Darko to this day.There is still things in that movie that people have missed or don't understand.But I like how Chris Fisher and Nathan Atkins payed many respects to the original Donnie Darko by simply putting in little things from the 1st movie.My favorite is when Samantha is walking in front of the movie theater \"Hah\" think about it people? Strange Days & Twelve monkey's that is awesome!!! *Hint* \"The red car\" \"Water\" \"Metal\" *cough* Roberta Sparrow and many more. Which I think is simply very well done. Good job you guys! Now everyone likes how plot worked in Donnie Darko but,It's not exactly the same here with S. Darko.Which I think is very good because they are not necessarily trying to create a sequel.It's a continuation and a very good one in my eyes.I mean this must have been really hard to do.I think the cast was very well chosen and Daveigh Chase is just beautiful.I really like how Corey dies for Samantha and even Jack Sparrow which is my favorite character in the movie! He even has to die for Samantha to live in the end.I thought all of this was very clever. Oh and by the way the music is also pretty cool I would not mind owning a copy of the movie soundtrack whenever it is released.People just need to accept it and take the movie for what it is.

            "content": "Spoilers due to weird personal opinions ANGLE 1 Blu-ray makes more demands on one's system than DVD, but for St Trinian's 2 and Heathers it seemed worth having a go. Reading around, I got the impression that some individuals had got Blu-ray to play on less expensive hardware by converting the video to more easily playable forms. Does some software consider reworking Blu-ray to be improper? I soon ended up with Trinian's that were bloated. Get to view Blu-ray S Darko, it ended up as just a bit torn. Jitter abounded. If some people have success with this then others discover that things are not so simple. ANGLE 2 The original Darko dives into subjects that are not talked about openly, they are covered with taboo. There is a story there, one that had me watching it several times even though the acting did not feel too real, my perception was askew? The story has a lot of veiled symbols and an SF commentary, but I tended to ignore that side and look to what I understand as the real story, shown by my personal relationship with the taboo. I tend to view the bad stuff that Donnie did as unreal, a paint job explained by the symbolism of the misdeeds. I note that Donnie has a remedial education gap re personal hygiene. I can relate. Darko 2 as a fan thing made by a very different production team, not unheard of. Their understanding of the story is a bit different to me and their ways of dealing with taboo typically does not have the class that the original had, but I can still watch the first two thirds comfortably and that helps me to rethink just what my opinion of the original is now. The early breakdown, Sam in the road, that definitely helps me re the very start of Donnie. ANGLE 3 In my early days of DVDs, some actors stood out. I was in my early days of enforced male to female and looking to girls was proper and Daveigh Chase, being a rising star in the horror world, was one who I looked to. I only watched Donnie because of her. I experience her and Sparkle Motion as having a central role. I find the dance scary. I find the glimpse of a lookalike to Shannen Doherty, Girls Just \u0085 and Heathers, just before the engine fall as scarier. Soon I was wondering if Daveigh was getting her roles because of her name and despite the fact that she could act, but Spirited Away says that is not a bad thing. I was tangled by a past of being a believer in old time religion and chasing David was a real issue to me. I did keep my thoughts to myself and am several thousands of miles from where Daveigh lives. Soon I was hearing messages that Daveigh had been born in Utah, that she had the Utah religion, that she liked to live and work there. She appeared to move from features to acting in TV series. A fan picture of Travelling Pants having her as highly plump, somehow I felt a need to calm my fan interest and to look elsewhere. I have not considered any other actor to have a chasing David link. Camilla Belle, just a wide range of interesting stories, the early ones set a standard. Only one of my most recent fan dreams, Yasmin tooth fairy, has ended up with fan pictures showing her as really fat. I currently look to Trinian's. ANGLE 4My favourite horror of young Daveigh, her as the star, is Beethoven 5. Yet re-watch it soon after torn S Darko and it actually felt empty, a watchable void. Beethoven 5 has Daveigh riding a bus to town with her dog, her staying a month in the town of Quicksilver with her uncle, a certified grease monkey. A story of ghosts and robbery and of various forms of justice prevailing. My torn S Darko seems to quote bits of this and other stuff of hers that I know, but is not a direct quote. In S Darko, a Silver Nitrate production, she is trying to emigrate from Virginia to Hollywood, just (Corey's dad's?) car breaks down in small town Utah. A slightly similar car tries to kill them, later. She does not enter town with a large St Bernard but with Corey. She ends up by not heading to Hollywood or even staying in Utah, but returning to Virginia instead. Scary stuff, given my past. So, the car likely belongs to Corey, my interpretation is likely askew. ANGLE 5 There is amazing scenery, set as the countryside around a village in one of the main Utah valleys. From the IMDb locations page this is three areas close to Salt Lake City. Echo, with detail from Delle and Magna. ANGLE 5+1Heathers, I find the region 2 DVDs I have purchased to all be a bit fuzzy compared to the clearest DVDs. The Blu-ray region 1 was my attempt to solve that. It is now obvious that the Blu-ray version has the image quality that one hopes for. I now need to be able to view Blu-ray reliably. The S Darko soundtrack appears to point to Heathers at one point and to me that is the same ball park but a different game, The quote might relate to some detail in these two rather than a global comment. ANGLE 5+2 Get to know this further and I now respect this writer's view as deeper than my own. I find that this does help me to appreciate the original better, despite the weaknesses.",

Darko and watch till your brain's fried twice over, but if you're a die-hard Donnie Darko fan looking for a fix of the old magic that Donnie gave us, steer very, very clear.-Final Score- 3/10 The good: *Good looking actors. *Pretty rad special effects *Weirdness level's off the charts.The bad: *Terrible, Confusing Plot *Wooden acting *Horribly obvious and unnecessary Donnie Darko references.The ugly: *Pretty much the entire hour and forty three minutes.RENT OR BUY? Rent for sure, but only if you're looking for something to get stoned and pass out to.",

Why, why was this made? What was the point? This added nothing to the original story and added less as an original story.Donnie Darko was a great film. As complicated as time travel, warm holes, and near death experiences can be to capture well in a story, it did it very well. This film did not do so well.

            "content": "Not just because the film is an atrocious sequel to a film that really did not need a continuation. But the main reason being that the story literally, by the end, restarts itself. The entire film technically didn't happen. Sure, 'Donnie Darko' used the same method, but for justifiable causes. It was a meditative thought-provoking narrative that philosophised the use of time travel. This on the other hand is just pointless. So incomprehensibly dumb, that nothing could quantify this sequel's existence. Years later after the events of the first film, Donnie's youngest sister travels to California with a friend when their car breaks down. They wander around town for a few days, experiencing hallucinations taunting that the world will end in 4 days, 17 hours, 30-something minutes and oh my lord no one cares. Someone tell me what the point of this was? Seriously. I've got nothing. Is it supposed to indicate that bad things happen to people who treat others inappropriately? Does it question the meaning of fate? Or even religion? For the life of me I cannot find a single positive outcome from this straight-to-DVD experience. The acting was wooden. No characters had any personable qualities or even remotely relatable. The script thinks it's a dissertation on fate, and yet still includes the line \"until farts taste like cherry\". Whilst boasting a similar budget to the original, the visual effects were somehow worse. The story doesn't even make sense, as it purposefully confuses in an attempt to come across as intellectually stimulating. Music so obtrusive that it was as if I was listening to \"Now That's What I Call Music! 54\". The \"somewhat attractive actor playing an unattractive nerd\" clich\u00e9. \"That rash is gnarly!\". I can't. I'm done. It just clings onto 'Donnie Darko' because it's the only thing it can do. I literally just watched it five minutes ago and have already forgotten about the whole thing. S. Darko may have just improved my rating for the original. This is irrefutably terrible. Sleepy Darko. Snoozefest Darko. Someone-Pass-Me-The-Gun Darko.",

But since I have to write 10 lines in order to post this review, I will say that the director, Chris Fisher, has tried very hard to mimic the style of the original, from the pseudopod-a-la-The Abyss to the ramping effects to the countdown title cards to the double-feature movie marquee. Then there's the iconic rabbit mask, which although creepy in the original, in the end, had no significance other than being part of Frank's Halloween costume - that's in this movie. And of course, the book, \"The Philosophy of Time Travel,\" had to make an appearance, even though Donnie, having died when the jet engine crashed into his bedroom, never actually had the book - so why does Samantha have it? This is what happens when someone other than its creator writes the sequel. But I digress. Daveigh Chase is very easy on the eyes.",

There was nothing scary or really even a mystery to solve like the fist film. By already watching the original movie, the viewer would know what's going to happen, because it repeats itself leaving no mystery. And adding the bunny costume was almost a mockery of the original film. In part one he only wore the costume because he came from a costume party - it made sense to why the costume was involved.

But this film was/is in a league of its own... a bush league! The storyline had no definition, nor did it lead to anywhere substantial. It had a cast marketable to that 14-25 demographic, that still eats up the bubblegum media and television shows, that only someone of poor taste could \"appreciate\" (James Lafferty of One Tree Hill & Ed Westwick of the 'makes me want to gouge my eyes out with a rusty nail', Gossip Girl) (Okay, One Tree Hill isn't terrible)When deriving from a cult classic like Donnie Darko, and spewing this crap among serious movie goers, it really feels like an insult that they would even think of releasing this in theatres. The producers must have no clue, because the teeny boppers will hate it since they lack the mental capacity to understand, any of which is going on (having seen the first film or not). But then, there are people like myself, who even after having seen the original film, are still left bewildered by this one.The acting wasn't bad, but then, the movie was so horrid that the acting could have been terrible, and still looked great. You'd think they would splurge a little more on some special effects. I mean, it couldn't have made this film any worse, right? Sadly, nothing could save this abomination of a film.It's like they were trying to create a masterful David Lynch film (see 'Mulholland Drive' :) Great piece of work) and wound up making a mockery of what *was* a good movie in \"Donnie Darko\".I give it a 3/10 Originally I gave it a 4. But due to my high anticipations for this film, and being so drastically let down, at this point, a 3 is being generous. I wouldn't pay to see this movie, if it were the only movie in theatres.

I basically live and breathe Donnie Darko.S.Darko is trying its best, it really is. The cinematography is very reminiscent of Donnie Darko, and admittedly beautiful at times. Both the score and soundtrack are very nice. The original actress that plays Samantha Darko in the first film reprises her role. The thing that really impresses me is that the director most certainly \"understands\" Donnie Darko -- meaning, he has a firm grasp of the fictional time travel rules in Donnie Darko and implements them into this sequel. He put a lot of effort into getting everything just right, and you can tell he has a genuine love and admiration of the source material.However, I'm giving S.Darko only 5 stars, because in the end, it just doesn't work. Richard Kelly was firmly against this sequel being made because Donnie Darko did not need a sequel, and I have to agree.

However it opens up for a possibility of a third film to explain the reasoning in this one.The whole movie is about saving Samantha Darko, not only from the \"end of the universe,\" but from herself. Her character is the inverse of what Donnie was in D.D. She needs to start living her life, other lives are sacrificed for her to do so. Donnie had to die for everyone else to live. When they speak of saving the universe I feel that Samantha Darko has something that she needs to do in the future, something she needs live for.This is why Donnie had to die, so that she wouldn't perish in the plane crash. This is why when Samantha dies in S. Darko, that she needs to be saved by her friend sacrificing herself. This is why, in the end, she must be led away from the small Utah town where it is going to be destroyed by meteors. She cannot die until she saves the universe. The events I feel are yet to come.Her character may be more important in the grand scheme than originally conceived in the original Darko film.This is why I think it is opened up for a third film.I am sure many fans of Donnie Darko would be very angry with this film, but I've accepted it, as I do with all sequels and remakes that come out these days.

I knew I'd watch the movie before passing judgment. My expectations were incredibly low, however. I figured that it would either be a poor attempt at cashing in on the first film's success, a cute film that made a decent attempt, or a surprise hit that blew my mind. The large amount of time since the first film made me doubt the first option, and the fact that Richard Kelly would not be involved made me doubt the third. So I figured it would be an okay film, worth watching once, and then forgetting about. The film finally came out, and I decided to rent it. I watched it with a friend, also a big Donnie Darko fan. My final verdict: I was indeed blown away. I will say that this film is not really on the same level as Donnie Darko. But it was far better than I had expected it to be. In terms of cinematography, the film is superb. In smaller terms: it LOOKS like Donnie Darko. You'll find fast-motion clouds, slow-motion parties, and upside-down, rotating shots. All of the rules of the first film are kept intact. Those who are very involved in the mythology of the film will likely not be disappointed. Everything about time travel, water, metal... all remains intact. My major qualm is that some things seemed directly lifted off of the first film. Of the now four people I know who watched both the first movie and this sequel, all four have found that to be its biggest flaw. But it does have its own story, and it's a beautiful story. The effects are wonderful, very beautiful. Overall, the movie is worth watching. I expect a lot of people will cast it aside and hate it simply because it exists. Good for them. But this movie is a good continuation, a great sequel (considering the original mastermind was nowhere to be found) and it was put together by true fans, for true fans. Where Donnie Darko blew my mind out of this world, this movie at least blew my mind out of my chair. That's more than can be said for a lot of films. In short, this movie is not Donnie Darko.

Cinematography is dull and uninspired, lots of slow tracking to sad music that will never match Mad World from Donnie Darko. Performances are tolerable, mainly from the side characters, two leads are nice to look at but not much in the way of acting. Chuck Bass seems to have a large pole wedged up his smug arse the entire time, either that or he was going for cool and managed learning impaired. Plot has no purpose, a great deal of the film is completely pointless and only serves to add to the eeriness, which isn't there to begin with. There was a lot of potential for this, they could have done something interesting with this universe, well Richard Kelly could have, this guy thought he might be able to, but hasn't. Instead what we get is a predictable, lack lustre excuse for a plot, half of which is basically a loose rehash of the original, but without a quarter of the mystique or compelling characters and themes. And an ending that makes no sense to a viewer unfamiliar with the concepts explored in the first. It would be an anti- climax were the director able to drum up any kind of anticipation. So it's just very a messy finish, which I suppose some would still call a climax (HA I'm so funny).It's one thing to love a film enough to want to work with that intellectual property, it's another thing to butcher it and pretend you achieved something. Straight to DVD is right. Pointless Self Indulgent S**t.",

However, the proposal, with a lower budget and and a more Tarantino or Rodriguez approach and style, keeping away of the teenager comedy genre of DD could be attractive, but it fails.In fact, at the beginning the plot appears to be a road movie like Death Proff -even Thelma and Louis is referenced by the motel owner !! in a funny wink- or movies like that, but despite some little hits of the script it doesn't work good enough as it develops. Many things of the movie are confusing and they don't mix as good as in DD.Anyway, if you like this kind of films or if you loved or were astonished (like me) about DD, you should watch the film. At least because you will laugh in many moments, and who knows, probably this is not a handicap for the film !!. So, no totally bad and unwatchable, but insufficient.",

            "review_title": "Lessons From a Nightmare",
            "content": "It's a bad week in Conejo Springs for Samantha Darko, the iconic Donnie Darko's little sister, now grown up and reprised by Daveigh Chase. Sam has hit the road with her bosom buddy, Corey (Briana Evigan), because she feels cast adrift by a family shattered by her brother's bizarre death. Not surprisingly, considering her history, she's a profoundly troubled young woman.Fatefully, Sam's road trip brings her and Corey to a troubled little town in rural Utah plagued by missing children, a homeless veteran's post-traumatic stress, ennui among the young, a lecherous ex-con turned pastor and countless other eccentrics -- indeed, clinical neurosis seems to be a prerequisite for permission to live in Conejo Springs.Sleep disorders are a common symptom of mental illness. Thus, if Samantha had been better rested, she probably would have thought to avoid a town named after the furry little mammals that inspired the hideous death creature that haunted her brother. In any case, Sam lands in the town to work out her destiny at a time when a lot of the townsfolk are facing crises in their lives. Soon after she arrives, the specter of Things Falling From the Sky establishes itself as a motif of doom and a Doppelganger of our protagonist materializes to set off a countdown to The End.After all this is set up, things go very badly for the title character -- and almost as badly for the audience. A casual movie fan might well consider this movie a wreck and feel cheated by the resolution. For the filmmaker and film student, it's worthwhile to analyze this movie because its inspiration was a landmark of cinema and culture.I would recommend \"S. Darko\" if you're involved in movie-making -- or obviously, interested at all in Miss Chase. If you're not in either of those categories and you see it anyway, you may be tempted to take the DVD along with you next time you go to the trap range.Be that as it may, the story is set up in a compelling fashion. But no sooner do we realize that The End is near than the question becomes: The End of what? About half-way through Act Two, you will understand why IMDb viewers rank this movie so low. This could have been -- should have been -- a great movie.\"S. Darko\" has a strong cast of attractive young performers, and very good production values. The cinematography and music evoke powerful moods and the leading actor, Miss Chase, creates a deeply engaging and sympathetic character.To consider what went wrong, two titles come to mind: \"Psycho\" and \"Dallas.\" Other than the shower scene, the Hitchcock masterpiece is best remembered for the extraordinary plot device of killing off the protagonist at the midpoint crisis. If anybody else has ever been able to get away with that risky twist, Mr. Fisher is not among them. And, as far as the prime-time soap opera goes, one of the most memorable achievements of \"Dallas\" was the entire run of Season Nine, which went into the books as the longest dream sequence in history.Back to \"S. Darko,\" let's assume for a moment that the whole project deserves to be taken seriously and you're left sorting through the usual existential questions during the closing credits.The key question is how Samantha could have insinuated herself into the lives of so many people if, as it turns out, she departed so soon. Perhaps her dreams were a projection of her inner conflicts into characters she actually created? Otherwise, what would be the emotional reward -- for both protagonist and audience -- in having someone choose to commit themselves to a journey headed to certain doom when it turns out that journey doesn't exist? After all, the opening title crawl tells us that S. \"has drifted deeper and deeper into the darkness of her sleep. And when darkness consumes the starlight, nightmares rule the night.\u0085\" Fair enough, but in the context of her life, the nightmares need to light the way to some kind of redemption, even if they've swallowed up all that starlight. Of course if the hapless Samantha's demise would have brought redemption to a subsequent protagonist, the average viewer would be left with feelings of fulfillment while taking the DVD out of the machine.But instead, we're left with the message that a person can consider taking a certain path, and then have a profound nightmare about the consequences of taking such a path, and then wake up and achieve salvation. After all, Dorothy had a similar experience in \"The Wizard of Oz\" -- and she returned transformed from a wistful young girl to a wiser young woman. But Mr. Fisher chose in one scene to evoke \"Alice in Wonderland,\" a story in which the protagonist has a bizarre dream that is its own adventure and leaves her largely without a transformational arc -- a curious hollowness captured perfectly by Walt Disney.Here, at the end of all the sound and fury, Samantha seems to have had a nightmare that transformed her into a person who doesn't need nightmares. I suppose that is possible, but I think many viewers will be left wishing they could have the last 100 minutes back.It's worth adding that Miss Chase has already done excellent work as a child and has a great future. I saw one of her first roles in the Michael Landon biopic as one of about 20 children portraying kids growing up in a large family. I knew at once she had star potential -- I even called her agent (who corrected my pronunciation of her name -- it's \"Da-vay,\" not \"Davie\") to find out what she was going to do next.This movie will do little to harm her career. I remain convinced she'll go on to achieve great things in her profession.",

            "content": "As most of the other reviews mention, this really is not a spot-on sequel to Donnie Darko. This movie raises far more questions than it answers, and while that's fine, it also leaves so many issues open that you start to wonder if there was even a point at all. Let me go over a few of the points in this movie that genuinely bothered me;~The Second Tangent Universe; In this movie, there are actually 2 Tangent Universes; the main one, and about half way through, another one is thrown in. There was NO point to this whatsoever, and it didn't contribute anything to the story. If anything, it ruined the philosophy that Donnie Darko-style Time Travel is about; Tangent Universes are supposed to be extraordinarily rare. For 2 to happen at the same time is beyond any odds I'd ever believe. Not to mention that the second universe really didn't add anything; it killed off one of the two girls and resolved nothing.~The meteorite; Yeah, that's right. Meteorite. One happens to be the Artifact in the Primary Tangent Universe, and some kid gets his hands on it. He develops rashes, starts acting weird, and at the end apparently just goes insane. And my only real complaint; what in the absolute f***, does this have to do with anything? ~The tesseracts; Now, from what I understand, a tesseract is a fourth- dimensional hypercube, basically a 4D cube. And the fourth dimension, from what I understand, is time. So a bunch of cubes that exist within the fourth dimension showing up in a movie mostly about time travel, not unlikely, but still, nothing about them is ever truly explained. ~Resolution; There is none. At the end, the kid is still locked up, nobody knows where he is (Sam should know if she remembered anything about her time in the Tangent Universe), the people hiding the kid are still living happy ordinary f***ed up lives, and nothing is resolved for anybody, not even in the Tangent Universe. Nothing positive happens at really any point in this movie. And finally, ~Death for the Living Receiver(s); The Living Receiver does not have to die for the Tangent Universe to be closed. There is nowhere that says one has to at all. So I don't get why that bit of information seems left out. Nobody HAS to die at all. But both Living Receivers, knowing full well what's coming ahead, decide to die. No. The job is done the second the Tangent Universe is resolved. Death adds nothing to it.It seems this movie was made without really understanding the original movie. It seems like somebody watched it once, liked it, worked about half of it out for himself, and decided there had to be a sequel, since everything else was getting one. Its only redeeming quality was the fact that the same actress who initially played Sam Darko reprises her role in this one. I would recommend against seeing this one if you were a fan of Donnie Darko.",

I am a Richard Kelly fanatic, and have literally delved myself into his world further than most people have. I've watched all his audio commentaries multiple times, bought the Donnie Darko book, read the original screenplay a gazillion times, and just generally fangirled to the point of embarrassing myself. I know Donnie Darko inside and out (as well as his other two films, Southland Tales and The Box).And that is why I enjoyed S.Darko. Is it a good sequel? No. (Donnie Darko didn't need a sequel). But as an homage, it's actually not bad. I was pleasantly surprised at how loyal Chris Fisher was at sticking to The Philosophy of Time Travel, and Richard Kelly's made up rules for that world. He was incredibly faithful and did a brilliant job in that respect.Also, the overall tone of the film matched Donnie Darko's tone, which is something that I felt was really important. Even the score and the soundtrack matched, which is no simple feat considering Donnie Darko had a score that was unique and unlike any I had ever heard.Most of all, the creativity that is shown in S.Darko really impressed me. Showing the story from the point of view of the Manipulated Dead instead of the Living Receiver was a wonderful choice that showed S.Darko wasn't just trying to be a Donnie Darko copycat. Also, the idea of a Tangent Universe within a Tangent Universe was interesting. Not my favorite thing about this film, but it was fun to think about.The character of Justin had to be my favorite thing about S.Darko. He was like Donnie in many ways, but he was also the opposite -- Donnie had many people in his life who loved and cared about him, and so he chooses to die at the end to destroy the Tangent Universe and save their lives. Justin, on the other hand, doesn't have anybody. Everyone around him treats him as an outcast and couldn't care less if he existed or not. And yet, at the end of the film, he still makes the choice to sacrifice himself to save everyone else. A truly heroic and tragic character (and I am a sucker for those).So, will you like S.Darko if you aren't a Donnie Darko die-hard? Definitely not. Will you like S.Darko if you ARE a Donnie Darko die-hard? Probably not. But are there redeeming qualities about this movie? Definitely and absolutely.",

It tried it's best to stick to the original concept but still went it's own way with it. When someone watches Donnie Darko, they are not trying to figure out who plays the different roles in the story (like the living receiver and manipulated dead) but Chris Fisher uses this to his advantage in S. Darko. It turns into a different kind of mystery because you are trying to figure out which character plays which part instead of 'what the hell is that bunny doing here?'. When it turned out that Sam was the manipulated dead and not the living receiver I was so surprised. I just assumed that Sam would have the same role as Donnie. This switch was a great idea. It made the story in keeping with what made the original such a hit but put in a twist that made it its own deal. I also love how it turns out that Corey was a key piece to saving the world too. If she hadn't sacrificed herself the second time around then Iraq Jack would have never had the chance to die the second time too. This makes you think a lot about the first movie. I wonder what Gretchen or Cherita Chen did that we weren't shown... If you approach this movie with an open mind and no impossibly high expectations (because come on...no one can top the original so don't expect someone to...)then I think you will be pleasantly surprised by what you see. I bought this movie for 15 bucks with out seeing it and I am very happy that I did.",

I have no difficulty in watching movies like 'memento' '21' 'Mulholland Dr.' 'the seventh sign', etc. some have simple stories with a complicated time line. some use a lot of symbolism and have deep meaning. even movies like 'necromantik' and 'salo ole 120 giornate di sodoma', i can understand why they make a movie like that considering the history and other background info. But this one, S.Darko, has reached a new Lev of 'being totally meaningless'.For one who hasn't watched the first Darko movie, I expected a dark, mysterious and thrilling movie, which might be a bit twisted and complicated in plot and time line. but after 30mins, i started to 'WTF!' but I still have the hope that the later half of the movie would explain everything in a good way. Well guess what, after 1:40,all i can come up with is 'WAAAAAT DAAAAAAAA F$%(*)#*($(*)%*#(%' words can not describe how i felt about this movie. Chris Fisher has interpreted 'director' in a new high Lev as 'spending other ppl's money on making absolute senseless meaningless useless piece of sh1t and being a d1ck'.Srsly I mean, if this movie's purpose is to help you kill time when you r bored to death(sorry to say, but it doesn't have any meaning or purpose as a movie itself) , it fails. Cuz i d rather go outside, digging up dirt and counting ants then sit down and watch this piece of crap.But I wanna show my thanks to Hollywood. Having disabled ppl working like normal ones is really thoughtful and should be praised. Hollywood has just made those retarded ppl like the writers and director of this movie believe that they can do what other normal ppl can do, tho they kinda failed. The discrimination against retarded ppl shall be demolished truly. After all what they need is our support, encouragement and love.

And that's what these folks were attempting - another tale from Darko-land.I'm a Batman fan - the dark and brooding Batman - and that Batman was brought to life by writers and artists other than the original creator. And a lot of people complained about that, too.This movie is not bad. Not great, but really not bad like it seems most others feel. More than anything else, I believe the reason is that I never really cared for or connected with the characters, so I didn't have an emotional stake in the story. But that's a truly difficult and magical thing to achieve with any form of storytelling.What did work was the sci-fi aspect of it. I did care about the story and it's resolution (or non-resolution as the case may be with poor Billy).I agree with others that it might've been better had Mr. Kelly been involved, but Fisher and Atkins do a decent job of a second tale in this \"universe\", paying a bit of homage and also trying some different plot devices.The problem is the universe has a few rules that constrain the writing a bit, and the whole \"msg from the dead to save the universe\" is really the primary gimmick. It's this gimmick that anchors us firmly in Darko- land, and it's gonna be pretty tough to use it (thereby anchoring the audience) and NOT have a story that looks like a rip-off.BUT, it can be done and I for one look forward to seeing someone try again. All the negative feedback will likely just keep future attempts from happening, which is too bad, because there's a LOT of potential in this universe for creative story-telling.For example: How about a story where the central figure is the \"dead messenger\", where we'd learn more about the physics of the multi-verse, or the world the \"dead\" inhabit?How about a story where the \"living receiver\" DOESN'T do what is needed and the \"dead messenger\" is forced to try an alternate course of action? Or perhaps these \"dead msgrs\" are from heaven, but when the receiver refuses they're forced to get old testament to save the universe.I can imagine a story where saving the universe doesn't require the protagonist to die, but to kill instead. Or a story where we have more than one \"living msgr\" acting together. Heck, one could go crazy and turn the \"dead msgrs\" into avatars controlled by man and actually coming from the future, ala Terminator.Lots of options so I hope someone continues the saga.I personally liked the direction of this film. I liked the soundtrack, I liked the cinematography, I liked the editing and pacing for the most part (some scenes might've been a tad too long).What I didn't care as much for was the dialog and acting. Both were a bit wooden. BUT so was the original, and so are a ton of films I really love (\"My Own Private Idaho\"). So that aspect of the film gave it a more Wim Wender/Gus Van Zant feel, which isn't really all that bad. It was consistent throughout which gave the film a continuity, so it's not like the acting/dialog broke my fourth wall and took me out of the experience. But the emotional content would've resonated more with a different approach.Mind you, they shot this baby in under a month, with mostly first takes and everyone involved deserves a hand for how well it really did turn out under those conditions.Best part of the DVD: The bonus segment about the song the guys wrote, \"Utah too Much\". I play in a country-ish band. I lived in SLC for half a decade. I can't wait to play that song for an audience!",

Yes, the film is reminiscent of a teen flick; yes, the main characters are iconic representations of pestering post-pubescent scum; and yes, the film has essentially borrowed concepts and conventions from the original that would make it seem as if it were a mere knock-off. Sure, there are drawbacks to the film; and sure, it deserves to be compared to the original by default. However, it's reckless to slander the film's ingenuity. It has its own subtlety, its own twisty plot, and, while attempting to remain a follow-up to such an accredited prequel, its own air.",

This is more like an independent film that heavily ripped off Donnie Darko.I rented it knowing it wasn't gonna be a great movie. I can honestly say it wasn't terrible or as bad as everyone says it is. I really wanted to watch it just to see what someone that thought that they could make a sequel to DD, would be like. DD was one movie like many that you just CANNOT take any further. Most of its beauty was just pure dumb luck, a fluke, and my proof is that Richard Kelly has yet to do it again.S. Darko lacks all the essence of the first film that really was achieved by all the characters together. You have neither Gyllenhall(sp?), Barrymore, Swayze, but instead have probably the character with the smallest influence in the first film. With that you can't expect much. With that said, watch this movie with a grain of salt and nearly 2 hours of free time. Keep an open mind and you won't be disappointed.",

That's about it. Don't see this movie. It's not worth the time.Although, it did have some good ideas. More use of wormholes and the tangent universe. But it still sucked.

This movie, despite it's flaws, is not bad at all. While I'm sure the majority of you are professional directors with degrees in cinematography, complete with your own versions of Donne Darko 2 in mind, let's refrain from tearing down a good movie solely off the fact that it didn't match perfectly to what you had envisioned.Now, on to the movie. The plot was headstrong and loosely based off a sub-normal crazy teenage act of rebellion. If that isn't relate-able, I don't know what is. (We've all been through that phase) Admittedly, there are a few anachronisms (as pointed out by a few others) but that is in no way a bad thing. You have to remember that after the events in Sam's past the future has been changed forever. These may seem like anachronisms to us, but in the Darko Universe everything is as it should be. All the cars and Budweiser advertisements are up-to-date. Some of you may think that a plane crashing and the death of a lanky white kid in rural Virginia couldn't have possibly changed the future that much but it's a little theory called The Butterfly Effect. It's more than just a movie, look it up.The acting on the other hand, while not perfect at times, was still better than average. I've read posts on how \"Donnie Darko was so good because it was written in such a way that you could relate to it and feel immersed in the story\". Now I don't know that person on an individually personal level, but dear reader tell me this, which can you more easily relate to: 1. A troubled teenager who is trying to deal with the death of a loved one and a broken family through an act of rebellion. 2. An emotionally dysfunctional teenager who commits arson at the order of a psychotic delusion in the form of a man in a rabbit suit.9 times out of 10, it's #1.Overall, I give S. Darko an 8 out of 10 because it took the Darko Universe in an unexpected, interesting, and mind-bending direction, which is exactly what I've come to expect from Darko, ironically.As for the rest of you who constantly slander a movie you so obviously watched with intentional bias, I give you a 1 out of 10. Shame on you.",

I've seen people who said the acting was bad, or the effects were bad, and all other kinds of crap. number 1, the effects weren't bad for a low budget movie, you want to see bad effects, go see the movie corpses. second, the acting was actually pretty good. If you were mad that the lead girl wasn't emotional enough or whatever, she wasn't supposed to be, she was psychologically messed up from her brother. the acting was good, and the plot was obvious. if you just remember the first darko movie, the thing is that you just have to wake up. Donnie did, and he followed his destiny. She woke up and followed hers, she left to have a future. the director copied a lot from the original, and you shouldn't compare them, i agree the original was much better. but don't count this one out, the girls were hot, the acting wasn't bad, and the effects were good for a low budget movie. stop hating please. I stand by my earlier conclusion that this was a good movie, actually had a plot, but you need more of an IQ than a garden has to figure it out.",

Funnily enough this is roughly how I'd describe the film. I've given it 10 out of 10 in order to compensate for all the people who have given it a 1. Truthfully I'd give it a 5.5/10. I think there are far worst ways to end an evening but don't expect anything ground breaking. Some food for thought, but not quite down the rabbit hole (no pun intended).

(i know, now the fan-atics will bring out their 50 page term papers on universal laws to defend the first movie)... The point is, movies like these are meant to entertain and make you think. In s darko you look into the thoughts of the characters... i didn't know anything about Donnie's sisters in the first movie, frank was just some nobody that you meet at the end, ...in this one you know how Cory thinks, you actually meet Iraq jack, the metal shop bunny mask is cooler than the fluffy halloween costume in #1... yes its weird, they both are, but after i saw Donnie (and liked it) i put it away and was done with it, s darko i'll still watch.",

Like most people who mistakenly watched this movie, I am a big fan of Donnie Darko. My best friend is, too, and that's how this story began. Someone happened to buy this for her as a gift, so she came over and we popped it into my DVD player. 30 minutes later, the two of us were in car-crash-mode (you know you shouldn't be sitting there just watching, you should be doing something about the horror you've just witnessed, but for the life of you, you just can't look away). However, I broke the spell and found the one way to make this train-wreck a good movie. I call it: The S. Darko Drinking Game. Firstly, you need a little bit before you start (we took a couple drinks and started the movie all over again). The important rule about the game is that the rules must always be flexible. We began with \"Take a drink every time you remember this is a bad movie\". Then we added \"...and every time the pretty boy from Gossip Girl poses for the camera\" (because seriously, he does). And \"...and every time the sorta/kinda pretty boy from Twilight scratches/shows that ugly rash\". You can probably guess how it went from there. It became a funny movie after a while. I even laughed when Samantha died (the second time). Then again, I could've been just so happy that the movie should finally be ending. All in all, I enjoyed the movie...to a degree. However, not even I have worked up enough courage to try it again. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone. Not even the actors.",

I liked how they cast the original Samantha Darko to reprise her role. I found it laughable, however, that they cast Ed Westwick from Gossip Girl. He is comically ridiculous. Jackson Rathbone did a good job as the \"geek with a dark side\". I was also satisfied with Briana Evigan's role of the somewhat bitchy, but ultimately loyal friend. Overall, it's not a perfect movie, but if you look past the wanna-be sequel title it claims, it's NOT as bad as everyone says it is.",
