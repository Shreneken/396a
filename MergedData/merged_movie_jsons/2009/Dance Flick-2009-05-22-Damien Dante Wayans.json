            "content": "With the recent disappointments that have been in the spoof movie genre, we needed something fresh and funny, well we're not getting that obviously. But ever since the Friedberg/Seltzer team has joined in the \"I can make a movie too\" bandwagon, we were begging the Waynes Brothers to come back. The last really funny spoof movies are the Scary Movie series, they were clever and in our faces about the clich\u00e9s in horror movies. The past few years we have had a major thing with dance movies like: Save the Last Dance, Step Up, Stomp the Yard, You Got Served, Honey, etc. Leave it to the Wayanes Brothers to finally put this genre in it's over clich\u00e9d and overused scripts in it's place. Unfortunately Dance Flick did not meet my expectations, it was one of those movies that used all the funny clips in the trailer. I can't even believe how many problems there was with this movie, wither it's the editing, acting, or direction, Dance Flick is a let down.Megan is a former dancer who goes to a new school where everyone can magically sing and dance. She meets some new friends like Tracy, Charity and Thomas who is in a street dance gang. When Thomas and Megan connect they must face their \"impossible\" dreams together. Trying to \"bring it\", they work together to bring the ultimate dance group together. They also must face the difficulty of having a inter-racial relationship, as black women and white men passing them by, they try to pretend their love isn't real. But will they put all aside to help Thomas and his crew win the five grand to pay back his sponsor? Well, if you've see the \"dance flicks\" of the past decade, you know how it goes.Now for some odd reason I did get a few laughs out of a stupid movie like Meet the Spartans, but that was because I kept my expectations low and knew what I was going into. With Dance Flick it was completely different, I was really excited because we have a really funny team working on the film. But they relied too much on the gross jokes, instead of getting a laugh from them, they keep pushing on the gross jokes too much on the audience and it just didn't work. The actors seemed to force their comedy too much as well where they were just not funny. The movie was also, like most spoof movies, was way too short as well, the stories didn't make sense and were just too random. I'm sorry to say that Dance Flick is just a bad movie, it has a couple giggles here and there, but the audience was silent throughout most of the film. I'd say to skip the movie, if you really want to see it, go for the rental.2/10",

            "content": "(Synopsis) Megan (Shoshanna Bush) has a dream of going to Juilliard and becoming a dancer. While she is performing at her dance audition, her mother is tragically killed in an auto accident. Megan must move to another city to her destitute father's apartment which is located in a condemned building. She enrolls in Musical High School, an inner city high school. Since her mother's death, Megan has given up dancing. Megan meets some new friends at the school like Tracy (Chelsea Makela), Charity (Essence Atkins), and Thomas (Damon Wayans Jr.) who dance in a street dance gang. Thomas and Megan connect, and they must face their impossible dance dream together. They try to bring the ultimate dance crew together to win $5,000 at the local dance contest.(My Comment) The funny and inventive Wayans Brothers made this spoof movie, yet it was not as funny as the TV movie trailers would imply. This is one of those movies that used all the funny clips in the trailer. If you go in thinking it will be a funny movie, it will disappoint you. There are so many problems with the acting, script, editing, and direction. Unfortunately, Dance Flick did not meet my expectations. I did laugh at many of the scenes, but the few laughs that I did have, weren't enough. At least the movie was short. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, so save your money and see something else. (Paramount Pictures, Run Time 1:23, Rated PG-13)(2/10)",

            "content": "Nearly incoherent mess from the Wayans brothers basically parodies every dance-themed film of recent memory and even takes stabs at other pop culture features like \"Twilight\" as well. Vignettes add up fast and furiously with no one in the cast making much of an impression and the film almost feeling like it had two dozen different directors and screenwriters (and none with a good cinematic idea). As good as \"Airplane!\" and \"The Naked Gun\" were in the 1980s, \"Dance Flick\" and others of the type are that awful in the 2000s. Do whatever moves necessary to avoid this horror of a movie which accomplishes nothing except stealing the audience's time, energy, and money. Gobble, gobble. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).",

            "content": "\"Dance Flick\" is the latest in a long line of \"Airplane\"-spawned movie parodies, this one a product of the formidable spoof-industry mavens, the Wayans Brothers. Like most such films, \"Dance Flick\" is a goofy, genial and instantly forgettable comedy that takes on such recent hits as \"Step Up 2 the Streets\" and \"Hairspray\" as well as more dated works such as \"Flashdance\" and even \"Singin' in the Rain.\" As with all these scattershot send-ups, the movie defies the rules of logic and physics as it pokes fun at the accoutrements and style of hip hop music and culture.Damon Wayans, Jr. plays the not-so-streetwise hood who falls for Shoshana Bush, a lame-assed white chick from the suburbs who wants to make it to Julliard but has to overcome the trauma of losing her mother in a car crash on the day of her audition. The amusing Essence Atkins costars as Shoshana's sassy best friend, Charity, with Shawn Wayans appearing as Charity's baby daddy.It would be easy to feel superior to a film like \"Dance Flick\" - as most viewers clearly do - but a good part of it is actually pretty funny.",

I am happy to say Dance Flick is a hilariously nasty spoof of the Step Up movies, You Got Served, Stomp The Yard, Feel The Noise, and How She Move. I wasn't doubting that this was gonna be funny, it just wasn't a very good chance. The secret behind this and the first two Scart Movie's success (I do like the other two Scary Movies quite a bit, though) is the Wayans brothers. They now how to perfectly write, direct, and star in a comedy. There's still the same gross-out jokes, but for every gross out joke there's at least 2 huge laughs. The story is basically a huge parody of Step Up. City girl moves to a school, and forms her own dance crew. Only here, they make fun of it. Yes, we do get a hairy chest shot of her, pooping jokes, and snot running down people's noses, but unlike Disasater Movie or Date Movie, that's not the only thing here. There's also a lot of funny and cleverly done jokes laughing in the faces of these dance movies. If there's nothing better than paying eight dollars for a ticket to get a good amount of huge laughs, then I don't want to know what you should pay eight dollars to do.",

The scenes where Brandy and Halle Berry hit the mom can never be duplicated. Kim Wayan's almost walk on role was funny. Marlon Wayans is still a cornball. Shawn Wayans is still a player. However, it was very disrespectful to poke fun of the late Ray Charles. I hope his estate sues the Wayans family.",

            "review_title": "A Comic Cakewalk!",
            "content": "The Wayans clan, who made the first two \"Scary Movie\" spoofs, show no mercy with their latest parody \"Dance Flick,\" an uproariously crude, lewd, and rude roasting of dance movies. Specifically, \"Dance Flick\" pokes fun at \"Fame,\" \"Save the Last Dance,\" \"Drumline,\" \"Hairspray,\" \"Center Stage,\" \"Step Up,\" \"Roll, Bounce,\" \"Stomp the Yard,\" \"Step Up,\" \"Step Up 2 the Streets,\" and the \"High School Musical\" movies. \"Dance Flick\" ranks as the best parody movie since \"Superhero Movie\" (2008). Moreover, the Wayans have ripped into some classics, such as \"West Side Story\" and \"Singing in the Rain.\" Indeed, the fun of most parodies is spotting the movie being jeered first and hoping second that you'll cheer the jeers. Even if you loved the movie getting mocked, a good parody can make you appreciate your favorite movie more because it pays tribute to it.Not nearly as scatological as the first two \"Scary Movies,\" \"Dance Flick\" relies on the usual hilarious sight gags that the Wayans deploy throughout their derivative, often lowest-common-denominator, plot to skewer the conventions and clich\u00e9s of those terpsichorean tales. Unless you've seen the aforementioned films, you may not be laughing when others are roaring. Sometimes, the Wayans insert some pungent political satire into this brisk 83 minute epic, but it doesn't distract from the overall antics. You rarely have enough time to read all the whacky wall signs plastered in every shot because the film flies by so quickly.After her mom dies in a tragic auto accident rushing to her daughter's Juilliard dance audition, Megan (Shoshana Bush of \"Fired Up\") relocates to the big city to live with her destitute father (Chris Elliot of \"Cabin Boy\") in his condemned apartment. Like everything else in the audacious \"Dance Flick,\" the demise of Megan's mother is played strictly for laughs. In fact, she escapes from her wrecked vehicle, only to be struck by a car with a Lindsay vanity license tag. Another vehicle with a Brandy vanity tag hits her. Finally, a third vehicle with a Halle vanity tag strikes her. Appropriately enough, a black female dressed as Cat Woman flees from the accident. After Halle hits her, Megan's poor mom flies through the air and lands in her freshly dug grave.Meanwhile, Megan enrolls in an inner city high school, Musical High School. She meets Thomas (Damon Wayans Jr.) and they become an item. Megan has shunned dancing since her mom's death. Eventually, Thomas persuades her to take up hip-hop dancing. Later, on their first big date, Thomas takes her to the ballet. Megan is shocked. The ballet recreates the events that culminated in her mom's death involving a stalled gasoline tanker truck along with those reckless celebrity drivers with vanity tags.Aside from Thomas, Megan meets a variety of oddballs at Musical High. The first day at lunch in the cafeteria, the entire student body improvises the song & dance routine from the movie \"Fame\" where everybody plays a musical instrument, including a blind kid named Ray (George Gore II) who displays his piano skills. The \"Fame\" lyrics has been changed to something considerably more salacious as well as silly. Megan's ghetto hall locker neighbor is Charity (Essence Atkins of \"How High\") and Charity hauls her infant son to school everyday and hangs him in her locker while she attends classes. Charity's brother turns out to be none other than Thomas. In another \"Save the Last Dance\" scene, Charity reprimands Megan for her interracial romance with Thomas because African-American gals are running out of their own race to date.Imagine the usual line-up of characters in teen dance musicals. Each has a counterpart in \"Dance Flick,\" right down to the pairing an obese \"Hairspray\" type girl and her dream boy jock who would rather play Juliet in \"Romeo & Juliet\" than dribble for his father's high school basketball team. Megan gapes when she meets her dance class instructor, Ms. Camelto\u00e9 (Amy Sedaris of \"Bewitched\"), who lives up to her descriptive surname. Meanwhile, Thomas and his main man, A-Con (Affion Crockett of \"Soul Men\"), have their own troubles. A-Con is a street hoodlum with no ambition, but Thomas aspires to be a gynecologist. Thomas dreams of attending Jus Community College. They have a dance crew that participates regularly in street dance competitions. They have lost $5-thousand during their last street dance contest. Now, they owe the five grand to a local gangsta, Sugar Bear (David Allen Grier of \"An American Carol\"), and he demands his dough. Sugar Bear resembles Jabba the Hutt of \"Star Wars\" and cannot consume enough candy, pies, and sugary treats.Primarily, director Damien Wayans has taken \"Save the Last Dance\" and crossed it with \"Step Up 2 The Streets,\" adding characters from other movies like \"Hairspray,\" \"Ray,\" and \"Fame.\" For instance, an obese girl like Tracy from \"Hairspray\" attends the school and the basketball coach has a son who resembles Zac Efron from \"High School Musical.\" Grier is riotous in an obvious fat suit as a Sugar Bear and Chris Elliott plays Megan's sordid, low-life father. Naturally, the entire Wayans clan gets in on the action. Shawn plays Charity's baby's daddy. Shawn has several amusing scenes. Marlon is the most outrageous as an idiotic drama teacher who has made only one movie. He played a slave in a \"Mandingo\" plantation movie where he cut his leg off. Keenen Ivory plays a street dance promoter Mr. Stache with the whitest fake teeth you've ever seen.The Wayans have been masters at politically incorrect parodies since their Fox-TV series \"In Living Color,\" and they ridicule stereotypes mercilessly here for maximum merriment. They rag straight people, gay people, black people, white people, and drunken celebrities. When A-Con tells Thomas that he cannot become a doctor because he has guns for hands, he displays his gun hands and calls himself Edward Triggerfingers after the Johnny Depp movie \"Edward Scissorhands.\" Altogether, \"Dance Flick\" is a comic cakewalk!",

My friend and I were both able to agree that it was is probably the worst movie we have ever seen.

Some jokes just didn't make any sense whatsoever, and were disgusting. In short, the movie left much to be desired.",

            "content": "If you look at IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list, you might notice that there are a lot of parody films on the list...all made during the last decade or two. It seems that a lot of lazy filmmakers have found that such movies are popular...althought they are extremely stupid and poorly made. An unusual parody film is \"Dance Flick\"....because it parodies another Bottom 100 film, 2004's \"You Got Served\" (#75)...though there is precident, as the \"50 Shades\" and its parody are both also on this list.Like the other parody movies, \"Dance Flick\" ostensibly parodies one particular film or style of film but its jokes are very broad and they attempt to parody a variety of films and pop culture. Like these films, the misses outnumber the funny jokes. And, many of the misses are generally crude and disgusting.\"Dance Flick\" is a Wayons project, with seven members of this acting family appearing in the movie or in behind the camera. This isn't so surprising, as a few of the Wayons' other films have been on this list over the years. What is surprising is that like \"You Got Served\", the movie isn't that bad and probably should not be on the Bottom 100 List.The story, oddly, is a hip-hop film whose star is a very white girl, Megan, who moves to the inner city and finds friends among the local teens. She is an orphan and ex-dancer who soon falls for Thomas...a guy who loves hip-hop and introduces her to the culture.On the plus side, although the film has many misses and many of the jokes are crude, there also many hits...genuinely funny skits that made me laugh...such as the scene involving the leg, the \"Fame\" song as well as the bizarro ballet Thomas takes Megan to see. Along the way, you see them parody a variety of films...some of which must have gone over the heads of the audience, as they were references to 1980s films....and most folks who like these parody films are teens and young adults who likely never saw films like \"Fame\" and \"Flashdance\". On the negative side, I am sure the script would offend many, as it tends to reinforce some negative black and gay stereotypes...so politically correct folks should think twice about seeing this one. It also is a crude and stupid film nearly as often as a clever one...so it's not like I am heartily endorsing the picture...just pointing out that it's watchable and not especially terrible...as its inclusion on the Bottom 100 would seem to indicate.",

            "content": "I can't believe the creators of this movie think they have the right to actually diss \"Employee of the Month\"(2006) which I admit was not a good film, but I was just astounded. Now I will admit the movie did give me a few chuckles, but that is cause of how stupid the parodies in this is, but few of the parodies was a bit entertaining since I got most of it. I sometimes enjoy stupid comedies but the stupidity of this movie was just too much to the point it just gave me a bit of a head ache. The story is retarded and very simple, a girl named Megan who does ballet meets up with some wannabe break dancer Thomas(Damon Wayans, Jr). And they get some wacky romance going, with a bunch of stupid crude jokes thrown in to lengthen the run time which would actually have been a very short movie without it. The thing about the jokes in this movie despite it being not funny, is just way too drawn out. It just seems they went to great efforts to throw in unfunny jokes. If your someone who seen a lot of movies and get the parodies will find some of it to be very slightly amusing. But if you don't get what they are doing parodies of, you just won't get the dumb joke, because it's a inside joke for the people that has seen the movie they are trying to do parodies of and it's even a lousy attempt at that. And there is a heck load of parodies thrown in from a heck load of movies. It's just obvious the Wayans brothers was just trying to cash in, because they basically used the best bits for the trailer which wasn't even funny, so if you seen the trailer there really isn't a point to seeing this movie. This movie just makes black people look bad, in my opinion. The jokes are just vulgar and messed up while trying to go in the shock humor direction while trying to entertain the audience with the suffering of some of the characters in the movie. Which is fine if it was funny but that is not the case and it just feels like it's you that is being tormented. I must say they must have either payed the lead actress a lot of money for this role or she was just desperate for fame. The film is racist and sexist, and like I said is fine by me if it is funny, but it just isn't. This is one of those comedies where everyone is obnoxious and semi-retarded and I seen this types of comedies do quite well if they go in the right direction. But \"Dance Flick\" is just a jumbled mess and when the film is finished you start to wonder what just happened, because of the stupidity. And I ain't one of those critics that think they are more intelligent and superior to everyone else and go around bashing on dumb comedies that are actually quite entertaining for not being smart. But this film deserves to be bashed on. But like I said, if you get the parodies of other films which is strung up very randomly for laughs you might find it slightly amusing and will survive through it.3/10",

The gay guy, I think his name is James, provides some pretty great humor. The whole \"Fame\" song he does is pretty great.

The dance move stunts are surprisingly well done and there is something I really like about Sugarbear or whatever the fat guy's name is. Overall, a decent source of goofball comedy and toilet humor. As is expected, Thomas wins the dance battle and gets the girl at the end. The jokes just keep on coming though. Not every gag made me laugh but one thing I have to say about this movie is that there are tons and tons of gags. This movie probably has as many gags as Airplane.",

The acting was bad all in the film, mostly by the lead character Megan, and Thomas. His facial expressions were weird and he was over the top too much. But its a Wayans film, acting isn't always that great in their films. The plot is spoofed from Step Up 2: The Streets. About a girl Megan who wants to live her dream to become a dancer so she moves to another school. This happens when her mother passes away. Many spoofs in this film were unnecessary and just plain unfunny like the spoof of Ray Charles from \"Ray\", \"Fame\", and others. Spoofing Ray Charles was a surprise because \"Ray\" isn't a dance movie, and this movie is called Dance Flick. They also spoofed \"Twilight\" at the very ending. I didn't laugh at anything except a few chuckles. And like others have said, many of the funny scenes were in the trailers. One funny scene was towards the end with the final \"you got served\" dance scene with the fat guy dancing. Also credit to Shawn Wayans character and Affion Crockett (A-con), he was pretty funny.

            "content": "There is one thing in film that I can't stand especially in the last new millennium is the spoof genre. The ridiculous, over the top, disgusting humor that forces jokes into a tired story by making fun of various types of movies that don't deserve being made fun of. Scary Movie brought stupidity to a whole new level. The quality of films in the spoof genre shrank to the worse level of stupidity after the nineties leaving behind the Naked Gun films, Airplane and classics like that. All this being said imagine my shock when Dance Flick actually turned in a reasonably less stupid, and actually funny (even if it was guilty pleasure laughing) with a decent story no matter how silly it might be. The films they poke fun at actually work into their story and they use the teen dance flick \"Save The Last Dance\" as the basis of their story and that works too. The cast really meld well together and the toilet humor is in full swing which is almost a given with this type of movie, in some ways it always has been. But repeatedly I found myself laughing and shaking my head at the pure silliness but yet still entertaining me so bravo to them.Relative newcomer Shoshana Bush leads the cast as dancing hopeful and awkward clutz Megan. In true comedienne style Bush uses physical comedy and terrific facial expressions to really bring home the laughs. She likely has a promising career in comedy if she gets out of this spoof genre because as okay as this movie is...it's not likely to get her anywhere. Damon Wayans Jr. continues the Wayan's shaky ground career in spoof movies, lord knows the Scary Movie films were enough to make me never watch a spoof movie again. However Wayans Jr. does a decent job of not overdoing the slapstick comedy, a mistake his father made on numerous occasions. Wayans Jr. And Bush are kind of cute together but then don't have a lot of chemistry. Essence Atkins plays Wayans Jr's sister Charity and she is hilarious. Her over the top performance really stands out in this cast and she is ridiculously funny. Veteran young actor Affion Crockett is also good, very funny, and not overused as the best friend A-Con.If I sound like I'm talking this movie up like it's a must see treat of the year then let me back pedal. I still hate spoof movies and if I could go back in time I probably would have saved the Microsoft points (I rented it on Xbox 360) and not paid money or currency for this. That being said if you stumble onto it via cable or someone else rents it and forces you to watch it then you won't be at a complete loss of an hour and a half or less. Fortunately like many spoof films it has a mercifully short run time. The ridiculousness will make you smile despite yourself and the cast is decent enough to make it work. So if you can lower your intelligence or if you actually enjoy parody/spoof movies then this one is at least redeemable and that is saying something. 6/10",

I knew going in that it was going to be a very silly movie but from the previews - it still looked funny. Sadly, it was not funny at all. This is very disappointing considering the actors in the movie. It was also directed by Damien Wayans who I've always thought was a funny guy. This movie gets a big THUMBS DOWN! Some parts of the movie actually made fun of Ray Charles which I didn't understand at all. That was not funny! Why would they make fun of him in a movie that is supposed to make jokes about other dance movies? Do yourself and favor and don't bother! This was a total waste of money!!!",

            "content": "When I first saw the preview for this one, I found myself hoping against hope that the family that brought us I'm Gonna Get You, Sucka and In Living Color would step up to offer us a funny movie after White Chicks and Little Man. Honestly, I never bothered to watch those films, as the trailers were so screamingly unfunny to me.And now I find myself horrified at the average rating of 3.3 out of ten on IMDb(as of opening weekend) for Dance Flick, which I consider a loooong awaited return to form for Keenan Ivory Wayans, and a revelation of the rebirth of that satirical spark from the earliest days of In Living Color. In fact, Dance Flick even tops all modern attempts at satire by Zucker proteges Friedberg and Seltzer (Disaster Movie,Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie, Date Movie) and even David Zucker himself (though, curiously, it seemed to me that Shawn and Marlon Wayans were in his orbit for an over decade long meltdown, including his involvement in the Scary Movie series and, finally, last year's unfunny and politically confused An American Carol).Here's reason # 1 why Dance Flick tops it: it shows every sign that it was made by adults who actually watched the movies they're lampooning in their entireity (Gasp! Imagine that!). It's not surprising to me that a number of the more negative reviews on here ignore jokes based on movies like Little Miss Sunshine or Twilight, since those gags seemed to have been written by people who sat and watched more than the trailers for those films.Reason #2: A good cast given a chance to shine. David Alan Grier's Showgirls parody was a great use of DAG's singing talents. Yes, he had to act through a fat suit for most of this film (ala Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy), but his performance so made up for his participation in Zucker's Carol.Essence Atkins is hilarious as Charity, the student mom who hangs her baby carrier up in her locker, baby intact, telling the waif to \"breathe through the vents.\"Shoshanna Bush plays Megan White, who makes a bizarre choice for her Julliard audition, and whose mom seems on the edge of a \"tragic\" fate (in one of the funnier sequences in the film).Damon Wayans, Jr., however, is a revelation as a chip off a really funny block. He plays Thomas Uncles (if you can't sit well with that joke, please go rent I'm Gonna Get You Sucka and then we'll talk), a young dancer in a street crew who's also a starry-eyed med school hopeful in what's described as a \"Cosby sweater.\" Damon Jr. shows acting and humor chops equal to any in the previous generation of Wayans, and hopefully gets the chance to work on something at least this funny again.Reason # 3: The director. Damien Dante Wayans demonstrates the difference between throwing a grab bag of lame material at the screen versus an attempt at layers of jokes.Reason # 4: Continuity. This film, finally, feels like a product produced by people responsible for Hollywood Shuffle and I'm Gonna Get You Sucka. I'd gladly watch this film again, right alongside the previous two. Each of the films take out the satirical knives to point out the silliness inherent in a lot of pop cinema, but with affection.Reason # 5: The jokes are funny. The movie is chock-a-block with well-timed gags, right down to the set decoration and costuming. Yes, there is evidence of jokes about Hairspray and Ray that are barely used, and the film is far from perfect. But the difference is in the funny. This is, and is so worth your time.",

I don't really see the point since anyone who's seen any of the films spoofed would agree that many are actually pretty funny in their own right. The plot follows the usual \"kids needing to dance ending up in make or break competition while finding romance along the way\" rut. The problem is that the plot is so terribly clich\u00e9d that there really is no need to watch since you know whats going to happen.(yes I know its a spoof but its lacking any sort of creativity or effort beyond the obvious so it becomes painful going) For better or worse some of the jokes are funny, but they usually come at the end of much too long a set up. As it is I've wasted too many words on the lousy film in order to get over the minimum length. My best advice is avoid this.",

            "content": "Not another movie spoof? Movie parodies are something of a hit and miss affair, with most of the recent movie spoofs (Meet The Spartans, Date Movie, Epic Movie, etc) missing the mark. As the creators of the original Scary Movie, Keenen Ivory, Marlon and Shawn Wayans have hit the mark with more accuracy though, as their parodies have been characterised by more wit and an appreciation for the subtlety required by the genre. As the title of their latest movie suggests Dance Flick is a send up of the whole dance oriented movie genre, targeting everything from Fame and Flashdance right up to more recent films like Step Up, Centre Stage and Stomp The Yard. But the film also includes spoofs of Hairspray and the whole High School Musical franchise. Most of these dance-themed flicks have followed a fairly predictable formula and have been fairly clich\u00e9-ridden, so the targets are pretty obvious. You can virtually tick off all the parodies as they parade before your eyes. There are quite a few laughs to be found throughout the scattergun approach, but there are also many more moments that fall flat. What passes for a plot centres around the relationship that develops between Thomas (Damon Wayans Jr), a street dancer, and Megan (Shoshana Bush), a classically trained dancer when they meet at a talent school. Thomas is involved in \"street battles\" and desperately needs to win an up and coming competition to pay back money he owes. Dance Flick has been co-written by siblings Marlon, Keenen Ivory and Shawn Wayans, who have been the creative mainstays of their films over the years. But the film introduces a whole new generation of Wayans into the film-making fold, both behind the camera and as on-screen talent. Making his directorial debut is their nephew Damien Dante Wayans, who has worked on TV series such as My Wife And Kids, and it is obvious that he shares his uncles' comic sensibilities and appreciation of cheap sight gags. Dance Flick will appeal to fans who love this sort of low brow humour.",

The trailers didn't convey whatsoever the degradation celebrated in this trashy film.I enjoyed \"Something about Mary\", love Monty Python, Fawlty Towers, and Hot Fuzz etc. Assuming you can look past the tired, sophomoric attempts at pornographic humor, the not-so-funny gratuitous violence, \"Dance Flick\" simply is not funny and it certainly isn't intelligent.Seems that we are not alone in our assessment of this terrible movie. We spoke to the manager after walking out, he agreed with us, apologized, and gave us compensation for our movie tickets. This movie shouldn't be rated PG-13; I recommend a rating of R.

The young male lead did a good job, I will have to say though. I didn't recognize him as someone I had seen in movies before, but then I realized that he was one of the Wayans men as well. This movie was definitely better than the disastrous \"Superhero Movie\" and all of the other recent spoof films but didn't live up to the potential that it really could have had.

The plot is nonsense, a mishmosh of elements that no one takes seriously, and that's acceptable; but then why treat the other two elements with equal contempt?",

There have been some surprisingly good spoofs such as High Anxiety, but the Friedberg-Seltzer movies are all a waste of time with terrible acting and lowbrow humour. So I watched Dance Flick, and while it was actually better than I expected, I was expecting it to be utter crap you see, it wasn't particularly good either.Dance Flick does have its moments though. The choreography does sparkle a lot more than it doesn't, and there are one or two appealing performances, especially Essence Atkins's terrific comic turn and Shoshana Bush's cute as a button Megan. Plus Damon Wayans Jnr is pretty likable. The film is quite short and does move briskly, and I enjoyed spotting the references to Fame and High School Musical, some of which were done in a smart manner.However, there are some failures. The film does start off on the wrong foot unfortunately, thank goodness it does pick up. The story is also rather thin, and the script relies too much on bad taste and gross humour than genuinely hilarious and sophisticated humour. I am especially talking about Amy Sedaris as the aptly named dance teacher Mrs Cameltoe here. The direction is perhaps a little too smug and the editing is choppy on occasions. Although it does have many problems, Dance Flick is definitely not as bad as Disaster Movie or Epic Movie, and is moderately entertaining thanks to some spirited choreography and performances but is deeply flawed due to its thin story. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

It actually didn't step up 2 anything.After watching this movie (and about every other spoof comedy out there), I was wondering, why it isn't possible to capture the essence, the jokes, the creativity of the Zucker comedies? They look they masterpieces compared to recent \"comedies\" (well, they are, but you get my point, hopefully).If one of the best jokes is \"Came to pick up my son\" (if you laugh at that, you might enjoy the movie, more than most people, although I giggled at that and didn't like it), you know you're in for something really bad. The spoof movies nowadays, are more like a Saturday Night Live show. Some sketches, but nothing really coherent. Not to mention the fact, that most people in here, either can't act or did a very good job convincing you, that they actually can't act! One other reason is, the Zucker guys always said, how much they loved the movies they spoofed. I don't get that feeling from those new movies. Most of the jokes just are mean and would work better without a \"movie\" surrounding them (I think they would work as videos on the internet, on special comedy sites, that have such videos).

            "content": "Megan (Bush) moves away from her troubled home life to pursue her career in dancing, all the while adjusting to her new life and preparing for the biggest dance battle in history The comedy genre has hit a slump over the past decade, particularly with spoof related genres, evident when watching Disaster Movie, Scary Movies etc. So the premise doesn't look too wonderful when seeing the trailer for Dance Flick, which epitomizes the use of slapstick in identifying the underlying nature of High School Musical and Step Up 2.But having an open mind and a friend who can get me in the cinema for free, I politely agreed to view this Wayans picture with him and in all honesty, we knew this would be awful, but oddly despite the degrading nature of the plot, the terrible slapstick and the degrading humour of character representation, it is by no means the worst spoof you will ever view.The plot is a gimmick of Step Up 2 the streets, taking into account the central character Megan moving away from home to pursue a career in dancing before getting involved in the underground scene. Having watched that 2007 release seeing the comparisons here were fairly accurate, bar the awful humour. In fairness, Dance Flick depicts the nature of Step Up 2 quite well. However this doesn't stop viewers from being sickened once more by an awful array of disgusting jokes.Evident with Disaster Movie amongst other spoofs, we are delivered humour around physical appearance and abnormality and sick acts, and this picture is no different. From the gangster leader's weight problems to hanging a baby in a school locker, this is silly waffle, a film made for pure attack on modern well intended films. Perhaps 10 years ago it may have been humorous, but now with the plot so carbon copy of another we can see the punch lines coming, and this predictability weighs the suspense and intrigue down and with that comes a formula of boredom when annoyance sets in.Performances wise none of the main actors really generate enough capability to even carry out some of the physical comedy. Megan's expression when kicking everyone when dancing is ridiculous, whilst Thomas is stone faced from start to finish.If there are any other positives then they lie with the director and choreographer for making the last dance battle well staged, even if the fat gangster stereotype ruins it with the jump and squish move.The inclusion of some dance and sing sequences is a step away from the norm, but are very cringe worthy, especially the high school musical Tony moment about his true orientation.At the end of the day Dance Flick is your basic normal unfunny spoof that is only different from other recent spoofs by choosing different films to target. It isn't the worst film you will ever see, but nor is it the best.",

            "content": "One wonders about the appeal of parody movies, taking genres that happen to be the flavour of the moment, and then adding doses of comedic spoofs into something of an abomination of a film, very much like a patchwork Frankenstein brought to life by the need to make fun of everything. While I could have swore off such films with the likes of the very unbelievably bad film Meet the Spartans, somehow the need to laugh after a rigorous in- camp training, and wanting to give the Wayan brothers a chance as I've enjoyed their Scary Movie spoof, brought me to their Dance Flick.The Wayan clan banded together to make the film, finding their blood relations from acting and directing right down to coming up with the story and producing it. At times I wonder just how one can find the funds for these kinds of films, especially when recent outputs like Superhero Movie and Disaster Movie were really, really bad, and when you read of people conscientiously wanting to avoid such films so that they result in poor box office, and will never get made again. Unless of course there are so many people out there who are just craving for laughter, of any kind.There's no prize for guessing the films that the Wayans had decided to spoof. With the recent dance flicks like Step Up, Step Up 2 the Streets, and musicals such as Fame, Hairspray and High School Musical, there's no lack of source material to base the spoofs on, which extends its reach to films such as Black Snake Moan even. The art is of course to try and piece everything together for some semblance of a storyline in order for it to work.The liberal application of lazy narrative glue comes in the form of borrowing the backbone from the Step Up movies, where you have a wannabe dancer Megan enrolling herself to school to master her craft and find confidence to dance again, while street dancer Thomas (Damon Wayans Jr) finds a common romantic bond with her. One needs to dance to fulfill her life's ambition, while the other just needs to repay his debts after his street dance circuit attempt with his crew resulted in tragedy (of the comedic sorts).That basically sums up the story, as very random scenes get strung together played just for laughs. You can guess the quality of such scenes from the get go, where toilet humour was the first off the blocks, and set the stage for many more to come. with political correctness getting thrown out of the window in expected terms. One wonders too about the license that the Wayans have in telling many racists jokes about their own race, and also the many celebrity jibes from Britney to Halle to Lindsay that find their way into the scenes through many one liners. Sexual innuendos, and at times very in-your-face explicit display of sexual organs become part and parcel of the shock-and-awe strategy to elicit cheap laughter as well.If you're seriously game for some laughs no matter what the quality is, or probably can laugh at anything the Wayans throw on screen, then you'll survive Dance Flick. If you prefer your humour to be witty, then this is obviously not the comedic film for you.",

It's either they're all obsessed with vulgarity or they've all been done better before. This latest offering from the Wayans brothers, sending up all the recent smattering of dance movies from Save the Last Dance to the remake of Fame, is sort of a mix of both, especially if you compare it to their brilliant Scary Movie films. They're certainly very thorough, sending up every pop culture about in films at the moment, including, for instance, David Hasselhoff's drunken camcorder ramblings, but a good laugh is had once every blue moon. Sadly, instead of managing a steady rhythm, this send up has two left feet. **",

While she is performing at her dance audition, her mother is tragically killed in an auto accident. Megan must move to another city to her destitute father's apartment which is located in a condemned building. She enrolls in Musical High, an inner city high school. Since her mother's death, Megan has given up dancing. Megan meets some new friends at the school like Tracy (Chelsea Makela), Charity (Essence Atkins), and Thomas (Damon Wayans Jr.) who dance in a street dance gang. Thomas and Megan connect, and they must face their impossible dance dream together. They try to bring the ultimate dance crew together to win $5,000 at the local dance contest. - Douglas Young (the-movie-guy) This movie was fun, but not as funny as the trailer. How is this possible? I can remember the 30 seconds of funny much better than I can remember the 83 minutes of funny, that's how. Although, this is by far one of the funnier Wayans Productions I've seen (yet), I still wouldn't want go to pay for this movie in the theater and probably will not watch the movie again. There are quite a few movies Dance Flick imitates or parodies, I guessed 5, but here's a cheat list if you don't recognize some of the scenes: 1. Save The Last Dance 2. Stomp The Yard 3. Step Up 4. Flashdance 5. Step Up 2 The Streets 6. Hairspray 7. Dirty Dancing (cut from final print) 8. Mamma Mia! (cut from final print, can be briefly seen in international trailer) 9. Little Miss Sunshine 10.

Directed by Damien Wayans with special effects that sometimes work and sometimes don't. Story is none existent. It's just a series of sight jokes with a cast that are helpless to improve it. Wayans proves to know the genre but he fails to provide a story to employ that knowledge. Shoshana Bush plays the white girl hoping to bust into dancing. She is coached by a black dancer, which leads to obvious romance and much finger pointing. Essence Atkins plays her best friend who brings her baby about in a backpack then stuff him in a locker. Damon Wayans plays Atkins' brother who teaches Bush dance moves. Christina Murphy plays the snide top dancer in a role that has been played and parodied so many times that the role must have highlight notes on every script it ever appears in. David Alan Grier plays a character named Sugar Bear and one can expect that this isn't the cartoon bear from the breakfast cereal. It sets out to make fun of High School Musical and any other musical made within the previous thirty years. At times very funny such as the scene where a father stops by to \"pick up his son\" but ultimately it is just a tired retread of dance movie clich\u00e9s that were long since forgotten.

A collage of goofs, spoofs, jokey jokes, fart jokes, barf jokes without a added side helping of more subtle humour. This time around the hapless target is the onslaught of dance movies initiated by various idiotic TV competitions. Various movies (not only purely dance blockbusters) are naturally winked at including \"You got game\", \"Hair\", \"save the Last Dance\", \"Ray\" or even the Twilight series.The plot as thin as it is focuses around the characters of Megan (the beautiful Shoshana Bush) and Thomas (Damon Wayans Jr). But given this is really a cascade of wink-winks it truly is hard to piece together a coherent recap of the story.Nonetheless the movie comes with no surprises. Whoever liked the previous Wayan movies (apparently quite a reasonable amount given the Wayans are still making these movies and apparently with a rather sizeable budget) will come out satisfied with this outing, as the humour is unchanged and keeps . Actually the way the Wayans try to joke is so predictable and repetitive it seems that the newest 'flick movie' made by the brothers should be the \"Flick Flick\", which basically pokes fun at their own genre and its audacious lack of innovation.",

Not only does such a crass generalization border on the self-reverential, but is should be nipped in the bud before Wayanism develops into a tax-exempt Hollywood religion along the lines of Scientology. In America, if someone who's on TV every day like Oprah says something is funny, 90 per cent of people will laugh (or buy the \"funny\" product) so they won't feel left out or stupid. Well, hey, it's time for someone to point out that most of the Wayan's on-screen jokes have fallen flat for at least a decade, and DANCE FLICK does nothing to reverse the downward trend. I cannot dispute that the Wayans may actually believe other Wayans are funny. Heck, the Wayans might actually BE funnier in private than they are when mixed in with the other 874 non-Wayans listed here under DANCE FLICK's \"full cast and crew\" heading. About 95 per cent of DANCE FLICK's humor is contained in the theatrical trailer, and the other 5 per cent is definitely NOT worth 10 bucks. Maybe \"white men can't jump,\" but let's at least see if the Baldwin or Culkin clans could elicit more sincere laughter with a fresher non-urban satire (for instance, a spoof of desperate suburbanites flicks such as AMER!CAN BEAUTY, BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD, and REVOLUTIONARY ROAD).",

            "content": "As a fan of the Wayans Brothers but not a fan of dance films, I didn't know what to really expect from Dance Flick.\n\nAlthough parody movies are often very stupid, since Dance Flick is a parody of a genre which is already ridiculously stupid, it has a lot of comedic potential, as well as the fact that it has major participation from the Wayans Brothers who are some of the funniest people to have happened to spoof humour in a long time. But despite their best efforts, Dance Flick eventually succumbs to its wounds and falls into the same bland and humourless territory that many other spoof films do these days.\nDance Flick has a very funny opening scene due to capitalising on the over the top nature of Wayans Brothers style of over the top humour which puts a lot of comic emphasis on African American stereotypes. But soon after the intro, it becomes a generic story about Megan White, a girl whose has lost her mother, moved in with her alcoholic father and started at an inner city school for performing arts while she tries to leave dance behind. Unfortunately, Megan White is not an interesting character and Shoshanna Bush is not that funny in the role. I mean her performance is ok because considering the stupidity of the material presented to her and she does have a certain charm to her, but she isn't funny. Her character is a whiny and repetitive one who isn't nearly as funny as Cindy Campbell from Scary Movie. Dance Flick puts way too much focus into her and not enough into the Wayans Brothers who are the best source of comedy in the film. So unfortunately, much of Dance Flick is wasted potential.\nThe general structure of Dance Flick is that it is a story about a girl trying to achieve her dreams while breaking away at random points to deal with subplots which feel like a series of comedic sketches. And for most of the time, the sketches are the funny parts while the main plot simply isn't. While Dance Flick could have spoofed dance battle movies, it keeps its focus a lot more on legitimate dance films instead. Of the two, dance battle films are a lot more ridiculous and as the film reveals in its opening scene, its form of parodying the genre is pretty hilarious at times. But soon after this gets reduced simply to a series of moments that detract from the actual intentions of the film. Dance Flick fails because it goes into territory which is inferior to what it could have been going into, and the jokes aren't funny because they only feature inconsistent appearances by the Wayans Brothers who are the only consistently funny element of the film and that is because of their over the top nature. Since they are absent from the spotlight in the film most of the time, Dance Flick ends up being an underwhelming film which just misses the mark and goes into dull and repetitive territory which has its gags getting stale pretty fast and failing to make the comedic impact that it really wants to. You can tell that with Dance Flick the five Wayans who have written the film had the best intentions and really tried, but a lot of the material just isnt funny and it is pretty bland when it could be hilarious. I mean the intro scene of the film was great because of its over the top nature and ridiculous parodying of dance battle films, but once it turns into the story about one girl's journey to prove herself and achieve her dreams, it just loses its edge. Dance Flick is better for its subplots than it is for its central plots, and it contains many unfunny female characters while featuring a lot of hilarious male African American characters. So despite having five writers collaborating, the communication occurring between them must not have been that strong. They were smart enough to ensure that the story was not reliant fully on pop culture references and that it was parodying genres as a whole and not just specific films. But it parodied the wrong dance genres and misused a hilarious cast by focusing on restrained humour instead of over the top jokes. A spoof film house to be out there and really excessive with how it lays down the thick headed and stupid humour, but Dance Flick is so cheap and so tame that it doesn't seem as if the filmmakers were really trying. \nDance Flick does not achieve the same heights as the better spoof films and although it is far from one of the worst, it had potential to be a lot better which is wasted on tame jokes. Although Dance Flick is directed by a Wayans and written by several Wayans family members, the humour does not adapt to their iconic style and tries too hard to appeal to a wider audience by not boxing the film in. Unfortunately, the tame humour and uninspiring dance story make it a lot more female oriented without even poking much fun at how the genre is very female focused. Despite appearances by Marlon Wayans who makes a brief but hilarious presence during his short period of time on screen, Shawn Wayans' series of small appearances which are essentially one laugh after another and the consistently funny lead performance of Damon Wayans Jr. in his first leading role in a comedy, Dance Flick is only sporadically funny at best and is more focused on storytelling than originality and over the top humour, so it simply is not enough to do.\n\nSo despite the efforts of the Wayans Brothers and a few really funny moments, Dance Flick is too tame for its own good and spoofs the wrong dance movies a bit too often so that its jokes to not reach the grasp needed to succeed as Wayans Brother quality humour in the best sense.",

But some birds had their wings clipped at a certain point of their life.\nThe movie starts out very funny, a typical dance-off as scene in more serious productions but the only thing that makes this movie different from the rest is that it's the first to parody dance films but instead almost makes fun of it's self in a very desperate attempt to catch a laugh.  The movie mainly follows a girl, Megan White (i won't give her real name, perhaps she'll be forgotten starring in this role and therefore have a better chance in the long run in a more decent film) and Tom Uncles, a more professional street dancer whom trains Megan how to be better, faster, and more flexible with her moves (kinda like Save the Last Dance).  The movie takes an unexpected turn and even though my favorite parody directors (The Wayans) are behind this so call movie, The guys whom struck gold with ScaryMovie 1 and 2, it seems they've struck a grave of dead cats with Dance Flick.  The movie turns into a more cheap stereo typical spoof comedy with amazingly unfunny humor and jokes about project life that has never been in good taste nor cleaver spouted out in the most ridiculous manors.  And to top it off; if you didn't laugh at the bad joke the first time, you better get used to it because the film will definitely run it over and over and over again.  It's almost as if the Wayans got lazy and took some writing tips from \"Meet The Spartans\" and \"Disaster Movie\". What age group finds this abomination of humor funny?  I don't think there is one.  Not to mention the random scenes of guest star character's popping into the show for 6 sec. and then leaving whom have nothing to do with the movie nor add any intelligent humor, nor actually bash any characters from what it is they're trying to parody.  This is the first movie I saw in theaters that half way through, I wanted to leave.",

Both filmmakers make reference to the musical \"Singin' in the Rain\". In \"Dance Flick\", Mr. Moody(Marlon Wayans) uses the word \"dignity\" a lot as he talks about the stereotypical \"Negro\"-specific roles he accepted during Hollywood's unenlightened years to a classroom full of bored students. Half a century ago, Gene Kelly's silent film star stood on the red carpet at a gala premiere for his latest movie and says, \"Dignity. Always dignity,\" to describe his years in vaudeville as a burlesque act. Both proclaimers are being ironical. \"Classy\" is an aesthetic that has never been synonymous with Wayans' filmography(the geyser of semen that pins the \"Scary Movie\" franchise girl to the ceiling in an \"American Beauty\" parody comes immediately to mind), but his treatment of the immortal dance flick is classy, especially when you compare it to Kubrick's \"A Clockwork Orange\", in which Malcolm McDowell sings the titular song while viciously beating an old man and woman during a home invasion. What's not classy, however, is how he takes away Halle Berry's dignity by dredging up her old \"Hit and Run Halle\" public image in an admittedly funny throwaway gag. That's so 2000. That's so antithetical to the significance of Berry's breakthrough Oscar-win for Marc Foster's \"Monsters Ball\". Acceptance speech histrionics aside, Berry shed light on the indignity of her thespian predecessors who were regulated to playing \"colored folks\", such as a cotton-picker(Mr. Moody's biggest role) and other roles of its ilk. \"Dance Flick\" has a sociological disconnect, but it's typical of this filmmaker's no holds barred approach towards his own people(e.g. Regina King as the disruptive movie patron who gets murdered in \"Scary Movie\").",
