            "content": "`Y tu Mama tambien,' a stunning new product of the New Mexican Cinema that is achieving crossover success in the American film market, is a frank, open and uninhibited celebration of teenage sex \u0096 masterfully directed by Alfonso Cuaron and beautifully enacted by a trio of first-rate performers.  Don't miss it \u0096 provided you are not offended by sometimes-graphic depictions of sexual activity (please note that the film is unrated).  The matter-of-fact, unflinching way in which Cuaron films his sex scenes purges them of indecency and helps to bring a new frankness to a subject all too often approached by American filmmakers from the angle of tittering exploitation (wherein the directors and writers seem as adolescent in their attitudes as the characters on the screen).  Not so here.  The film centers around two boyhood chums, Tenoch and Julio, just embarking on their careers as university students, who, for one last glorious summer, decide to revel in all the wildness, hedonism and promiscuity that carefree adolescence has to offer (the title of the film is emblematic of the youthful immaturity of the characters).  With their girlfriends away in Europe, the two decide to take a road trip through Mexico with Luisa, the attractive young wife of one of Tenoch's stuffed shirt cousins.  While on the journey, the three of them not only indulge in all the bizarre sexual hijinks that both the situation and their hormones would lead one to expect, but they also learn a thing or two about life, about relationships and about how sex can be used both to bring people closer together as well as to pull them farther apart.  For indeed, one thing the film makes very clear both to the characters and to us is that sex can often be employed as a weapon to wound those we care most about, especially with all the power shifting that takes place even in some of the most non-sexual of relationships.  The boys also discover that sex can be used as a sublimation to avoid recognizing what one REALLY wants.  This awakening leads to a final scene that is almost heartbreaking in its understated poignancy and pathos.One of the most unsettling \u0096 and thereby controversial \u0096 aspects of the film (and the one that will make it uncomfortable for many in the audience) is that it refuses to take a moralistic stance regarding its characters' behavior.  The filmmakers neither approve of nor condemn what these young people do \u0096 they merely record the events with an attitude of detached objectivity that precludes any finger-wagging disapproval.  If the characters learn any `lessons' from their experiences, they do so strictly on a subliminal, subconscious level \u0096 and the same goes for the audience.As a director, Cuaron displays a confidence and spirit rarely seen in filmmaking today.  Along with his co-writer, Carlos Cuaron, the director has chosen to take an objective, almost documentary-style approach to the material, allowing the scenes to play themselves out in a way that makes them feel realistic, spontaneous and almost unscripted.  He uses a shaky, handheld camera much of the time to enhance the immediacy of the experience. We often feel as if we are eavesdropping on the lives of these three fascinating individuals.  As a result, not a single moment of the film feels forced, contrived or artificial.  (Only the fate of one of the characters seems a bit convenient and contrived). Cuaron is not afraid to let the camera linger on a scene a moment two longer than necessary \u0096 nor is he afraid to let the camera wander off on its own from time to time, such as when it spontaneously follows a woman into the back of a roadside caf\u00e9 to show us the cooks hard at work in the kitchen.   Many of the shots even have an elegiac, travelogue feel to them.Cuaron has been blessed with three outstanding young actors \u0096 Diego Luna, Gael Garcia and Maribel Verdu \u0096 who bring his characters to vivid, endearing life.  Utterly naturalistic in their every move, gesture and facial expression, the three of them play off each other in such a way that we never doubt for a moment the truth and sincerity of what we are seeing. American actors please take note!`Y tu Mama tambien' is a stylistic triumph from first moment to last.  It has a playful, expansive spirit, as reflected in its openhearted attitude towards sex, its wry humor, its affection for its people and its country, and its visual appeal and inventiveness (Emmanuel Lubezki did the glorious cinematography).  The film has heart, soul and chutzpah.  What more could a jaded filmgoer want?",

            "content": "This is a very different Mexican film. One in which you can really appreciate the sure hand of director Alfonso Cuaron working at the top of his form with an excellent group of actors, which proves that when someone of this magnitude decides to make a good film about interesting characters in contemporary Mexico, one can expect a fine finished product.Alfonso and Carlos Cuaron have created people and situations that are very believable. The script is fine. \"Y tu mama tambien\" is about awakening and about reaching maturity. It's a great Mexican Road movie done with a lot of care.The Cuarons shows us a slice of life that could happen, not only in that country, but one that is universal. Producers and directors in Mexico should see this film and learn how to do future movies, even though the popular taste runs into the horrible soap operas, popular in Mexican TV. The Cuarons have turned out a magnificent script and have turned away from those popular melodramas that are a staple of the film industry of our neighbor to the South.Gael Garcia Bernal, who was excellent in Amores Perros, here demonstrates once again what an actor can do, given the right scenario and obviously a lot of freedom to give life to Julio. Diego Luna is also very credible in his portrayal of the son of a rich man on the road to discover himself. Obviously, the underlying theme is that both like each other, but it never comes out, as they both are so closeted and think themselves of being straight in such a macho atmosphere.Maribel Verdu plays the pivotal role of Luisa. She sees right through the boys, but has to play the part since they are the salvation from her miserable marriage. Here as in other Spanish films, she lets us know she is an actress who likes to take chances. This was the right vehicle for her and she takes advantage of a role that makes her outshine the rest of the cast.One can only hope more interesting things coming from this director and Mexico's gain is our loss, as it's obvious Mr. Cuaron's incursion into American films have not been as satisfactory as his work here.",

            "content": "I read an article about this movie and some have referred to this movie as a Mexican version of \"American Pie.\"  I believe the joke was that it should be called \"Latin-American Pie.\"  Now, I enjoyed the \"AP\" movies, and don't believe them to be crappy movies, but they possess no depth and substance. \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" is much more sexually explicit than those two films put together, but it's in no way exploitative.  It's a slice-of-life story involving teens, and who's gonna deny that 80 percent of a teenager's life revolves around sex?The two main characters, though utterly repulsive in nature, aren't totally unsympathetic, like the characters in Larry Clark's \"Kids.\"  Through the narration, we get a sense of the characters' backgrounds and why they are the way they are.  We aren't simply thrown into this torrent of teenage decadence without a net.I'm sure very few people will regard this as a comedy, but it's filled with hilarious moments, mostly involving the explicit sexual conversations. Though it leaves you with a sad feeling at the end, it doesn't keep you depressed the whole way through.As well as being a character-driven youth drama/road movie, it's basically a film about life, most specifically fate and how it works in mysterious ways and how many people live parallel lives and simply aren't aware.  I'm not going to pretend as if I wasn't stimulated by the sex scenes, or seeing the Spanish actress who plays Luisa naked, but I didn't enjoy it just because of its sexual content.  Too many movies nowadays forbid you the pleasure of going on a character's journey.  Too many movies are all about plot, and more specially about plot devices.  Screenwriters spend so much time developing plot that character development is put on the backburner.  When you get to know the characters this deeply, you're able to connect with them, feel their pleasure and feel their pain.  \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" is one of those rare, character-driven gems that is definitely worth a trip to the video store!My score:  9 (out of 10)",

            "review_title": "A Mexican masterpiece that's full of youth, ribald sex, politics, economics, and death.",
            "content": "(Spoilers)\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n's `Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n' is an instant classic that's bursting with sexy fun, but this Mexican movie about two oversexed boys on the road with a beautiful and sad older woman is haunted by tragedy and history \u0096 film history as well as the political and economic kind.  It's amazing how Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Diego Luna, as Julio and Tenoch, work off each other: they have a hysterical time, laughing and laughing.  I couldn't help wondering if when they shot some of these scenes they themselves may have been high on some of the superior grade `sticky' mota their characters love and praise so much.  These frisky pups, so eager for sex, so incompetent and over-hasty when they get the chance, having such a wonderful time with the sexy Spanish lady with the impressive tits, are very real, but quite symbolic: the Mexican upper class and the lower middle class, inseparable and cautiously in love with each other, going to bed with Spain to acquire some sophistication; but wait! -- Spain, Spain is dying, while Mexico, as Luisa (the assured, somber Maribel Verd\u00fa) tells the boys, `breathes with life.' It's all haunted by mortality and pursued by corruption, and their summer is the end of an era for them.  Back in Mexico City, their sexual tutor is gone and they are no longer friends; it's over, la commedia \u00e8 finita.  Julio and Tenoch have no choice but to act out their social destinies separately, as history decrees.Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and his brother Carlos have produced a movie that is as sophisticated and multi-layered as it is entertaining.  If last year's Mexican hit, `Amores Perros,' was a homage (structurally, anyway) to Quentin Tarentino's `Pulp Fiction,' this one is a homage to the French Nouvelle Vague and most specifically to Truffaut's `Jules et Jim,' itself the tale of two different kinds of young men, bosom buddies both, more than a little in love with each other, unified and separated by their far more sophisticated lady love, embodied by the sublime and unforgettable Jeanne Moreau.  The voiceovers in `Y Tu Mam\u00e1' mimic the same device so often used in many New Wave movies, particularly in `Jules et Jim,' and as in Truffaut's film they are a constant reminder of the fact that this is just a moment in time, that it all ends, and in Cuar\u00f3n's version, the narrator talks about death, degeneration, road kill, disease, all kinds of disasters that happen around and before and after the events of the charming and ribald little story of Julio, Tenoch, and Luisa. The action freezes during these voiceovers to emphasize the momentary nature of the story and to break the jaunty rhythm with the introduction of an awareness of politics, mortality, and history. This goes well beyond the Nouvelle Vague model and as one writer has put it is as if the `American Pie' DVD had a director's commentary by Susan Sontag or G.K. Galbraith. Sure, this movie is hilariously sexy and ebullient.  But there's a whole lot going on here. The Mexican obsession with death is strong in `Y Tu Mam\u00e1': the combination of death and vibrant sexuality and love of life is a rich dish for a gringo palate.  But this isn't just spicy food:  it's a brilliantly constructed movie that works on many levels.`Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n' moves with an energetic and liquid flow from the first. This is very assured, almost bless\u00e8d, filmmaking.  Scene follows scene with imperceptible grace, never held too long, never cut short. The visual rhythm is perfectly sustained. There aren't any wrong notes. The whole cast are constantly alive and right.  Bernal and Luna just seem made to act in this film. (Bernal's beauty and his gifts are indicated by his presence in both this and `Amores Perros,' and his receiving Mexico's highest film acting prize.) Cuar\u00f3n works with a rich palate:  his cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, always has a lot going on in the frame.  In a road house the camera just wanders off and catches local people, an old lady stiffly dancing to a radio.  Mexico is constantly present without being commented upon (the voiceover doesn't belabor the images but augments them; the boys drive by many police roadblocks, oblivious of the repression).  The landscapes are subtly beautiful, never conventional. (There's so much going on that I couldn't think of writing about the movie till I'd seen it twice.)  But none of the peripheral action and scenery that make the palate of the movie so rich ever distract from the story.  All focus is on the story and its irresistible momentum in every single frame, so it's only afterward that you realize the full complexity of `Y Tu Mam\u00e1' and the beauty of its imagery. For me images that remain are a short tracking shot that goes over to the window of Luisa's flat and looks down to see her meet Julio and Tenoch and get into the car to go on their journey to the mythical beach; the country club pool, with its wide expanse, and the ranks of elegant modernistic lounge chairs behind a stream of water spraying the perfect lawn; the rich leathery tan of an old lady's face, momentarily glimpsed with a patch of red flower; a lovely shot in a bar, worthy of Cartier-Bresson, showing Luisa phoning her husband through a little window, while in an identical window we see reflected Julio and Tenoch playing a game of hand soccer; the pigs scattering across the beach at dusk and ruining the boys' encampment. Why some critics have called this movie lightweight (or even bothered to drag out the phrase `road movie') I can't imagine; I guess they overlooked the burden of sad knowledge (and the cinematic genius) amid so much happy fun.",

            "content": "Before you read any further I would like to strongly suggest that you go see this film. Do not read my review and just go see it. Find out where it's playing and buy yourself a ticket, in fact bring as many of your friends as you can, such as I did, and I promise you will all somehow have enjoyed it in a way films are rarely enjoyed. I do not feel that I will be able to describe exactly what I felt having seen this film, but if you would like to see my effort then read on.This is the story of 2 teenagers, Tenoch and Julio, best friends their whole lives, which have indulged in many of life's guilty pleasures. We meet them at a point when their respective present girlfriends are leaving to study in Italy, leaving the 2 friends on their own for the summer. In the short time after their departure we see a whole new side of the boys. They masturbate to the thought of Salma Hayek, smoke weed, drink hard, and flirt with another man's wife. She is a beautiful older woman named Luisa at a wedding, who in turn is Tenoch's cousin's wife. They flirt with her and invite her to come with them to the fictional beach Heaven's Mouth. She is of course reluctant, but takes them up on the offer after her husband one night calls her to confess he cheated on her. This is the beginning of the road trip to the non-existent beach that will change their lives.An unidentified man narrates the entire film, and when he speaks all goes silent in the scenes serving as a moving freeze frame if you will. He speaks the future of the lives we are watching these people interact with, and ultimately you begin to worry what will be of there own future. During this road trip to the fictional beach, all 3 main characters meet new and interesting people in new and interesting parts of Mexico. It makes them ponder life as their own past experiences begin to unravel in their intimate and personal conversations. Not before long the compounded sexual tension between them is in a way relieved, but to mixed consequences. All of the subtle characteristics of jealousy, anger, passion, naivety, become completely real.These characters are so believably acted, that when you see these actors in interviews or in other films you'll almost feel cheated. Relationships like this simply don't seem like they can be cheated; yet through some form of skill and humanity every element comes together just right, never distracting or deterring you from the story.Featured are some of the best-shot sex scenes ever (as one of my friends pointed out as a matter of fact). `Y tu Mama Tambien' finds a way of making all of it's moments feel intimate and genuine, yet never in bad taste. Alfonso Cuaron makes it difficult for us to believe what we are seeing at times is only movie, which serves this tale all the more. The shaky `Road Film Style' cinematography used here is perfect in capturing this uncommon, and unbalanced relationship. You are kept on your toes at all times, expecting something or someone to break. The dialogue is fresh and funny, the kind you just know cannot be faked, that in fact somewhere somehow the writer or actors uttered those phrases. I am convinced that a great majority of this film was improvised, whatever the case may be.\n \tThis film is obviously more than flesh, more than experimenting youth. Take some of your favorite moments from mediocre mainstream movies like `American Pie 1 and 2' and remove all the slapstick value. You will realize that there is much more there than you ever saw before. That is what I think in small part this film strives to achieve. It succeeds. We can sympathize with theses characters every step of the way, because as we first get to know them you realize that they either are like you, someone you know, knew, or maybe someone you always wished you could be. By the time things begin to happen to these characters you yourself begin to feel part of their journey.This is an experience many of you won't take part in, and that is the sincere shame. Instead a great majority of people have been walking out of `The Scorpion King' unchallenged and un-entertained. `Y Tu Mama Tambien' offers a true form of escape, one that no blockbuster will dare. It's the lives few of us will ever live, for better or worse. What transcends from the screen to your hearts and minds is as eye opening as anything you'll ever see, and as effecting, if not more, as your own personal life experience. Bold words? Go see it and you tell me.Note: Please feel free to contact me and share your thoughts on this film or on my review of it.",

            "review_title": "Last Tango in Mexico",
            "content": "In many ways Alfonso Cuaron's \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" reminds me of the desolation theme of Bernardo Bertolucci's \"Ultimo tango a Parigi\" (1972) and the deceptive perspective of Michelangelo Antonioni's \"L'Avventura.\" (1960).\nRaging post-adolescent hormonal drives seem to propel Julio and Tenoch forward, with little else of substance to account for.  Likewise, Luisa's motivation seems more despair- than romance-driven.  Thus, the trio's trek in search of the idyllic Boca del Cielo is reminiscent of the forlorn lovers' quest for emotional fulfillment in the Bertolucci film.Comparison with the Antonioni opus stems from Cuaron's script seemingly being about a carefree, liberated trio on a journey for fun, when in fact, it's really about escape from their own worst \"enemies\"--themselves.After a particularly talky beginning (complete with abundant narrations) the film settles in on its main theme, and the dialogue becomes more pointed. While the camera work is generally appropriate, Cuaron tends to rely on long- to medium-shots, with nary a close-up.  The result of this is a somewhat distant enactment, in which the viewer is held a bit at arm's length from the action.  One seldom gets close enough to become intimately acquainted with these people.  In the end, one is touched by important revelations which are crucial to understanding that which has transpired.  Yet, the viewer's emotional involvement is perhaps less than what it might have been, given closer perspectives.This film obviously impressed many people, and I must agree the work by the principles is uniformly solid. This is a \"last tango\" which has made its mark as a distinctive film work.",

            "review_title": "Funny... but above all, a really intelligent motion picture",
            "content": "Alfonso Cuaron is simply one of the best Mexican directors in recent years in Mexican film production. His incredible AIDS-driven comedy, \"Solo Con Tu Pareja\" was maybe the most funny Mexican picture in a long time, and his always present criticism to the way of life of Mexican people in a city such as Mexico City, is incredible accurate and clever. His other projects in the United States, \"Little Princess\" and \"Great Expectations\" were beautifully-manufactured motion pictures, with the help (or support, if you may) of the marvellous photographer Emmanuel Lubenzki (\"Sleepy Hollow\", and the above-mentioned Cuaron movies). Returning to his home country this time, Cuaron displays such magic and poetic visuals, in contrast with the subtle criticism to the society in Mexico, and the clever and sharp dialogs between the leading stars, using every word young Mexicans use to apply in their conversations.\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" (And Your Mother Too) is, in the surface, a really funny story about 2 friends-almost-brothers, Tenoch Iturbide (an outstanding Diego Luna) and Julio (a really incredible performance for the recent Ariel, the Mexican Academy Award, winner Gael Garcia Bernal, in another excellent portray of a young guy with \"issues\"), that plan a trip to an imaginary beach, \"Boca del Cielo\" (Heaven\u00b4s Mouth) in order to flirt with a Spanish girl, married with Tenoch's cousin, and portrayed by a credible Maribel Verdu.But this is only the \"surface\" of this road movie. In fact, we are dealing with dreams and realities, with social problems and political ones. Tenoch is a young guy living with a millionaire family, son of a wealthy businessman with friends in the highest \"stairs\" of Mexican politics, with a second name such as Iturbide (one of the most important and powerful leaders of Mexican politic history). And, in contrast, Julio  is a middle-low-class guy, living with his mother, brothers and sisters, in a small department, with a last name such as Zapata (a revolutionary leader in Mexican history, with native origins, that took part in the Revolution at the beginning of 20th Century). This is a clever and sharp critic of the different models of living of these 2 friends, and in fact, of all Mexican citizens (I know it, because I'm Mexican, too).Also, the movie has an excellent narration by Daniel Gimenez Cacho, star of a previous Cuaron film, \"Solo Con Tu Pareja\", that explains the things we cannot see, but that we can understand and feel. The \"subtle critic about Mexican society and traditions\" that I have talked about all along this comment, is the one thing that makes this picture go from a funny comedy to an intelligent essay of the lives of young people, social classes, discovery and re-discovery of personality and our own soul, and the final revelation of who we are and what we become when time passes by. In the lives of Julio and Tenoch there is no redemption, but a clear message of their goal in life, their true feelings about friendship, and their sexuality. This road trip is only a pretext to tell a story about discovery and finding our true nature.Yes, maybe it is a little provocative and bold, but because of these characteristics, \"And Your Mother Too\" is an incredible motion picture, true to its meaning and compromised with the reality it is trying to show. We care about this people, we care about their problems, and at the end, we care about our own society, and we care about what we have become with time. And the true meaning of the movie's title, \"And Your Mother Too\", within the narrative of the film, is simply hilarious.Give this movie a chance, and see it. You won't be disappointed. It has an excellent direction, excellent photography, its is very sexy, it showcases credible performances by all its cast. But above all, it has a real story, real character development, and real power. One great movie from a great Mexican director. Maybe not his best, but really near.",

            "content": "The two teenage males in this sharply etched film, \"Y tu mama tambien,\" are obsessed with sex and view its pleasures as something akin to joyfully skating across a frozen lake.  As the story develops the ice gets thinner and thinner, its incapacity to carry the weight of their fantasies advances faster than their growing inevitable end stop - maturity.The Mexico of the teenagers and their generally stoned friends is one of affluence and political connectedness.  One father belongs to a country club that features one of the biggest private swimming pools I've seen - no film set here (the pool is the scene of a very, ah, unusual depiction of teen horniness).  Neither of the lads cares much about the actual political and social issues occurring during their adventures and which are seamlessly integrated into their story.  Their futures are a blank to them but a blank untroubled by the need to be concerned or ambitious.And then arrives the femme fatale, a beautiful, smart but very raunchy just-left-husband gal with whom they take off in a beaten-up old station wagon to find, ostensibly, a secret beach.  Of course what the guys have in mind is seduction.Without a polemical discourse the viewer is carried into the isolation and poverty of much of Mexico as asphalt yields to hard dirt roads leading to barely navigable sand traps.  The people they encounter along the way are realized subtly but effectively.These teens aren't really so likable but they do show occasional promise of growing up, a redeeming feature.  This is less a road film than it is a comedy of (very bad) manners. The director and three leading characters have taken raunch to a new and interesting cinematic plane.While these kids may be a parent's nightmare, they become more complex, and inevitably more insightful, as the film develops.  By the end they are very, very different people and in danger of becoming sort of plain vanilla post-teens (whatever the Mexican equivalent of the Japanese \"salaryman\" is, they may well be launched along that path).This film is rated \"R\" but many will wonder how it avoided an \"X.\" Be forewarned.  But some of the sex scenes are hilarious - especially if the viewer has ever been a teenager. :)Cuaron uses voiceovers not so much to explain the story but to quietly show that all lives have \"sidebar\" events beyond the tale being told, events that can be described in one or two sentences and which illuminate the fullness of a character's journey.The scenery is gorgeous.Definitely a different and engrossing story.",

Using three central characters -- two immature adolescent males and a young woman in crisis -- set in a road-trip situation, it was hardly a road-trip movie.  Nor was it an adolescent movie.  Nor was it a woman-in-crisis movie. Nor was it about sex.  Instead, what starts out with a sizzling but ditzy prologue becomes something much deeper and much more profound as it goes along.  By the end I was breathless and somewhat stunned.  The character study is amazing.  The societal insights are haunting.  The shared humanity it exposes is painful at time but ultimately reaffirming and uplifting. These are three of the most memorable, identifiable and completely human characters I've seen on screen in ages.

In his film, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n not only describes the sexual experimentation of Mexican youth, but he also addresses the impact wavering politics and an unstable economy has on the Mexican people as a whole. The film takes place in 2001, just one year after the election of Vincente Fox, a member of the opposition party. After about 70 years of revolutionary presidents, Mexican government underwent a radical change during the time of the narrative, as well as the film's release. Mexico has undergone numerous financial fluctuations throughout its history as a country, and recent years have brought along various economic lows. The extreme changes in economy throughout history caused Mexico to have a large separation between each of its economic classes. In his narrative the two young boys who take a journey to a beautiful land with a beautiful woman seem to represent the desires of most Mexicans during this insecure time. Julio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) embark on a thrilling journey filled with sexual exploration and an investigation of their inner selves. After convincing the beautiful Luisa (Maribel Verd\u00fa) to take a trip with them to an imaginary beach, the trio heads off in search of adventure. Self-discovery ensues when Luisa seduces both boys and convinces them to make love with each other during their last romantic encounter. The raw sexuality displayed throughout this movie seems to encapsulate the uninhibited nature of Mexican youth. While the full frontal nudity and unashamed sexual acts performed on screen may be disturbing to an American audience, Mexican cinema seems to embrace sexuality with open arms. While they do not leave anything to the imagination, the sex scenes throughout Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n are beautifully orchestrated. These scenes absorb the magnificence of sexual attraction and the inhibition that comes along with this temptation. While the film utilizes the characteristics of raw sexuality at its core, the underlying message of the film seems to encompass the trials of politics and economy within Mexican society. Julio comes from a lower-middle-class family, while his best friend, Tenoch, is the son of a high-ranking politician. As their mental age begins to grow throughout the film, the distinction among their varying classes also becomes clear. It is this distinction that ultimately drives them apart. Cuar\u00f3n uses the distinct lives of these two boys to comment on the state of Mexico's political affairs. While the large separation between classes is rooted in economics, the separation also occurs within the lifestyles and moral character of each class's constituents. Cuar\u00f3n's film Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n depicts the raw sexuality apparent in Mexican society, and also indirectly comments on the political atmosphere of the country. Through the use of a compelling story of self-discovery and the beautiful landscapes of the Mexican countryside, Cuar\u00f3n offers his audience a glimpse of Mexico through the eyes of one of its citizens. While the underlying meanings apparent throughout the film are deeply rooted in the political principles of Mexican society, the narrative of the film introduces a moving story that forces its audience to fall in love with its characters despite their downfalls. On a scale of 1 \u0096 10, Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n is definitely a 10.",

            "content": "I think this is an excellent movie which works on many levels. Of course, the photography is brilliant and the use of perspectives is great!But what I want to write about are the parallels between some events in the movie and the inner plot.1. The 2 friends are swimming/diving together, somehow as a symbol of their friendship. But the second time, the pool is filled with leaves - which are a symbol of decline and thats the moment when Julio confesses that he had slept with Tenoch's girlfriend. That's when it gets complicated.2. Then they are stuck - with their friendship and with the car. But that is the moment when they find the perfect beach. And that's the moment when their friendship reaches its climax - they confess everything to each other, but they are cool with it. Their friendship seems more important than ephemeral things like lust, sex or their teenage girlfriends. But the idyll of the beach is disturbed by the pigs that smut everything. And the pigs are like lust and sex - that's what destroys the relationship again and this moment. The pigs are wild and dirt everything, like the final sex scene with Luisa and the 2 boys.3. The more wild nature gets, the more wild is their experience. But back in the civilization of the city, they cant go on with that. The city represents their socialization and the society's rules (which doesn't really allow the kiss of the boys). Its way beyond their comfort zone.4. The beach is also a parallel to Tenoch. He wants to be a writer; free and on his own - but ends up studying economics. And the beach ends up as a touristy place - probably without its natural beauty.I don't know if you agree with my attempt to interpret the movie on a deeper level; but to me, the picture works perfect on so many levels.It's a very inspiring movie - dramatic and yet funny, offensive and yet subtle and witty.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.Films in the US, India and Hong Kong have a happy freedom in that they can exist in a world context. All other films carry the burden of nationality, and it is a heavy burden indeed. That's because films define society and `national' films attract undue expectations to define what it means to be French, or whatever. It is burden enough when the country has a healthy economy, a long history with film, and political stability. But when the country lacks any of these, each marginally competent film gets blown up to mythic proportions.So it was within a whirlwind of expectations that I viewed this as a non-Mexican North American. My own experience with Spanish-speaking literature and film is relatively slight, but from `Quixote,' through Borges, hispanics have led us all in intelligent self-reference. In the last few decades, this has merged with post-modern fabulism or `magical reality' to produce some similarly great art.But there is a backlash from the street, which promotes the frank, impulsive sexuality of hispanics. And so we have Spanish films that are about sensual caprice. And people flock to them for self-definition. I recently saw a most amazing film: `Luc\u00eda y el sexo,' which to my mind was a superb blend of the two: Spanish self-aware abstraction folded into a selfserving passion for sex as life. Both literary and cinematic.Now along comes this film, that doesn't make any such synthesis. It in fact sticks entirely to the `passion-for-life' side, goobered up with some political commentary and wrapped in a traditional `dying girl' wrapper. That this is deliberate can be seen in the girl leaving her writer husband, whose friends talk about intellectual things she doesn't think important. Its pleasant enough, especially the dialog, and I didn't mind watching it. But knowing that millions of Mexicans adjust their sense of self using this template is somewhat tragic.So let's emphasize what element remains of interest: the narrative structure. There are three narrative stances here: the one within the story, centered on the boys; the `underwater' one (presumably the placeholder for what would be the folding in a better film and presaging some new awareness in the story); and the spoken narrator. These are separated by very clever sound editing and constitute the best element of the film. All the folding is done here: for instance, one road is blocked by a traffic death and later on a different road the narrator informs us that if they had been on that road tens years prior they would have seen an accident with similar social context.If you work hard, this spoken narration is sometimes clever but all in all you'd be far better off watching `Luc\u00eda y el sexo,' and celebrating hispanic passion: both sensual and intellectual.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

            "content": "Alfonso Cuaron's Y Tu Mama Bien is one of the better films of the year (not quite best, but still highly recommendable). Cuaron, who scripted with his brother Carlos, tells a story with such a level of stark and touching realism that the audience will not only feel for the three main characters, but will feel like their along the ride with them. In this story, Tenoch and Julio are two friends whose girlfriends go away to Italy for a little while and are left with not much to do (outside of partying and masturbation) until they get an idea to go to a secluded beach called Heaven's Mouth and ask the married and 10 years older Luisa to come along. She agrees after discovering her husband cheated on her more than she could stand and this takes the movie onto a road trip with dialog and actions that, despite having the be read on the bottom of the screen in subtitle format, is much better than most teen movies that go for sex related dialog (however, Cuaron had to go back to Mexico to make this type of movie so that the MPAA wouldn't s*** on it and make him re-edit it to a NC-17) and action. The only flaws keeping Cuaron's latest work from being a great coming of age tale is that the narration, while keeping in some good insight along the way, becomes heavy handed at times and gives information that is either humorist news along the area the characters are traveling or about the characters themselves which isn't a bad thing until it digs into things that don't have much relevance to the rest of the picture or even to the characters when you think about what is really up on the screen. Plus, the very last scene is too conventional to be placed as where the film leads up to (he should've ended it when Luisa goes into the ocean the last time).But still, these squabbles shouldn't stop people from seeing this movie, overall it delivers splendidly in it's uninhibited and mature ways.

            "content": "If you had one last summer of freedom before having to get serious about the maturity thing, then this movie will have special meaning for you. It is an example of a non-pornographic movie where explicit sexual scenes play an essential role. It is the story of a summer in the lives of two oversexed teenagers, close friends Tenoch and Julio, whose girl-friends have left for a vacation in Italy, leaving the guys behind to deal with their sexual frustrations and boredom. Their initial diversions are drugs and partying. But, in a flight of fancy and make-believe, Tenoch floats the idea to the sexy wife of a cousin, Luisa, that the three of them take a trip to a remote beach. For reasons of her own, and reasons that constitute a significant subtext of the story, Luisa surprisingly agrees, as her husband is also away. Tenoch and Julio then scramble to come up with a plan, and the three of them take to the road.The youthful enthusiasms of Tenoch and Julio propel the story to a great extent. For example, they talk about their club, the Charolastras (the \"astral cowboys\"!) that has a manifesto with eleven rules:1. There is no greater honor than being a Charolastra.2. Do whatever you feel like.3. Pop beats poetry.4. Get high at least once a day.5. You shall not screw a fellow Charolastra's girl-friend.6. Whoever roots for Team-America is a faggot.7. Whacking off rules.8. Never marry a virgin.9. Same as 6.10. Truth is cool but unattainable.11. The a**hole who breaks any of the previous rules loses his title of Charolastra.If you find this kind of adolescent playfulness endearing, then you will like this movie.But, more serious topics are broached. We see a rural Mexico that few tourists probably see - there are military checkpoints (the movie takes place in the summer before the 71-year rein of one-party rule ended), poverty stricken towns, a roadblock where they are coerced to make a donation, the site of Tenoch's maid's home town, and much more. Tenoch's upper-class cosmopolitan urban existence is in stark contrast to most of what they see.In their brief trip Luisa has taught them much about life, about being a woman, and about sex. And Tenoch and Julio also make some discoveries on their own. But Luisa carries with her a sadness - a sadness that we do not fully understand until the end. It is the revelation of that sadness that teaches the greatest lesson and truly marks the end of Tenoch and Julio's adolescence.I found the beginning of the movie a bit confusing as we meet, or are told about by a narrator who makes occasional intercessions, Tenoch and Julio's families, as well as the families of their girl-friends. Interesting background information, but things don't really take off until the trio is on the road.An excellent, original, insightful, sexy, joyful, and melancholy movie.",

It's been on my \"must see\" list for so long, and I shall give myself a severe telling off for being so tardy. I've just watched Children of Men, director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's latest movie, and been totally blown away by it, so I thought I should catch up with his earlier works.There is a line in the film where one character says \"Mexico breathes with life\". Well, so does this film. It's entertaining, life affirming, funny, wistful without being sentimental and features the almost unbearably cute Gael Garcia Bernal. Bernal and the excellent Diego Luna (as Julio and Tenoch) are two young men with too much time on their hands. They take off on a road trip across Mexico with an older woman Luisa (Maribel Verdu, with a body to die for) while their girlfriends are in Europe.Luisa is nursing the hurt of discovering she has an unfaithful spouse, but by the end of the film we discover she has deeper reasons for escaping from her life in Mexico City and heading to the coast with her two new young friends. The boys are trying to impress her when they tell her about their secret beach, but after traveling through the grinding poverty of Mexico's hinterland, they do actually find a place at the coast which is beautiful and unspoiled, where life is still lived with grace. But not for long, as we discover that this place too is about to be redeveloped for tourism. Along the way, Luisa seduces both boys - whose rampant sexuality dominates the film wonderfully \u0096 trying to show them more adult and arguably more satisfying ways to make love.The movie is beautifully acted and perfectly filmed and edited. It says quite a lot about teenage sexuality, male and female, and it shows a side and depth of Mexico not seen on the average 5 day vacation package. I loved it.",

His film's always look great but when he has a hand in the script the resulting film is often shallow and rings hollow. This happened in Roma, and it also happened in Gravity as two quick examples. Cuaron co-wrote this and it is easily his best work on that front. The story has classic form, road trip spliced with love triangle, that is pushed to its logical extremes. The characters are vivid and fully formed. Given the voice-over and some of the story beats that the characters drive by there is also a pretty strong critique of class and privilege in the film. In any case the writing is intelligent and the ending, especially, can hold multiple readings. It feels weird to say this but the script is probably the best thing about the film.The acting is quite good as well. Luna and Bernal make an exceedingly sexy pair of friends. Given what the script calls for them to do-the nudity alone!-they give utterly fearless performances that are immature masculinity personified and there is enough ambiguity to them you do wonder about the characters' identities. Bros should see so much of their sexual insecurity in them.If anything the direction isn't quite what it usually is. It is fairly good. The film moves at a great clip. But at times you can sense that Cuaron was still finding his voice and the film, visually, is frayed by experimentation. Overall, this is probably my favorite Cuaron film.",

She doesn't give up for the sake of those two horny teens ... it's a more personal reason.  I would have done the same thing if I was in her shoes knowing that my life is about to end.  One last taste of freedom.  To discover Paradise.  What life is all about.  That's Louisa's personal journey to find the answers.

In one scene, the camera floats to the back of a country hotel where we see an ancient woman dancing and a family of women cooking and another scene (my favorite) is when Louisa dances toward the beautiful boys drunk on tequila.

The film's attitude to them is ambivalent: the occasional scene hints at their boorishness, and a strange, deadpan commentary, draws attention to their relatively privileged status in impoverished Mexico; but essentially the portrait is sympathetic, even a celebration of teenage exuberance and naivet\u00e9. Ultimately, however, to me the whole film seemed more like a preface to another movie that would have begun where it ended, in that the events have only a retrospective significance to the characters, but the structure of the movie allows no room for nostalgia until the very end.

The beautiful older woman (Ana Lopez Mercado), teaching them about life, sex and themselves, is from Spain; the upper class boy (Diego Luna) has the Aztec name of \"Tenoch,\" and his working class best bud has the last name of \"Zapata\" (played by the riveting Gael Garcia Bernal, who was also in another terrific Mexican film Amores Perros, and is so charismatic that I kept following him with my eyes and forgetting to read the white on white subtitles to figure out what he was saying, so Spanish speakers have a real advantage).The climaxes are telegraphed in advance, coming organically out of the story, but make us re-interpret what we've seen throughout, so it's the kind of movie you want to talk about to people who have seen it.As scatological as the subtitles are, I gathered that the spoken language is even more so, as I recognized a couple of epithets that didn't get translated.The cinematography is lush and beautiful, the only indication that this is the same writer/director who did Great Expectations and The Little Princess, Alfonso Cuaron.The soundtrack songs are carefully selected to reflect specific points of Mexican influences and regional culture as they play on the radios and jukeboxes along this brilliant, revelatory journey.

Even if a viewer had a strong desire to bond with one of the characters, the distant camera framing prevents the audience from identifying with anyone.Lots of mindless vulgar antics.  A long predictable stretch towards the end has all of the main characters in a silly drunken stupor.  The older lady, with a body all men lust over, is supposedly only four weeks away from dying of metastasized cancer -- totally unbelievable!The sex and nudity are remarkable for an R-rated movie, but it is not hot enough to recommend the movie.",

Some of us mature more and/or faster than others.Tenoch is the son of an important politician of the ruling party in Mexico. His father is both corrupt and rich. His best friend is Julio, the son of a worker, a secretary who has been at her same job for decades. Luisa is a dental technician from Spain. She's married to an intellectual, a writer, a professor, a man of no passion. They are all on their way to Heaven's Mouth, a semi-mythical beach which the boys believe they have made up in order to lure Luisa on an outing of fun and games.At first, Julio and Tenoch strike you as being a new versions of Cheech and Chong. They're funny. They smoke dope and they fool around the pleasure principle like there's no tomorrow, no pain and no worries in contemporary Mexico or for that matter the world. The camera pans the traffic jam caused by a dead pedestrian, a poor man on his way to work, hit by a bus because he was in a hurry and didn't take the lengthy pedestrian ramp. Tenoch and Julio discuss and diss Julio's left-wing sister, who is at a demonstration, thinking that it is she and her comrades who are holding up traffic. They pass the dead man's corpse, in slow roll with the others in the snarl.'Y tu mama tambien' is like this. It takes you fast, past the wreckage, arrests and police state operations/apparatus of daily life in Mexico as people make their livings and the three make their way to Heaven's Mouth. And as much as they ignore a well rounded honesty of life, other than pleasure, eventually, revelations begin to weigh in and make the participants stop, to reflect on who they are; what they desire; who they have been and who they may be becoming. They're all naked, but not yet completely revealed. Each has secrets covering weakness and betrayal.And the sex is good too.",

It all leads up to an unexpected and somewhat downbeat ending.There is a lot of nudity--most of it male and frontal--and plenty of sex, but almost none of it is particularly exciting.

Although the plot doesn't steer far away from convention, at each point the viewer's anticipation is deftly sidestepped, and the scene is injected with a dose of raw emotion that has little to do with Drama, and everything to do with reality. It is so refreshing to see characters behave in a way that resembles personal memory, if not actual experience.The guys are by often banal, bratty and obnoxious \u0096 in other words, quite normal teenagers \u0096 but not without their charm. They float along in their privileged bubble, largely oblivious to the social tensions wracking their country, except for facile quips like \"left-wing babes are totally hot\". They have a lot to learn, and their trip with Luisa is a catalyst to confronting their adolescent fantasies and indolence with a dose of reflection.As for the much talked about sexy bits, they are funny, erotic, and utterly non-pornographic. What a pity that such a candid portrayal of sexuality seems to be nearly impossible in American film.Highly recommended.",

Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n is the right man to direct the next Harry Potter film.The film begins with two sex scenes. Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) are two privileged 17 year old brats in Mexico City. Both are having one last intimate moment with their respective girlfriends before the young women go off to a summer trip to Europe.The charmless arrogant pair belong to a privileged fraternity. Life revolves around sex, drugs, alcohol and jerking off. Tenoch's father is a politician. Both boys attend a wedding reception where the President is due to attend.At the wedding they meet enchanting Luisa who is from Spain. She is 28 years old, a dental technician. The invite her to a secluded beach in the Pacific coast and invent the name of Heaven's Mouth.That is before they find out that she is married to Tenoch's cousin, a writer who got educated in Spain.A few days later Luisa accepts their invitation after her husband drunkenly admits to having cheated on her again.Tenoch and Julio need to get hold of a car and find some directions of any beach that matches the description they gave to Luisa.Obviously both of them fancy their chances with Luisa on the trip.Cuar\u00f3n peppers his film with voice overs that show another side to Mexico. A highway where there is a traffic jam as someone got run over by a bus. He did not take the bridge as it would increase the walk to his work by several miles. His body was identified several days later. The fisherman and his family that the boys meet at a beach. He takes them on boat trips and has a small shack that serves food. He will later lose his livelihood when a luxury hotel is built.Along the way they see a different more rural part of Mexico. They also see constant police roadblocks but the boys are ignored by the police, another sign of their privileged background.Luisa when alone cries uncontrollably. She speaks to her husband on the phone unsure whether she is angry with him or misses him but does tell him that she will not go back to him.Luisa also initiates a seduction of Tenoch which Julio witnesses. It causes a rift between the boys as Julio tells Tanoch that he has had sex with his girlfriend. Later she seduces Julio as well which then upsets Tenoch and he responds by telling Julio that he also had sex with his girlfriend.Luisa later takes control of the situation by criticising both of their lack of sexual prowess which is more about their own satisfaction. She later gets intimate with both of them while noting the latent homo eoriticsm between the two.Cuar\u00f3n is another director from the Mexican new wave. His influences are the European new wave directors such as Francois Truffaut.The movie was dubbed as the Mexican version of American Pie. The films are vastly different.Cuar\u00f3n takes a mature approach to relationships and betrayal. It is a summer where the boys grow up and move on. There are constant hints of underlying darkness beneath Mexican society, something Tenoch and Julio have been shielded from. You get a voiceover where until he was four years old, Tenoch thought his nanny was his mother.It also has a coda when the boys meet up one year later where they catch up and talk about Luisa.",

While I loved the Mexican backdrop spending time with two teenagers who are hardly smarter than Beavis and Butthead seemed to me quite a drag. Yes, well observed, but what are we getting here? People that have nothing to say and are saying it!\nThe road movie has only so many cliches to them and this obeys most of them. They all have to have a scene where one person argues with another and they get and walk. Then the driver drives alongside and begs the other person to get back in. Do you think this doesn't happen here? And there are two boys and one girl - do you think there isn't going to be tears and jealousy before (and after) bedtime? This should be called road movie by numbers!There are some lovely rolling scenes (with nice music) and just as you are getting to enjoy it we get in to another \"my dick is bigger than your dick\" style shouting match. On the roadside people seem to be being hassled by law and order or living improvised lives, but the film doesn't seem to careless. They drive on by. Depth? There isn't any.The problem with sex is that I am not shocked by it. Sex doesn't have to be sexy, indeed sex when viewed abstractly from medium distance looks quite funny. I don't know why a woman in her late twenties/early thirties (I am presuming here based on the age of the actress) would want to hang with these clowns. For sex? When did an attractive woman ever have to go short of casual sex. In real life clever men hang out with stupid women - you never see it the other way round!This is the kind of film the French have be doing for years, only much better. Just off the top of my head Pauline at the Beach and Betty Blue are miles better films, so why are they rated lower than this? Maybe this got good word of mouth and the people that saw it, loved it? And the people that wouldn't like it were kept away or turned off after five minutes. One of the top hundred films ever made - what a complete and utter joke!",

Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's \"Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n\" uses the escapades of a pair of rich teenagers in summer 1999 to look at the issues affecting Mexico, and does a masterful job with it.Diego Luna and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal play high school graduates Tenoch and Julio. They've always lived a life of privilege. One day at a wedding, they meet Luisa (Maribel Verd\u00fa), the unfulfilled wife of a family friend.

However, in addition to the lessons about sex that Luisa teaches the boys, this trip serves to reveal a lot about the two boys and the phony lives that they have led. Moreover, the trip reveals a new Mexico to the boys: for the first time, they see poverty.I can't do this movie justice by trying to describe it. It's one that you simply HAVE to see to truly realize what it says about Mexico in general.

The reference is not casual. Both films have a similar core even though they're completely different, structure-wise.Julio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, one of the most versatile and exciting international actors of this generation - is there any role this guy can't play? Che Guevara, sinner priests, transvestites...) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) are best friends. Like most 17 year-olds, all they can think of is sex, and when they meet an attractive Spanish woman, Luisa (Maribel Verd\u00fa), Tenoch's cousin's wife, they convince her to go on a road trip with them. The destination? A secret beach called \"Boca del Cielo\" (Heaven's Mouth).\"Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\" avoids the clich\u00e9s of teen movies and goes into much deeper territories. Sex is naturally discussed - and shown - throughout the film, but in a mature way, and Cuar\u00f3n dives into serious issues like friendship, love, Mexico's socio-economic reality and life itself. The ending - which I shall not spoil - reminds me of \"Lost in Translation\", but in a darker, sadder tone. If you feel like going on a sensual, unique and unforgettable emotional journey, rent \"Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\". 10/10.",

(Sample insight: they agree that masturbation feels good.) A woman joins them, adding nothing to the mix. After two hours it ends. There is no story, no characterization, no relationships, not even a hint of writing or directing talent.It's not the actors' fault. They dutifully disrobe, simulate intercourse, and they look okay naked. But there is less meaning here than there is in the average porn vid.I guess some of these rave reviews are from kids who are excited to see nudity and hear dirty talk. I direct these children to their older brothers' socks drawer, where they'll find more intelligent handling of sexual and gender issues in any 4-Hour XXX video.Though the cast is attractive, even the sex scenes boring. There is not an interesting or original thought, shot, or line of dialogue in the whole film.The idea that this movie has anything to say about politics or \"sex roles\" or \"coming of age\" is ludicrous. The morons who compare this movie to masterpieces by Truffaut, Fellini, or Almodovar should be shot for sacrilege. It takes more than two actors and an actress on screen to make JULES ET JIM.To repeat: ALL THAT HAPPENS in this movie is two boys and one woman ride in a car, get naked, sit around on the beach, have sex, and read page after page of pointless, clich\u00e9d dialogue. These aren't characters, they're voids with names.The filmmakers haven't the talent to even begin to suggest characterization or plot development. The \"political\" side, which some posters find so intriguing, amounts to the narrator telling us, near the end, that the PRI lost an election -- which has no connection to anything said or done by the characters. Faux meaning doesn't get any more faux than this.It would have been easy to append a phony political point to the film, maybe by having the leads murdered by the oppressed masses -- giving the film at least an illusion of meaning -- but the filmmakers aren't smart enough to figure this out.I've seen many films I've disliked, even hated, but there was always SOME talent involved in their making. This one provokes nothing -- no emotion, no thought, no reaction of any kind. It's like staring at a blank wall for two hours.I recommend Y Tu Mama Tambien to very horny, very stupid teenagers and to anyone curious to see what happens when people with absolutely no talent and absolutely nothing to say get their hands on a movie camera.",

Hoping to escape her troubles, she agrees to accompany the boys on an extended road trip, during which their lives are changed forever.Opening with two simulated (but incredibly realistic) sex scenes, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's ambitious Mexican road movie has more on its mind than mere titillation (AMERICAN PIE this ain't!). Immensely popular on its home turf, particularly amongst hormonally-charged teenagers, the film embroiders its commercial aspects with a political awareness that acts as social commentary: The narrative unfolds amidst the decline of the much-hated Institutional Revolutionary Party which governed the country until July 2000, and the three principal characters travel through a landscape scarred by poverty, yet enriched by its heritage and traditions.Verd\u00fa offers her sexual favors freely to the boys (for reasons which only become clear toward the end of the film), but her actions have unforeseen consequences which threaten to tear the two old friends apart. When confronted with the evidence of various infidelities, their anger - sparked by jealousy - hints at a twist in the tale which must have come as a terrific shock to its target audience (I'll say no more)! This is a movie which dares to tell the truth about sex and sexuality, not merely to provoke viewers (though the nudity is both generous and cheerful, and the beautiful Garc\u00eda Bernal has since become something of a gay icon and poster boy) but also to illuminate the motives which underpin the characters and their fragile relationship.

Invariably when I have seen a film with especially sordid unappealing characters, a lot of crude sex scenes, and a morally incoherent worldview, I know that the film will receive rave reviews from the sort of pseudo-intellectuals who think the presence of drugs and sex in a movie, along with a lack of dramatically satisfying resolution is somehow proof of a film's high merit. And I can see from many of the reviews here that I am sadly right.Y Tu Mama Tambien is a fairly schizoid film in that on the surface the story is of two spoiled brats whiling away summer break and their coastal trip with a sad young wife who is leaving her husband, but there is a constant subtext of commentary, some of it voice-over, some woven subtly into the story about contemporary Mexico, the disillusionment of young people with their world as well as general angst of the people with their nation.Unfortunately, the surface story is not very interesting. A lot of explicit sex scenes starring the two teenagers, Julio & Tenoch, cannot distract one from the fact that their characters, as well as the actors themselves, are, physically unattractive, dislikeable, and one-dimensional. As a result, the sex isn't even very sexy. The young woman, Luisa, is the only character in the film, other than some of the kindly villagers met during their trip, for whom I felt the slightest sympathy, and even she struck me as somewhat unbelievable. She alone seems to have something of a conscience, or to show concern for anyone other than herself. Julio and Tenoch evince no affection for their family members, no interest in anything outside of sex, nicotine and drugs, view women as receptacles, have no obligations of any sort---where are their parents? So, although Julio unlike Tenoch is not from a wealthy family, he seems to be remarkably free from responsibilities. Spending time watching them was painful, and I kept thinking, okay, surely there is something more to this film.On the other level, the one which seems to reach for some sort of political/economic/philosophical commentary, the movie didn't really work. The voice-overs imply that we can expect something deeper, some really pithy observations, but the story doesn't really deliver anything. The narrations serve to put distance between us and the drama. I couldn't see the point in observing what would happen in a traffic accident on the road in the past or the future, for example, yet it takes up time in the film. Once it became clear that these interruptions would not develop further, the film seemed increasingly amateurish.At the end I felt somewhat depressed at the narcissism and vacuousness of the lead characters and felt I'd been drinking from a septic tank.",

When looking at the movie cover and movie rating, perhaps the film seems like the Mexican version of a mix between Road Trip and American Pie, but after watching the film, deep life lessons can be found in the background of the picture.  After being enthralled with the message and theme of this movie, I was excited to test Linda Seger's theory, `Creating the Myth'.  I knew that most mainstream Hollywood movies would follow this theory, but was interested to see if this theory transcended both language and culture in this independent film. After the completion of Y Tu Mama Tambien an additional time, I was surprised to find that Linda Seger's `Healing Myth' theory truly explains the components Alfonso Cuaron's masterpiece. Before delving into the specific nature of the theory, describing the colloquialism of the movie helps explain the movie's cultural phenomenon. The audience is introduced in Spanish with subtitles to two Mexican teenagers, Tenoch and Julio, who are seemingly free for the summer after their girlfriends leave for a European vacation. Despite having to read subtitles the movie is easy to understand by the characters lively expressions and acting ability. Julio and Tenoch stumble across a beautiful woman, Luisa, who happens to be the wife of a distant cousin.  They lightheartedly invite her to go to a beach, really joking about it.  After Luisa finds out her husband has cheated on him, she agrees to go out on a road trip to a beach named Heaven's Mouth. On this journey, she seduces the teenagers and has sex with both of them. The sexuality of the film is realistic, which in no way is pornographic or crude, but rather honest and respectful.  In their journey to the beach, many scenes of the reality and blight of rural Mexican life can be seen through the windows of the old Volkswagen. People being searched at checkpoints, drug busts, deadly traffic accidents, and poor villagers walking the streets, all give the film an underlying message reminding that many people are left behind in rich economies, penniless and hopeless. Once reaching the beach, they are in paradise and relax and live in the beauty of nature. As the teenagers have to go home, Luisa decides to stay at the beach. The ending shocks the audience with a surprising twist.  It is revealed that Luisa knew she had had cancer and soon died after the guys left.  Much meaning is added to the movie after this realization is made and Luisa's character takes on a true mold of the healing myth. Seger's theory begins by stating, `All of us have similar experiences' (Seger 161). This theory therefore not only applies to American films, but all people in all cultures.  This is evident in seeing the two seventeen year old Mexican teenagers in this film.  The emotions, growing up, searching for oneself; all humans can relate to this. Although the film does not fit the popular mold of the Hero Myth, it fits the Healing Myth mold almost perfectly. The one-line description of this myth is `some character is 'broken' and must leave home to become whole again' (Seger 165).  Luisa, the attractive female is this broken person, who flees home for two main reasons.  The reason the audience is led to believe for most the film is because of her husband's affairs, she has left the life in Mexico to get away from her problems.  What the audience does not realize during the duration of the flick, is that Luisa is actually diagnosed with cancer, and is terminally ill.  Her need for rejuvenation and balance takes her to Heaven's Mouth and allows her to become whole again. She does this by simply living a life which is meaningful and seeking the truth. In telling colorful stories of old times and sucking the marrow out of all interactions, this allows her to become whole and ready to die. In realizing her frailty and death, she realizes the importance to live up to the ideal of  `living life to the fullest'. As Seger's theory gets more specific, it discusses the many ways the character can be broken.  Whether spiritual, physical, emotional, or even sexual, the journey which the character goes must heal the broken aspect of them. Luisa is broken on many levels.  The one that is apparent to the audience is the sexual and emotional brokeness.  She cries her self to sleep after she hears her husband has cheated on her and sexually misses his love and presence. This is the `outer wound' in a sense that the audience can see it. Just as the theory states, this outer wound forces Luisa into exile, which begins her process of transformation.  Seger discusses the `inner wound' as something that the character does not know about.  This is a different variation in the theory because in fact Luisa knows that she is suffering from cancer. The interesting twist is that the audience is the one who does not know about this wound and is hidden until the film's conclusion. Although this shows a difference from the theory and the film, it does not disprove the theory.  It is merely a trapping which is a product of the culture. As Seger states, `The trappings may be different, the twist and turns that create suspense might change from culture to culture,...but underneath it all, its the same story' (Seger 161). In noting this variation the audience can fully appreciate the beauty of the film's writing.  Although her cancer is a physical ailment, this brokeness is also inner due to the place she keeps it.  Luisa does not let cancer slow her down but rather she lifts herself to live life to the fullest. This transformation of the way she lives her life can inspire all people to break out of their shell and live everyday as if it were their last. The archetype present in the film also adds to the cultural phenomenon and proves Seger's theory in yet another way.  The archetypes, usually found in hero myths, are commonly present characters. Y Tu Mama Tambien does not have the typical archetype, in that it is not a character, but rather the narrator's voice who fits the archetype.  This archetype is the wise old man who provides the audience with special knowledge.  This part is essential to the success of the film. The narrator has an older, deep, calm, and soothing voice which gives the impression he is wise and intelligent.  The narrator's voice fills in all the gaps of the movie which are not said by the characters, which allows him to serve as the wise man for the audience. One example which summarizes the narrator's purpose happens during the long car trip. Suddenly the noise of the movie becomes silent for two seconds and the narrator's voice calmly comes in. The voice explains that the village they were passing was the village which Tenoch's nanny was born in.  His nanny was forced to leave the village alone at the age of thirteen to look for work because of the desperate poverty she was experiencing.  This really contrasts the two worlds present in Mexico, the rich upper class, and the marginalized poor.  Throughout the film the narrator's voice provides similar comments which opens the viewer to an entirely new insight of the often painful Mexican life. The narrator even reveals the secret of Luisa's cancer in the end. He then tells of the way she continued on with her life as balanced and full of energy. The narrator captures the essence of the film in his wise old man archetype which he beautifully fulfills. Balance in life is something that all people want, but do not necessarily seek out actively until it is too late.  Luckily for Luisa she balanced her life by simply taking a trip with two guys to a beach.  In this journey she learned life lessons of friendship, humor, compassion, pain and joy.  The movie has certain differences from the exact mold of the Healing Myth, but those minute differences do not affect the overall theory. Rather they add to the uniqueness and power of the movie. In closely following Seger's `Healing Myth', Luisa truly has been healed, maybe not from cancer, but healed from all worry and fear of the painful world, and she enjoys life as a blessing.",

Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN with one cinematic brush paints quite a critical and yet laughable picture of Mexican(much of Latin American?) culture. The two main  male characters are ever so subtly portrayed as  unwitting victims who have been sucked into the \"machine\" of National Idealism. This idealism does not ring true with their personal quite imperfect human relational experience. The main female character, though unwittingly wise , is yet a victim nonetheless as she identifies with the poor with whom she finds solace. I found the movie thoroughly delightful and laughed so hard that even the more revealing, erotic scenes(by some considered soft porn)only served to accentuate how deeply penetrating and pervasive\"lies\" of a society influence  the young, restless, brave and idealistic even in their more intimate moments...though they think they know better! I highly recommend this to anyone who wishes to view a first class cinematic \"event\", which may well become a classic in Mexican filmmaking.",

            "content": "A powder keg of epic proportions from Mexico that created controversy practically the world over with its intense situations, subject matter and its unbelievable creativity. \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" (translated as \"And Your Mother Too\") is the story of two young men in present-day Mexico (Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal) who have just graduated from high school and are looking for a hot summer without their girlfriends (Ana Lopez Mercado Ortega and Maria Aura Boullosa) who are traveling abroad in Europe during their time away from their studies. Luna and Bernal think the summer will be great, but soon they realize that may not end up being the case. The duo attend a wedding and meet sexy 30-something Spaniard Maribel Verdu (in an appropriately erotic and steamy performance). Soon the awkward teens who always seem to be drinking, smoking and doping are flirting with her and wanting her to come to the beach with them (a fictional place called Heaven's Mouth). She explains she is married (ironically to Luna's stuck-up cousin, played by the scene-stealing Juan Carlos Remolina Suarez) and the duo leave her alone. Very soon after the wedding Verdu learns the results of some medical tests and it is made apparent that something extremely serious is ailing the beauty. Trying to come to terms with her illness, she learns that Suarez has had multiple affairs and she sinks into a deep depression. Her fright and sadness turn around when she remembers the offer from the youngsters and she contacts them immediately. The duo believes that this is the best thing that could have ever happened. In spite of the fact that Heaven's Mouth does not exist, they do not let that small inconvenience stop them from having an opportunity to be with a hot older woman. In the U.S. cinema this would all point the way to a silly teenage road trip film with over-sexed boys on the prowl, but \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" is not like that at all. It is a trip that will forever alter the trio's lives, making them question their wants, their needs, their friendships, their relationships, their sexualities, their places in a complicated world and their futures. As all this goes on they find a Mexico that none have ever seen before, a place where drug dealers and cops have waged war for so long in some areas of the land that there is really no hope or happiness for those unlucky enough to be innocent bystanders. Poverty and uncertainty also plague many that the group pass along the way on a seemingly endless trip into something unknown. \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" may actually be the finest production to come out of Mexico. The Mexican cinema has always been mired for one reason or another because of various factors, but they took a huge step forward here. The three leads are revelations, with Verdu possibly becoming an international superstar (hopefully this will help her career the way \"Malena\" helped Monica Bellucci) by the film's emotion-packed finale. The Cuaron brothers (Alfonso, who also directed, and Carlos) developed a monumental screenplay (which brought them Oscar nominations) that has its peaks and valleys and actually plays like lives intertwining and touching (much like real-life situations). The script is one of the most brilliant I have ever encountered. Emmanuel Lubezki should also be given kudos for cinematography that almost acts as a fourth lead (the camera work just adds so much to this picture). Censorship has never been a big deal in Mexico with their cinema, but the government stepped in this time. This is a very rough film to sit through. There are excessive sexual scenes that push the envelope on most everything previously seen in the mainstream cinema. The movie was cut down to only about 75 minutes in one version (there should be about 105) and the Cuaron brothers decided against that when the opportunity arose to go international. The movie received no rating in the U.S. (it would have been an NC-17 easily) and due to that fact it became more of an art-house flick, a movie that very few saw and one that most in the typical viewing public had never heard about. In Mexico, \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" became an overnight sensation. It immediately became the country's largest money-maker ever and quite possibly the nation's most talked about production. Strangely the Academy failed to award this movie with a Best Foreign Language Film nomination (\"Talk to Her\" also failed that nomination). During a year where the Academy dropped the ball consistently (think \"Gangs of New York\"), the snubs to \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" may have been its largest mistake of all. Even though young people under 17 are sometimes advised to steer clear of a movie like this, it is truly apparent that those in that age group are the real ones trying to be reached. \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" teaches you to not always live in the present, but to plan for your future and to let where you are dictate where you are going. Near total excellence. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001)I wish I had seen this movie when it came out. In 2010, it's daring subject matter doesn't mean as much socially or personally. It's just not as daring as it might have been a decade ago, though in Latin America it will still surprise a lot of viewers, who are still dealing with issues of homosexuality outside of the celebrity and gay counterculture spheres. That is, this movie is about sexuality, very openly, among exceedingly normal people.Some points.1) It has a casual filming style, with jittery camera, ambient light, and location shoots.2) The actors (two very young men and a slightly older woman) are as unrehearsed as possible, at least in appearances.3) It's a road trip movie that doesn't romanticize or create theatrical drama. Instead it makes it seem like it really could be, or really was, a road trip just as shown.4) If you take it literally, you might be bored. You might wonder why these somewhat ordinary people on a very ordinary day have to offer that is worth the two hours of screen time. (I say somewhat ordinary because the three are all \"beautiful people\" and are not at all ordinary. This is really a fault, conceptually, but a reality for most filmmakers trying to draw an audience.)5) A voice-over will interrupt the flow of the characters on their trip in a highly affected way (even the background sounds and the dialog are muted). This allows the film to give us information that might not be available otherwise.6) It all matters because of the end. What happens in the last couple scenes begins at first to seem predictable, almost too delayed given the length of their trip and the obvious sexual needs of all three of them. But then it twists, and it's the twist that matters (and the twist that might not have the punch it once did).I had trouble getting absorbed. I watched it with a native Spanish speaking woman who was much more taken with the mise-en-scene created by the ordinary Mexican landscape and interiors and even by the banter in the car. I was busy reading subtitles (there is a lot to read). But beyond that, I think if you want something to \"happen\" you will mostly be impatient or bored. If you can get into an unidealized road trip and just learn something about the characters you might find it a special, sincere movie. All the unfancy filming and realistic acting and script have the big purpose of making the final turns in the movie convincing, and convincing to an ordinary viewer. That's key. The sexual content, which includes some very uncensored material (two men masturbating on diving boards, nothing hidden, for example), is meant to be the sexual reality of the common viewer. So that homosexuality, or even the hint of it, becomes simply an acceptable alternative, or something that exists and has to be grappled with, or is to be found within, large or small.That makes the movie important. It might not pull it off perfectly, but it does have an edge and a depth matters.",

In fact, many film snobs immediately assume something artistic and deep must be going on because they see a film with subtitles and unknown foreign actors.This movie has been hailed as an amazing insight into Mexican culture and politics. However, any cultural elements explored here are so general, they could be applied to just about any country around the world. Yes, there are class differences and income differences in Mexican society. Some people are more privileged that others. Big surprise. Apparently teenage boys in Mexico are incredibly horny and will have sex with just about anything that resembles a woman. Uh, I think that's kind of a universal truth around the world. Sometimes Mexico, like every other country, goes through periods of political turmoil. This is rather vaguely hinted at in the film and isn't an amazing revelation.The movie's rather obvious observations are compounded by the three main characters' annoying and empty-headed personalities. These are definitely not deep thinking individuals. Julio and Tenoch exhibit the \"macho\" attitude and homophobia one would find in teenage boys just about anywhere. So we're stuck with nearly two hours of their sexual ramblings as they drive through the Mexican countryside with their older female companion Luisa. Luisa is certainly the most interesting and likable character of the bunch. At first we think she's a confused, middle-aged woman with a dissolving marriage looking for a mindless fling with two young men. It's painfully obvious early on that her relationship with them will be a sexually charged one. The plot twist at the end of the film, where we discover she was aware cancer would claim her life soon, at least brings a little depth and intrigue to her character. Which is more than one can say for anyone else in this film. Also, the homosexual encounter between Julio and Tenoch is not much of a surprise either. Sometimes the most macho and homophobic guys can have homosexual tendencies. It almost feels as if this scene was added just for shock value, rather than to say something meaningful.This isn't a road trip movie or coming of age movie. In the end there's not much of a feeling that the characters have grown or changed (with the possible exception of Luisa). I don't see it as much of a character study either, because we're stuck with three uninteresting, unintelligent central characters. The conclusion of the film is certainly its strongest point and at least helps to give the feeling the movie was trying to say something insightful, even if it fails miserably.",

But Alfonso Cuaron was able to turn it into a Mexican drama.Set in around the year 1999, two teenagers, Julio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) from Mexico's elite have to say goodbye to their girlfriends going travelling in Europe. Both are oversexed and take drugs, and are preparing to go to university. In the summer their are bored very quickly, and at a wedding they flirt with an older Spanish woman, Luisa (Maribel Verd\u00fa) and invite her to join them on a trip to the beach Heaven's Mouth. It's a mystery on whether it even exists. What take's the boys by surprise is when Luisa accepts their offer and they have to make some quick arrangements. On the trip through rural Mexico the boys tells stories of their sex lives and become more and more interested in Luisa, who is depressed about her live. On their trip they see poverty that rural Mexicans suffer, the changes to the nations and their own friendship is tested.The film is classified as a comedy. I personally see it as a drama with some comedic elements. It is a tale of friendship which also acts as a social commentary about the youth of Mexican and the social elites (they suffer the same issues as anyone else). It also shows wider themes about Mexican life and the issues facing the nation.The winning features of the film are the performances and the direction. Bernal, Luna and Verdu are fine actors, ending up doing other excellent films after Y Tu Mama Tambien. Cuaron is a man who gets the best out of his actors; just look at some of his other films to see this. All free actors make you believe in their characters and have tough roles to play. You end up caring for the character, a tough job because Julio and Tenoch are not very likable.Alfonso Cuaron is one of the best directors around at the moment, making the best of the Harry Potter films and the excellent Children of Men. He has such a great approach to this film, allowing the camera to follow the characters and action, using tracking shots and focusing in and out. He rarely cuts, which is refreshing in today's climate. The action feels more natural and the takes a Kubrickian approach. Cuaron makes you interested in to fairly unlikeable character. I personally see Cuaron as one of my top 3 options to direct the next Bond film.If you like this film, I also recommend the Motorcycle Diaries.This is a worthy film.",

Yes, there is some strong sexual content, although not really on the X-rated level. But that doesn't make you interested. The boys are just irritating, behaving in many ways like 13-years-olds more than like they were 18. One can't see why the woman, all right performed by Maribel Verd\u00fa, takes interest, although she has reasons for escaping her life.This is not very sexy. It's not good neither as a narration of teenager's life or the life of \"the mature woman\". You get glimpses of another Mexico, with demonstrations, military patrols and so on, but you don't get concerned and so aren't the boys or the woman.This is a disappointment.",

            "content": "Viewers familiar with Mexico and it's sociopolitical environment will probably get more out of this film than the average, less-informed person. Still, there is much to enjoy and appreciate for those who only want to (or can) examine the personal relationships of the film. Luna and Bernal are two teenage boys whose girlfriends are taking off for an extended holiday in Italy. After some frisky goodbyes, the boys are left on their own to while away their summer. (This includes activities like smoking pot, drinking, masturbating and just generally goofing around.) When they stumble upon a more sophisticated older woman (the wife of Luna's cousin) and skittishly ask her to join them on a road trip, the film, and the boys' sense of awareness, takes on a more profound tone. The woman (Mercado) surprises the boys by accepting (after hitting a speed bump with her husband) and the boys are forced to come through on what was really a tall tale spun in order to impress her. The threesome sets out across Mexico and proceed to explore each other's thoughts, feelings and, in some cases, bodies en route to a little-known (possibly imaginary) beach called Heaven's Mouth. While it can be argued that not a lot happens during the course of the film, there is actually quite a bit going on. The boy characters (who at the start threaten to be little more than Beavis and Butthead, but who eventually are fleshed out more thoroughly) are forced to peel off their veneer of superficiality regarding themselves, for better or worse. Mercado is the catalyst that provokes this, but she learns a lot about herself in the process as well. The entire film is presided over by a dry, wry narrator whose comments are insightful and both poignant and amusing. The language in the film is crass, but realistic. As the trio covers Mexican terrain, many glimpses of the people are shown in the background. Here (and in the beginning when the class structure of the leads is noted) is where a working knowledge of the country can come in handy for more enhanced viewing. Poverty, militant force and solicitation are shown to be as common as birds on a telephone wire. One element that will likely either attract viewers or shock them is the blunt, casual approach to the sexuality of the film. The scenes, however, are mostly refreshingly fun and natural (as opposed to the overly serious gymnastics that can be found in so many American thrillers and dramas.) The dynamics of the three leads' relationship takes a major turn when a little too much tequila opens up a realm of heretofore unexplored emotions. This leads to a rather downbeat finale, but the film offers many visual and verbal pleasures along the way and does hang in the memory when it's over.",

            "content": "Mild spoilers follow.If I have a complaint it's that Luisa (Maribel Verd\u00fa) is hardly the stunning fantasy catch the two boys take her to be. Too skinny, with an unreal face and obviously fake breasts, her natural beauty is still barely discernable, from time to time, but for the most part the only people likely to be attracted to her are those who have been trained to think they ought to be. It comes as a shock to see just one asolescent, let alone two (that is, ALL the male adolescents we get to meet at all) falling for her.Yet perhaps this is exactly right. Julio and Tenoch have been so trained that it seems they scarcely have any natural impulses left at all. As we travel through rural Mexico we see, everywhere, the police intimidating the poor; the camera lingers on such scenes as though trying (and failing) to get a clear picture of exactly what's going on, but the two boys do not; their natural curiosity, which might bring them into contact with something unpleasant, is all but dead. Even their natural lust is all but dead. They pursue sex as though participating in a formal game, and they don't seem to care about this set of rules rather than that very much. When Luisa rewrites the rules - by explicitly reading out a new set, one by one - it's fine by them.The voice-overs are wonderfully managed. They're really a natural extension of the camera work I mentioned earlier: just as the camera turns to look at the social context or some other detail that commands our attention simply because it's interesting or important in its own right, even though \"the action\" is elsewhere, so too does the narrator. One critic called this a \"distancing\" technique, which is surely wrong. I doubt we could be so immersed without it. Besides which, \"Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n\" is yet another illustration of the general principle: first-person narration is usually the kiss of cinematic death, third-person narration usually is not.",

The surface layer of a coming-of-age road-movie with good dialogue and frank treatment of sex is fairly good -- well acted, beautifully shot, etc.One level down is the real Mexico. I liked this one better; with the bits and pieces of information scattered around, one can still get a pretty good sense about the social contrasts in Mexico.  A whole \"Germinal\" is hidden in these hints, and this would have been a pretty good movie even if that was all there was to it.But hidden even deeper is a grand tragedy on the scale of Ancient Greeks. (Some previous comments described it as a melodrama, but this was subtle and so craftily done that it is tragedy for me :)  What would you do if you had only a month to live?  Luisa has a luxury of an unhappy marriage and a cheating husband away from home (whom she still cares about) and an opportunity to have some good time with two teenage boys.  But does she have the right to be manipulative only because she is dying?

Having been brought up in the United States and having attended the public schools I am no stranger to the phenomenon of teenaged boys being teenaged boys, having been there and done that myself, including the hazy, sunny obligatory motor trip to Tijuana and points south. But what struck me while watching this fascinating film was how very like the guys I went to school with are Tenoch and Julio. In fact I was a little reminded of the song \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\" by Paul Simon. Not much would have to be changed to see this as an American movie about young people in America near the end of the 20th century.But this is about Mexico and it takes place in Mexico and even though Julio and Tenoch rag on \"Team America\" there is no doubt that their lives and the styles they copy and take as their own are enormously influenced by American culture, for better or for worse.Gael Garcia Bernal who previously starred in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's Amores perros (2000) plays Julio, who is from a middle class family. Diego Luna plays his friend Tenoch (named after Tenochtitlan, Aztec founder of Mexico City) who is the son of a prominent Mexican politician. Both boys live the kind of lives of plenty and privilege that the average Mexican can only dream about. And so there is a certain decadent and hedonistic quality to the way they embrace life. But what director Alfonso Cuaron captures with these boys and their adventure to an imaginary beach with an older woman is the zest of youth that throws itself wildly and madly into sex, drugs and the search for experience and the fulfillment of youthful urges. What they learn from Luisa (Maribel Verdu) is something most young men really lust after, that is, how to please a woman sexually--well, at least they experience a first course.Cuaron shows us teenaged boys as teenaged boys are: raunchy, randy, irreverent, and as a old army sergeant used to say, \"young and dumb and full of...\" you-know-what. Well, not dumb. Both boys are sharp and quick to learn about life, and as the movie ends and they go their separate ways, we know that both will go on to college and make a good life for themselves. In this sense this is a coming of age movie with Lusia as mentor to the boys.Looking at the movie a little more deeply we have to ask, why does Lusia go on the trip with Tenoch and Julio, and why does she let herself go, so to speak? We learn that her husband has cheated on her (again, by the way) and had the temerity to call her up immediately after the fact and confess. Later we learn that she has an even more compelling reason to indulge herself in a youthful fling. (But of course you should see the movie to find out what that is.) The sense of freedom and naturalness that Cuaron captures, not only in the area of human sexuality, but in the spirit of a vast country moving from a largely agrarian society to an industrial one, and the bewilderment that such rapid change makes people feel, is made especially vivid by the focus on the young, since they are the ones moving the fastest. (Of course this focus doesn't hurt at the box office, since young people make up the bulk of viewers, in Mexico as elsewhere.) However, despite what some reviewers have suggested, this movie addresses Mexican poverty in only a token way. This is a movie about privileged Mexicans who could, as I intimated above, pass for Americans or Europeans with only a minor cultural shift.Be forewarned that the sexuality shown here is about as graphic as any you'll see this side of an X rating, which is okay with me. Certainly it is better than the usual violence that Hollywood serves up. In fact I hope this movie triggers a change in the movie industry away from the belief that you have to titillate the mass audience with violence in order to be successful. Sex will do just fine.Bottom line: a vital, vivid romp that will delight especially the young. Clearly this is not a movie for prudes or social conservatives--and that's an understatement!(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

They all have the same structure of travelling by car, insipid dialogues and a lot of long, boring travelogue footage of the Mexican countryside. On top of this is the story of two 17-year old kids that are Mexico's intellectual rivals of Beavis and Butthead, who are hot on the trail of the clueless 28-year old wife ( Maribel Verdu) of the cousin of one of the two dumbheads, who has the bright idea of following these two jerks to a far-off beach called Boca del Cielo, spiced with some insipid sex-scenes, a lot of crude bodily functions, all done in the spirit of trying to be \"original\" and \"shocking\", sentiments that are never reached by Cuaron's pedestrian directing and total absense of close-ups in one of the dullest films of the year. Near the end of the film there is a scene in an outdoor eatery where the camera holds on a long shot of the three main characters for what must be four or five minutes of the longest, most boring sequence we have seen in a long time. Cuaron must have gone to sleep when he shot this sequence and forgot to yell \"cut!\" To wrap it up, the film has absolutely nothing going for it except for the soft-core titillation of some sequences that don't really amount to much and the empty ramblings of the three main characters. And what is really ridiculous is that the filmmakers decided to add a voice-over narration that has all the makings of an after-thought that is the most annoying, self-conscious tripe of \"social awareness\" bs that we have seen, especially since it has absolutely nothing to do with the \"story\" at hand. Ironically, this film, which has absolutely no interesting story-line and looks as if it were improvised in its totality, received the \"Best Screenplay\" award in the recent Venice Film Festival and the Beavis and Butthead couple of young actors (Gael Garcia and Diego Luna) received the Marcelo Mastroianni Acting Award, which says a lot about these overblown festivals...",

Basically two bored, rich Mexican adolescents (they look to be about 18 or 19 years old) go on a car trip to the beach with a good-looking babe in her 30s who is fleeing from her pathetic excuse for a husband. These two guys are perfect imitations of Beavis and Butt-head: they're dim-witted, profane, keep up a constant stream of stupid, crude sexual jokes and love to masturbate together. The very idea that the pretty, sophisticated Luisa would want to spend even one minute with those two pathetic losers, let alone go on a road trip with them, is absurd. The rest of the movie is what can only be described as a realization of a Beavis and Butt-head wet-dream, having the pretty Luisa join in their constant and raunchy adolescent humor and initiate sex with them. When I saw reviews of this movie I thought that Luisa somehow helps the boys become more mature. But instead Luisa starts acting and talking like sex-obsessed adolescent herself. *The spoiler.* In the end she wades off into the sea like a mermaid and the two boys return home and continue being perpetual children. I am including this spoiler to warn anybody who may have thought that something besides a string of dirty jokes might actually happen before this overly long movie ends. Perhaps the filmmakers thought they were showing that the 60s vision of \"The People's Guide to Mexico\" has finally come to a generation of Mexican youth. Besides that, there seems to be no meaning or message in this movie. The sex scenes are always frantic and repulsive. It's soft core porn, but without the erotic ambiance. In any case I'm writing this to warn anybody who may have been snowed by positive reviews by liberal critics whose aspirations may be secretly adolescent themselves. And, by the way, who often complain that there's not enough movies being made for grownups. There are no grownup characters in this movie.",

Most of the movie consists of long, explicit dialogues about the sexual exploits and chemical habits of the leading male characters, who seem to be little more than moronic schoolboys with no apparent motive to do anything other than to devote themselves to the pursuit of every depravity they can think of.  Some of the scenes in which they actually pursue their wretched pleasures are so vulgar that I would probably be censored if I attempted to describe them here.  Sex is reduced to an act of elimination, and words are chiefly useful to describe one's last or next or best act.In a vain attempt to give the film \"meaning\", voiceover narration is jarringly superimposed over the soundtrack to tell us about the terrible fates or hidden pasts of the characters on the screen.  These interludes do little more than force an extra helping of bathos and morbidity onto an already very depressing picture.  The final scene, too, is contrived and cheap, too little and too late to rescue the viewer from the banality of the previous 100 or so minutes.If there seemed to be any real joy or genuine pleasure to the lifestyle of the principal characters, the overall message would be \"eat drink and be merry\".  As it is, though, the film comes across like an infomercial for suicide.If you are the kind of viewer who must be shocked or titillated by a film in order to get anything out of it, then this might be a good film for you to see.

Still though, their juvenile credo including points like \"pop beats poetry,\" farting in the car, and drunken antics weren't all that interesting to me. The sex stuff is a little overdone too, including feverishly screwing their girlfriends before they depart, jerking off together into the pool (ugh), having sex with the woman on the trip, and exploring their own bisexuality - the last of which may be a surprise to them, but probably not to us after some of the earlier build-up. There is probably authenticity in all of this but I would have liked the film more had director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n reined it in a little.To me the little moments out the car window that the narrator tells us about are some of the film's best, informing us of events in the past, present, or future, and most of all reminding us that life is transient, and that the road trip is just a brief moment in time, all of which sets the stage for that brilliant ending.

The sex scenes were so natural and sometimes funny that I forgot them untill I saw Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n a second time. 10 out of 10 .",

            "content": "Julio (Bernal) and Tenoch (Luna) are typical arrogant seventeen year old boys whose girlfriends have gone away to Europe. Bored and sexually frustrated, they invite an attractive older woman (Verdu) on a road trip to a beach that doesn't exist in order to try and seduce her. Startlingly she accepts. As the days progress, the boys' relationship with Luisa develops and they soon find themselves entangled in a lecherous love triangle. An intoxicating fusion of sex, friendship, politics and death, Y Tu Mama Tambien is a mix of sober realism with carefree fun. While an omniscient voice narrates the past present and future of seemingly meaningless background events, the boys continue their trip, oblivious to all but their own libidos. Although skilfully executed through voice overs, the political statement doesn't quite cement with the main storyline as intended. An interesting watch, if you are patient enough to handle the slow moving storyline but it does feel like Alfonso Cuaron is trying a bit too hard to be arty and missing out on simple clarity. After opening into an explicit sex scene, you're bombarded with names and background information and spend the next few scenes trying to work out who's who, when it really doesn't matter. Well worth a watch though, if only for the exceptionally well written characters. The boys are especially believable and development of Luisa's character from fragile tag-along to free spirit is well-paced. Good\u0085 nothing special but worth watching nonetheless.",

Although sexually explicit, the film does not cater to prurient interests to increase box office receipts, but is always fully believable as a true depiction of how adolescents think and feel. The voice-over narration allows us to step back and see a bigger picture of the world that surrounds the characters as they drive through the Mexican countryside, so it becomes more than just a look at self-absorbed characters existing in their own little world.Y Tu Mama Tambien is filled with joy and celebration and also a touch of sadness. The film has the kind of liberating quality that I have not seen in cinema in years. In Y Tu Mama Tambien, Cuaron has transcended the limitations of the \"coming of age\" genre to make a film that is universal in its message about young people and the transitory nature of life.  I strongly recommend it.",

            "content": "Often described as one part buddy-film, one part road-film, and one part coming-of-age film, Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN offers the story of two teenage wannabe studs who coax a slightly older and somewhat more sophisticated woman into a road trip to the beach--never dreaming that the woman might have a personal agenda of her own. The premise is hardly an original one, but in the hands of director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and a truly remarkable cast the result is absolutely astonishing.As a number of people have pointed out, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal) are not entirely likable characters: they are thoughtless, self-indulgent, crass, and rarely think above their belts or beyond the next joint. But their encounter with Ana (Ana Morelos) will shake them out of their adolescent-inspired sense of superiority in more ways than one: as their friendly rivalry for Ana's favors escalates into open jealousy, their revelations demonstrate that they are no less hypocritical than the pompous and corrupt adult society against which they so pointedly rebel.The film is unexpectedly satirical, neatly adopting a \"boys will be boys\" smile and then quietly but sharply undercutting it by transient images of poverty, decay, and death that the trio encounter as they move out of their rather sheltered existences in Mexico City and travel the backroads to the sea--images that the boys ignore with a youthful zeal but which foreshadow and then underscore the series of punches the film delivers at its conclusion. The cast is impressive, with Luna and Bernal the very image of thoughtless, vulgar youth, while Morelos is remarkable as Ana, a woman in her late twenties who seems to be fleeing from a faithless husband and seeking revenge in casual sex but who secretly has a still more weighty motive behind her actions.The film has a great deal of nudity and sexual activity; there is also considerable drug use and profanity. A great deal has been made of that, and particularly of the intense kiss between Luna and Bernal--but ultimately Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN is less about sex, drugs, and youthful excess than it is about responsibility in relationships and how failure to keep trust can have devastating consequences in platonic, romantic, and sexual relationships. The DVD package is quite nice, with several interesting bonuses, and although the subtitles are in white they are easy to read. Overall, an impressive film--but one perhaps best viewed by middle-agers with some perspective than by the youth it satirizes. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",

Luisa is married to Tenoch's adult cousin and she hasn't seen Tenoch in about a decade, and she's never laid eyes on Julio before.  In the scene where the three of them meet, the guys come off as completely silly and juvenile, i.e., not the kind of boys most women like Luisa would go on a long jaunt with.   Basically they ask her like this:\"Hey, um, wanna drop everything in your life right now and go for a real long multi-day drive with us to a beach?\"\"Okay.\"Um, right.The director also employs a strange device in the form of frequent voice-over narration to convey information, during which all other sound oddly ceases.And if gratuitous sex scenes, frontal nudity and bodily excretions are your idea of a good ol' time at the movies, then run right out and see this film. Within the first hour we get to watch: a flatulence duel; each guy graphically boink his girlfriend; each guy take a leak (in the most graphic depictions I've ever seen, and both times it has nothing to do with the plot); our heroes appraise each other's penises (with some frontal nudity so we GET THE POINT); our heroine squat to relieve herself in an open field; and a sort of masturbation duel that is unrealistic to the point of ridiculousness and culminates in a gross- out denouement that had people in the audience I saw it with groaning.Mr. Cuaron seems to have stumbled upon a brand new style of filmmaking which we could dub \"toiletism\".  Most directors have enough faith in us to assume we possess sufficient common sense to know that the characters relieve themselves at some point, but Mr. Cuaron wants to make ABSOLUTELY SURE that we know the characters in his movie pee and fart. Hence, he shows us.  If this guy had made The Maltese Falcon, we'd have to watch Sam Spade piss a few times just to make sure we remember he has a bladder.If tastelessness is your gig, then by all means see this movie.

            "content": "Alfonso Cuaron is an extremely talented director, all his films to date have proved that. 'Children of Men' is especially good, have always have had a huge soft spot for 'A Little Princess', 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is one of the best directed films of the 'Harry Potter' franchise and as polarising as 'Gravity' is there is no denying that Cuaron's direction and the visuals were exceptional.'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is not quite Cuaron's best and is not for everybody, as can be seen by the reviews here. While not everything works, to me 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' was a near-masterpiece of a film. It is a little slow at the beginning that one is almost deterred from watching further. The second flaw is that while amusing and informative at times the deadpan narration (one of the components that has garnered the biggest mix of love and hate) is a little heavy-handed and over-explanatory, it could have been used less and wasn't always necessary.Just for the record have nothing against narration. There are instances has been used well in film (a notable recent example was 'Gone Girl' where it was crucial to the story) but others where it has been poorly done (the animated film 'Rock a Doodle' for instance had very annoying narration).However, 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is a beautifully made film. The scenery is absolutely majestic and the clever and often dazzling photography, which has Cuaron's stylistic touches all over it, complements it brilliantly. Nothing to complain about Cuaron's directing either, he is a master of visuals and mood and interaction and conflicts are also brought out believably.Scripting has a great mix of humour, emotion and insight. Parts of 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' are very funny, others are genuinely moving and it has a lot to say about society, the economy and such and all in an insightful way. Much of it is very uplifting too. The same can be said for the story, which has a slow start but once it gets going and if stuck with it's very absorbing and layered. The sex scenes are raunchy and sensual, not feeling gratuitous or misplaced.Characters have been criticised for not being likable, in a way that's true but there are times where it is clear that they weren't meant to be. They are however compelling in their realism and relatable. Luisa is the most interesting and most well-developed. The acting is strong, Maribel Verdu in particular being a revelation though Gael Garcia Bernal proves himself to be a rising star.In conclusion, a great film and a near-masterpiece. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This movie has been called \"sexy and funny\" by more people than I can count, and that pretty much sums up the bulk of it. A touching coming-of-age road story (but this time in Mexico rather than the US) follows two horny teenage friends and an attractive woman as they search for (and serendipitously find) Heaven's Mouth, the idyllic beach of dreams that is empty, open, and a realm of passion.Their story is backed up by a subplot of national instability. Politics and class dissolution follow them everywhere, but like the teenagers they are they are only caught up in their own ideals, the world of sex, friendship, and the wonderful ability to not care actually care for truth. The woman who follows them craves that freedom, but is also pulled by the allure of remembrance for her lost lover from an age gone by, and the three strike a pretty stunning relationship with the wide, colorful Mexican landscape.Director Alfonso Cuaron is not only good at directing action but sustaining drama through long takes of emotional imbalance. This movie's editing focuses the narration very well on the actual movements through space of the characters in ways that preordains the showy later cinematography of Children of Men--this time, though, it's for dramatic effect rather than action. And dramatic it is.I can't say I like the hand-held cinematography that much. Hand-held cinematography is a very hard effect to pull off well and in this one it was sometimes more distracting than it should have been. Cuaron definitely knows how to use it, and it's good to see that over the years he's getting more comfortable with the technique. He should already be considered a great director, but if he keeps up his improvement I won't even have to argue the point.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "This was the film which for me marked the coming of age of the Mexican film industry. Since I cannot claim to have kept up with all their productions, and also recognise that it is often not easy to appreciate films offered in a language different from ones own, my impression might be hard to justify; but I have no doubt that this is an unusually fine film. Its main theme of two adolescent males coming of age sexually has been overworked recently, but such U.S. films as the \"Porky's\" series or \"Fast times at Ridgemount High\",or even the Canadian \"Loving and Laughing\" are all very immature in comparison with YTMT. Julio and Tenoch, the two lads here, are not looking for a first conquest - in fact they seem to be quite sexually active before the story begins; but they are very excited when Luisa, a somewhat older married relative who has just found out that her husband has been straying yet again, agrees to go with them on a road trip to an imaginary beach, the Boca del Cielo on the distant coast. Most of the film is the story of this trip. On the level of personal relationship we see how the influence of this older woman gradually makes the two teenagers aware of how immature their own behaviour has been, and how they can develop more meaningful relationships with companions. This is combined with a great deal of social commentary on the state of Mexican society which is provided indirectly through a series of incidents that occur whilst they are on the road. One of the two comes from a very well to do home, the other from a middle class one, and their family backgrounds are also observed by the director Alfonso Cuaron with a very sharp but not unkind eye. His direction is quite exceptional throughout, with the same type of keen eye that Spanish Director Pedro Almodovar often shows, but without needing a collection of rather way out characters to make his various points as Almodovar so often does. His characters are real and rounded, and they behave in a very believable way. Beyond this, we are shown the nature of Mexican society; we see extreme inequality between classes resulting in rather heavy handed behaviour by the police. We are also shown the detrimental but indirect impact of an unstable economy, and the hope brought to many in the poorer classes when the long ruling Revolutionary Party were finally ousted from power in 2000.There is a lot in this film but it has no dramatic climax, it simply shows the ongoing character development of the two lads who mature in a most believable way through the many new experiences they share. No attempt is made to suggest that magical changes have taken place in a matter of mere days, all that is shown is the gradually development of a greater awareness which will eventually result in real character changes. After their trip they separate to begin to build careers of their own, but in the final scene they meet again briefly some time later, and we see that although this process of maturing has continued on an ongoing basis it is still far from complete. In a very brief but quite dramatic sequence we also learn why the young woman who went with them on the trip decided to take them under her wing in this way.Mention must also be made of the photography which is exceptional and was rightly nominated for an award - a few of the sequences shown may have been a little too uninhibited for some viewers but the R rating given to the film by the MPAA should provide these individuals with adequate warning. For a long time it remained unrated and could only be seen in Art House theatres or on DVD's. Many thought this was because of fears that the MPAA might give it a NC-17 rating. I was happy to note that this did not occur.",

            "review_title": "Cuar\u00f3n Revisited",
            "content": "When Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n made his first feature, \"S\u00f3lo con tu pareja\", he was considered one of the hopefuls who would revive Mexican cinema's past glories, but the chances for developing film projects are few in Latin American countries, and some of their best filmmakers have gone Hollywood, including Cuar\u00f3n. After doing new versions of \"The Little Princess\" and \"Great Expectations\", he went back to Mexico and made \"Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n\", a film that proved he was among the best talents working in world cinema. With his brother Carlos, he co-wrote both his first film and this fragmentary, good film that has different levels of interpretation. First it can be seen as a common sex-crazed youth comedy, but it belongs more appropriately to the anti-genre mode, as Robert Altman's caustic \"O.C. & Stiggs\". Both films use elements from that sub-genre to comment on the status quo, class relations, sexual politics, warring ideologies and ecology. \"Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n\" goes beyond that, thanks to a narrator who comments on everything Mexican and human, making it a universal reflection on existence. Also, the movie confronts moral values and iconography when it deals with sex, showing what most films suppress or sublimate. Second, it also works as a \"rite de passage\" psychological melodrama, and as a film about gender confusion, which has been a fashionable topic for too long now. Wisely it does not capitalize on it as other films have done. The truth simply hits the two male leads, Julio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna), when they find themselves engaged in sex with Luisa, a foreign lady (Maribel Verd\u00fa) and with each other. But my favorite and most attractive level is a third one, in which I see its story as a metaphor of the predatory work done by the national and international agents of globalization in the so-called underdeveloped countries. This reading may be more meaningful to a Latin American, but the elements are there to consider its validity. The three main characters are introduced within their social, ideological and economic frames. The boy from upper middle class (Julio) who follows orders to keep up with the rich and powerful; the rich boy (Tenoch) who will follow the work of his elders, and the foreign lady (Luisa) whose initial attraction to the \"New World kids\" later becomes disdain, imposition of her rules and control over their bodies and souls. For some Luisa is the most endearing character: I find her rapacious and two-faced, often hiding her motivations. My appreciation of this character is not caused by xenophobia or misogyny: it is simply based on my own direct observation of many international agents (male or female) working in Latin America. The three meet in the overblown wedding of a bourgeois couple, with the Mexican President as a guest of honor. Then they make a trip through the Mexican landscape where they witness the inner culture that market economy erodes in most countries. The cultural devastation finds barriers in countries with strong millenarian cultures, as Mexico. In this scenario, it's not a surprise that Tenoch decides to study economics, that Luisa is a Spaniard who is rotten inside (it does not matter if she is out of scene in the end, more agents will come to follow her work), and that Julio has not yet found a way to subsist in this ever-changing situation, with middle class in impoverishing conditions, due to ruthless economic measures taken by governments and international financing agencies. When the three engage in sexual rites, these acts have a striking effect on them. Sex -as suggested by Pasolini, Reich or De Sade- has a corrosive effect on \"bad consciousness\". What the Cuar\u00f3n brothers show is what is happening outside the minds and illusory, comfortable and acclimatized environments of the rich and famous, and their sycophants in the middle sectors. The Cuar\u00f3ns are brave enough to show it without palliatives. Bravo! 10/10.",

No matter how good things seem at any given point in time, it's all going to turn to radioactive crap and everybody knows it.This movie is a pretty good illustration of the speaker's point. It's a very good movie too.These two teenage boys are good friends, cheerful, vulgar, dopers, who have created a club of their own with a code consisting of some ten points. The points are perfectly down to earth. \"You shall not make love to your boyfriend's girlfriend.\" That sort of thing, only phrased in an earthier fashion, as are the subtitles. \"Chin-GA, tu mama!\" It starts off as a lot of fun. The two kids meet a beautiful young woman and they agree to make a cross-country trip to the beach at Puerto Escondido. The woman has a partner from whom she is temporarily (then permanently) separated. The two roustabouts each have a girl friend, both of them touring Italy for the summer.The trip in the station wagon begins like a kind of \"On the Calle\", everybody laughing and smoking and drinking and talking dirty. (The nubile slightly older woman blends right in.) The dialogue is amusing in its own quietly raunchy way. The audience is having fun too, perhaps anticipating the explicit sex scenes that were touted as a major feature of this film on its release. Well, the sex scenes come along alright -- both of them -- but its simulated intercourse involving little nudity, and the movie is much too good to be thought of as just a frame for someone's bare buns. And they do not signal any sort of life affirmation either, just a failed attempt at it.The story is linked together by a literate narrator, so the audience is aware of a discerning intelligence behind the half-articulated ululations we hear on screen. For instance, we have a shot through the windshield of the road ahead, as the station wagon weaves in and out of some low, dry, rolling hills. If the car and its passengers had passed this point some weeks earlier, the narrator tells us blankly, they would have encountered a mess of white feathers. Ten yard farther and they would have seen dozens of chicken flapping around on the pavement. Another fifty yards and they would have seen a truck lying on its side. There would have been two bodies beside the cab. And so on. And the camera picks up a couple of those white crosses and plastic flowers that one finds in Mexico, marking the site of a fatal highway accident. And the camera pans from the windshield, through the side windows of the stations wagon, following the makeshift monument as it recedes into the distance. The two boys and the girl don't know any of this of course. They don't even recognize the signals when they pass a funeral cort\u00e8ge walking on the side of the road, carrying a casket to the town graveyard. And so it goes. The girl sleeps with one of the boys, trying to spread love around, so to speak, and being earnest about it too. It's not played for laughs. The other boy spots them and sulks. So she makes it with him as well, trying to heal the rift, but it's never quite the same after that. Barbed secrets about violations of the code are hurled back and forth. They finally reach the beach and are befriended by a fisherman's family who take the three tourists by boat on a visit to distant beaches. The narrator informs us that the relaxed fisher family will be soon displaced by huge hotels and the father will wind up working as a janitor. The camp on the beach is disrupted by a horde of hogs, who will soon be slaughtered and whose flesh will cause an epidemic of trichinosis. The girl makes love to both boys at the same time, while they kiss one another. She stays behind, knowing she is dying of cancer. The boys do not see one another for a year, and then only for a few minutes over coffee, with no signs of any lingering friendship.Now -- I've made this sound pretty bleak, and in a way it is. But still, the movie is enjoyable and often funny. It avoids melodrama deftly. (Eg., we don't hear about the girl's cancer until the end of the movie, by which time she's long out of the picture.) It isn't what happens on screen that is tragic. It's that damned patient narrator, explaining to us that this too, no matter whether it's good or bad, shall also pass. The narrator's tone of voice is dispassionate and blank, as if he were reading a list of names from a telephone directory. Everything turns into radioactive garbage, he tells us, not unkindly.

Mexican cinema should be in a buoyant mood after this film.http://lotsofpopcorn.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "This is not a portrait of Mexico; Mexico is just a background for the story. This movie shows certain parts of contemporary Mexico but the same script could be played anywhere else. The same issues that surround the main plot affect all places and are truly universal: corruption, misunderstanding, economical gap between classes or the end of traditional jobs ad lifestyles. Marivel Verdu says in a moment \"you are just like all men, you fight but what you really want is f... each other\". Why women show affection in a more physical way to other women? What if this is not caused by physiologically but culturally? What if men are culturally repressed towards showing affection to other men? Why is affection, sex and friendship so hard to understand but so easy to mix in real life? Death. What about it? The whole movie goes around this and you won't notice till the end. The movie doesn't make clear statements and that makes it subtle and mature. If I'm wrong please give me the simple answer to sex, friendship, death and love. I'll be happy to consider this movie worse than I do. While we find an answer, I recommend you to watch this movie; you're surely going to enjoy it. It is funny, it's deep, it has an incredible script, and it's also visually beautiful. Hollywood believed in this director and he's now doing great films there, watch this movie and you'll see how good he is. But remember, this movie may answer a couple of questions about life but it'll ask you a thousand more.",

            "content": "Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9nAs my experience of Mexican culture is confined to eating in the one or two Sydney Mexican restaurants actually run by Mexicans, I have to take this movie more or less at face value, though it apparently was very popular in its home market. At face value it is an enjoyable romp for two Mexico City 17 year old kids, one over-privileged and the other a little less so, who go on the road with an older (and absolutely gorgeous) woman who for reasons of her own is happy to play with the boys in this particular hot summer.The director, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, though from Mexico, has spent time in Hollywood. He has done an interesting post-modern version of  `Great Expectations' (1998) with Ethan Hawke and Gwynneth Paltrow and is directing the next Harry Potter number. This film, co-scripted by Alfonso and his brother Carlos, is very anti-Hollywood, especially in the depiction of sex and in the sly suggestions that there might be more to growing up than grossing out. As mentioned, I can only assume that the snippets of Mexican life we do see \u0096 the beggars, the children's funerals, the weddings both rich and poor, the tough life of the poor, are all for real. (And all for US$5 million.) One wonders what a re-make by Alfonso of `American Pie' would be like. One thing is for sure, this movie takes a hold on you in a way `American Pie' never does. Unlike the `American Pie' crowd (with the possible exception of Chris Klein's character, the amiable dumb jock), we can at least identify with the kids here. Tenoch and Julio (Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal), obnoxious though they may be at times, are at least real in their spottiness, puppy fat and raucous behaviour. Their travelling companion and mentor in life and love, Luisa, is beautifully realised by Spanish actress Maribel Verdi. I suppose she is a fantasy figure, but sometimes fantasies come true \u0096 well, up to a point, and this one has a twist.It's funny how so many defining experiences seem to happen on holiday. The threesome, despite all indications to the contrary, has a great time, and the boys do learn something about themselves and life in general. As for Luisa, she has at least emotionally liberated herself from a claustrophobic marriage and can face her future with a certain amount of serenity.\nI'm not sure the ironic voice-overs added anything to the story, particularly as they often went off at a tangent (`two years ago a farmer and his daughter died at this corner') but they did seem to fit in somehow. As for the road movie aspect, you not only feel you are actually inside the battered Le Baron station wagon looking out at the hot bleached summer landscape but you are with people who are interesting travel companions, even if you wouldn't actually like to live with them. You also feel a certain sense of danger. This is a country where banditry is widespread and practised by officials as well as criminals. Yet many of the ordinary people we meet are friendly decent and generous. Things happen, but we come up smiling.",

            "content": "This Mexican film is one formerly featured as an entry in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, obviously I was interested already because of this, and the fact that it was directed by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (A Little Princess, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Children of Men, Gravity, Roma) made it even more appealing. Basically, teenage best friends Julio Zapata (Amores Perros star Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) and Tenoch (The Terminal's Diego Luna) have their respective girlfriends leave for a trip to Italy. Without their girlfriends to have sex with, the two boys take the opportunity to live as bachelors. At a wedding, they meet Luisa (Pan's Labyrinth's Maribel Verd\u00fa), the wife of Tenoch's cousin, Alejandro 'Jano' Montes de Oca (Juan Carlos Remolina). Trying to impress Luisa, the boys talk about a fictitious, secluded beach called Boca del Cielo (\"Heaven's Mouth\"). The boys invite her to join them, but she initially declines an invitation to accompany them. Later, following a visit to a doctor, she receives a phone call from a drunken Jano, who tearfully confesses that he cheated on her. The next day, Luisa calls Tenoch and asks if their offer to accompany them to the beach is still available. Although Julio and Tenoch have no idea where they will go, the three set off, driving through rural Mexico. They talk about their relationships and sexual experiences to pass the time: the boys boasting about exploits, and Luisa talks about Jano and recalls her first love who died. When they stop for the night, Luisa leaves a tearful message on Jano's answering machine telling him that she has left him. Tenoch finds her crying, Luisa seduces him, and the two have sex. Julio sees them through the open door, upset he walks away. Afterward, Julio tells Tenoch he had sex with Tenoch's girlfriend. Luisa notices the tension between the boys the next morning, so she has sex with Julio to equalize their perceived status. An upset Tenoch then reveals that he has had sex with Julio's girlfriend. Julio and Tenoch start fighting but stop when Luisa threatens to leave them. Driving along the coast, they chance upon an isolated beach that is actually called Boca del Cielo. Making camp there, they begin to relax and enjoy the ocean, along with a local family. Luisa makes another phone call to Jano, bidding him an affectionate but final farewell. That evening, Luisa, Julio, and Tenoch drink to excess and joke about their sexual transgressions. The boys admit to frequently having sex with each other's girlfriends. Julio adds that he had sex with Tenoch's mother, but it is unclear if he is being serious. The three of them dance together sensually, Luisa kneels between the boys and stimulates them both, while the boys embrace and kiss each other passionately. The next morning, the boys wake up naked together. Tenoch goes outside to vomit, and the boys are eager to return home. The narrator (Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho) says that their journey back was quiet and uneventful, and that Luisa stayed behind to explore the nearby coves. When they returned, Tenoch and Julio broke up with their girlfriends and stopped spending time together. A year later, in a chance encounter in Mexico City, Tenoch and Julio have coffee together. They awkwardly catch up on each other's lives. Tenoch informs Julio that Luisa died of cancer a month after their trip, she was aware of her diagnosis during their time together. Before leaving, Tenoch tells Julio he will see him again; however, the narrator reveals that this interaction is their last meeting. Also starring Marta Aura as Enriqueta 'Queta' Allende, Diana Bracho as Silvia Allende de Iturbide, Emilio Echevarr\u00eda as Miguel Iturbide, Ver\u00f3nica Langer as Mar\u00eda Eugenia Calles de Huerta and Arturo R\u00edos as Esteban Morelos. Bernal and Luna as the testosterone filled boys do well, and Verd\u00fa as their middle-aged companion is alright, this film was previously described as being a foreign language version of something like Road Trip or American Pie, I can see why, it is a mix of a road movie with amusing sexual stuff, there is a fair amount of nudity, masturbation and sex scenes, and lots of naughty conversation, besides all this the scenery of Mexico is good, all in all it is a reasonable erotic coming-of-age drama.

I almost laugh at the thought other reviewers offer as the picture confronting a truth and sincerity in human relationships, as this one doesn't even come close. If the director intended to explore a coming of age story with sensitive portrayals of sexual intimacy, that would have been one thing. But the coming of age for Julio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) occurred well before the story even began, and opening the picture with a graphic sex scene with no prior warning is deeply disrespectful to parents who wouldn't have known any better if they had taken children along to see it. And as for Luisa (Maribel Verd\u00fa), how would anyone consider that she might have had even the slightest modicum of respect for herself by taking up with these two misfits, even considering some sort of motivation for revenge against her philandering husband. Then to top things off, Julio and Tenoch engage in an erotic scene among themselves, which just about puts the finishing touch on any sort of credibility the story might have pulled out at the last minute. I won't say I was disgusted by the picture because I've seen far worse images relative to the graphic sex, but wrapping some commendable cinematography around the package doesn't salvage it for me. Take my warning or watch it at your peril.",

The older woman puts the two together, realizing that their interest in her is purely lustful. It makes sense that the two of them should be together, rather than either guy with her.

It's a warning about income inequality, and it's an encouragement to live life to the fullest.This is a remarkable film. It's hugely entertaining, heartfelt, considered, beautiful, and thoughtful film. Two graduating high-school students, one the son of privilege (Diego Luna as Tenoch) and the other from a lower-middle class background (Gael Garcia Bernal) take a road-trip to the mythical beach of Boca del Cielo which they invented in order to impress the estranged wife (Maribel Vertu as Luisa) of Tenoch's cousin Jano. Being 18 year olds, they are full of swagger and bravado but can't anticipate what will happen and this makes for the drama of the roadtrip. They see Mexico and we see it beautifully, as filmed by Emmanuel Lubezki. It's often seen from inside a car as the group heads southwest toward the coast and we seen the dry, brown Mexican landscape often in shade. Lubezki uses extended shots, lingering over the dry, sleepy landscape. As they drive, they stop in different places and Lubezki captures the locals in their everyday lives. We see regular people selling trinkets, driving buses, herding animals. The dignity of regular people is honored as we see their lives doing their jobs. We hear about social conditions in the area through some very interesting voiceovers. They are interesting because they serve as a counterpoint to the privilege of Tenoch, Julio, and Luisa. We hear about the life of Tenoch's maid. We hear about the life of itinerant fishermen, and we hear about the lives of people struggling through the desert to get to the United States. Many times voiceovers aren't particularly helpful, but in this movie they really add a lot of depth and heart to the movie. I can't think of a film in which voiceovers were used as well as in this one.The boys are immature but can also be very funny. Writer Alfonso Cuaron and his co-writer, his brother Carlos Cuaron, get the tone of 18 year old boys just right - boastful, over-the- top, overconfident. This is their first mistake. All sorts of betrayals and miscommunication lead to tension and fights. The boys fall out and make up. They bond and they bicker. There are awkward moments and moments of resolution. This movie is so much more than a coming-of-age movie. It's so much more than a sex romp. It is not just social critique either. It's beautiful cinematically also, but it's more than just a valentine to Mexico. It shows that movies can charm us with their beauty and humor and joy but also make points about justice and struggle and yet everything can go down easily. It's a movie you can go back to again and again.",

            "content": "This film by Alfonso Cuaron (co-written with his twin brother Carlos) is worth your while even though it's in Spanish and you'll have to read the subtitles (\"but I don't like to read, I'm brain-dead,\" no offense intended at those out there who are actually, officially-medically brain-dead). You may have seen some of Cuaron's other work (e.g. remake of Great Expectations w/Hawke and Paltrowich), but unlikely that you've seen him like this. The story's formula is not an unfamiliar one: a coming-of-age episode involving two male friends, each of whom hankers for the same femme fatale (many have thus rightly compared it to Truffaut's classic, Jules et Jim). Julio and Tenoch (Gael Garcia Bernal & Diego Luna, respectively) are two Mexican upper-middle class teens and longstanding friends, as evinced by their getting high, reluctantly attending school and incessantly engaging in frank discussions about their sexual fantasies-cum-encounters (which become all the franker as the film progresses). They both have girlfriends, conveniently away on holiday to Italy, leaving the boys by themselves, but fret not, they've promised to behave and remain true! The leading lady in this foreign gem that you shamelessly balked at seeing because it involved reading subtitles, is as comely as can be, HOT in the most classy while still curvaceous of meanings (the former proved by the first scene in which we meet Luica (the delicious Maribel Verdu, who the non-troglodytes amongst ye might remember as the loveliest of the beguiling sisters in Trueba's Belle Epoque) in a formal cocktail dress, the latter proved no less indisputably by the balance of the film); consider also that her character is a woman ten years older than the two other protagonists and thus emblematic of an older, female teacher upon whom her younger male students bear great crushes. The film's replete with great local flavor, stellar vistas and beach scenery juxtaposed with unmistakable poverty, assorted Mexican pop and varied American fixtures, as well as an enrapturing leitmotif, further buttressed by Cuaron's use of stedi-cam shots, close-ups and practically lyrical lab dissolves. This ineluctably intoxicating film deals with sex in an up-front and explicit manner, quite unlike the way the Hollywood studios would dare depict it--Hollywood could never have made this movie, just another reason for you to see it. The film even informs the viewer of the unabashed means by which it intends to address the topic of sex, lust and passion by a sort of visceral, visual confrontational opening scene, with the camera espying two people (Julio and his girlfriend) having sex while promising their hearts to one another/none other. Louisa's character is Spanish but we find her in sunny Mexico courtesy of her marriage to Tenoch's pompous author cousin. Tenoch & Julio encounter Louisa at a wedding reception, where they hit on her for the fun of it and in an effort to irk her husband, a character the audience will immediately dismiss, and whom we will later learn we were well warranted to so hastily dislike. She responds with amusement, seemingly flattered and they talk of taking a trip to an Edenic beach, called \"Heaven's Mouth,\" in the north of the country, a fictive, extemporaneous creation of Tenoch and Julio's, described in increasing detail on the heels of each other's mendacious leads (a scenario I certainly found familiar), with the boys finally asking her to join them. A few days later, after an emotional crisis I dare not divulge, she shocks them by accepting their offer to go to the paradise that doesn't even exist, so they must borrow a car and think of somewhere that might vaguely resemble such a locale. This journey becomes the crux of the film; an odyssey of self-discovery I found most conscripting. Much as Truffaut did in the aforementioned Jules and Jim and, more recently, as Jean-Pierre Juenet (Delicatessen, City of Lost Children) does in Amelie, Cuaron employs an almost surreal, stoic narrator who periodically works on our auricular senses to complement and/or counteract the otherwise heavily/visually vibrant emotional aspects of the film. Every once in a while, the film goes silent in an almost hypnotizing way, whereupon the narrator tells us a character?s back story, some random thought or a piece of Mexico's history; one such moment comes when the narrator tells us of the horrors our heroes would have seen had they happened to have driven down this particular stretch of road five years prior, an odd fact that soon turns out to be profoundly more relevant than was immediately apparent. The journey that the boys end up taking with Luica is enlightening to say the least and, as for the film as a whole, I can say nothing more pithy and poignant than: add it to your queue!",

Maybe it's that there was no way I could ever relate to the two main characters, even a little bit, as they are carefree, drug-using and sex-obsessed teens. I don't think it's just that, because as characters, they really were never developed beyond that simple characterization, and while it may have been an intentional choice to never really differentiate their personalities, it hurt my viewing experience. The narration and shots are good, and Verdu gives a good performance, but I just wasn't left with anything substantive. The reveal at the end relating to Luisa definitely helped explain her peculiar decision making and strange willingness to go along with these two stupid, horny teenagers, but the themes still don't seem consistent. The last thing Luisa told the boys was something to the effect of the world is the foam of the ocean, so give yourself freely to others, or something meaning be free and just do things. This is strange, coming from a character who's marriage was ultimately ruined by infidelity, and saying it to two boys who are outrageously hypocritical in their expectations for others, particularly related to fidelity. Erotic scenes don't by themselves add to a movie, and while Verdu plays her role well, the lack of connection to any character or any themes that are cleanly developed (especially with the ending of an insincere meeting between the boys and never meeting again) kept it from being an enjoyable experience.",

None of the scenes are gratuitous and they perfectly capture that glee and joyful discovery of teenagers finding someone else to have sex with. The script is brilliant - with three dimensional characters slowly developing over time - and it totally succeeds in showing that fragile time when teenage friendships seem like they will last forever but they rarely do. Funny, sad, sexy, disgusting, real, childish - this movie shows humans as humans. The two young male leads give accomplished, powerful performances and the female lead is fantastic. I went into this movie knowing all the strong reviews and I expected to be underwhelmed. But I wasn't. The film impressed the hell out of me. A major accomplishment in telling a real, simple story about people that packs a wallop.",

He really looked like a hillbilly in this which doesn't suit him.Even though i watched this with English subtitles, i didn't understand what the characters meant.

I went with a wonderful girl on a first date.  Veryakward.  I would not have elected to expose her to the graphicsexuality on our first date. The movie itself is very wonderful.  Very clever.  I loved the irony inall the names.  Especially Heaven's Mouth. The two young guys were wonderful.  Reminded me of myself andmy best friend.  The cousin didn't ring true for me.  Sobbing,screwing, sobbing screwing.  Maybe more of an internal dialoguefor her would have great.  Some of it was explained at the end ofthe movie, but it still didn't justify her. I felt like i totally knew wherethey guys were coming from, but she was a mystery.  Broken upover a boyfriend she broke up after the love of her life died.  I don'tknow.  She was the only part of the movie that didn't ring true. The movie is beautiful, touching, clever and worked on so manylevels.   I couldn't justify all the graphic sex scenes.  I felt like i waswatching pornography.  It didn't help relate to the characters at all. Another review mentioned that homophobe's wouldn't enjoy thepicture.  Well, and here's a spoiler, that scene was the only nicesex scene in the entire movie.  Maybe that was the point.  Theseguys screw anything, all day long.  We didn't even see the guyshave sex.  They kissed.  Passionately.  That was the only momentof \"sex\" in the movie that seemed real.  They only time either onecared about who they were with.  The rest of the time they were justgetting off.  So saying that the film was a little too graphic for mehas nothing to do with homophobia.   I just think if went too far.",

            "content": "\"Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\" is a drama that has a real insight on teenage sexuality and surprisingly enough this actually generates a lot of laughs between the more touching portions of the film. I'm also going to admit that I find the plot pretty erotic so that's a big plus. It's a coming-of-age story about two teenage boys. Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) are, as most teenage boys are, focused on sex pretty much all of the time. They joke about stealing each other's girlfriends, seducing each other's mothers, romancing older ladies, that sort of thing. They jokingly strike up a conversation with Luisa (Maribel Verdu) and try to entice her into taking a trip with them to a beautiful beach where they can all frolic in the sand and sun. Despite the fact that she's in her late twenties, she decides to take them up on their offer and the three of them go on a road trip.One of the strongest characteristics about this Mexican film is that it genuinely feels like a true story. The sort of story that's too crazy not to be true. The characters and events don't feel manufactured or phony in any way and this allows you to really relate to the characters to the point where you may not have much in common or have experienced any of the events that they have, but you'll feel like you have a connection with them because you've all taken this trip together. The performances are all very good and when the film becomes erotic, it's very sexy. There are a lot of comedic moments but they're mostly there to make the bitter-sweet tale more digestible. This isn't some sex-comedy about a bunch of teens that need to lose their virginity by the end of the summer. The ending will probably leave you sad, but that's because you let yourself get so emotionally invested in the plot and characters that you didn't want their story to end. I've seen it multiple times and I'm not sure I understand all of the subtext that has to do with Mexican politics, but that's what special features are for, so I encourage you to track down some essays that will clear up the details, or watch it with someone that's smarter than me and knows what all of those little moments are all about. One last thing. While I love this movie and encourage you to check it out, even the R-Rated version isn't suitable for teens and certainly not kids. With that said, I strongly recommend \" Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n\". I might bust this one out next time I have a date and she wants to see a movie\u0085 (R-Rated version on DVD, November 15, 2012)",

            "content": "The way Alfonso Cuaron shifts from a Children's novel adaptation (A Little Princess) to a classic novel adaptation (Great Expectations) to an adult road-trip movie is really fascinating. 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' is one of my favourite road-trip movies, but to call it just a road-trip movie would really be an understatement; not only is it a thrilling journey of sexual exploration, but also a nuanced exploration of some of the most pressing socio-economic issues of our time. The narrator gives us interesting character histories, and intriguing but haunting societal insights which make the story quite gripping, and makes Mexico a character as well. Other than that, as critic Roger Ebert says, 'it (the movie) is about the fragility of life and the finality of death.' And the film is funny as hell; its humour is quite well-placed. It takes the genre of teen sex-comedy to completely new heights.Class-division really plays an important role in establishing relationships; even in the best of friendships, there's always a deep-seated impact it has. No matter how close we are to someone, we always keep a few things secret. A free-spirited road-trip cum sexual adventure boils down to a night where true feelings and pinions come out in the open; things are never the same after that.The three lead actors, Gael Garcia Bernal, Maribel Verdu and Diego Luna, are really talented, and given riveting performances. Other than the three characters and Mexico, we invisibly become a part of their journey and their lives. The cinematography is spectacular, and captures Mexico with such elegance. The one-shot scene towards the end, in the bar, which starts with conversation and ends with a dance, is quite a remarkable sequence. The passionate kiss which comes after this scene is sensual and memorable.The film is quite observant, doesn't compromise anywhere with its storytelling, and doesn't take any moralistic stance on any aspect; that's what makes the film so gripping and compelling.",

But since this is almost impossible, i'll accept that the song is just inspired by the film.Nevermind. I just wanted to say that that's how i first heard of this movie. And i admit that i hadn't had big expectations before i saw it for the first time. As a matter of fact this first time i didn't actually watch the whole film 'cause my parents kept walking into the room and you know that you really shouldn't watch this film with your parents. But then i was alone at home one afternoon and i decided to try to watch it again and the least i can do is to tell you that i was pleasantly surprised.I have watched \"Y tu mama tambien\" at least five times by now. It really shocked me how much the Mexican style of life resembles that of my country. What also shocked me is the fact that i was really experiencing some kind deja vu watching these two guys. It was like i was watching i film about me and my friends, only in Spanish. The funny thing is that the language is the only difference because the mentality, the way of talking, the dreams and hopes they have, are the same. I especially liked Julio because he somehow looks and lives the same way i do. So this film really stroke a chord on me (i'm not sure if that's the exact meaning of the expression).I was so repelled watching \"Kids\" for example, but somehow Julio and Tenoch seemed so innocent to me, even when they were masturbating by the pool. As I've already said the Mexican mentality somehow seems so close to me and i never really knew this before i watched this film. Now i feel like my ultimate dream is to go there.As for the film itself, there's no point in telling you it's great. I'm sure that the people who would really like it, have already watched or intend to watch it in the future. If you are cool, at least by my standards, which means if you feel the highest point you can reach is freedom and if you are dedicating your life to get to that point, then don't waste your time - watch it. The film feels really liberating and is very sincere in its depiction of young people's lives, especially in Latin and in my opinion Balkan and even some arab countries. Also it deals the current iconomic and social realities in Mexico and with the problem of human sexuality too.The acting is great, especially by one of the greatest young actors nowadays - Gael Garcia Bernal and also by Maribel Verdu. The story is simple and well written, the direction and cinematography are great too.It's also a must-see for all of who are sick by the majority of American cinema nowadays.",

As someone who loves foreign movies (especially when they're in Spanish) I think this's one of the best I've ever seen.

It seems that the two guys used to be what is called \"bitongo\", i.e. young people from rich or well accommodated families with no working interests, saying this because poor ones in Mexico must work heavily to survive, but these were swimming, smoking marihuana each time and playing the role of parasites. The Spanish lady, married to another Mexican guy, is disappointed because her husband went to bed with another woman; he himself, crying, told her what he did. Well, in films you may see many non real facts as this one, so she became angry and probably wanted to revenge what happened to her. For this reason she decided to go to a beach far from D.F. together with two guys, who knew masturbation as the only enjoyable sexual act. She came to them as a fortune, thirsty of sex, she was able to make love with both at the same time, they learned what is sex and went finally back to D.F., she remained at the beach and later died of cancer. The film is different from those that we normally see, the camera moves in its own way, the dialogues are difficult to understand, and to be frank I do not know what the director really wanted to demonstrate with this film. If he wanted to show misery of Mexican people, corrupted police, etc. He should have used more direct language but not showing the Mexican reality from its margin. The PRI party went away for the first time in the last 70 years in Mexico, something remarked in the film, so what? Has the police changed its attitude toward the society with the new governing PAN? Is there any improvement in the life standard of Mexicans or are less poor people than before? When the film finished I asked all these questions to me without any answer.",

The problem is that much of the deeper issues and intelligence of this film are buried underneath a preoccupation with juvenile humour and softcore pornography.Don't get me wrong, I'm not overly conservative or anal retentive, but I expect South Park from South Park, and from a film like this, I expect a little less Emmanuelle - I don't see this as a kitschy, art-house, blue foreign film.What I do see this film as, is using the struggle between two teenage boys to deal with each other's cultural differences and coming of age to represent the struggle Mexico (and many other countries like it) to overcome corruption and deceit, lass struggle and misguided revolution.Y Tu Mama Tambien has the opportunity to say a lot more than it does, but wastes it with silly sex scenes and flatulence jokes. True, there needs to be a certain amount of juveniles being juveniles, but in the end, this film spends too much time filling in the blanks with overdubs and basically spells out much of the story to the viewer through narrative. And so, important revelations (such as the one about Luisa) are overshadowed by excess.Still, this is, by all means, a clever and deep film. Gorgeous as well, both in setting and cinematography. Mexico both shines and fades in different lights. And I think Diego Luna's performance is absolutely spectacular.

            "content": "A road trip of self-discovery (aren't they all?); two impulsive, inexperienced teens, a strife-torn Mexico, several backstories which would kill a horse - and a magnificent rack.*Y Tu Mama Tambien* (\"And Your Mama Too\") reeks of everything that makes an independent film good (full-blooded characters, unrushed storyline and editing, no CGI, and superb acting, in that naturalistic vein that \"movie stars\" find so hard to slip back into once they've been told how important they are to the economy); yet it simultaneously exhibits one of the intrinsic problems with independent films \u0096 losing focus due to a breadth of scope uncalled-for in a simple, yet effective, tale.It is as if writers Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n and Carlos Cuar\u00f3n try too hard to give us motivation for their 3 main characters, inserting excessive social context to the point of irrelevance. As the three friends meander down the Mexican coast, so too a disembodied narrator (who is not part of the tale, but some kind of omniscient entity) meanders off script completely, describing unrelated, non sequitur tidbits (a car accident from ten years ago; a fisherman who ends up a hotel janitor; the history and eventual bacon demise of pigs which invaded a beach camp). With no evil Big Studio to curb the padding, to hone the focus, director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n seems to be trying to cut his *Bohemian Rhapsody*.While their teen girlfriends tour Europe, best friends Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) do what every teen male would do in their position - seek out other chicks. At a party, they zero in on one of their older cousins' wives, the statuesque, magnificently-endowed Ana (Ana L\u00f3pez Mercado), inviting her on a road trip to a mythical beach, fully intending to seduce her before their fraud is uncovered, yet not having the slightest clue how to go about it.Careful what you wish for \u0096 you might just get it. The boys attain an understanding of how the seemingly simple physical act of sex can be so demanding psychologically, as the experienced Ana first seduces Tenoch (in a sense-glutting, euphoric first-time scene straight out of Penthouse Letters) and the next day raunchily straddles Julio. Arguments, confessions (including the admission by both boys that each of them slept with each other's girlfriend), juvenile standoffs, drunken three-ways, bring Ana, Tenoch and Julio closer together during the journey, but separates them forever after the trek.Here is a film where sex is not depicted as dirty, nor is it sacrosanct. There is no mood lighting or preparation. It happens. In this movie (as in Life), sex is simply a normal part of growing into adulthood. No matter what Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell say. It is the social protocol we have set up around sexual encounters that is anything but normal. In ostensibly becoming \"civilized\" *homo sapiens* have complicated a facility which every other animal on earth easily incorporates into their lives.As if to hammer home the normalcy, the movie opens with Tenoch and his girlfriend, entwined in naked afterglow, presaging the coming storm by each voicing their infidelity insecurities, coaxing promises from each other that they will never \"do it\" with any other ethnicity \u0096 which is all moot, we are to learn, as neither of them is experienced enough to have assessed whether they would *want* to do it with other ethnicities in their short period of carnal awakening.No other species ponders sex or death as much as we humans. And this movie presents a liberating, refreshing view of what brought us to this point in our evolutionary development \u0096 sex: it is offhanded, it is quick, unsacred, unpracticed; no preaching, no finger-wagging, no condoms. Any kind of moralism is left to the viewer to glean - or not.Magnificent racks can only help the decision.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",

            "content": "Tenoch Iturbide and Julio Zapata are two teenaged friends living in Mexico City; their girlfriends have gone away for a holiday in Italy so they have nothing to do. During a family wedding they get chatting to their cousin's Spanish wife, Luisa, and end up inviting her to come on a trip to a great beach they know about. They don't expect to hear from her again but after she learns that her husband has slept with another woman she calls them to say she wants to go with them. This presents a slight problem as they made up the beach! Still they decide to drive to the coast. Along the way they talk about the rules they live by and their sexual experiences. After the car breaks down they stay overnight in a hotel and Luisa seduces Tenoch. Later, having witnessed what happened, Julio tells Tenoch that he had slept with his girlfriend. Luisa believes the ill feeling between the boys is because she had sex with Tenoch so she tries to balance things by having sex with Julio. This doesn't improve matters and more secrets are revealed. It looks as if they will never get to the sea but by chance they get there and try to resolve their issues\u0085 some things will never be the same though.It must be stated the this film if fairly raunchy; the opening scenes feature the two boys having sex with their girlfriends for one last time before they go away and there is more sex and nudity before the film is over. There are also lots of conversations on the subject too. That said the film isn't just sex and nudity; it is more about the characters. The three main characters are believable and sympathetic despite their obvious flaws; the boys talk about their rules but each as already broken them. There is also a degree of sadness as an unidentified narrator tells us of various tragedies that have occurred, or will later occur, along the route they are travelling and to the people they meet. The cast do a fine job making their characters seem very believable; this is especially true of Diego Luna, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Maribel Verd\u00fa who play our three protagonists Tenoch, Julio and Luisa respectively. The way director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n filmed the story in a distinctly non-glossy way added to its feeling of realism. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody because of some of its more adult content and downbeat elements but I thought it was well worth watching.These comments are based on watching the film in Spanish with English subtitles.",

            "content": "As male fantasy goes, 'Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n' is the road tip that dreams are made of: two teenage boys accompanied by an older (but not much) girl embark on an adventure in Mexico. And though it is less a female fantasy to run off with two younger men, it surely is not so much of a stretch to dwell on the point. The ride is so much more than just pranks and misadventures of the youthful trio; the exuberance and craziness of the boys is tempered by the sometimes wild yet far more reflective older woman, anchoring us in reality and certainly in the eventual sadness of adulthood. Our youthful male characters, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal) are completely beside themselves when the wife of Tenoch's cousin (they meet briefly at a wedding and the boys make up a tale of a fantastic beach they are headed for) accepts their invitation to go along. Initially non-committal, she decides to throw in with them after a drunken call from her husband causes her to reflect on things. The trials and tribulations of the trip are what we might expect; car troubles, sometimes profound and more times than not inane conversations and hormonally-drug-alcohol fueled sex. The last a surprise? It shouldn't be, since this is a film very comfortable in its explorations of the things that drive us forward. Such sex scenes as there are manage to be so well staged and performed that we are convinced we're seeing the real thing. Though the moments are fleeting, enough real animal sensitivity is generated to call them arresting.As matters unfold, the tensions and drama that develop keep us quite fascinated with that old question: Where is this going? Suffice it to say that the laughs and sexual adventures of the journey turn into a straightforwardly somber finale. This re-entry into earth's gravity gives pause; it generally does.The use of a narrator throughout the film lends a certain air of truthfulness to the tale. Inserted in no discernible pattern, sometimes the narration is about the matters at hand, sometimes about an incident only tangential to the story (a traffic jam is explained, in some detail, as to the how and why of a pedestrian's death) and even facts about global politics might be related. But these occasional supplements are generally helpful in fleshing out the characters and certainly underscore the relative in consequence of the dreamlike story unfolding.Some great insights into what director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n had in mind as he shot this great looking film \u0096 the scenery is quite spectacular, sometimes capturing the squalor of rural life in parts of Mexico while at others glorifying the beauty of oftentimes unspoiled sites. In the interview he shares how he devolves this film and shot from his own technically ignorant but youthfully unencumbered POV. Rating: 3.5 Stars.",

            "content": "\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" is yet another wonderful Almodovar film, this one from 2001. It's the story of two teenage best friends, Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna), whose girlfriends have gone off to Italy. They meet Luisa (Maribel Verdu), the young wife of Tenoch's cousin Jano and since Jano is away, they invite her to a wonderful beach, Heaven's Mouth. Actually, so far as they know, it doesn't exist, but they both find her very attractive. After Jano admits that he has cheated on her (again), Luisa accepts their invitation, and the three of them embark on a life-changing adventure.This is a film that will be deeply appreciated by Mexicans because it has to do with politics and class differences: Tenoch is the son of a rich businessman and has important friends; Julio is lower class and lives with his whole family in a small apartment. His last name is Zapata, after a revolutionary.However, because of the classic elements of the story, this is a movie for everyone. It's about sex, discovery, freedom, immaturity, and evolution. It's not your typical road trip movie. It's more of a psychological study of three people, one (Luisa) who has had some startling revelations in her life, and two juvenile boys who don't yet know what they're about. And when they find out, things change profoundly.The sex is graphic but important to the story as it serves as a process of self-discovery that is sometimes painful. There is also a lot of humor, too, particularly in the beginning of the movie.Almodovar as usual gives us a provocative film with layered characters and wonderful performances by all three stars. Their acting is entirely natural; the friendship between the two boys is very real, as is Luisa's reaction to them.Highly recommended.",

This movie isn't schizophrenic like \"Amelie\" and the shock value isn't stylized like \"American Pie\".  The story is adequately paced and the shock value is realistic.  I was in extreme awe at how far beyond the line that \"Y Tu\" actually went in terms of actual taste and I possess a strong stomach.  All the drug use and all the sex should make any normal person want to gag but it would take away from telling of such an original story.  \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" is quite possibly the best independent film to have come into the United States this year.  Apparently, \"Y Tu\" shattered all the box office records in Mexico when it debuted.  With a well-written and perfectly-paced story, I was enthralled by the tale of two warped-minded teens who managed to talk a seductive older woman into a road trip to a supposedly nonexistent place.  Throw in ravishing cinematography, excellent direction, and three of the best performances this year, you have a made winner.  If you can stand very realistic shock value, non-schizophrenic pacing, demented male mentality, loads of cheating, shocking confessions, much drug use/sex/nudity(both sides)/language, and great acting, directing, and writing, this is your film.  I royally recommend this intriguing, intelligent study of the damaged youth male mentality in Mexico.  I give it 10 out of 10!  It makes you wonder how damaged our mental capacities are if many American movie watchers like this film.  Oh well, here ends my rant!",

            "content": "And Your Mother Too is one of a few films ever made where it has something horribly, horribly flawed within it in several separate places yet redeems itself somewhat with its attention to detail in the form of the way it's going to look. How so many people can like this film really is beyond me; yes it has its neo-realistic charm and that breakaway from Hollywood feeling but in truth; Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n is a horrible mess of nasty content and fundamental errors.The film takes an 'Am\u00e9lie' (2001) approach is telling the bulk of its story but when I say story I really mean random stuff that's happening, has happened or will happen. This is put across thanks to voice-overs and images that relate to the events we're being told about. One such example happens when three characters are driving down a road and a terrible accident that occurred ten years earlier is talked about, culminating on a shot of two graves (the dead drivers). It's this sort of content that made Am\u00e9lie so watchable, so funny and so enjoyable. Here, in this film; it works to good effect but what else we're seeing makes it difficult to like in the long run.I hear and read people say about what an excellent character study this is, well in my opinion they couldn't be more wrong. There are no characters in this film to even have a study of. The 'characters' consist of Luisa (Verdu) who's a middle aged woman and two kids: Tenoch (Luna) and Julio (Garc\u00eda Bernal). The first thing's first; having teenage, drug smoking, casual sex obsessed boys as your two main characters who just muck about backfires massively here \u0096 it is not long before you just want to give one of the kids a clout and indeed, it will not take long for you to want maybe a truck or something to perhaps run one of them over since this film likes to rely on that documentary feel of 'in the middle of nowhere, road movie, anything can happen'. If you think about it in real terms; you wouldn't give people like this in real life two seconds of your time if you were to meet one so why like them so much here? With enough evidence in the opening thirty minutes to relegate the two leads to 'despicable' as they insist on one more act of sex before one of their girlfriends catches a flight or the way they lie on diving boards pleasuring themselves to images of Selma Hayek amongst other things; there is also enough meaningless dialogue and hand held camera work to basically have this film beg you to consider it an 'art' film. Some foreign films I like, some I don't \u0096 some are too 'in your face' (Brotherhood of the Wolf) and some just try too hard to give you something you really don't want. Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n is one of them \u0096 I don't want to see all this sex, I don't want to hear what these kids have to say and I don't want to have anything to do with these sorts people.Luisa is another contradiction of a character. She puts her feet on the dashboard during the road movie segment of the film and happily flirts with them (asking them how they screw their girlfriends) but then gets all angry later on and storms off \u0096 exclaiming them to be too immature. What a complete script/character contradiction: what did she expect? She screws them both and then leaves because they argue too much? She created the situation in the first place and anything that happens involving her getting angry is very, very poor film-making. Even after an hour and about fifteen minutes she actually says 'I shouldn't have screwed either of you.' \u0096 Duh! You think? I could see this coming from a mile off.Thats moves me onto the next flaw: predictability and content. As soon as all three characters are in that car driving along I said to myself \"Yup, they'll be screwing each other in about thirty minutes\" and you know what? That's exactly what happened. I did not want to watch a porn film when I sat down to watch this but that's what I got \u0096 character study/development like hell.In the American Pie films you get teenage boys smoking, having sex, getting up to mischief, hanging about, even doing it with middle aged women and that's exactly what you get here but a few hand held shots, some long takes, some narration about events 'ten years earlier' and the fact it's foreign apparently rises the film's profile: What a load of rubbish. I didn't laugh, I wasn't that entertained and I felt a little dirty afterwards \u0096 lots of drugs, profanity (the masturbation scene in particular) and needless sex: nasty, nasty film-making.",

It is SO refreshing to see a film made outside of the Hollywood trash pile that is so full of character and characters that are interesting and moving.

            "content": "\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" is the story of two Mexican stoner kids just out of high school.  Tenoch is the son of the Secretary of State under the PRI government.  Julio comes from an upper-middle-class family with leftist politics.  Not that these kids care about these things.  What they care about is getting stoned, having sex, swimming and masturbation.  When their girlfriends leave for a trip to Europe, the boys are down to only three things to keep their interest and they assume they are going to have a boring summer.Then Tenoch's father hosts a family wedding at his mansion.  All of Mexico's social & political elite are required to attend.  That includes Tenoch's insufferably pretentious cousin Jano and his beautiful Spanish wife Luisa. When the boys bump into Luisa, they both start hitting on her at once.  They tell her they know of a beach far away from tourists called Heaven's Mouth that is the most beautiful place in the tropics and they will take her there whenever she wants.  Of course they are just making it up, and Jano chases them off before they can go any further.Some time later Jano phones Luisa in tears and admits he's been cheating on her.  So Luisa phones Tenoch & calls his bluff.  She wants to go to Heavens Mouth with the boys.  So they all get together & borrow a rickety 1983 Dodge station wagon from Julio's sister & take a cross-country journey in which they will all discover themselves, each other & Mexico.The most up-front part of the film is the sexual part.  This is only the second non-porn film I have seen that features a \"money shot\", which is why it couldn't be released in the U.S. with an MPAA rating (the first film--if you're interested--is Pedro Almodovar's \"Kika\").  There is lots of nudity and sex on display and even more conversation about it.  The conversations are of a highly explicit nature and may be even more shocking than the actual sex scenes.But there is another, more subtle part.  The journey they take is an odyssey into the real Mexico:  a place of incredible poverty & despair, but also a place of great freedom.  It is a place that neither Tenoch's nor Julio's family wants to acknowledge.  The authoritarian, right-wing PRI wants to sweep the poverty under the rug & clamp down on the freedom.  The upper-class Zapatista-sympathizers are too busy organizing demonstrations to do anything constructive about the poverty & take themselves too seriously to enjoy--or even acknowledge--their freedom.  I would have probably missed this subtext had it not been for the narrative voice which talks about the despair & freedom (as well as the characters' life histories) that occur off-screen.There are flaws of course.  The pacing in the first act--before the wedding--is a bit slow, and the narration interrupts the flow of the story a bit too much.But the acting and story are superb.  I had assumed at first that the two boys were really stoner kids until (*SPOILER ALERT*) the final scene where they are reunited as men in their twenties--played by the same actors, but with radically different characterizations.  And the cinematography can only be described as stunning.  Especially the scenes where the boys race each other swimming.Overall, this film succeeds on both the coming-of-age and social commentary front, which is no small feat.  And it crackles with all of the attitude that the title (translated: \"And Your Mother Too\") implies.  8 out of 10.",

Two minutes later Julio farts (the same guy supposedly who had manners) and laughs hysterically. The two boys then laugh together as kind of like \"hahaha we pretend to like the rules, but we break them like it's a joke\". That kinda seems to be attutide of the two. Luisa is just a \"fresh piece of meat\" that happens to be the target of these salivating lowlifes. lolEven sadder is that Luisa succumbs to the advances of these two, however it's not due because of their charming personalities.. Hell no.It's actually due to the fact that Luisa catches wind of the fact that her husband has been having an affair with another woman. Seeing her husband's infidelity face first, Luisa then like many women in that of position irrationally basically sleeps with both boys during separate instances.. LOL Even more hilarious is the case when these two fight over Luisa as if they sort of own her. Lol It seems that they are oblivious to the fact that they have basically had a couple of one night stands with a vulnerable woman who only wanted to strike back at her husband Oh yeah I forgot to mention the couple of cheap lies that the boys use to entice Luisa to being with them is that their on a journey to \"Heaven's Mouth\" , a special beach in Spain presumably. lol However this turns out to be one of the silly twists in the film does it really exist or not?

With plenty of curiousity, but little expectation, it turned out to be an enjoyable, and wry film. Plenty has been written about the sex, some has been written about it being `another road movie` - both of which is valid - there`s loads of both. However - the sex is frank, but never exploitative and therefore rather refreshing - and certainly made me smile, remembering my own adventures as a kid. The road movie, analogising their own journeys of self discovery alongside social comment contextualising Mexico well between those who have, with those who have not is done well - and done with enough sensitivity to keep the viewer interested throughout. The ending, equally good, was both thoughtful, provocative and makes you review and reassess your assumptions on the film, and the motives of the characters in it. Very good. However the main reason for comment is to say 3 things. Firstly - i believe that Mexico have produced two of the most remarkable and refreshing films of the last couple of years - if you havent seen them, shame on you, dig them out and enjoy them. Secondly, that Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, the lead role in both films has a screen presence which belies his age, and without doubt could, and indeed should eclipse Del Torro as the next big thing south of the border - he is very good in both films - watch this space, and thirdly - Harry Potter is in very good hands, and indeed the darkest of the 4 books so far could be the darkest of the 4 films planned - about time too.",

Vulagarity and drug talk is rampant, and they are not even nice to look at (which would have helped with me). I don't enjoy constant scenes of bad language, drug use, etc. Parts of the movie were almost at a \"Porky's\" level. The sex scenes, while fairly explicit and not to my taste either, are quite overrated I would say. There isn't nearly as much of it nor is it as graphic as everyone is always commenting on, so i really don't know where that is coming from. There is really more sex talk and carrying on than the actual acts. Having said all of this, the story of what these boys learn and the secrets that their woman companion hold is told with great visual interest, intelligence and ultimately I find the movie came to quite a satisfying ending, even if I had to endure quite a bit to get there.In short, not a movie to my taste, but I can understand the regard in which it is held.",

It's incredibly entertaining, sort of like a road-trio film that garnered a lot of controversy (and you can see why). The lead performances from the males are very good, especially Garcia Bernal. Maribel Verdu also gives a really solid portrayal here, although for some reason Diego Luna doesn't stick as much in the material. He seems out of place for whatever reason. I don't think it's Cuaron's best film, but it doesn't need to be. This is really absorbing, intriguing cinema that, at its best, provides a form of discussion for film buffs. Recommended.",

And their road trip takes them on a journey that shows little personal growth. The closest we came to caring about the characters involves the tragic character of the older woman/fellow traveler whose cathartic experience provides the only sympathetic moments in this film. But is that enough to endure the immature pandering to the voyeur in us?\"Y tu Mama Tambien\" uses the narrative technique involving a disembodied voice giving us background 'ala \"Amelie\" and \"Il Postino\"; but that not only reminds us of how a great idea can enhance a sensitive story and reminds us of how misspent two hours in the dark can be.",

At a wedding, they meet a married woman named Luisa, who they tell of a secluded beach, which is totally made up by the pair.

The film is about 2 Mexico City teens, Tenoch (Diego Luna) & Julio (Gael Bernal) who hook up with the cuckolded wife of Tenoch's cousin Jano, Luisa (Maribel Verd\u00fa). Basically, the 2 horny boys' girlfriends leave for Europe for the summer and after Luisa's husband confesses his infidelity she begs to go on a road trip with the boys, who are eager to take the 28 year old sexpot away to a mythic beach they have told her about.The friends both end up screwing Luisa, then inflicting pain on each other by professing to have screwed each other's girlfriend. Luisa is about to leave them both when they promise they will do things her way. They stumble upon a beach, have some adventures, then get drunk one night with Luisa, are prepared to engage in a threesome, until Luisa simultaneously takes both of them in her mouth. This penile congress leads the two boys to a night of homosexuality without Luisa's presence. The next day one vomits over his debauchery, they leave Luisa at the beach, return to Mexico City, and part. 2 years later they meet at a caf\u00e9 one last time, discuss the fact that Luisa died of cancer a month after their road trip, and never see each other again- Tenoch heading toward a life in the upper crust, while Julio goes off to community college\u0085. I do get tired of critics who seem rapt by foreign films that mine the same material that Hollywood tripe does, with just as little success, yet somehow draw raves. Here's the only cogent piece of advice the film imparts, and its aimed only at the Tenoch-Julio demographic: Do not whack off too much or you will diminish your sexual continence. Thankfully I learnt that lesson before watching this film.",

I wouldn't call this a reflex movie because it will only display that sometimes instincts are more important than loyalty and even truth; but the real fact is that it displays dramatic situations through funny moments and very well performed by young actors. You know, when you're young you tend to follow your inner instincts even if it betrays your ideals and moral adequate situations.Our two main characters live life at their prime but never think that through the eyes of a mature woman they will learn what life is really is... the important aspects about it.The movie is also a prime example of a great buddy flick.

Editing -- especially the breaks in action for comments -- are confusing and superfluous.  Ultimately such problems are the responsibility of the director, but I know so little about specific production details of this particular film that I cannot comment -- except in general terms based on received impressions. (Modest spoiler follows.)Still, it is likeable and pretty, and full of many sweet and funny moments. Perhaps that is why any somber intrusions such as the illness of the woman or the final drift into meaningless separation of the two main characters seem out of place.  (I am reminded of another film \"Summer of '42\" as I write this.)  Sentiment and nostalgia must be consistent in stories like this, or things go awry and the viewer is left indiscriminately confused.

In fact, its raunchiness has earned it the equivalent of an NC-17 (why Mr.MPAA spokesman is it an \"R\" to see male 'fluid' as a hair gel (SOMETHING ABOUT MARY), but an NC-17 to see the same substance drop into a pool???). What's so refreshing here is that the film takes its trio and shows them in all their faults, thoughts, and actions without strenuous preaching or overzealous and extreme behavior. It's \"just them\" - and you either accept them or reject them - that's YOUR problem. Ironically, this kind of freely sexual film (and its frequent drug & alcohol use) were made throughout the 60's & 70's, but now it seems so risque in our supposedly more \"advanced\" culture of the 21st Century. My only quibbles would be the narration which is too frequent and seems to be straining for some sort of poetic \"meaning\" to the proceedings when the less said the better most of the time (a little goes a long way here). Also, the climactic scene and epilogue are not as 'shocking' as much as they are somewhat unbelievable and unnecessary (or both, depending on your point of view). One sour note is lead actress Maribel Verd\u00fa's obvious implants. Too bad. I hope Foreign films will not soon be plagued by one of Hollywood's unfortunate \"attributes\".

            "content": "The plot summaries and overheard scuttlebutt on this movie are completely unreliable. Reading about it you get the impression it's either a funny road-trip movie or a teen sex comedy. Actually, it's a brilliant piece of film-making.The performances of Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal are magnificent. They're young actors obviously without a lot of experience, but the richness they give to their characters really makes the viewer believe that their friendship operates on multiple levels--something the normal road-trip \"buddy\" movie rarely does. A lesser movie would have focused on how each of them react to the influence of Luisa. Wisely, however, the Cuarons have chosen instead to focus on how they react to each other as a result of her presence. That's far and away the more interesting story--and why this film is riveting.The addition of the narrator was, in my view, inspired. Narrators are rarely seen in movies these days, but the narration in this film is perfectly balanced--the narrator is healthily detached from the action, but chooses to illuminate interesting details about the relationship of Tenoch and Julio, stressing the things they will not tell each other--and the narration makes the viewer a participant in the action rather than merely an observer. The characters undergo a pretty radical emotional transformation over the course of their adventures, but even at that the narrator finds time to tell us ironic anecdotes that illuminate modern problems in Mexico, such as the man who's killed on the bridge early in the movie. As a result the whole thing comes off brilliantly as a kind of subtle social satire, but even if you don't care about that element it's still fascinating to watch.This is also a beautifully made film. I wonder how many casual viewers notice that the scene at the beachside bar, leading up to the infamous climax of the film, is done all in one fluid take. I also wonder how many notice the increasing entropy of the visions presented on the screen: at the beginning we see the well-ordered, colorful, upper-crust environs of Tenoch's family's house, and at the end we're cavorting around in squalid rural inns where clucking chickens shamble through the guest rooms and pigs run wild across the beach. The final scene of the film couldn't be more perfect. The plot device revealed in this scene is a little contrived, but at least it doesn't come totally out of the blue. Yet the characters' reactions--again more to each other than to the situation--are completely believable. This is a really eye-opening film and one that must be seen several times to appreciate all its subtexts. And it's damn fun to watch, too!",

In the midst of that already considerable achievement, director Alfonso Cuaron has managed to weave in perspective of Mexico's class system on at least three different levels.I have been surprised to read numerous reviews where the film's construction is made into a binary: rich (meaning the road-tripping teen-aged friends Julio and Tenoch, and their travel companion Luisa) versus poor (those they meet along the way, peddlers on the road, fishermen on the beach).  That comparison is certainly present, but I would argue that the conflict between the worlds of lower-middle-class Julio and very wealthy Tenoch is the central tension in the film.  Cuaron handles this in a deft and heartbreaking manner where we see Julio slighted time and again, but in subtle ways: Tenoch's girlfriend gets no problem from her parents if she wants to hang out with him late night, but Julio is constantly chaperoned with his girlfriend; the voice-over that occasionally dots the film informs us incidentally of Tenoch's past hesitancy to use the bathroom at Julio's place; then there's a repeated swimming race which takes on metaphorical weight as Julio tries continually to catch up to Tenoch.  Finally, an incredible scene takes place between the boys as they have a coffee after their journey of self-discovery (not a spoiler, don't worry).  They are about to go to college, Tenoch to University and Julio to community college. Tenoch has a Tower Records bag next to him, the sign of his ability to consumer products freely, but Julio insists on paying, a sign of his self-consciousness.  The body language of Julio as he asks for the check is unforgettable.When would you ever have this kind of class undercurrent flowing in a coming-of-age teen story made in Hollywood? The kids in \"American Pie,\" as well as its flip side \"American Beauty,\" are basically from indistinguishably similar neighborhoods and classes; the issue doesn't come up.  1985's \"Breakfast Club\" comes to mind, but class issues there are fodder for confessional-speak, not for fleshing out real-life situations. Just the fact that Julio's sister in \"Y tu mama\" is a political activist and we actually see her in a demonstration adds more dimension to this film's characters than most teeny boppers are getting in their current ninety minutes of thin character sketches.  It's exhilarating to see a film like \"Y tu mama\" but simultaneously depressing--Cuaron has made a great film, but left the States to go back home and get it done.",

Sex orgy for sure, \"road trip\" flimsy excuse for it, at best. Learn anything from the \"sights\"? Nope, missed it all. Deal with cancer? No life change here, just the statement that since there is nothing after death why bother with such trivia. No, leaving hubby ain't a life change, just cowardice. (BTW, this single event highlights the problem with the film that repeats endlessly, i.e. what evidence is there that he deserved such treatment? The opinions of two adolescent booby bumbling drug soaked hormone ravaged teens? This is supposed to make us sympathetic with the anti-heroine?? It's one thing to see life, events, situations interpreted by the protagonists and quite another to have those interpretations foisted on and be explanatory of another character's behavior. Can be done but only by an experienced master.)  Want to see the utter banality of materialistic modern civilization? Want to see a wife who cannot communicate anything to her husband? (Hey, he may be drunk when he calls but he went way beyond her lack of verbal interaction.) Want to see promises that are lies even as they are being made? Want to see the acclaimed \"two Mexicos\"? Duh, every country has at least \"two\". And far better drug busts can be seen on TLC or Discovery or... Want to see infidelity at every turn? Want to see two realities running in parallel but never meeting? You know, the reality of the world presented by the unknown but omniscient narrator and the other one already fully adjectived. Want to see the film 99% critics pander to what they think will be PC? Then see this film. Shame on you Mexico for pandering to American tastes and aiming for one-upmanship on tripe. You succeeded. P.S. the one positive point, if it can be called such, was the hugely clear gulf between parents and offspring. Positive in that it showed how little parents often know what their kids are really doing or understand their kids or take any time to learn. Negative in that it was done in the same trite manner as the `political commentary'.",

It has all the heart and earthiness of the best indie films, and it also has the raunchiness of a hardcore porno film.

Until that happens, I feel that many people, myself included, do not have the maturity to understand this film's subtleties.  This brings me to my main point.  The assorted people I saw this film with seemed to fall into two main groups.  There were the cinephiles like my myself and also some people obviously not used to a mature film.  I found it immensely distracting to have people giggling away during the most poignant moments of this film.  I think that if we can learn to both understand and respect sexuality, we will understand this film.",

Bingo.The film is a Mexican 2001 film about the exploits of 2 sex mad pre university teenagers.\nTheir Mexican girlfriends go off on a tour of Europe so they use their time 'alone' to befreind an older woman (who I thought resembled Sandra Bullock) and take her on a slow road trip to a beach.\nThe film descends into several sexual scenes and explores the emotions of jealousy, discovery, and other set pieces to graphic to explain to a Flixster audience.The film has elements of the British sexual comedy Rita, Sue and Bob Too. The film is not a comedy however and the ending is sad.\nI understand that Mexican cinema is quite graphic but in no way pornographic. I will certainly have zero Gravity thoughts when I see Gravity. You wont find a thought provoking film like this at your local Odeon. Very arthouse intellectual this.As an aside just shows how poor Mexico is and why we MUST proceed with HS2 in the UK!",

What i love most about this movie, and i guess its what people who didn't like this didn't like, is the interaction between the three central characters and how the two male leads break away over time and how most of this movie, 99% probably is all dialogue. The movie's unashamed take on teen aged sexuality and middle aged women was unbelievably accurate and wonderful, of course this will turn people off but it happens and Cuaron was right to show it. Everything in this movie is delightful and i cared for each of the characters, helped along by the narration of things still to come and things that have happened.

            "content": "This is a great movie and truely representative of a boom in Latin American film. Check out some of the stuff coming out of Chile if you get a chance - especially Sexo Con Amor. Heres some ideas from someone who studies Mexican history and a bit of film criticism.What do people think of the significance of Ana, la Espanola? I find it a motif in the two most successful recent Mexican films (Amores Perros being the other) that it is a beautiful woman idolised by Mexican males who plays the tragic heroine. Ana's marriage collapses and the film concludes by revealing to the viewer that her make-every-minute-count attitude towards life - the essence of the mexicanidad represented by the boys - is born out of her imminent death due to cancer. Likewise, Goya Toledo's stunning model Valeria is the victim of the car crash around which Amores Perros' three plots weave their narrative. Instead of death she lives to lament her misfortune as a crippled shadow of her former self. I sympathised most with the actresses playing the role of the foreigner, the european, over the Mexican actresses who suffered loss, because in the brutality of a Mexican society dominated by machismo they saw their beauty taken, they became fucked by the harsh reality of life. This recalled the theme of La Chingada (the fucked/violated one) in Mexican history. She is La Malinche - the conquistador Hernan Cortes' lover and translator, who facilitated the conquest of the ancient Aztec civilization for the colonising Spanish troops. To this day 'La Chingada' remains an insult in Mexican spanish - hijo de la chingada, 'son of the f**ked one' or 'son of a bitch', and 'chinga tu madre' - 'motherf**ker' remain some of the vilest insults in mexican street slang.what does this history lesson have to do with film you ask? well, my theory is that in these films, the directors are subverting the nationality of La Chingada - the f**ked one is la espanola in each case, not the mexican women as it the time of the conquest - and in doing so reclaiming a mexican identity through the medium of film. The Spanish women are 'conquered' by Mexican men, and live in Mexico migrating from their homeland. Their destiny is tragic, as is that of the Aztec civiliztion following the Spanish invasion. In each film, they become La Chingada figure.As well as subverting nationality to reclaim identity for the Mexicans, the narrative surrounding las espanolas highlights problems blighting Mexican society. The global invasion of materialistic consumer culture is documented by Valeria. Indeed it is exactly because she is the beautiful model that her injury in the car crash seems so tragic. Until the tragic revelation of Ana's cancer adds extra significance to her character, it appears as if marital infidelity is the tragic element, revealing the breakdown of the traditional family unit in the Catholic conservative Mexican society. Furthermore, it rises as almost a side issue yet the liberation of Ana allows Julio and Tenoch to discover their homosexual side, an issue still largely taboo in the world of teenage Mexican men.What do other people think about the roles of Ana and Valeria? Am I reading too much into them?",

It starts with a sex scene, and from what I know, ends with a sex scene (I walked out).  I suppose if one was to go into DEPTH on the movie, trying to justify the sex, they could come up with the idea that it was an intellegent work of cinema.  But if you're smart enough to not scratch through the surface of pornography, then you'd realize it was filth.  \"Comedy.\"  Ha, the fact that one would call this garbage \"comedy\" is the only thing that I see amusing.  Among the disgusting amount of sex scenes, there was a \"farting contest\" a \"masturbation contest\" multiple urination scenes and ethnic slurs at the first sex scene.Sigh.

During the trip, a lot of funny (but REAL) and a lot of unresolved things between the kids come out. But also, (without losing the comedy track) you (and them) are able to see the reality of the country they are living, just as a background but the effect is created. By the end, all of them will learn something and their lives will change. Nothing spectacular, just EXPERIENCE.This is not a moral tale, is just a window to a reality that usually American COMMERCIAL cinema tries to hide. There are a lot of sex scenes in the movie which probably never make to the U.S. release(this would be really a pity).

But to think that that is what this film is about misses the point. From the first scene, frivolous boys saying goodbye to girlfriends and planning a party summer, to the end scene in the lonely coffee shop where they meet at the end of the summer, they have clearly changed and grown up, and been changed forever by their experience, and that's what this film is about.",

            "content": "Way before sweeping the Oscars with Gravity, and right before being in charge of Harry Potter's third movie, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n filmed in Mexico a little road movie that became a sudden hit around the world (and gave him and his brother Carlos an Oscar nomination for the screenplay), cemented his reputation as one of the top filmmakers currently working (and truth be told, his Potter gig wouldn't have happened without this one), and made the lead trio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Diego Luna and Maribel Verd\u00fa) international celebrities.In Y tu mama tambien, Cuar\u00f3n tells the story of Tenoch and Julio, two best friends, fresh off their high school graduation and looking for summer action after their girlfriends leave for European vacations. After they meet Luisa (the Spanish wife of Tenoch's cousin), they invite her to a trip to the beach (a fictional one) and she declines the offer at first, but when she receives life- changing news, Tenoch and Julio are forced to improvise everything for the journey along with her.Cuar\u00f3n goes beyond the typical road movie and offers a luscious portrait of a Mexico marked by overwhelming social contrasts, as seen in Tenoch and Julio's friendship, the former son of a prominent politician with a turbulent past, and the latter, son of a working- class single mother, and also seen in the many places visited by them during their unusual trip (a country filled with poverty and misery, but with a strange vitality and beauty). At the same time, it's a seductive and fervid vision about sexuality, with a verve and naturalness closer to the French Nouvelle Vague, unafraid to question double standards that still prevail when it comes to sex and masculinity, especially in a society like the Mexican one.A movie of such nature requires the right actors, committed to this fearless task. And Cuar\u00f3n chose wisely with Luna and Bernal to play Tenoch and Julio, for they've been friends in real life since their days as child actors in Mexican TV and their chemistry is indeed remarkable. But the movie's revelation is Maribel Verd\u00fa (already famous in Spain before this movie), who finds in Luisa the perfect opportunity to show her acting skills as a vulnerable woman, ready to leave the pain behind and enjoy life in every way.One can say Y tu mama tambien is a curious mix of coming of age movie + road tip + raunchy teen comedy, but the result is nothing like any of those.

Cuoron should have made the film about her. I honestly could not see the big deal about this film except that it sure as hell wasn't a coming-of-age story because the main characters mature from sex crazed adolescents into cold and unappreciative young men with no sense of genuine feeling for an incredible woman.

And if this was indeed a satire, what kind of internet version of sex-crazed society is being ridiculed here?

Excluding the penultimate scene at the outdoor bar, each scene seemed extremely realistic. Unfortunately this also means several true emotions were suppressed so there was never any extremely strong emotion on screen other than rage, but the film showed the awkwardness of that suppression very well. I was disappointed in Bernal's performance because I've grown to expect a lot from him, but all three of the main characters performed decently well.For the bad, people tend to watch films to escape reality, not to relive its most awkward moments, so I can see how many might think the story is off-putting. Nearly all of the sex and nudity scenes went on for *far* longer than necessary, to the point where I might even say this film is borderline pornography. The narrator was both good and bad. The narration added details that seemed more appropriate for a book than a film, creating a world that felt more realistic but also adding nothing to the actual story other than to randomly pop in and kill any good emotions the viewer may be feeling. My biggest complaint is the penultimate scene in the bar and back to their room. There was no reason for the two boys to make amends for everything that happened between them, especially not to the point where they become gay for each other. Despite that scene shattering what immersion I had, the final scene did seem accurate to show how that choice essentially ruined their friendship forever.",

The eroticism, mind you, broke all box-office records in Mexico. Y Tu Mama Tambien is therefore a real deal for, say, perverts and the psychologically immature, who pant out of contained hard-on and kinda sighs of regret. It seems a newly--fashioned sex comedy, post-Last Tango in Paris -- unfunny even in its wildest spurts, and with plenty of moral corruption: kinda teen-sex comedy viewed through an obtuse glass darkly. I'm not particularly into porn, but I've certainly seen, on the internet, much more explicit and worse images in relation to graphic sex. Wrapping up commendable artisanal cinematography in a pseudo-artistic package really does not help it, though. This configures pornography disguised as 'seventh art.' If the authors had intended to narrate a coming-of-age story through a sensitive portrait of intimacy, it might have been different. But the male protagonists are not minors and the female protagonist shows nothing but disrespect for her personality as she gets involved with the two misfits just to get revenge on her macho-man promiscuous husband.",

            "content": "This movie is less about sex among teen-age boys than it is about Mexico. As Maribel Verdu, in the role of Luisa Cortes, tells the boys near the end of the movie, \"You should be glad you're Mexicans! You should be glad to live in Mexico!\" To which the boys whimsically agree with a bizarre, tequila-soaked toast to \"Mexico, magical, musical!\" The boys themselves enjoy that rare thing in Mexico: a middle-class lifestyle, even though they are actually the \"aristocrats\" of that country, attending fancy weddings and spending substantial sums of pesos on marijuana, beer, and road trips.The road trip which comprises most of the movie's action is a two-day sojourn through the countryside, beginning in Mexico City and ending somewhere on the Pacific coast. Film makers Alfonso and Carlos Cuaron (Alfonso directed it) want very much to show Mexico as a quaint but non-threatening place, interspersed with convenient motels, friendly restaurants, and the odd roadblock set up by the Mexican military. But the road is always clear for adventure, for \"imporant\" life experiences, and most importantly for sequences that resemble so many American-made \"coming-of-age\" movies, of which \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" is often a replica. \"See?\" the Cuaron Brothers seem to say, \"we Mexicans are no different from you norteamericanos!\" They are completely wrong, of course. But that's what makes this movie interesting. Nobody in this movie suffers from that particular North American trait borne of Northern European Protestantism: guilt that derives from failure to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Nobody in this movie has a sense of anyone or anything outside themselves; they live with passion for the moment, they fly into rages when it suits them, and sex is no different from any other kind of activity, though it does have the potential to get males and females worked up about each other. Such treatments make this movie so Mexican: it's still very much the Third World down there, even if there are cars, fancy houses, and even paved highways.",

            "content": "\"Y tu mama tambien,\" like a lot of the films from the new generation of artsy Mexican directors (Inarritu, Almodovar), is seemingly unpretentious. At its surface, it's a short movie about two young teenage boys who take a road trip through the countryside of Mexico with an older and more experienced woman. Up to this point, the two boys have spent most of their days dallying in drugs, alcohol, one-minute sex and, occasionally, longing-filled masturbation. Their innocence and naivet\u00e9 is charming enough, but in the company of a relative-by-marriage named Luisa, the boys realize they have a lot to learn. Their friendship is tested by their shared desire for this woman, and, less obviously, by their curdled and misspoken feelings toward each other.A lot of critics and fans praise this movie because it is unafraid to show sex. True, many of the scenes are graphic and even have a the ironic flavor of bad porn. But people who can't get over the sex are missing the point--and believe me, that's tough to say as a seventeen year-old male. The point of the movie can be summed up in one of Luisa's lines near the film's end--\"Life is like the surf, so give yourself away to the sea.\" As the trio travels through dirt-poor sections of Mexico, they collide with disturbing vignettes of death and disaster--the side of Mexico that these three rarely see. Drugs, sex, partying aside--all that these very confused people are trying to do is enjoy the small slices of life they've been doled. And aren't we all?",

            "content": "Decades from now, if there is a movie to describe how youth life in Mexico is life at the turn of the millennium, this one would be it. Re-launching the career of director Alfonso Cuaron, Y Tu Mama Tambien is an explicit film full of politics, subtle commentary, and sex. This movie is also a tough pill to swallow, as it showcases rough emotions, rough dialogue, tough moments of truth, and an overwhelming amount of sexual tension and material. If you can get past the intensity and frank content, then it's a good film to watch. But, this movie is not for the shy, not for the easily-embarrassed, and not for those that lack an open mind. View at your own risk. Don't let it scare you too much though, because this movie is full of heart, humor, and beautiful drama. Everyone has that one major moment in their life when they realize they must grow up, they must do something different in their life. Every person (that eventually matures) goes through that one period of time when ugly realizations open up, leading to them drastically changing. Before jumping to the mature stage, the edge or blockade to leap from must occur. In Y Tu Mama Tambien, we follow a road trip led by three people that deflowers into a plethora of emotions, ugly truths, and sudden realization of mortality. Two young horny teenagers (Diego Luna, Gael Garcia Bernal) with nothing better to do in their lives attempt to convince a beautiful older woman (Maribel Verdu) to accompany them on a trip to the beach. What starts as a harmless attempt to have sex with this woman winds up opening up deep dark secrets that threaten the extremely strong friendship and bond between the two boys. Written by the director and his brother Carlos Curaon, this film not only feels very realistic and close to the heart, but also gets meshed in with the political turmoil happening at the time and taps into what was going on in Mexican youth culture. With Mexico having problems in its government for years, very few realize that those most affected are the next generation of leaders and movers, the young adults. The splitting class systems and constant political turmoil was leaving the Mexican youth in a Generation-X state of mind. This movie reveals all this in a matter of 105 minutes, and for that reason this is one of the better original scripts released in a decade.It is not just the writing that's very gritty; the acting is fantastic as well. I personally believe some of the toughest scenes you could possibly act in are sex scenes, and especially when there are no clothes and no camera tricks to hide the action. A lesser group of actors would have trouble delivering a decent performance when having to reveal it all and engage in graphic sexual scenes, but the three main actors were flawless in their performance. You can feel their tension, you can feel their rage, and sympathize with them when they are at their absolute lowest. The chemistry amongst the three is impressively strong, giving the movie a near documentary feel. Road trip movies always require that the audience can remain interested and invested in the characters involved at all times, and Y Tu Mama Tambien definitely delivers. After a stint of failures, Alfonso Curaon went back to the basics with this movie, ultimately delivering the best directing performance of his career. No shot is ever too long or too short, as he does a superb job visually showing the beauty of Mexico within its fragile status. His directing of the sex scenes were most impressive, as they hold nothing back in a physical scene, while at the same time still deliver the emotions. Sex scenes rarely deliver drama and reveal character traits (usually\u0085its to make the men happy inside), but Y Tu Mama Tambien's assortment of explicit scenes happen for a reason\u2014they are not used for show. While some of the dialogue could have been cut, making this a shorter film, Curaon did a fantastic job directing his script. Bottom Line: An amazing look at turn-of-the-century Mexico, Y Tu Mama Tambien is an emotionally-driven road trip through a beautiful country marred by politics, reputation, and ugly stereotypes. There's so much more to Mexico then just Hispanics angry at their government and trying to head to the States; here is a country rich with culture, history, beauty, and unfortunate uncertainty. Few movies can represent their city well, and fewer movies can accurately portray entire countries well. But, Y Tu Mama Tambien accomplishes just that with a blend of fantastic writing, excellent acting, and great directing. One of the best road trip movies you'll ever see, I recommend this Mexican cinematic modern classic as long as your eyes can tolerate graphic sexual content and graphic nudity. Otherwise, you'll be missing out on a good film that's rough along the artistic edges.",

I think Veronica Langer and Gael Garcia Bernal are luminous actors. The bald views of the variety of modern Mexican life are very well presented. The use of narration during periods of stopped action enhances the screenplay. However, I was disturbed by my own sense that these kids are just like California teens from middle class homes in ways that are far from attractive to me. This made me question whether the film's appeal might be related to this familiarity, observed and recognized subliminally in another nation's culture.

He shoots his story (from a screenplay in collaboration with his brother Carlos) of two high school graduates (Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal) joined by a runaway wife (the alluring and intelligent Maribel Verdu) in search of a beach paradise in a direct but fluid way, allowing his characters to develop beyond their obvious symbolic significance into recognizable young adults struggling to rebel against the preordained roles Mexican society dictates they play. Naturally, their struggles include copious amounts of drug taking (finally a film that doesn't judge its characters for using drugs!), explicit sex bantering and short but powerful couplings that are as convincing as they are frank. It can be downright hysterical--and it's always entertaining--but it's also the serious work of an angry, opinionated director who knows how to make film as subversive as it is fun; Cuaron's contrast of the relative freedoms of Mexico City with the impoverished and repressed countryside being exploited by a conservative ruling party in bed with big business blindsides you by virtue of its matter-of-fact presentation. It's an excellent marriage of comedic excess and poetic wistfulness, a satisfying work of art with broad cultural appeal.",

Plus, the lesson that director Alfonso Cuaron is trying to point out you should enjoy the life that you have and not afflict it.  There are some wonderful shots of the quiet, lonely landscape that's handled by Emmanuel Lubezki (\"Sleepy Hollow\").  Some of the most recent American sex comedies like \"American Pie\" series or \"40 Days and 40 Nights\", have or haven't really made a strong case as this film has.  Simply unimaginable.

            "content": "To describe director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n as simply a road movie featuring two immature best friends and an older, attractive woman would do it a disservice. While that is the premise of Cuar\u00f3n's film, one that at times proves utterly hilarious, there is a stunning complexity to behold. Underneath the surface level, where sex and drug use runs amok, lies both a character study of the three main protagonists, Tenoch, Julio, and Luisa, and an exploration of the bliss of youthful ignorance that doubles as a provider of insights into the state of Mexican society circa-1999.Throughout the trip, Emmanuel Lubezki's camera often moves away from the trio, focusing on happenings outside the vehicle. The story is set against a backdrop of turbulent political change, made clear by the repeated mention of protests in the film's opening act. But as they travel to their destination, Tenoch and Julio remain unaware, immersed in their friendship and their blossoming relationship with Luisa. Yet Lubezki's beautiful camera-work shows everything from police brutality to the aftermath of a hit-and-run accident, displaying the style that he would later use in Cuar\u00f3n's next feature Children of Men. His usage of long takes remains masterful as well, with some scenes carrying on for minutes with nary a cut to be found. These scenes make the film come alive, possessing a lively, fervent energy so rarely found in films today. His images gain further impact from an omniscient narrator voiced by Daniel Gim\u00e9nez Cacho, who provides intermittent commentary on everything from the protagonists' unvoiced thoughts to the history of an area. At its core, Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n is a story about life, with the narrator's ruminations weaving a rich tapestry of the past, future, and present of not only these characters but Mexico itself.The friendship between Tenoch and Julio, the primary driving force of the film, feels as authentic as anything that's ever been put on screen in the history of cinema. Diego Luna and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal capture a spirit of boyish exuberance so perfectly, delivering plenty of laughs as they trade blows over their shared life experiences. And yet a profound sense of melancholy permeates throughout the film, made perhaps more noticeable by the presence of Maribel Verd\u00fa's Luisa. As we watch these characters on the road, we can feel that their last days of adolescence are slowly fading away. Luisa serves as the film's emotional core, a pained woman who shares with Tenoch and Julio the life experiences that have led to their trip. Verd\u00fa simply nails her character, sensual and emotional in equal measure, a reminder of both the pain that comes with living so much as the unbridled joy. The voyage these characters takes feels so real, so genuine, no doubt due to the wonderful script from Cuar\u00f3n and his brother Carlos. It all comes to a head in a climax that left me breathless, one so full of passion and longing, and yet in the most unexpected way.With Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n, Cuar\u00f3n delivered one of the greatest coming- of-age films of all time. I was not only blown away by the performances from the main cast, but by the story that Cuar\u00f3n tells. Despite the thematic complexity of the film and the potential to run into exploitative territory with such a premise, Cuar\u00f3n instead masterfully directs a tale with poignant observations on sex, love, life, and the human condition. And the ending, meanwhile, is one for the ages. It left me in tears.Rating: 10/10 (Masterpiece)",

The sexual themes in this movie were meant to be looked at straight on, and I can't think of another movie which has had the same power to present this central side of the human experience.Some commented that the story is \"unrealistic\", but I see it as a \"what if\".

The joy of fiction is being able to create these \"what ifs\" in order to explore the possibilities -so what if the grown woman had every reason to throw all inhibition and caution to the wind?

Against this trio's many discussions about sex and the ensuing activities, director Alfonso Cuaron makes some very pointed observations about present day Mexico both politically and socially. These are effectively exposed with the understated and unexpected voice over narration as well as scenes of brutality and hardship shown by the way, through the car windows of the traveling trio, who seem largely oblivious to these occurrences. The apparent smallness of these cinematic ploys is in fact extremely potent and poignant. They are played in a highly unbalanced counterpoint with the teen road movie.This is all achieved with much cinematic style, but the sex both physical and in particular verbal simply becomes tedious. The denoument after the final sex scene while moving, remains unsatisfying. Director Cuaron seems to fault slightly just when his skills were most needed.There's much to recommend \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\".

It's a simple concept but well explored here - the amusing script, is filled with smart observations. The characters of the two boys - Julio and Tenoch - are at turns nice, and selfish, logical and quite stupid...quite like real teenage boys. Their friendship shifts and flips throughout the movie, emulating real life relationships of adolescents. The catalyst for this is the older woman between them, Luisa, who has a dignified sadness to her. The acting from all three is spot on.The comedy elements of the movie are character and plot based, centering around the wild antics of the two teenage hot-heads. It's more of a wry observant humour, than deep belly laughs, but there's more than enough here to keep you entertained. The drama moments are equally well handled - the sadness of Luisa is treated perfectly, with the two boys unable to handle the grief and unwilling. Their friendship and sexuality is refreshing - rather than make it into a typical Hollywood joke, it's addressed well and with a frankness we don't normally get to see enough of on the screen.\"Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n\" is rounded off nicely with observant direction from Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, who gives a true-to-life depiction of Mexico in both its glamour and its squalor. The flavour of the place is obvious to any who watches this movie.\"Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n\" is a nice break from the typical norm. Some may raise an eyebrow at its frankness and casual display of nudity (there's a lot of it), but its all done with taste and context, and never feels gratuitous (there's a great tender adolescent awkwardness to all the sex scenes).

And it should also be mentioned that sex is an issue in this film in a very good way, monstrously good way. Only thing that bothers me is that the beautiful girl is called OLDER LADY in some comments. She is rather young, at least she looks young, maybe 30, not older. She is very sexy, and it is understandable that the boys, or should I call them kids, are hot for her. Older lady, means grandmother to me. Two guys and my granny, now that is a movie I wouldn't want to see. How this simple road movie manages to be so good, is a mystery. But I think that the direction and the cast and the humor and the wicked sexy dialogue, i.e. the script, all help to push it in that direction. I cant wait to see the next Harry Potter movie.

            "content": "Julio (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal from \"Amores Perros\") and Tenoch (Diego Luna) are both nearing college age and living in Mexico City, but are seemingly improbable friends. Julio comes from a lower middle class family, while Tenoch's father is a rich politician, but they are inseparable except for when they are having sex with their girlfriends (an instance of which opens the film -- note that the film is unrated but is almost certainly beyond an R). Their girlfriends go away to Europe for the summer, leaving Julio and Tenoch restless. At a party at Tenoch's house (to give you a picture, the President of Mexico attends and the bodyguards outnumber the guests), Tenoch and Julio meet Luisa (Maribel Verd\u00fa), a very attractive, somewhat older woman (perhaps in her late 20's) who is married to Tenoch's cousin. Not knowing who she is, they invite her to go on a trip to a secret beach they say they know but which in fact they have made up. A few days later Luisa gets a call from her husband, who is totally drunk, and who confesses that he has slept with another woman. We see Luisa react. Later Luisa calls Tenoch to see if the offer of the trip still stands. Even though they don't really know where they're going, Tenoch and Julio agree immediately. And even though they believe their girlfriends are being faithful while they visit Europe, Julio and Tenoch are obviously hoping that Luisa will not be faithful to her husband. And so the road trip begins.\nThroughout the course of the film, we also get a perspective on the real Mexico. We see it through the car windows, and we hear the narrator describe other events that we do not see. The difference in social class is illustrated, though not with a heavy hand, and is mirrored in the differences between Tenoch and Julio. The cinematography brings us this Mexico in a realistic but not self-consciously gritty way.\nAll three of the lead actors are very *very* good. Maribel Verd\u00fa plays the central character, with the most complex emotions to show, while Bernal and Luna are teenagers in the process of growing up. Assuming that the sexual subject matter is not an obstacle, the film is well worth watching on many levels, and these performances are the primary reason why.Seen on 5/24/2002.",

Okay... \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" is an instant classic, setting up a standard, even cliched, perhaps even ludicrous situation and then subverting it so that the audience has no idea what to expect or where this movie is going.  The best road movies are as much about taking the audience on a journey as the characters.  Here, we laugh along with the two adolescent, hormonally-charged lads, w*nking and smoking and farting and drinking their way through a long hot summer. They meet a very sexy older woman whose husband is a complete s**t, and so the stage is set for a rites of passage tale.  Standard stuff.  Adolescent male w*nk fantasy.  Except, as time goes on, and the characters reveal themselves through their actions, through dialogue and through the sparingly-used but startlingly-effective voice-over (about which, more later) we come to see that this is actually a much more complex tale, about sex, about the relationships between men and women, between humans and their environments, between law and order, between love and hate. The journey to the mythical \"Heaven's Mouth\" beach is at first hilarious but things grow sad and more introspective as the older woman reveals herself to be, firstly, devastated by the break-up of her marriage, and secondly, sexually voracious.  The two lads are hardly up to the task of keeping her happy.  And anyway, it only leads to jealousy and acrimony between them.They drive on, meeting a fisherman and his family with whom they hang out for a while, in a perfect summer idyll that is never cliched or obvious.Eventually, sex looms on the horizon again, but the (alarmingly erotic) threesome that develops doesn't quite go the way the lads had planned it (or does it?). Meanwhile, about that voice-over.  This is perhaps the film's finest effect: The cool, dispassionate voice fills us in on various characters at first, providing sardonic, ironic counterpoint to the images on the screen.  As the film continues, The Voice comments on things that the characters take no notice of (like the reason for a blue cross on the side of the road) or things they do not yet know (like the depressing fate of the fisherman, whose livelihood will be destroyed by the development of a hotel on his island).  This adds yet another layer to this remarkable film.  And it is a remarkable film.  It is very funny but at the same time deeply serious and often very moving.  It creates a genuinely human story from the stuff of mindless cliche, Quite a feat.  I urge you to see it immediately.",

            "content": "So much can be spoken about this film. It is one of those which whilst you are watching it you are unsure what to think, and when it finishes you feel completely overwhelmed by what you have just seen. All of this and the film isn't really about anything on the surface and doesn't have any major scenes to get you on the edge of your seat. It is simply a film with fantastically written and acted characters that you care about and want to follow on their journey, which is the brilliance with this film. The plot is fairly simple. Two Mexican teenage lads lose their girlfriends to the travelling bug, however as soon as the other halves disappear across the World the two begin partying and searching for that next sexual encounter. At a wedding, to which they both attend, they meet Tenoch's (Luna) cousin's wife. Hr name is Luisa (Verdu), she is ten years older and way out of their league. However they both work their charm and invite her to a make believe beach the following day.The lads little fib doesn't pay off as when she realises that her husband has been sleeping with random women she takes them up on the offer, sending the three of them across the country in search of a make believe beach. Whilst on this trip tension between the friends builds as both try to sexually conquer a woman much older than them. She again calls their bluff and begins to flirt back and before you know it she is pitting them against each other. Many times through the film we see Luisa alone and upset, clearly hurt at her recent issues, but we don't fully understand this until the end when her big secret is revealed and we can see why she is like she is. It ends up being quite moving.Like I said the film is very bare on the surface but the depths are endless. For one it shows us the contrasts within certain areas of Mexico at the time of filming. This is also highlighted by narration which is spoken over a muted backing track every time the trio move to a different area. The narrator explains to us the dangers of where they are heading or the turmoil the area has been through. As well as the narration we see this in our leading characters. Tenoch is a member of a wealthy family and has mainly been brought up by the maid. This is in contrast to Julio's (Bernal) very middle class family, who seem nonexistent in his life. In Luisa we see a woman who had potential which was extinguished due to an ill aunty she had to care for. Technically she is an orphan and had to go out to find the first job she could. Each of their contrasts are shown throughout the characters and it all means something to each of their lives.Sex is also a massive theme in the movie. The opening shot is of one of the boys having sex with his girlfriend, and the second is of the other lad trying to have sex with his girlfriend before her Mother comes up the stairs. This is their life, and by the end of the film their sexual encounter is brought to a whole new level in a shocking final act which ultimately changes both their lives.So much is good about this film. It is very relatable for every man and woman at the ages and with the problems of the characters. It is all believable, from the characters, to the language, to the motivations. Even the camera work is as if you are there with them in the moment. Everything about it is drawing you in and despite the lack of anything really exciting happening you are constantly hooked.I had heard of this film before I watched it and whilst settling down to give it a view I was a little dubious but by the end I was shocked, I was moved and I was willing to watch more of these characters. Alfonso Cuaron used this film to gain the big productions in Hollywood and I'm really not surprised it worked as this film is fascinating. 4 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",

            "content": "\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" (And Your Mother Too, for all you gringos) is one of the best Mexican productions in recent memory. It's a clever and intelligent buddy/road trip film that really captures the spirit of carefree youth left to their own devices. Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal play off each other as if they had been friends since childhood and really honestly seem torn when a girl (Maribel Verdu) comes between them.Since we've already received a \"shame on you\" letter for being involved (read: giving out passes\u0085that's it!) with this film, I think it is fair to go ahead and say this film is pretty graphic by American standards. There is full frontal nudity on all three main characters and there's a couple of other random naked people as well. There's drinking, drugs, and plenty of sex. While not done in a \"Porky's\" style or in any disrespectful way, there is a large portion of people (conservative) that will find this offensive. There are a few \"gross\" scenes, but they all come out in a humorous fashion, not intending to be graphic for the sake of being graphic.While quite a change of pace from the director of \"A Little Princess\" and \"Great Expectations\" (Alfonso Cuaron), this narrative tale examines a time in the life of two boys and how little they knew or cared about the world at the time. This is an interesting angle to the \"buddy movie\" angle because it looks back on the time rather than being a \"slice of life\" kind of film. Its critique of Mexican culture and society are interesting to see through the eyes of younger people, who are apparently often trying to escape their heritage.  It also focuses on the perception of how deep friendships really go. Are we as close to our friends as we think?This one is definitely worth checking out if you're an open-minded viewer. First of all, you have to not mind the subtitles, second of all you have to get past the Puritan-based shame of seeing naked bodies, and third you must appreciate independent cinema. Nothing blows up, nobody's a hero, and there's no \"stars\" to speak of. So if that's all OK with you, go enjoy this film and celebrate the fact that \"Crossroads\" isn't \"the buddy movie of the year\".",

If this isn't enough to entice you there is also a cleverly written, well directed, funny sexy and ultimately shocking story for you as well. Two best friends from rather different backgrounds see their girlfriends off to Italy for the summer and are basically lazing around, aimless, direction less and un motivated. Maribel Verdu's plays Luisa (the older woman) whose husband has just confessed to cheating on her so she takes the boys up on a whimsy offer of seeing a beautiful idyllic beach called 'heavens mouth' that really doesn't exist as they were simply chatting her up. However after directions from a stoner friend they set off for some lovely coastline and find out a lot about each other on the way both mentally and physically. Luisa sleeps with both boys and they each find out they cheated with each others girlfriends and both events cause a serious rift in their friendship. The trip ends with a threesome and a bit of embarrassment for the boys the next morning with both making swift exits. Luisa stays behind as she has finally found herself after a pretty dull life with her husband (or so we think!) What makes this movie stand out are the performances from the three leads. Maribel Verdu as I have said is stunning. She gives Luisa such dimension from being vulnerable, sad and reflective and to then be seductive and sexy as hell. Wow what a woman. Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal are best friends in real life I believe and it shows in their performance which is true and honest. The final scene for me was a real kick in the teeth. It is set a year later as the boys have drifted apart and bump into each other and decide to go for coffee. It turns out Luisa died of cancer just a month after the trip and knew all along she was ill. Tenoch (Luna) leaves and the narrator tells us they never meet again. It ends as Gael Garcia Bernals character sits and thinks for a while (about Luisa?) looks like he is going to cry then comes around and asks for the cheque. I've got to admit it was a sucker punch. The movie is littered with moments that upon finishing watching become important, the sense of death all around (the accident on the road at the beginning & the story of the deaths on the road 10 years before) of life fading away of history and how we all fit into our small time on earth. Luisa at the doctors taking the survey on if she thinks in terms of the present rather than the past or the future. Luisa telling her husband on the phone she met a 98 year old woman who remembered her whole life still and the stories she could tell, her non reply when a Mexican lady says she is natural with children and that she should have her own.

I'm totally confused!Its so boring and dragged out.The narration is annoying and dull.Its such a pain when everything goes quite and the narration INTERRUPTS rudely! Its boring the story just plods along..no conflicts or action..it's far too long too!Nothing actually happens in this stupid film.Also, I think that actor is ugly..He looks like a baby alligator/Dinosaur.I hate the two male protagonists they are so dirty and vulgar.

I don't think I've ever seen a film that equals the unabashed eroticism and deeply provoking under currents of this one.  I thought the story wasn't lacking in anything, which is rare for me.Plus, it was just such a beautiful film, with those bright colours and a cast that looks like they just stepped out of a Wilhelm von Gloeden photograph.  It's been almost half a year since I saw it, so it's not entirely fresh in my mind.One memory I have relating to this film will always stay with me: When Y Tu Mamma was released in theaters, I was still under-age.  However, I had no idea what exactly the content of this movie entailed.  I'd just heared that it was the most groundbreaking film to come out of Mexico in years.  Anyway, I got to the ticket office of the art theater in my town, and I asked the guy behind the counter (a friend of mine) for a ticket for \"that spanish flick\" (I couldn't pronounce the title yet).  There were a few moments of confusion before I came to the realisation that he simply could not let me in.  Very embarrassed, I walked home and didn't get to see it for a whole year (when it finally came out on DVD).Anyway, I recoment it to anyone who's not offended by very, very graphic sex scenes.

            "content": "A simple but powerful road movie about two young men who go in search of a beach with an older woman who helps them to understand themselves more and furthers their sexual education. This deliciously atmospheric and erotic film takes the conventions of the road movie (one of my favourite genres but one which has increasingly found itself at a dead end;see such dismal fare as \"Road Trip\" for evidence of that) and plays up the subtexts. For example, this is one of the rare cases where the car is not a vacuum, the viewer is given short anecdotes by the narrator about fatal crashes or border crossings that end in death and through the windows of the car we see a dead body and the police stopping people for questioning. As filled with death imagery as it is with life this is a film which isn't afraid of the shadows, realising that this makes the sun even brighter. Like the Mexican Day of the Dead it celebrates life and death as well as the complexities of human nature and desire. This is an astonishingly good film; intelligent, compelling, superbly acted and best of all it lingers in the mind.  This is the sort of thing Hollywood used to make back in the 70's when script and performance meant more than spectacle. Cross that with the Latin steaminess of the likes of Bigas Luna or Pedro Almodovar and you have a heady cocktail to savour. Dont miss it",

It's funny how in most American cinema most of the full-frontal nudity is female nudity. There was hardly any female nudity in this movie, but lots and lots of male nudity. I have to tell you though...after seeing dozens of women being exploited by American cinema, it was a pleasure to see male nudity dominating this movie.Well, enough of that.  I actually rather enjoyed this movie.  It has a touch of the teen-sex-road-trip movie thing, but there's definitely more to it. It was funny without doing ludicrous things like having the protagonist do it with a pie.  It also had a bit more depth to it and portrayed the characters really well.  The casting was decent too, although when Luisa cried she would go :-D and it would take me a moment to realize that she was crying, not laughing.So, I'd recommend this movie.

But I think they must have been smoking the wacky tobaccy, because one should be stoned to make it through this adolescent crap.  To be blunt, it's like soaking your feet in battery acid.Y Tu Mama Tambien is your typical teenage `sexual maturity' flick, which has been totally clich\u00e9 ever since The Summer of '42.  The two young men, one from a socially prominent family, the other from a working class background, are both good-looking, and indescribably horny.  Like most young men in their late teens, all they think about is getting laid.  Boring, ain't it? But then they meet a mysterious Spanish woman, the kind that Dylan Thomas wrote about when he said that, `if the gods would love, they'd see with eyes like mine, but should not touch like I, your sweet inductive thighs, and raven hair.'  She's a real no-s*** goddess.  So, they set about the arduous task of seducing her.  By the end of the film, they've achieved their purpose, though not without the gracious condescension of the goddess. Asleep yet?What really galls me about this film is the way their relationship with the goddess, who initiates them into the pleasures of the flesh, descends into being decadently, indulgently sentimental.  At the beginning of the film, we see her gleefully screwing the two young men, apparently for revenge against her unfaithful husband.  At the same time, we see her grieving, apparently, over her failed marriage.  For a woman of strong desire, she's such a delicate flower!  But it's not until the very end of the film that we understand the real reason for giving her husband his freedom, for being a sexual goddess to the two young men:  all the while, she was dying of cancer.  She was selflessly giving herself to everyone!  How generous, how noble!Let me tell you, when comes to tear-jerking prattle of this sort, give my portion to someone else.",

Here's a movie about real-life characters whose deepest motivation is the lure and excitement of sex. (Powerful driving, penetrating sex.) It seems like a superficial movie at times, but it builds and builds until it reaches a wild and then sad climax. The writer-director certainly trains his camera on two boys in full heat and on a beautiful tragic heroine, making this one of the most interesting trios in film history.\nThe narration sound track is certainly a put-off. Stoping all background sound to listen to him just doesn't work at all. And it seems as if the narrator has to tell us several involved stories each time his voice is heard, as if competing for a screen writing course.But, forget about the narrator. The film sparkles with color and characters and glimpses of rural Mexico. It can offend the normal viewing audience with its cheers to blow jobs and intercourse and all other matters sexual, but this celebration, especially in a memorable encounter at a beach restaurant near the end of film, stands out as one of the most remarkable scenes in film history.All told, an engaging and charming and erotic adventure that despite some flaws stands out as one of this new century's best.",

            "review_title": "\"Youthful Impertinence and Carnal Obsessiveness\"",
            "content": "\"y Tu Mama Tambien\", the provocative film from Mexico, opens with a graphic scene of wild adolescent lust and never lets up. Filmmaker Alfonso Curon(He co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Carlos) directs with a vigorous intensity and an unsparing artistic vision. He immerses his frames with lurid conversations and sexually explicit attachments. The scenario opens with Tenuch(Diego Luna) a wealthy teenager and his less well-off pal Julio(Gael Garcia Bernal of \"Amores Perros\") flirting brazenly with the seemingly demure Luisa (\"Belle Epoque's Maribel Verdu) at an elaborate party held on the enormous grounds of Tenuch's father. The fact that the attractive, more mature woman is married to Tenuch's older cousin, does little to discourage the youths' hormonal inquiries. The two buddies, fueled with inebriated courage, extend  an invitation for Luisa to join them on a trip to an invented beach paradise they instantly name \"Heaven's Mouth\". Part of their steadfast playfulness with the woman is supported , no doubt, by the likely prospect of being entirely dismissed. Eventually the three do hit the open road together and immediately share an uncommon ease with one another. The forthright, spontaneous talk flows ceaselessly between them.(Possible spoiler) When Luisa seduces Tenuch at a roadside motel, the young man's false bravado quickly dissipates. He responds indecisively to the older woman's sensual commands. Is Luisa introducing the boy to the adult pleasures of sex or attempting to induce her own liberation? Luisa's awakened sensuality mixes mysteriously and enticingly with a deep-rooted, perceptible sadness. (Possible spoiler) Julio witnesses their heated session and mean-spiritedly discloses to his life-long friend that he slept with his girlfriend. This shift in the psycho-sexual dynamics of the 'triangle' and the consequences that occur, recalls Truffaut's \"Jules and Jim\". One may also cite the mercurial films of Federico Fellini and Pedro Almodovar as cinematic reference points. \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" shares the youthful impertinence and carnal obsessiveness of Fellini's cinema and the sex-saturated humor and unblinking openness of Almodovar's work. Curon uses an omniscient narrator who provides backstory, context, philosophical observations and future revelations in a calm, matter-of-fact tone. We're tipped off to the insightful information and commentary whenever the soundtrack eases into a forewarning silence. Curon closely examines themes of freedom, class, loyalty, and the nature of truth. What makes \"Y tu Mama Tambien\" such a distinctive film is that it's much more than a coming-of-age comic road movie. It's also a fascinating exploration of sexual awakening and a bittersweet tale of lust, loss, and irretrievable innocence. As the film nears it's conclusion, the boys' leering machismo and carefree outlook, contrast tellingly with Luisa's more knowing desires. She's lived long enough to acknowledge the precarious nature of life and she senses that the boys' pervasive spirit and uninhibited ways will eventually fade with time. \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" is an exuberant and adventurous work of 'pure cinema', reminiscent of the ambitious, sexually-candid, highly personal art films of 1960's European cinema. We can only hope for more unflinching and challenging films from Alfonso Curon and his contemporaries. The film industry needs it.  KB",

            "content": "Even masterworks can have warts. \"Y Tu Mama Tambien,\" widely praised, honored, and loved by the independent film crowd, of which I count myself a member, has a few.The storyline is straightforward. Julio and Tenoch, the pampered, selfish, jive-talking teen-aged sons of privileged Mexican parents, encounter Luisa, a pretty Spanish wife who loves too much and knows her needs too little. Suddenly and inexplicably betrayed by her husband, Luisa accepts the boys' half-serious invitation to drive to a secluded beach named Heaven's Mouth, near Puerto Escondido. The road trip provides the three with the chance to grow and share their lives, to build their trust, and to come to know the Mexican people, who are portrayed as bedrock betrayed by an oppressive oligarchy and political elite \u2013- by remote political and business leaders just like Julio and Tenoch's parents, and Luisa's husband, in fact.The trip has its magical and pagan qualities. Earth mother Luisa seduces each of the boys in turn. Each boy admits in turn to sleeping with the other's girlfriend. The action pauses from time to time so that, like water babies, the boys, shot from below, can swim naked in a pool \u2013- sometimes clear, sometimes strewn with nature's leaves. Poor Mexicans bestow gifts, like religious offerings, on the well-to-do travelers. Miraculously, Heaven's Mouth, whose name one of the boys made up, turns out to exist, and it is gorgeous. A peasant, who later emerges from the surf with fish for supper, leads the travelers to it. Pigs overrun the trio's campsite like modern-day locusts forcing the trio to adjourn to a local cantina where they party all night and take an oath to debauchery, also known as Diving into the Surf of Life. And so on.Whether in or out of their clothing, Maribel Verdu (Luisa), and to a lesser extent Gael Garcia Bernal (Julio) and Diego Luna (Tenoch), act with a range extending from comedy to pathos. Bravado, playfulness, wonder, anxiety, reserve, lust, disappointment, and rage, among other attitudes, spill out of them believably and in rapid succession.And the warts? Frankly, the extreme youthfulness of the boys early on is hard to take for anyone over 16. There are too many shots in which Luisa looks directly, beckoningly into the camera. The irony of rich and poor is heavy-handed throughout. The camera often drifts away from the action to follow poor Mexicans as they work, get smashed by a car, or are pulled over by the cops. An omniscient narrator glosses many scenes by describing what happened at the same spot ten years earlier or what will happen two years in the future. Each account is meant to, and does in fact, act as a damper on the drama.And the final twist, which will not be disclosed here, emerges without the basic foreshadowing they teach in creative writing class, even in Latin America, without which there is nothing left to do than to bring up the credits and go home. Some surf indeed, but it is too much.",

It spend first 20 minutes telling us how horny and wild two teenagers are with every possible clich\u00e9 you can imagine about horny and wild teenagers. That obviously was not enough, do there's a narrator telling you how horny and wild the two teenagers are. In spite this long introduction to communicate teenage 'hornyness' to the viewer an that they tend to drink a lot and have drugs, NOTHING else is being communicated about them, so they appear as stupid as Beavis and Butthead. If the story is about two boys growing up, please do them a favor and don't show them one dimensional, they are not. People in that age are very complex and that complexity is what affects their emotionally uncertain psyche. Authors are not doing that which is a big shame, they waste all the time showing and telling you how, well ... horny and wild they are.Then the film moves into showing how some families in Mexico are well off and have presidents at their receptions, and how some are poor. Big revelation. Not too much time was spent there, but many obvious clich\u00e9s used.Then an young married woman is introduced, and again all the stereotypes of used here. She's married but not happy, she's foreign, she just discovers her husband is cheating on her, good looking, ... Again, in case you missed the obvious, there's a narrator telling you what you should think. Guess what? Wouldn't that be a perfect match for two horny and wild teenagers, to go on a road trip together? Wow, your ability of prediction is amazing. So, this is supposed to be \"coming of age, sexually maturing, yada yada \" story. OK, right, but don't do it in a way of throwing all the most obvious and shallow stereotypes in a predictable mix.I did like the shots of Mexican rural areas, but I could see more in some documentaries.

Sure she was memorable, but the boys were the heart and soul of this movie.  I cared about them both from beginning to end, remembering well what that stage of life was like.",

Since this is also an erotic film, well, you've got the arties just drooling to talk about how \"great\" it is.But look at what the film is. It starts off with about 15 minutes of fart jokes and standard stoner movie chaff. We are introduced to two worthless teenagers, sons of rich families, who basically do nothing but have sex, get high, and drive around. Then we meet the older woman whose husband cheats on her, who decides that sleeping with teenagers and then killing herself is the best solution. They drive and talk and have R-rated sex and that's about it.People often confuse commentary on nihilism with documentary of nihilism. This movie is the latter. There is no real commentary given. Some have praised the movie for showing the poor side of Mexico - but that's all it does. It shows it. Like it's a sideshow. It's an obvious attempt to lend the movie more credence than it has. Then it rolls on, and the fart jokes and adolescent sex continue.If you get great kicks out of seeing teenage boy ass, or from seeing two teenage boys make out with each other while an older woman pretends to give them oral sex, well, this is your movie. There's more nude adolescent in this film than five Joel Schumacher movies. And the sex is boooorrring. It's Skinemax standard - covered shots, rapid movement, concealing camera angles.\nAnd the most annoying bit about the movie is the ending. Suicide endings are cop-outs. They are blatant heartstring tuggers, used when the person writing the movie can't think of a logical character arc. It's weak and tiresome.\nIf you want porn, rent a porn. If you want a good adolescent sexual awakening story, rent \"Last Tango\" or any of the other 100 movies that have already covered this theme. \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" just isn't worth your time.",

Still, if seen as the most important thing to do in our lives, we become no different than animals. While the importance of reproduction is undeniable, we cannot let it distract us from other beautiful things in life.\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" is about two best friends (Diego Luna & Gael Garcia Bernal) who go on a road trip accompanied by an older woman named Luisa (Maribel Verdu) looking to seduce her. Don't let the porn film description fool you, it's one of the most thoughtful movies on adolescence you'll ever find.Few movies give me the feeling I get when watching \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\", something indescribable I get when watching Hal Ashby movies or any kind of movie with the ability to leave a viewer profoundly touched. The natural camera-work and ambiance is something really hard to find, it's usually found in Lars Von Trier's earlier work, or Dogme 95 movies in general, yet the cinematography in this film is undoubtedly much better and easier on the eyes.In a way, \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" could be seen as a polar opposite movie to \"Children of Men\", while they're both movies with themes about sex, one sees it as fun and the other sees it as a necessity. The characters in this film are only doing it for pleasure, it's what they want the most and probably the only thing they think about, it's a journey about finding ourselves and the things that make us human.I also love the narration, it makes the movie feel a lot more intimate than it already is from the opening scene (when we see one of our main protagonist's having sex with his girlfriend) by letting us know personal details of every single character. It's hard to make a sex scene easy to watch and even funny, it's usually shots of legs and some other body parts, but here we see our characters from an original point of view. It looks awkward, its never what they want it to be, which is one of the aspects that makes the film so unique.It's not only a good film, it gets much better when revisited, the characters feel like good people to hang around with, making it what I'd say is my favorite \"hangout movie\".I'd recommend it to anyone who liked movies similar to \"The Kids are All Right\", \"The Descendants\", \"Dazed and Confused\", \"Rudo y Cursi\", \"Jules et Jim\", \"Harold and Maude\", and/or \"Boogie Nights\". Go see it if you haven't already, it's one of the best Mexico has to offer (and my personal favorite).*spoiler alert* By the way, in the last scene, the narrator lets us know that the two best friends will never speak to each other ever again. Why do you think that is? Because of them having slept with each others girlfriends or because of the awkwardness of knowing they had a threesome?",

            "content": "This movie is about two boys and a woman's trip together, the boys learning about their sexual identity and the woman freeing herself and realizing her liberation. The first boy, Tenoch, is the son of a politician in the upper class, while the second boy, Julio, is from the middle class and has an activist for a sister (seen in the window of their car is an anarchy symbol). With both of their girlfriends on vacation the boys take drugs and think about getting laid all day in the summer, until they meet Luisa. They invite Luisa to join them on a trip to \"Heaven's Mouth,\" a beach that they made up on the spot. On the way to a beach which doesn't yet exist, the boys' hormones get between them, and causes conflict between the three. Their trip teaches the boys much about what their friendship is and was, and who they really are. The woman serves as their mentor as she lives up her new found freedom from her husband, who she left before her decision to go with them. Y Tu Mama Tambien uses parts of Mexican culture to serve as metaphors for its characters' trek. An omniscient narrator comes in at different points and comments on the landscape and the people around them, showing metaphors for their struggles. Like the boys, the county is still trying to find its identity. The movie even shows this, when the boys go to a political protest to find Julio's sister, and also when they suspect a traffic back-up to be the cause of one. They see the poverty and corruption of Mexico (police and former police used to be thought to be thought to be responsible for 60% of Mexico City's crime), while also the good sides of the culture are shown. The boys are festive and the people of the country are friendly. These two sides are shown at once while the boys joke about the corruptness of Tenoch's father before finishing a bottle of Tequila. Although I have not been to Mexico City, from what I know about Mexico and the short time I have spent there, I believe this films depictions of it are accurate. This movie is not a Mexican version of Porky's or American Pie, as some critics like to compare it to. While the movie does feature teenage sex and drug use, these aspects are included because they define the characters. While funny, Y Tu Mama Tambien also should not be considered primarily a comedy. Their lifestyle is not joked at but rather portrayed accurately. While many people do not consider this as a typical lifestyle, many teenage boys seek sex and drugs above all else, as Tenoch and Julio did. The film's purpose is not to be funny but to portray the realizations of the characters on their trip.Y Tu Mama Tambien feels like a documentary in watching, in part from the omniscient narrations describing the country but also from the excellent acting of Diego Luna (Tenoch) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Julio). The cinematography also adds to this, in a pleasant way. The plot seemed to lose momentum about two-thirds of the way briefly through although regained it for a good finish. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind.",

            "content": "Generally I dislike Latin American cinema and culture in general. They are, I believe, inferior to European and American ones.This film is an absolute exception and just because of this I write this review. Some people accept it as a teen age film, others--as a comedy. But this film is neither. True, it is about teenagers but the point of view,I think, is unmistakably adult and mature. It may start as a comedy, but as the plot develops, it becomes painfully clear that definitely comedy it is not. The greatest merit of the film is putting the problem of freedom to the central stage. Nobody dares do that nowadays and those who have, have done it clumsily and unsuccessfully. These two boys--they want to be fully,absolutely free as most young people want to. And their trip to the sea is in fact their travel to absolute freedom, the fulfilling of their (and many others') dream, the much seductive ( but ultimately very dangerous) idea of breaking EVERY taboo and restriction. I think the most beautiful moment of the film is the final scene: the talk in the caf\u00e9, the moment of balance. Yes, they have had their enjoyment of total freedom but they had to pay the heavy price for it--their friendship. Also, all the time they (and we,the viewers) believed that they were using the woman when it becomes clear that in fact she has used them to a much greater extent. It is very easy to start a film interestingly and convincingly but it is much, much difficult to END it interestingly and convincingly. And this film manages this!!! Many things that happen in the film are deceptive and the viewer is forced to rethink many of his/her reactions and emotions as the film progresses and becomes more and more complex. The pace is perfect--neither too slow, nor too quick.I think few films have achieved such a degree of realism and sincerity. Only very talented people could make such a film! Latin American cinema should take note and learn much from this film! I am sure it will become a milestone in the development of Latin American ( and not only) cinema.",

At first I liked the rawness and un-glammy-ness of it, (and I guess with the way women's bodies are always exploited in movies, it feels redeeming to actually see some male genitalia) but after a while it gets in the way, and I was like \"I thought these guys matured a little in last scene, now we're back to this?\"Which brings me to my next problem, and that's the characters complete obliviousness to the world around them. I know it's intentional, but these guys don't become aware of the fact that there's something bigger than themselves and their penises until the end of the movie. And thus is the tone of the movie, it has a message and an inner beauty, but it's not realized until the end.This is a good movie, I do recommend it, but it's not quite as life-changing as the reviews would suggest. 7.8/10",

            "content": "Y Tu Mama Tambien (translated \"And your mother, too\") is one of those rarest of films: for it effortlessly combines elements of: an intelligent and thought-provoking drama about sex; the differing psychologies of men and women about sex; a coming-of-age story; the way politics relate to the problem of poverty; and about the brevity of life and the need to live it to its fullest. A film that contained a thoughtful and mature treatment of even one of the above elements would make it a good film. That Y Tu Mama Tambien does justice to all of them makes it a truly outstanding film, perhaps the best film to come out of Mexico in quite a while.\nThe film features two boys about 17 years old, Tenoch (Diego Luna) and Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal, from another great Mexican film Amores Perros). They are best of friends, even though Tenoch comes from a rich, upper class family and Julio comes from a family that can barely be considered as \"middle class.\" And as typical of many boys their age (irrespective of nationality), they are directionless and, above all, extremely horny. Their girlfriends leave for Italy on a vacation and at a party thrown by Tenoch's father (who's a respectable politician), the boys meet a sexy and older distant cousin of Tenoch, Luisa (Maribel Verdu). During their flirtatious conversation with Luisa they suggest that she should come with them and get away to a magical beach called \"Heaven's Mouth\" (which they made up just to flirt and make conversation with her). Some time afterwards, Luisa calls the boys and asks them if the invitation is still open. They say \"Yes.\" And after borrowing a car from Julio's sister for five days, the three are off on a roadtrip to find Heaven's Mouth.\nI will not reveal any more of the plot here, since this film contains some big surprises, particularly concerning the reason why Luisa decides to go with the boys to that made-up beach (which she believes is real). Suffice it to say that along their journey Luisa ends up teaching the boys about sex, love, and life--in short, the boys' journey to Heaven's Mouth is at the same time their journey towards maturity and manhood.\nYou've probably heard about the pretty explicit sexual content of this film and might have been either: (i) Dissuaded from seeing it, or (ii) since you like smutty and gratuitous sex in movies, you plan on seeing it. If you belong in the latter category, I can say that your expectations will be sorely disappointed. The sex scenes in Y Tu Mama Tambien are not gratuitous, nor are they smutty and puerile; rather, they're open and honest, thoughtful and mature. If you're looking for smut, look elsewhere. If you belong in the former category, I can say that you might very well be pleasantly surprised: surprised about this film's frankness about sex, yes, but even more surprised about its warmth and humanity.\nIn the end, Y Tu Mama Tambien is a film filled more with sadness--and the sober reminder of the mortality of us all--than sex. It is one of those great films that start out making you snicker and laugh (e.g. about its humor and sexuality, of which there are plenty), only to sneak up on you and shatter you emotionally by its (deadly serious) end. Although the aesthetically incompetent folks at the MPAA didn't give this film a rating, I will give it one: \"four stars.\" Y Tu Mama Tambien is one of the \"must see\" films of this year--or any year.",

Things are never what they seem as we follow two very horny friends (Bernal and the equally yummy Diego Luna) as they are lured by Luna's sexy older female cousin on a road trip into the poor heart of Mexico -- and into a journey of self-discovery that plays out with erotic heat that builds to a stunning climax and one of the sexiest kisses ever captured on film.Obliquely, Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n deals with many issues, including sexual politics, macho culture, friendship, class warfare, being true to your heart vs. following the herd, and mortality. Along the way, we're treated to a journey that is both loftily literary and basally sexual. Kind of like life itself.

From this very specific experience, it offers many insights into life and relationships.  With shades of Kate Chopin's Awakening Luisa journeys with Tenoch and Julio in pursuit of a mythical beach.  On the way, the cinematography and setting offer a view of Mexico's strange blend of crudity and indomitable vitality.  Through dialogue which permeates the film, the characters tell both their histories and their current situations.  The emotional and sexual ground that is covered is sometimes amusing and sometimes offensive, but always lively.  The characters tell the secrets and live the dreams that will die without any expression in the lives of many. The acting is not incredible but is exactly what it should be.  The simple plot allows for complex and shifting relationships between the characters through their activities and conversations.  The film's \"climax\" is predictable but nonetheless provocative, while the conclusion is in keeping with the reality which grounds the characters' dreams throughout the movie. Despite the whimsical journey, all three characters are repeatedly brought to back to the fact that their actions have consequences; if their trip is a flight of fancy, then the conversations are occasional crash-landings into cold, hard real life.  Its narration and events are so true to el ritmo acelerado de la vida (the pace of life) that the movie leaves the viewer nostalgic for those events in the characters' past. Overall well-done, but the lack of a unifying theme or idea leaves the viewer open to wondering what the point was. [8/10]",

The sex gets a little out of hand. The story of sex, and more sex may be difficult to happen in real life but it can certainly happen in the realm of magical realism. It's almost as if Zapata and Iturbide are guiding Cortez (or Cortes, whatever) to heaven while diluting themselves in earthly pleasures. Remember, the director takes nothing for granted here: The Institutional Revolutionary Party's last years of power, the main characters' last names, the iconography on the highways and the side stories told by the narrator who knows their past and future (as if he's God), the subliminal social criticism, etc. All this points to a better future with the new political party taking power (Fox), and the optimism it gives towards a new tomorrow in Mexico.",

YTMB is all about liberating yourself and finally realizing that sex after all is not such a big thing.The way director has focused on the psychology of characters makes us love them even more. We shun our moral judgement for a while and think whether what we normally believe about life is true or not. In the start boys keep on fighting because they had 'made' each other's girl-friends but later in the movie they forget it and laugh about it. Also, Lucia keeps on feeling sad because her husband has cheated on her but in the end shuns everything and forgives her husband or at least tries to. Lucia help the boys realize that we have take things in our stride and the boys teach her the same thing.I like the movies which affect the core of human heart, and question our beliefs and what is wrong or right, in short help in maturing the mindset of people. Though not everyone would like what is shown in movie but it surely is another perspective to remember that it's we who impose conditions on ourselves and in some circumstance we might also go against the normal and feel absolutely OK about it.",

It is about a moment when you realize for the first time that you are not the invincible king of the world, and all the tough rules of life fully apply to you; this is the time when you get to mature. It is about a moment when you realize that your whole life crashes into ruins, and there is nothing you can do about it, but accept it as it is - this is the time when you look back, and realize that only now you start to understand what life is all about.At the end 'Y tu mama tambien' makes you think about life and the lessons we all learnt (or should have learnt) along the way, which is always not a bad thing.

            "content": "There is something abouts film done in a foreign language and which is moderately competent but full of sex that tend to send reviewers raving. Perhaps it reflects something peculiar about the reviewers themselves, more likely it's just a poseur response of thinking that they have managed to understand just that tiny bit of something from another culture.This film, once it is stripped of all the sex, is just another coming-of-age film, not better, and not much worse, than a lot of those done in Hollywood. Two hedonistic and loud-mouthed Mexican boys Tenoch and Julio, better off than the vast majority of Mexicans (therefore they are not typical Mexicans and what they do have no relevance to the vast majority of Mexicans), went on a road trip with a woman, Luisa. A lot of sex went on, and the film is peppered with bits of inconsequential socio-political commentary about the state of Mexico. At the end the boys learn something about themselves, but probably not that much, certainly not enough to make them look at themselves more carefully and re-examine their lives and actions.The story is littered with incoherent story lines and illogical situations - for example, why should Julio get upset about seeing Tenoch and Luisa together, when that was as Luisa correctly surmised what they wanted. Was it because he has become attached to Luisa, or he had an undeclared longing for Tenoch? The first possibility is ridiculous as there is nothing that indicates this is so, since they got to know each other for only a day (and Luisa is not really beautiful as some tried to make out), and they weren't upset about leaving her at the end. The second possibility is not relevant as they knew that this is what they did - messing around with girls. Certainly when they finally did get together one drunken night, they were so shocked when sober the next day that they stopped seeing each other soon afterwards. It simply did not make sense that if they really had the hots for each other they should let it go so easily, unless you want to see it as a commentary on how homophobic even hedonistic Mexicans can be. In any case, whatever point the director tried to make falls completely flat - for example when Luisa said that the boys are lucky to be in Mexican because it is so full of life when we can also see that it is also a country so full of cheap deaths. Perhaps the two are related in some ways.The ending is somewhat poignant, when they met again a little older but probably not much wiser and learned about Luisa's fate which explained her actions. It is overall an OK film, far from great, worth watching if you are not squeamish about sex (or especially so if you like to watch sex on film), but don't expect too much. The unfortunate thing is that the plaudits that some heaped on Cuar\u00f3n based on this film led him to be given the job of directing Prisoner of Azkaban. A worse mismatch of director and film I can't imagine.",

I was delighted by this charming movie, and might even go and see it again.Every scene drips with colour, and the cinematography is utterly beautiful. Mexico city and the desert drive to Heaven's Mouth are shot in long, flowing, low-down camera angles which take in the beauty of the country. All this is set off against the scatalogical ramblings of the three main characters.The movie is sometimes overwhelmingly joyous, sometimes awfully sad, but always compelling. It reminded me of the movie Betty Blue, which treats themes of sex and childishness quite similarly.A very graphic film in every sense, Y Tu Mama Tambien features frequent scenes of sex and nudity, and the language is often coarse and blunt. However, the characters are so utterly charming that the effect is never repellant.A wonderful, lively, attractive film featuring superb performances. A must-see.",

            "content": "Okay, here's the deal: this is, as with almost all contemporary Mexican and Latin American films, very complex as far as what it's saying. Allow me to be extremely brief...this is of course a politically charged film and, at its core, a criticism of politics in Mexico. This should be obvious during a second, maybe a third, viewing. Cuaron knows exactly how to get his point across (what I think is a largely negative outlook on the future of the country, but an outlook nonetheless), and does so by masking Y Tu Mama as a coming-of-age road trip. But this is not necessarily a coming-of-age story, not for Tenoch and Julio. It is a commentary on the time period, a time when Vincente Fox's win ended a 70+ year long rule of a government that, for lack of a better word, sucked--as well as an analysis and possible interpretation of human will, motivation, meaning, etc.. Definitely worth buying on DVD. One of the best modern foreign films made.Things to pay attention to, both technical and thematic:1) the framing of certain figures and their location on the screen (e.g. the corners, the middle, and so forth), and the choice of shots and angles, for instance, when Luisa talks to her husband for the last time in the phone booth.2) the narration, the narration, and the narration....NOTHING should be chocked up as \"unnecessary\"....Cuaron is an experienced, well-educated filmmaker. Why would he direct a sloppy script? A bunch of reviews mentioned the trivial scenes with the pigs, and the chickens, but they are in fact there for many reasons (and if nothing else, they give us a glimpse of the \"real\" Mexico)and 3) the parallels between and representations of the three central characters. They illustrate three different \"segments,\" if you will, of Mexican society and political divisions.Sorry to sound preachy. I just don't think a lot of people understood this movie and thus decided it wasn't worth their time. Give these kind of films a chance.

            "content": "On this, the opening weekend of the third AMERICAN PIE movie, I voted with my feet and instead chose to watch a different coming of age film - Alfonso Cuaron's Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN.  Why I waited so long, I don't know.American filmmakers expend tremendous energy, dreaming up \"coming of age\" tales that center around the external, working-world-like concerns their young protagonists must face.  In the end, they are often just writing forced metaphors for the sexual awakening that ushers a young person into the social world of adults.  When AMERICAN PIE came out, it was hailed for its honesty and its likeable characters.  It's such a telling example of what is wrong with American cinema that the fim's rating came down to how many thrusts Jason Biggs was allowed to give a pie.Doubtless, some American viewers will either find MAMA too prurient to contain any value, or they will be so uncomfortable as to laugh at all the wrong times. But Cuaron has made a film in which we are encouraged to laugh, to hold our breaths in anticipation, to feel the blows to the gut of betrayal and to remember our own most painful experiences of sexual awakening.  This is the story of two young men who are full of hormones and lust; they create and idealize rules of behavior for themselves that they cannot possibly satisfy.It is also the story of Luisa, an older though not much wiser woman, who takes a journey through rural Mexico and sexual maturation with them.  Her intentions are questionable, and even when we learn that she sought to affirm her own sense of life, we wonder if she was careless in the way she went about it.  The film will not answer this question for us, which by itself would earn it the kiss of death from American censors.  Luisa is the catalyst throughout the story, and it is only at the end that we become aware of her own journey as well.  Maribel Verdu's frank, playful and layered performance is likewise the glue that keeps the story on track.Cuaron makes an important documentary about rural Mexico in between the lines of his trio's road trip.  The voice-over narration is critical for American viewers to understand the subtext; and for some reason, Mexican directors can pull off this conceit that feels like a cop-out in american movies (as in COMO AGUA PARA CHOCOLATE). As with the story of the three protagonists, this documentary is not judgmental, but it raises difficult questions and demands consideration.What surprised me most, an hour after the film had concluded, was that I found myself in tears as the ramifications of the film's events pieced themselves together in my mind.  My actual sexual experiences may not have mirrored those of the characters, but I and many of my generation have been down the road where the mysticism, power and necessity of intimacy are painfully defined through trial and error.  More than anything else, Cuaron captures not just the honesty of this journey, but the hard truths that result from it.  And yet, the truths I took away were the ones I knew already, as I am sure they will be for each individual viewer.Viewers who are offended by sexual behavior we are all told is \"wrong\" will miss out on the beauty of this film, but I do not recommend it to them. Instead, I reserve my high recommendation for those who can understand that sex is part of life, and of growing up - and who can appreciate fine filmmaking that does not sidestep that great truth.  Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN joins my very short list of 10/10 ratings.",

I'm no kind of puritan, and have nothing against sex , but this film crosses the line of bad taste. Most of the people in the audience left and booed at the film. there's also a tasteless  gay sex scene near the end that grossed everyone out.

I won't go much into what happens there so as not to spoil the ending, but it seemed clich\u00e9d to me and incomprehensible. No offense to the actress, but it seems unlikely that two teenage boys would fall for someone like her. She lacks the level of physical attractiveness needed for the role. There is also a great deal of gratuitous nudity. The two male lead actors' boyish bodies leave one feeling disgusted. It's almost like watching two children, so gross. The lead actress is a poster child for anorexia and her emaciated body was not needed in the story. Thank goodness I fast forwarded through the film, otherwise I would have wasted two whole hours of my life. As is I want my time back.

I might agree with those who complain that writer/director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's film isn't especially challenging or groundbreaking, but I see its relative simplicity as a virtue. Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n presents a charming, honest and bittersweet tale of youth's fleeting folly, and its straightforward narrative suits the material. Nor is this so one-dimensional a story as it might at first seem. Though his manner is oblique, Cuar\u00f3n deftly grounds his characters' small-scale joys and sorrows in an incisively observed larger world. Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n's wealthy young protagonists are both liberated and shielded by their position in life, drifting idly through a landscape that for others threatens much more serious consequences. It's a subtle but effective strategy, and I found the film's concluding scenes quite poignant.Oh, and Brian Eno's \"By This River\" appears on the well-selected soundtrack. It's an impossibly lovely little nothing of a song that everyone should hear at least once.",

Kudos to the director for his bravery in showing how much sex really drives people, especially the two boys. The way that this opened - wow.  That certainly sucked you in.But the flaw in the movie was definitely the overall taste that it left you with.  I won't go into details, but I just expected more of a punchline, a climax - more of a point than what it said.  What I really admire though is the poetry - it certainly leaves you thinking. I guess in this way I came up with my own rewards from this film. Perhaps it's a personal thing, but my girlfriend is going to Italy, and I certainly had the same worries as the two boys here (despite their hypocrisy). Overall, a lovely piece... I want to see more from this director, Alfonso Cuaron - he is unfortunately directing Harry Potter's 4th film (?!?)...  For this movie 8/10",

I'm just glad they didn't decide to \"shock\" us some more and have them be blood-cousins. Incidentally, I don't think those guys came off as gay in the end there.  I mean they were already used to being naked around each other & masturbating together, so a threesome seems like something they'd be pretty comfortable with.  And they just needed a little kissin' while they were getting hand jobs, yo!  That doesn't make them gay.  Of course the threesome scene was cut way too short to know whether they actually had gay sex.

The guys plant a little idea of getaway in Luisa's head. And when Luisa's husband confesses that he cheated on her, she calls one of the guys and asks them about the getaway. What a way to overcome your sadness with a couple of boys? Boys will be boys...why should they refuse? A chance to have some fun and they did not have anything better to do. So voila...the road trip begins. Not much depth to their conversation. It is acting and energy of the guys that keep the movie going. They share stories, smoke, fool around, and eventually get into the known territory. Hey what do you expect? When two boys go on a road trip with a hot adult who is desperate. And wait..the ending, a clich\u00e9..not much there too. Not a great script. If you happen to read some reviews about it, you will probably want to watch. In between, you will realize that the script is not great, the dialogues are okay, the acting even worse, and no breath taking closure. My favorite part is the eleven points in manifesto and how these guys get excited while talking about it to Luisa in the car. Narration made no f******* sense. What the heck was it for? So why is narration used in a movie? One to bring a party's view which is different from what's already being shown on screen. Two to tie different parts of stories together.Three to delve into prelude which has a bearing on the story. Four, to introduce elements such as a character into the story.In which category does it fall?",

I have also rated over 100 movies.This is a definite 10. I nearly died when I saw what some others had written.

DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE! You will find it mostly hard to follow anyway unless you have seen it at least once.What is it about these boys nature that is unique? Their relationship is indivisibly close. They share their most intimate moments together, some of which we are privy to, constantly emphasizing for us how close these boys are. They have a feeling of invincibility and their only vulnerability is the extremely small number of repressed truths that they have hidden from each other... all of which we will learn about throughout the course of the movie.Is the character of Luisa merely there as a toy to provide these two teenage boys some excitement on their trip? If you see her that way, then you have missed something big. She controls these boys. She is the motivation driving the trip and she is the one with power, especially sexually.Think about where they have come from and where they are going, what their trip represents... at what points do the characters redeem or purify themselves, and what happens and when. The name of the beach they are travelling to, `Heaven's Mouth,' should be a big clue... both Heaven and Mouth are key to the understanding of this location. They really don't know where it is or where they're going, or even if it exists, but after their experiences along they way they are inevitably guided toward this 'pure' place. Finally, what happens at this location that is significant? What causes the intense regret and guilt that these boys are possibly feeling and where do they go afterword? Why does Luisa stay behind... for the obvious practical reason we learn of, yes, but what is it about her that allows her to stay at this place? What causes Heaven's Mouth to disappear, be exploited, or however you with to see the final fate of the location?What role did drugs play in the whole unfolding of the story? If you take away the alcohol and marihuana would the story still work?I would seriously, and I'm not being at all sarcastic or saying this tongue-and-cheek, recommend some help if you are so sexually repressed that you are unable to get beyond seeing this movie as a sendup of teenage boys, great sex, and drug use.",

I can't say that i found the movie comical. To me it was a big Drama, worthy of an italian opera. In short: The woman has heard terrible news of which the viewer doesn't know until the end. She finds out that her husband is betraying her, because he tells her himself. At this point she takes the invitation to go to the beach with the two boys (\"real\" latin lovers, just like the husband). On the way there are some clashes between the boys, because of jealousy and immatureness (like \"real latin lovers: they can f**k around, while women are called prostitutes). So both have an adventure with her, while, in the evening she cries her lungs out because she's dying, alone. In the end she dies close to a \"pure\" family on the coast.

I absolutely adore this movie, and now Cuaron too. 'Mama' had a somewhat documentary feel to it, which I loved. Made it seem more real. There was a huge contrast between it (the first Mexican film I've ever seen) and most American movies, due to the lack of in-your-face close-ups. It gave the story a more even flow, I think, because there weren't constant breaks to show someone's facial expression, no trying (and failing) to convey a deeper sense of feeling by thirty seconds of just someone's face looking sad, desperate or angry. Think Lord of the Rings with that one. This is a movie I can watch over and over again without getting bored.",

I first looked at this film as a coming-of-age film, albeit one that happened to include sex scenes much more graphic than others of its genre. That opinion helps me find a reflective starting point for this film, but every time I watch it, I think more and more about the socioeconomic points Cuar\u00f3n interjects throughout. I think more about how little I know about other countries, especially the one just south of my own. (I suppose Tenoch and Julio don't know that much either.) After this last viewing, I thought more about whether the the two actually learned something positive from the experience. We're told they never meet again after the film ends. What happens next?

            "content": "After reading all the comments here I realize there is little to add. However, I do believe it is important to underline the reasons why this is a must see film. First of all, I hope all movie goers recognize that one can't treat Hollywood productions the same way as Foreign films. To be able to truly appreciate a foreign film, one has to be at least slightly familiar with the movie making history of that country. Mexico had its \"glorious\" years (or, its \"Epoca de Oro\") during the 40s and the 50s. After those two decades due to lack of talent, lack of creativity or -most likely- lack of funds (or a combination of the three), it went downhill faster than a tourist gulps down a shot of tequila. During the following thirty years movie fans in Mexico had to satisfy their needs with productions from the rest of the world because home wasn't coming up with anything worth watching. Then in 1990 Jaime Humberto Hermosillo takes Mexico by surprise with \"La Tarea\" and opens a new door for the Mexican movie industry. Following the cue, Alfonso Cuaron releases \"Solo con tu Pareja\" in 1991, Gabriel Retes: \"El Bulto\", Maria Novaro: \"Danzon\" and in 1992, Alfonso Arau brought to the screen the highly acclaimed \"Como Agua para Chocolate\". The last decade of the twentieth century began with a good start. These outstanding productions became known as a new genre: \"El Nuevo Cine Mexicano\" (New Mexican Cinema.) From then on Mexican film makers (always struggling with the money factor) have managed to produce the following extraordinary films: 1993: \"Cronos\" - Guillermo del Toro 1994: \"Principio y Fin\" - Arturo Ripstein 1995: \"El Callejon de los Milagros\" - Jorge Fons (49 intl' awards), \"Dos Crimenes\" - Roberto Sneider, \"La Reina de la Noche\" - Arturo Ripstein, \"Sin Remitente\" - Carlos Carrera. 1996: \"Salon Mexico\" - Jose Luis Garcia Agraz, \"Profundo Carmesi\" - Arturo Ripstein. 1997: \"Santitos\" - Alejandro Springall 1998: \"La Otra Conquista\" - Salvador Carrasco 1999: \"Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas\" - Antonio Serrano, \"Todo el Poder\" - Fernando Sarinana 2000: \"La Ley de Herodes\" - Luis Estrada, \"Amores Perros\" - Alejandro Gonzalez-Inarritu, \"Por la Libre\" - Juan Carlos de Llaca, \"El Funeral de los Dedos\" - David J. Delgado 2001: \"Y tu Mama Tambien\" - Alfonso Cuaron, \"De la Calle\" - Gerardo Tort 2002: \"Vivir Mata\" - Nicolas Echevarria, \"La Habitacion Azul\" - Walter Doehner. So lets see... 25 good Mexican movies in 12 years. That's not bad considering that Mexico is no Hollywood.So when you go see Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, do so in this understanding. Know that you'll be watching a film that takes place in a country that has been screwed up for many years by its government and that people have just had to learn to live under those conditions. Know that not all films made in Mexico will portray a protesting attitude towards social differences (no, not everyone in Mexico is an activist). Know that this film is worth watching because it is an excellent production and treat it as such. Isn't it about time for us to learn not to expect foreign films to explain (and offer solutions for) their entire socio-cultural structure?  Be open-minded, treat this movie as the rare gem that it is, allow yourselves to let your fibers be touched and enjoy the ride.",

I mainly wanted to see it in case the censors decided to edit the film down because of it's content, like they did with Original Sin and Monster's Ball.  The story of the film is interesting and the ending is superb.  The humor in this film is done in a tasteful manner.Some people complained that there was too much male nudity in the film but I felt it had a good blend, it was equal and just.  The sex scenes were realistic, some showcasing the humorous side of sex, the innocence, and the steaminess.  They are also critical to the story so if the movie was edited down, it would not make any sense.I also learned a lot more about Mexican culture through this film.  The narrator explained everything in wonderful detail so when you finish watching the film, everything make complete sense.  The imagery of Mexico is quite beautiful, which is another reason to watch and enjoy the film.  As the three adventurers take their journey, you feel like you are right there in the car with them.I truly enjoyed this film and hope others will get the chance to see it in the theater as well.",

            "content": "I just finished watching this film and went straight to the internet to see what was written about it. It was a very original film, unlike anything I have seen before; although I will not pretend to have watched an awful lot. I found many interesting comments, none of which really captured the essence of this story. Yes, it is a story of teenage hormones and immature hyper-sexuality. However, above all I was struck by the way the lives of the characters were perfectly blended in the social conditions of Mexico. I am almost ignorant to the reality of those conditions, but this film shows a great sensitivity to a reality not wanting to become a dominant theme. It is a background -a reality background that is not often accomplished without trying to make a statement. It shows a writer and director who is very sensitive to social conditions and the way they effect simple people. I was particularly moved by the scene were their car is over-taken by the police who then stop by-passers at gun-point. The three of them went on, not giving any attention, as if nothing happened; as if this sort of thing is an every-day sight; death and politics, interwoven with desire, life and sexuality, throughout.As for the sex, the explicitness is never raw; It is alive with the dynamics of teenage explosion, the guiding element of female sexual desire and freedom.I have to say, I was particularly disappointed by the viewer who seems to only want to reinforce the stereotypes of Western, American or otherwise 'politically stable' back-grounded films. I am a Greek viewer and identified the 'different', the 'other' -it is a Mexican film. However, I did not find it loaded with 'political' or 'nationalist' attitudes and stereotypes. This would be a very superficial viewing.All and all, watching this film is a definite boost to your senses and minds.",

Essentially the movie reminds us that it is only when we know there is an end to life that we can (must) throw ourselves fully into it. The boys were beginners, and thought they would live for ever. This is the trick that life plays on us. Luisa, on the other hand, knew sooner than most that there is an endpoint - and therefore lived fully and totally in the present moment, finding her true self as a woman. The movie told us very poignantly that the living of life itself is about reconciling these seemingly irreconcilable truths. If we all knew sooner rather than later what she knew, how would we live each present moment ? 'La vida es como la espuma, por eso hay que darse como el mar.\"",

            "content": ">> review still in draftAlright so, I'm new to this website and this is my first review so bare with me as I develop a style of expressing my feelings about movies. >_>I think the movie is divine, that it expresses a spiritual understanding of existence, a contentment with being and non-being in a poignant way and that this unfolds in a striking and natural *onda*.When Luisa is on the beach, when she sits there between the two, she says, \"\u00bfno quisierais a veces vivir para siempre?\"(Which is, \"Do you not sometimes want to live forever?\")Now, this is a sort of mediocre but interesting moment while watching the movie up to this point. There's this idea where they've come across the beach finally (unexpectedly, too) and there's the lift of spirit and contentment with having made it to el Boca del Cielo (Heaven's Mouth).Right, fine, this is a minor moment at this point, whatever; movie overall heading toward 6/10 perhaps.Fast forward to the end and we learn that Luisa was dying, knew she was going to die. What do we now understand about this moment? Aside from fact everything for which we had a strong feeling of Suspense of Disbelief is lifted (boom 8/10 movie now), we can revisit the beach scene.You might say, \"Ah, a very strong sadness, that she's happy now and is sad because she has to die, that she wants instead to live.\"But no, that's not right, rather here is where she attains her enlightenment, her peace with death and where the movie turns divine. It's an important expression, \"Do you not sometimes want to live forever?\"It could be, \"Isn't life great?\" or \"How perfect this all is?\" or it could silence and they could be watching the waves, or any other thing.But it's not, it's \"Do you not sometimes want to live forever?\"What does it mean to want to live forever? Here, I can see how this could be considered reading into it too strongly, that it is unfair to read all this into a movie and the intention, EXCEPT THAT, they're at el Boca del Cielo, except that it's come upon unexpectedly.So what does it mean? It means contentment with all possibilities, it means amor fati, it means she is at total understanding with existence, and that, indeed, death is a genuine non-concern; not that she's distracted from it (like how she was with sex with the teenagers), but that it becomes a non-issue, because she has attained a perfect understanding in that moment.Hence, the movie nails a divine experience and that, for me, is what makes a 10/10.I want to also add that, aside from this, the execution thereof is fantastic, and that it's reminiscent of the novel The Silent Cry, where in the last chapter there's revelation and the sudden understanding to all the events that came before. Where, there's this realization of, \"What a second, I missed something huge back there, and it's not my fault.\"It allows you to say, \"Hey, sometimes things are more important than I appreciate, sometimes each moment is infinitely valuable, maybe always and I'm only ignorant to it...\"Bottom line, I really think this is excellent and I'm very glad to have watched it.",

            "content": "The premise of the road trip in cinema tends to have been played out over the past couple years. In 2008, Tim Robbins, Rachel McAdams and Michael Pe\u00f1a took a trip across the country in The Lucky Ones. In 2006, a family took a trip to Redondo Beach, California for a beauty pageant in Little Miss Sunshine. And in 2002, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Diego Luna hooked a beautiful older woman in Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n. Each film has its own reason for the road trip, but they all feature the same basic prospect: all individuals stuck in the car find out a little bit more about themselves along the way. In the case of this film, the characters learn much more than a little; in fact, they learn quite a lot about themselves and about each other. I won't go into too much detail as to what exactly each person learns (because that would give so much of the movie away), but just be in for a lot of information coming at you at once. The acting is very good, especially from Maribel Verd\u00fa, portraying the woman that both boys fantasize after. I had a couple of problems with the film. Firstly, it tends to stretch on and on, and although it leads up to a very good final\u00e9, I just think that it took a little too long to get there. Secondly, there happens to be random dialogue about the areas surrounding the car-going travelers, which helps to set the stage and the state of the country as a whole, but in the course of things, tends to distract the viewer from the actual story at hand. But aside from that, it's a very well-made film. One review I've read calls it \"a comment on economics and sexuality,\" which is very close to being correct. If you aren't partial to rampant amounts of sexual escapades, this definitely isn't for you. Any of the characters could find themselves in some sort of sexual encounter at any time, so be prepared for that as well. On the whole, a solid film that's worth a watch if you don't mind the sexuality of it all.",

Try to check it on the IMDb what is it  about. I have mentioned it because Czech distributor of Y Tu mam\u00e1 tambien (And your mother too..) named this Mexican title as Mexick\u00e1 J\u00edzda (The Mexican Ride) to get the audience into the cinema. There is also one girl with two guys and it is also a road-movie. But the similarity of these titles ends in this point. You can give some other examples that can join this titles, e.g. the runaway from society,  reflecting the life, an effort to get know myself, hunger for freedom and so on, but by these points are characterized most of the road-movies - check Thelma and Louise :)Well, back to Y Tu mam\u00e1 tambien. I have enjoyed it. The teenagers are talking about girls, sex and drugs and I believe them. It is not like in American Pie - that was a Hollywood film made for the modish wave \"young people are having their first kickoff\". American Pie is a comedy about the life of teenagers, but Y tu mam\u00e1 tambien is a life comedy of teenagers. So do not compare these titles only because of language. In Y tu mam\u00e1 tambien you can believe each word that they say. I have seen two Mexican movies in recent time : this one I am writing about at the moment and the another was Amores Perros (2000). If I could judge all Mexican cinematography through these two films (of course I could not), but lets suppose, I would say that Mexican cinematography is honest. It is about life with no trashy moving moments - and this I prize very high.I won`t write in here what is this film about. I`m just saying: see it and think about it, because when you`re gonna think about it is not just entertainment - it will variegate your life. So I am ending this comment (it is not actually the review) full of comparing one movie with the others and I am admonishing about checking The Ride (1994) by Jan Sverak.Have a nice day.My rate 9/10",

I definitely think that this movie was excellently written and performed. Everything in the movie was humorous with a dramatic twist! 2 young men attract a women to go with them to HEAVENS MOUTH, a beach that they made up so that she would come with them on the road trip. Many people may say that this movie has too man sex parts, but i have to disagree. The ones who say that are the ones that are too immature to handle what happens in the real world. The writer is just trying to make a real film. In this world no this is what really happens there is no more walk you to the door/i never kiss on the first date kind of world. I think that this film tells the truth and i loved it!! anyone who loved this film too should check out other Deigo Luna films because they are great also! I give this movie 11 stars out of 10!!

The authenticity of the friendship between the main characters can only be attributed to unrelenting direction. And ultimately it acts as the catalyst for a much larger story. At points you'll laugh hysterically but not in a Caddy Shack way. There are political messages dropped throughout the narrative in a voice over that is both reserved and poignant.

            "content": "From the full-frontal frankness of it's opening scenes to the bleakly honest finale, Y Tu Mama Tambien is a enchanting, intelligent and erotically charged coming of age tale from Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron (Great Expectations, A Little Princess). Two 17-year-old stoners, Tenoch (Diego Luna), the son of a wealthy politician and his less affluent best friend Julio (Gael Garcia Bernal), plan a summer brimming with sexual misadventures after their girlfriends go on a European vacation.  At first, the best the two friends can muster is a bout of poolside masturbation, but they hit the jackpot after meeting Luisa (Maribel Verdu), a captivating twenty-something woman, unhappily married to Tenoch's cousin. Tenoch and Julio quickly concoct a plan to entice Luisa to join them on a long road trip in a borrowed car by promising her an idyllic stay on a non-existent beach which they name Heaven's Mouth. At first charmed by, but wary of her suitors advances, Luisa finally agrees to accompany the two teens on their journey after she learns of her husband's infidelity while he was away on business.  Over the next few intense days, Luisa takes solace and ultimately finds liberation in the libidinous attention her young companions focus upon her. They in turn discover many bittersweet truths about one another.Using the often treacherous back roads of Mexico as a metaphor for self-discovery, director Cuaron has fashioned a sensual character piece that is powered by the uninhibited performances of its three leads. Also, a restless energy is created by the constantly prowling, hand-held camerawork by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. Definitely a cinematic journey worth taking, Y Tu Mama Tambien is a hot, hilarious, yet heartbreaking meditation on the limitations of friendship, trust and love.",

Not because he was going to give away any plot spoilers (he never does that for any movie unless someone asks, and I made sure not to) but when I asked him what the movie was like, he said it was not just a sex romp but an insightful drama with great writing. He thought it was a great movie.Having just seen it, I'm in complete agreement with him. There is a lot of explicit sex in Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, but it's not gratuitous or glamorous or inexplicable. The sex and particularly the nudity in this film is woven with considerable finesse into the story that the director, writers and actors really wanted to tell--the story of modern-day Mexico, where the events of Julio, Tenoch, and Luisa aren't overshadowed by the political upheaval and economic earthquakes rumbling through their country, but instead mirror them.The master stroke device in this movie's narrative comes each time the audio suddenly fades to total silence, and allows the narrator to comment on events such as a tragic death or the bittersweet history of Tenoch's nanny. What makes this technique so brilliant is that (to my recollection) it is not applied to anything that the main characters say, except for a crucial fight between Julio and Tenoch. They are the narrators of their own action and only at the end does the narrator look outside them to provide commentary that is incredibly sad but also touching. Not many movies go from very good to outstanding in the final 5 minutes but Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN does.The standout performance here is by Maribel Verdu. The movie works because of her character, her sad history, her understated intelligence (she doesn't think she's as smart as the movie shows her to be) and her rainbow of emotions in dealing with these two horny, unformed, goofy but somehow-likable kids. If she wants a starring career in Hollywood, my guess is it won't take her long to get one.The only weaknesses I can point to are some speechifying that hammer home the film's unabashedly left-wing political views--which are otherwise presented in less-haranguing human terms--and a ridiculous narration that tries to tie this material to 23 pigs (you'll see what I mean!).

At the end i went out the movies feeling empty, this movie didn't entertain me, and not even left a message in my life. Lucky me i just pay 20 pesos! i probably would regret if it had been more.",

Then the process is described in excruciating detail. Most X rated movies do a better job at that. There was no necessity to make the movie so distasteful.

Second, the acting, the movie is stolen by the sexuality of the characters specially the female one. The Cinematography by Lubezki is superior to his past works, this is refreshing and amazing at the same time. The theme has stolen a lot of lines in the diaries in Mexico by his \"C\" classification (something like NC-17 IN US)  because this is a new kind of look at the sex in teenagers and  the way the film portrays the mexican decadent situation on this days, if you live here in Mexico you have probably seen it because this is the most engrossing film in this country (superior to \" Amores Perros\") and if you live out just wait to see the trailer and you will probably will go running to the theater to see it10/10",

It does work, it is funny in places, and the female lead (I forget her name) is excellent. Forget the usual Hollywood garbage at your multiplex - take a chance and see this - something different.",

But for example  where is the intelligent part in showing several times how people are p***ing? I fail to see the relevance of these scenes to the story but that's only my opinion. It seemed that the director showed sex every 3 seconds to try to divert attention from the story. It was somewhat a correct choice for the box-office of this movie (including the controversy about its candidature for Oscar) but it totally failed from the artistic point of view.It is easy to explicitly guide the viewer, take him by hand and show to him how people have sex (which is very nice and entertaining, but not for a film which was supposed to be \"art movie\"). But it is  much more difficult to only  suggest some things and then let  the viewer's imagination to go from there. My recommendation: rent \"Oscar and Lucinda\", a movie also about people who are on a journey of discoveries, but a movie which prefers the fine touch to \"there is more in life than sex but we don't care\" approach of \"Y tu mama tambien\" Or you can rent Emanuelle: an erotic movie which is closer to art than this mexican film.",

I'm reading the posts for this flick and wonder how many viewers are actually Mexicanos and how many just rented it because they heard rumors about its sensuality and couldn't see it in the theatre because middle America doesn't show art films as much as other cultured parts of the States? This was perhaps the most realistic portrayal of adolescence in the life of a latino. Sure sex was a large part of the story but what teenage guy (much less a latino) could argue it isn't as large or larger part of their own life. If you haven't even been to Mexico, the rural parts not yet Americanized, I don't see how you could even really relate to this story other than male fantasy fare - unless you've toured your own country living out of a VW. For those who don't understand Espanol, you'll want to watch the movie at least once more just to pay closer attention to the dialogue and even then it doesn't come close to exactly what is being said in Espanol. Great script! Great pacing! Great film!

Well, hush my mouth, what I got was something old, something blue and a little past its use by date.  This is pretentious schoolboy smut masquerading as erotic.  The camera never gets close - we see things in long shot, or the camera tilts up to avoid those 'nasty bits'. Not brave enough to deal with the issues, the homoeroticism is glossed over and dismissed and the sex is basically loud noises and overacting.  The hapless female is shown in all her glory (she gets her panties ripped off with monotonous regularity) while our two boys are treated with 'respect'. There are fart jokes, pigs, symbolism (the boys have a swim race in a polluted pool - diving into their murky subconscious, geddit?), political allusions (the characters have surnames of famous Mexican political figures) and the most annoying voice over narration.  This was a huge hit in its home country so I could not figure out whether this was political allegory or sex romp or road movie or what.  The male leads are the ugliest teenagers (and that's pushing it) ever to grace a screen and they are grimy - you would have to be desperate to shag these two. One of them has the largest, white bottom ever seen that one could project this movie on it. Let's face it you cannot take a movie seriously that resolves its plot by a voice over in three minutes.  I am lucky I saw this on cheap night because I would have cried myself to sleep.  Inept, inconsistent and ultimately boring.

On the surface level there is much to enjoy with these three free spirits who learn that they are not so free after all.  But lurking just below the surface, if you stop to look and listen, is a story of Mexican politics as well as a story of three human hearts being taken to a level of understanding they had not previously known.This is a wonderful film:  unique, insightful, funny, oh so honestly human, and with three superb acting performances.

A significant portion of the movie is dedicated to how far Tenoch and Julio would go to have sex with Luisa, but much of this is background sexual tension; the real development is when the characters reach their breaking points in relation to sex\u2014such as when Tenoch refuses to continue driving while Luisa and Julio have sex in the back\u2014and friendship\u2014such as Tenoch and Julio's progressive falling out due to scandalous confessions and a journey to a nonexistent destination for a mutual goal that sparks rivalry between them.The narrator specifically is the agent by which we look at youth and time; he observes in the present and describes how it is shaped by the past, but he also divulges information about the future that goes un-filmed and un-shown. This omnipotent knowledge feels secretive, and though he reveals through telling that Luisa had cancer, he chooses to describe and show Tenoch and Julio's last meeting, describing it so. The audience can infer that the narrator has been the camera all along, but that his eye also sees things that the audience doesn't, so he must speak to the viewers. In this way, much of this knowledge seems forbidden, something we aren't allowed to see but which we may hear rumors of, and that feeling (by no accident) seeps into the final scene with Tenoch and Julio.The meaning of the film is more like a puzzle for which we don't have all the pieces. The themes of time, friendship, and sex all intermix into what is essentially\u2014at least in terms of plot\u2014a meaningless journey for a goal that was realized halfway through. The audience must choose if these are the film's significance or if there is something more, some hidden knowledge that, like the narrator, we may know but cannot point out.All told, it's a well put together film with deep insights into young life, though it may often be hard to look at.",

Unlike Betty Blue, this film went from bad - to worse - to downright appalling.I'm hardly a prude, and am quite happy to tolerate sex in aid of some serious purpose, but I just couldn't understand how this film could appeal to anybody other than a teenage male shut-in; it was rather like \"The Inbetweeners\", but without the suburban charm. Sterile toilet humour and desperate, sub-erotic sex scenes abound from beginning to end, without the faintest suggest of a plot or intelligent characterisation. Even the jokes are terrifically unfunny.The film, almost as an afterthought, ends on a slightly poignant note; for those of you bored enough to watch it, I will not spoil it by outlining the details.

The film itself is more about the experience of the journey that the characters go on, and the interactions they have with themselves and other people. Although there is a clear plot, it mostly serves as a device for the real emotional situations to pan out (literally), creating some of the most believable, three dimensionally written characters in a film I've seen. The performances are great- full of energy and dedication. For me, this felt like a film about time; but not in the conventional sense. From another director that deals with this theme such as Nolan, rather than it being an obvious, more science fictional component of the film, Alfonso presents it in a more wholesome, sentimental way. As the characters go on this journey, there is regular narration that points out events that have occurred along the way that the characters are not aware of. The three protagonists are sealed in this road trip bubble, totally immersed with themselves and the destination. Lewbezki's long, continuous shots, provide the same feeling for us, creating a great sense that you are there in the car with them, except we are given a lot more insight into the thoughts and history of the characters and location. There are multiple occasions where the camera will pan round, allowing us to watch something else unravel as the protagonists pass by. This makes you very conscious of the very real, and somewhat dark modern time the characters are living in, yet you seem to forget this every time you are caught up in the emotions of the trio. When you aren't caught up in the solidarity of the dialogue, the cinematography makes incredible use of the breath taking Mexican countryside. On top of this, there are some technically difficult long takes, that are visually stimulating as well as serving as a piece of the narrative puzzle.",

More importantly, he created a realistic high caliber film that revolved around adolescents and their struggle with growing up and finding out \"who they really are\".The first time I saw \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" in the movie theaters I was completely enthralled. Seriously, I fell in love. Within the first week of viewing the film, I saw it another two times. I have admired Alfonso Cuaron ever since. Later on I found out that he had also directed two other films that I had greatly enjoyed years back, \"A Little Princess\" and \"Great Expectations,\" which were really different from this film.  Personally speaking, Y Tu Mama Tambien was more than just another teen movie to me, (i.e. \"American Pie,\" \"Can't Hardly Wait\") instead it was a film about the connections one makes in life, not only with others but with one's self. To be perfectly honest, when researching \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" and its director, Alfonso Cuaron, I began to cry because I felt so proud of him and his work and all the praise he was receiving for it. I know, I know-- this is quite pathetic, but before you judge me let me at least explain.Every article and review I came across did nothing but praise his work and in turn I felt my heart grow with pride. Why, you may ask, am I proud of someone I do not even know? It's simple: He DESERVES such marvelous acclaim. The thing about his film is that it has no bullshit, it's attempt to transcend the reality in which the youth are a part of, is so accurate it can only make you stop and think. Moreover, as a Hispanic I was proud to see a Hispanic filmmaker gain such wonderful recognition in the American film industry, because it is the worldwide leader in filmmaking, and for decades Hispanic cinema has gone unnoticed by moviegoers. Hollywood films are regarded so highly, and yet the Hispanic film industry, in my opinion, has produced a finer quality of films within the past couple of years. Not only did Alfonso Cuaron direct, produce and edit the film, but he also wrote the screenplay. Yet another reason why he deserves such recognition.As soon as the film commenced I was intrigued, simply because Cuaron had the guts necessary to make such a strong opening scene, despite what critics and viewers might say. What made that first scene so perfect was that it was neither raunchy nor inappropriate; moreover it projected how sex actually is, \"explicit, but innocent at the same time. It's clumsy and awkward and real\" (Sex). It never looked staged or rehearsed, but instead gave the movie a more relatable feel. Many viewers may have been appalled at the film's sexual motif, but as one writer put it, \"I mean, teenage boys do have sex,\" with Cuaron simply replying, \"And not always with a pie\" (Hot and Spicy). The films sexual scenes were not added simply to save the film, unlike the brainless movies \"American Pie\" and \"Road Trip,\" but instead were carefully constructed as mature scenarios used to expose the vulnerability and loneliness inside each and every one of us.Actors Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna did more than just play a pair of stoned, horny male teenagers. They managed to deliver lively character's complete with depth, wit, and attitude; a far cry from any one character in a teen film such as \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\"  Right off the bat we are introduced to these na\u00efve and not-so-innocent young men who think they are ready to conquer the world before them; (a common attitude in the lives of many adolescents, whether they'd like to admit it or not). The film's two male leads were more than just weed smoking horndogs, they are also a pair of friends who truly loved each and unfortunately got separated during the journey called life.Another great aspect of \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\" is how the female in the movie was not given the ditsy, self-indulgent, shallow personality most girls in teen films are insulted with. Cuaron creates a striking woman, both internally and externally, without having to include any stylish clothes or catchy lines. In turn we see how these young men fall for Luisa (played by Maribel Verdu), because she is an attractive older woman who offers them a friendship unlike any other. Within a short amount of time, Luisa has earned their trust and their hearts simply by holding honest, mature and wholehearted conversations. Cuaron's creation of a strong female lead was a nice departure to some of the female roles Hollywood has been feeding us.Alfonso Cuaron did not stop there. He went beyond the call of duty by adding an omniscient voice-over narrator, in the style of French New Wave Cinema, giving the entire movie a new perspective. Inspired by Godard's \"Masculine Femenine,\" he added third-person narrative with the intent of creating a \"point of view [that would be] very objective\"(Sex) and so that the \"context would be an important character\" (Au-Cinema). Not only does the omniscient, third person narrator help audiences understand the characters pasts and inner thoughts better, but it also makes \"offhanded but pointed comments about the country's political situation\" (Time '02).\nThe film's ending made it even better since it did not deliver the happy-ending one is accustomed to in this genre. Viewers find out the real reason Luisa decided to join the boys on the road trip was because she was diagnosed with cancer, which eventually took her life, and we also see the strong friendship that Julio and Tenoch once had fall apart never to be restored. The depressing ending closes this movie beautifully because it captures the reality of life in which heartbreaking things do, in fact, occur, whether they seem fair or not. Alfonso Cuaron explains why he chose to end the film this way,\" The ending is kind of sad, but I think it is also an affirmation of life. Even if you see these two boys completely f*** it up, you see that you don't have to. Life is amazing. It has all these freedoms and possibilities. That youthful energy exists\" (Au-Cinema).  I could not have said it better myself.As I write I am trying to gather my thoughts together, which has become an impossible task because the more I read about the movie, the more emotional I get. I feel so silly, but then a random quote from a movie just popped into my head that perfectly explains why I feel this way. Lester Burnham, Kevin Spacey's character in \"American Beauty,\" once said:\n\"It's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst.And then I remember.to relax, and not try to hold on to it.  And then it flows through me like rain. And I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life.\"This film, \"Y Tu Mama Tambien,\" is so relatable, it's so beautifully constructed that 'my heart fills up like a balloon' and 'then it flows through me like rain.' \"Y Tu Mama Tambien vibrates\" with such life, love and energy, you cannot help but want to take a road trip and spend all hours of the night sharing your most intimate stories with those that know you the best, especially before you grow up and wish you had done it long ago. The road of life is long and hard, but the road towards adulthood and self-discovery is even more perilous. If you enjoy films with realistic qualities, if you love life and your friends even more, do not miss Alfonso Cuaron's brilliant Mexican film \"Y Tu Mama Tambien;\" he manages to portray sex, drugs, and friendship in style so breathtaking the whole world took note.",

            "content": "Y tu mama tambi\u00e9n is an interesting film that fully embodies the classic, if stereotypical, coming-of-age tale. The road trip setting allows for a great variety of locations, which show several different parts of Mexico and several different subcultures, from busy urban Mexico City to an old woman alone on the side of the road, grieving the death of her great granddaughter. The narration, too, interrupts the story at appropriate times to broaden the audience's perspective and give more depth not only to the characters' personal histories, but to the political and social climate of the country. This is not a distraction from the present antics and drama of the protagonists; rather, it helps to give their relatively inconsequential story more meaning. For much of the movie, this is effective rather than melodramatic. Towards the end of the movie, these little narrated pieces start to feel excessively sad, even if they are realistic. The grim future of the fishing family from the beach is revealed: within a few years they will be trapped in the city, having lost their fishing business pursuing a bigger dream which was ultimately unsuccessful. After their trip ends, the rest of the movie is equally sad. Luisa's death feels pointless; the fact that the audience hears about it secondhand reduces her role in the movie from protagonist to adventure catalyst. The narrator reveals that Tenoch and Julio lose touch as well, although it is not explained why or what happened. The audience is meant to interpret this turn of events without much of a basis for it, as the rest of the movie is spent building their relationship, revealing flaws, and repairing them. The last scene of the movie is one in which Julio and Tenoch run into each other in the street and decide to stop for a cup of coffee. They part ways and never see each other again. This is an unsatisfying ending to an intense, emotionally charged story. The individual moments and narrated pauses in time in Y tu mama tambi\u00e9n were charming and intriguing, and were generally more satisfying than the movie as a whole.",

It reminded me of many of the the hippy movies of the psychedelic era and was, in many ways, naive.

The story involves two friends and a Spanish girl, who is married to one of the boy's cousin, on a road trip to an imaginary place the boys concocted to woo the Spanish girl. Okay, so it's another road trip movie, but it's more than that.

            "content": "**SPOILERS**Cuaron has been my favorite mexican director for some time now, so I'd been really looking forward to this movie. I'm glad to say it's his best in my opinion. The script paints an accurate picture of mexican youths and on top of that also looks into more commonly treated subjects, focusing particularly in the sadly enormous abyss between the rich and the poor in our country.The movie goes beyond any other before it in terms of sexual explicitness, but if you ask me it stops short of anything distasteful, and anyway it was about time we had some real love making in Mexican films, people might think we don't know how to ...In my opinion, either the two lead actors were high all the time, or they gave one of the best performances I've seen in a long time. They even make Marivel Verdu's occassional mishaps stand out. The photography is excellent, and you can see Cuaron pulling out every last bit of acting effort out of the cast.The dialogues are very casual and well crafted, the characters kept saying exactly what I would've said 10 years ago when I was their age, it was a rejuvenating experience that took me back to that most careless of ages and had me wishing I had also taken a gorgeous older woman to a deserted beach.(Spolier coming...although someone already mentioned it here) I saw the gay scene coming from about halfway through the movie, and I think it practically ruins the commercial success of this film in Mexico because of the way homosexuality is seen here. But Cuaron was brave enough to keep it, and to have it signal a crucial and enduring change that finishes the story in quite an unusual way. The actors were also brave to do it, they know they risk multiple derogaroty comments and could affect thier career in some ways (probably not in a significant way though, they are great actors no matter what).I hope international audiences are once again attracted to Mexican film-making, like with Amores Perros last year. It's my personal opinion that the problem with Mexican directors is that they are so terrificaly creative and unorthodox that they aim too high sometimes. But when all the elements catch up to them, the final product is astounding and internationally acclaimed. Felicidades Cuaron, eres (casi casi casi) la neta !!",

Instead, it was as accurate a portrayal of the borderline cliche coming-of-age story as I've seen in any American film. The boys live recklessly and curse a lot, they like to have sex (and talk about it, too), they cheat on their girlfriends and display an extreme amount of passionate bravado. But on the inside, they're insecure and unfulfilled, as displayed by the scene where they fight in the motel room and, of course, the kissing scene. They are just beginning to see life for what it might possibly be, and by the end of the film when they are faced with the cold reality of Luisa's death and the fallout of their friendship, they are incredibly more mature than at the film's beginning. Now, if that ain't classic coming-of-age, I don't know what is.This is an incredible film that should be watched and enjoyed by all. I highly recommend it to fans of great cinema everywhere.",

If this movie were really supposed to be Bill and Ted's excellent adventure, I'd go easy on it, but no, this is suppossed to awaken the world to this new vision of Mexican cinema that is truly breathtaking and deep.  Fact is, this movie has no depth whatsoever once you were to remove the inappropriately placed and annoying narrator.  What seems to get so much clammer out of the multitudes of meatheads who are so impressed with this film is how bravely our director takes on all these daring sexual themes.  This is nothing new in the world much less in the world of cinema, and even good Catholic Mexicans do a good job commercializing porn. Watching the film, I couldn't help thinking of some of Almodovar's work after a week of shot-gunning jicaras full of Pulque.  I think that you have a film that will appeal to the masses for the wrong reason- naked Spanish chic, or naked Mexican boys living out the real life Bill and Ted adventure on their everyman journey to try-n-distinguish-ourselves-from-Spanish-cinema-by-copying-an-American-style -road-trip-plot plus a bunch of low brow antics.  The social commentary (missed by the vast majority of the people I know who saw this movie) is at best a dismal display of sub-optimal neuron firings on the part of the screen writers. This is the only claim this film has to being good cinema- kind of like a chicken laying rotten eggs.  Perhaps, the only potentially neat thing about this film is the majority of the people who see it don't realize they are as guilty as the main characters in the film of what the social commentary of the film charges them with.  Although I certainly appreciate the irony in this, I think it might be a stretch to think this is what the director had in mind.  I'll make sure I take that Narrator off my Christmas list.",

            "content": "Unbelievable how some infantile viewers see only infantile sex in this magnificent, award-winning, Oscar-nominated movie.The political aspects of this movie merit (and have received) whole discussions in themselves.  But do the Porky's crowd even notice?  Nope. They're too busy being obsessed with the sex.The human aspects of these characters could be delved into with the ferocity of a Ph.D. shrink.  But do the Porky's crowd even notice the deep and nuanced psychology of these characters?  What motivates them?  What hinders them?  Of course not.  The Porky's crowd is too busy noticing the sex.The human growth and change shown in this movie say more about our shared existence on this planet than most movies you or I will ever see.  But do the Porky's crowd even notice the humanity?  Not on your life.  They're too busy focusing on the sex.I like what one poster said previously on this board:  Certain posts tell you more about the poster than they do about the movie.  People obsessed and offended with sex shouldn't see this movie in the first place.  (One wonders what these offended posters were doing in the theatre for this UN-rated movie to begin with!  Unless their sex-obsession is all-consuming and uncontrollable.)But for the rest of you -- this is a beautifully done, highly original movie about life, love, friendship, death, and growing up.  And everything in between.  See it, and savor its fabulous Oscar-nominated screenplay as well as some of the finest acting you'll see on screen this year -- or any other year!",

And as far as I can recall, NOWHERE in this entire movie, except in the very last few moments, does the voiceover ever tell you \"what is going to happen.\"  At the very end, it gives you a few, very dramatic details of what happens with the characters in the future, to button the movie.  But the best part of this voiceover is that it DOESN'T tell you what's going to happen.  It doesn't narrate the story in the old-fashioned way.  It gives you lots of new information about the characters, some of which is hard to digest on first viewing because it goes by so fast.  And it's not easy to assimilate -- it requires some thought. But on seeing the movie a second time, and now reading some of the good comments here, I am even more impressed by the quality of this complex voiceover.  It transforms this movie into something way beyond the norm in terms of coming-of-age movies.",

This movie is deep and as a viewer you have to understand the motive of the director to really appreciate it. Once you get it, the raunchiness and cinematography don't even matter. Technically, this movie was probably pretty cheap and easy to make. It was all...about...the acting. I don't think the story really mattered as much and definitely not the cinematography. It was horrible on purpose and I love that about this movie. The dialog was pure genius, I don't know if it was written exactly how it came out or if the actors improvised but either way it was as original as original gets. Sure, the movie is a bit twisted but it's a fantasy, the best fantasies are always a bit twisted. The sex is not just raw, I think it's real and nobody has ever made a narrative like this with sex that raw and that real. I loved the narration as well, it was poetic and perfect. The end is a goddamn kicker. The way this movie plays with the audience is great, I've never seen anything like it. Sometimes a movie comes along that is extra, extra special and this is one of those movies. Four thumbs up (hey, toes are thumbs right?).",

            "content": "Y Tu Mama Tambien...* * * 1/2 out of * * * *In the new wake of Mexican Cinema, we have a revived industry that's bursting with as much creativity as self-indulgent pretentiousness. \"Amores Perros\" was the closest thing that came to a perfect film ever since the \"New Mexican Film Wave\" started, but there has also been other not-quite as good attempts like \"Piedras Verdes\" which was basically a recollection of pretentious images that meant nothing, except to a small group of people who are known as the \"Mexican Hippie Culture\" (athough it contained a fabulous performance by the very charismatic Osvaldo Benavides who has worked his way from stupid soap operas to movies).Almost all Mexican films have some sort of social protest implied in them, whether the message is as direct as in Luis Estrada's wonderful \"La Ley de Herodes\" which directly exposed PRI's 71 years reign of corruption, or as subtle as the social commentary was in \"Amores Perros\" in where you could contrast the huge differences in social classes coming up with an accurate portrait of a deeply segregated coutry. Only \"Por la Libre\" tried to tell a \"straight story\" with little or no social commentary, and it was not very succesful at doing that.And we come to \"Y Tu Mama Tambien....\" which is a flawed film, but a very memorable one. It stayed with me probably longer than many other more polished films I've admired more. Although the 2 main characters are supposed to be representative of Mexican youth, they fail to give such impression, simply because life in the Federal District (in where the main characters live and where the story takes off) is very different than in the rest of the Republic.  But the 2 main characters, Tenoch and Julio, wonderfully played by Diego Luna and Gael Garc\u00eda are don't have to wear such \"label\" because they are convincing are individuals and work on their own terms.The movie has a very offbeat use of voiceovers, which is sometimes annoying but sometimes quite helpful, because it gives more depth to what's on screen.Of course, as a Mexican film there has to be some sort of social message. The social message in this movie was bit subtle at times but also painfully obvious- which might seem like a contradiction, but it's not. Lubeski's camera acts as a tourist and many important and sad social and political changes are happening in the background while the main characters are focused in their more superficial problems. It is not done in a preachyway, but it is very obvious, a statement in where the higher classes in M\u00e9xico are so self absorbed and egotistical that they are too focused on their own personal problems to notice everything that's happening around them.The movie has caused a \"scandal\" (although it seems more like a marketing device used by the director) because of it's frank sexuality, and even though the movie does indeed tend to focus on sex too often, the actors give their characters enough life and avoid becoming stereotypes. But I do believe this film is for adults, at least recommended from 17 years old on, it is hard to understand why Alfonso Cuaron is complaining that this film was rated \"For Adults Only\" in M\u00e9xico. It is hard to come up with any other recent Hollywood picture which is as open about sex as this one.What makes this movie so special is not the social message, or the sex scenes, but the way these characters interact. It reminded me a little bit of an even better picture \"Martin (Hache)\", in where it was a pleasure to hear the characters talk, not because what they had to say was very interesting, but because you could sense that there was a strong bond between them. It is easy then, to get emotionally attached to characters who are as likable and belieavable as the ones in these movie, and sad to see then hurt each other and themselves. Discussing the plot is irrelevant because it is a chracter-driven film, but it does deal with heartfelt issues about how we are all in this together, and you are always influenced by the people that come in and out of your life, no matter to what extent. It is not so much about love and friendship, but about need, about being young and selfish, and actuallly learning something that will change the way you view things.\"Y Tu Mama Tambien...\" is not by any means, a perfect film, nor does it aspire to be. For once there is a movie in where characters act freely, not like they have read the screenplay, most characters in movies seem to be going through the motions. Rough edges, and all, \"Y Tu Mama Tambien...\" is a film that lives and breathes, and much more than just passing entertainment.",

The movie is almost all nudity, raw language, and very, very blatant sex scenes. I am a teenager, a very mature one I might add, and see movies like this all the time, but when I saw it I was shocked at how many sex scenes there were and how blatant they were.  So if your teenager has seen movies like this before, just warn him that these scenes are very frequent, very blatant, and very raw--if he hasn't seen movies like this, don't take him to see this one. And definitely don't take your children. But for adults and mature teens, this movie is one of the greats. It's just perfect in every sense. The dialogue is superb, they really capture the feeling of Mexican teens and Mexico in general, and there is somewhat of a surprise ending. So please, please see this movie!",

The picture of Mexico was awesome - sometimes disconcerting, often heartbreaking, and always full of passion and I laughed throughout.  I am an adult heterosexual woman and it really was a great departure from American-made, immature, stupid attempts at showing us teenage sexuality and its accompanying struggles.

Had the movie included two wacky cops from South Georgia who 'burned rubber' trying to catch the crazy radical teens on the way to their sex-filled romp at the beach, this movie would have been a hit. And don't forget the happy ending. We wouldn't want the audience to be sad or they may not buy an extra large popcorn.Those of us, North Americans included, who enjoy films with complexity obviously love this one.  What does it mean?  Well...think about it.  The answer is not obvious and fed to you on a silver spoon. It means many things and it may take a few days of thought to understand it. It means different things to you than it does to me.  I watched it last night and I am still learning from it.The title, I think, refers to the scene in the bar where the teen boys are confessing their lack of loyalty.  They are telling one another that they slept with their friend's girlfriends. One boy says 'y tu mama tambien', confessing he had sex with his friend's mom.That's the easy part.  From my perspective, the lady and the journey were trying to teach them about life. The boys were too young to understand it or pay attention, but it was likely they'll grow to understand it later and encounter these same elements as they age.  The lady was trying to teach them about sex and love and living.  The road was trying to show them their past (the boys family came from one part of the road they passed quickly), the militaristic police and opression (many cars stopped along the way with police roughing up the peasants) , the sharing of gifts (the old man giving the boy the hat), death (the small child that was killed on the road 2 years prior to their passing the spot), the passing of time (the long journey), the mystery of life (the mystical heavens mouth was real after all), the local traditions (the town queen festival), the poverty (all around), love and anger (between the 3 passengers), and much more.  Their youth kept them from appreciating it all and in the end of the journey they were overwhelmed and had to get back home in a hurry.Two years later, in the cafe, they seemed to understand a bit more about life and death and they learned that the lady they took on their journey was misunderstood also. The reason she took this journey was to both teach them, but also learn as much about herself before the end of her own journey.",

It's not the sex what bothers, or the dirty words almost troughout all the movie, what really bothers is that there is just only one pourpose at the end: to make you laugh, to entertain. In Mexico we still think that our cinema ows to be political, social and with a message for the masses. We don't need to expose are reality in every movie we produce, we don't need to make serious ideological and subersive films all the time. \"Y tu mama tambien\" is a movie about friendship, about two kids growing up in a country were power and politics means everything, were your life and future depend on your economic position in society, were proving your gendre is almost your number one achievement in life... at the end, that's not just Mexico, or is it?

I think it is precisely the poignancy of the sort of people it captures that makes it work. Maybe it's an obvious point that privilege does not give you freedom from the pains/vulnerability of erotic encounters, or from the inevitability of death. As someone else commented here, the film is remarkably well structured and delivered in terms of the narrative structure. When the narrator shares little anecdotal details about Tenoch and Julio, as well as the stories surrounding them, all sound ceases, save for the voice of the narrator. It has the effect of pulling you in and out of the film, and testing the bounds of cinematic reality. Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal convey all the zeal, hormonal intensity and naivetee of adolescence.\nThe film also links eroticism with death. There is the suggestion that we have an intimacy to both in our lives. We can't really escape either. We are born, we make love and we die. Everything else is contingent and these are the sure things. This is especially so when you play it back in your mind and think of their little gestures of love towards each other - everything from the mundane bits of not mentioning what they don't like about each other's habits, to jerking off by the poolside in rhythm to their delightful sexual fantasies. However, everything passes and things do not last permanently.There is this sense throughout their road trip, that the randomness of death strikes elsewhere - the nameless, faceless statistics of the working class, the impoverished, the indigenous of Mexico. But all the while, it is absolutely, intimately connected to the three of them. It is not so much Ana's relationship to Tenoch and Julio, or her imminent death that is the real issue. She knows all the while, what is going and she is aware of her imminent passing. It is the relationship between the Julio and Tenoch that is really striking. It's so solid, but so transient. What/who dies such a quiet, unnamed death at the end of the film isn't Ana or all those other people we hear about from the narrator. It is the relationship between the two after their momentary crossing of the intimacy boundary. That's what really hits in the end. Nothing really lasts and death isn't just about the physical or material. It is very much about the emotional. This isn't to suggest that the film seemed nihilistic. The fact that it so blatantly confirms this sense of the inevitability of death (despite all the intimacy, all the screwing around and the love, the bonds we forge) is somehow grounding. That seems to be the paradox of the whole film.",

There are others like that.  Luisa, who we believe left her husband for being unfaithful really leaves him to find her independence we find out in the end why she left.  The movie is about being young and sexual and free spirited in a crazy world to sum it up.  I love the way they show sexuality in this movie it is at its most honest.  The way they show Mexico's classes poor, and rich, and finally The view and photography of the movie by Emmanuel Lubezki is Beautiful to watch and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n direction is flawless. I have one complaint though, WHY DO THEY ONLY PLAY MOVIES LIKE Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n IN NON-LATINO NEIGHBORHOODS THIS MOVIE IS PLAYING IN THREE THEATRES LOCATIONS WHERE FEW LATINOS LIVE EXCEPT FOR ONE OF THEM CLOSE BY TO THE LOWER EASTSIDE.  THIS IS A PROBLEM I HOPE DISTRIBUTERS WILL DEAL WITH...GO SEE THIS MOVIE...",

Boy, did he screw up.........big time.MR. CUARON: Why do you think that art means showing what every one else does not show?????? (FOR A REASON; IT IS GROTESQUE) Why do you think art means a lousy narration that gives us uninteresting facts........and succeeds at taking the point off your film? Why do you think Character Development means explaining the life of a person, through an uninteresting voice-over while we see this guy pee? WHY??????????Please, all of you who think this is a beautifull art film...........YOU ARE JUST CONFUSED..........just take a momment to think how deliberate and stupid the events build up in the film.....just take a look at how he copies Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu on going handheld.......just take a look at Carlos Cuaron's lousy writing, that will give you more that 10,000 uninteresting facts that do not affect the story in any way, and will only confuse an audience, and fool some, that do not know any better, into thinking it is artistic.....well...just add just a little more nudity....you'll be watching porn.

Here is my take on the story: a terminally ill, unhappily married women set out on her final voyage of life with two unknowing teenagers to a fantasy land. The fatalistic desires from the women mixed up with adolescent sexual fantasies that helped to transcend the two boys from still holding on to romantic illusions to such wild explorers who experimented with homosexuality or even, as the title suggested, quasi-incest.To me, the drugs and wild parties the two boys had already been accustomed to already suggested strong promiscuity. Their transition to what they eventually become is just matter of time. While the involvement of an older woman, and who is dying, is rather unusual, but if you can't appreciate the significance of the transition, you will be easily left out. The movie is excessively erotic (the director claimed that only 15 minutes of the 2 hour movie would qualify for a G rating) to the point that the sex was enough to overshadow artistic or moralistic subtlety.On another note, I liked the director's use of wide-angle lens in shooting beautiful landscape. His choice of the female protagonist was exceptional too. She was a \"mamacita\" alright.",

There are some funny moments and some witty dialogue. But the movie, for the most part, is not as deep or as profound as the hype makes it out to be. In fact, it seemed to me to _avoid_ such areas, electing instead to stay pretty superficial and sensationalistic. It may tread deeper waters than American Pie, but that is not really saying _much_ by comparison, is it?After I watched Y Tu Mama Tambien, I watched a short film called \"You Owe Me One\", also by Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, that was included on the DVD. It had many of the same elements of Y Tu Mama Tambien and was actually more humorous.",

The movie is graphic in terms of language, sex and nudity (much more male than female, including quite a bit of frontal nudity).  But, its very typical of an 18 year olds life in many ways - brash, immodest, etc.  The acting by the actors playing Tenoch and Julio is very good, and certainly brave considering some of the scenes in the film. \"Luisa\" is played by a stunning actress who handles the complexities of her role without faltering.   Although Tenoch and Julio are sex-focused, foul mouthed kids on the surface, both characters also have their complexities that help define them.  The movie is beautifully filmed, the directing was superb and the film is a well-balanced blending of drama and comedic touch. THIS is the way coming of age movies should be made, unlike the largest majority of crap that is made in the US.  I have seen this movie compared to \"American Pie\", which does it a great disservice.  While that movie was funny in its own way, this movie didn't go for the shallow laughs and mock drama that most coming of age movies do.  But, since it was made in Mexico, they did not have to sanitize to achieve a rating.  Make sure to see the movie in its unrated form.  If you see any rating attached, avoid it! Highly recommended, and easily in my top 10!",

The director intertwines the themes of sex and death in an interesting way, with much social comment on the poverty in Mexico and the corrupt politicians (Tenochs father is a powerful member of the government).This is a highly sexed film, with much explicit language, and this is a blessed relief from the often restrained language of Hollywood fare. As the three characters travel together across the Mexican landscapes Luisa ends up showing the young men just how little they really know about sex, each other and the world in general.  The ending is a dark twist to proceedings but brings together all the themes nicely.If you want to see an intelligent movie, with some superb acting and a novel take on the road movie, get hold of a copy.",

A Drama? An erotic movie? Hey, it's all of those things... and even more. The movie tells the story of two teenagers which spend their days with smoking pot, drinking, talking about sex and masturbating (while their girl-friends spend their holidays in Europe). At a party, they meet the beautiful Luisa, a woman in her mid-twenties who gets betrayed by her husband. She is not able to handle this situation and leaves Mexico City with the two boys, just because she wants to escape from her problems. Together they search a mystical beach, the 'Boca del Cielo'...As you can see, the story is quite simple and nothing that will surprise you. I've read some reviews which compared 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' to movies as 'American Pie' and 'Road Trip'. People who say that must have seen a different movie. The main difference which uplifts this movie above all these dumb US teen flicks is the fact that it feels REAL. Sure, Julio and Tenoch spend most of their day with consuming all kinds of drugs and talking about sex. But here it works: The actors don't seem just to PLAY the characters, the dialogue most of the time feels improvised, the camera-work is more like in a documentary film than in a feature film. Just look at one of the first scene on their trip to the Boce del Cielo: While one of the actors is the car driving along a curvy road, the camera rotates around the car, watches Julio and Tenoch (the driver) how they explain their personal 'Manifesto' which defines their lives to Luisa. They drink, laugh, poke around etc. There is not a single cut for some minutes and no truck that pulls the actor's car. This is a perfect example how a great script and a beautiful filming technique can be combined to give you a unique scene. This authenticity is the main reason why this movie touches so many people, makes them laugh and -at a later point- cry.There are many other episodes in this movie which are beautiful as well, but I don't want to give too much away. Just one more thing: Don't think that you have seen (or might imagine) EVERYTHING that might happen on this wonderful voyage.",

It's just all so, so sad.By the way, I liked this movie alright, but felt it could have put the main assetts of its lead actresses to better use (you know, more t&a), and the car crash scene lacked all the drama of the better financed Hollywood films. It's just so sad the director had to go back to Mexico and make it on a shoestring. And so sad that he couldn't have made his message more obvious for all the people who are incapable or unwilling to look below the surface gloss.

The film is brutally honest with interwoven stories of an unorthodox approach, exposing national identity with a socio-political discourse.The visual style of the film is almost a documentary-style approach, which allows the viewer to have the freedom necessary in order to question and reconstruct the narrative for themselves. This is achieved with an exquisite direction of photography. The camera pulls away from the story with long uninterrupted shots and reveals what happens off-screen, therefore we can identify the adverse social and cultural context without any ideologies being imposed on the audience. The sequences that spectacle the abuse of authority merge into the background and go unnoticed by the characters, which is directly connected to the sociopolitical discourse about the transition to democracy after the PRI party was in power for 70 years in desguise with the underlying theme of 2 teenagers who embarked on a journey with a woman much older than them, where they reach maturity and ponder life as their own past experiences begin to unravel in their intimate and personal conversations.The surnames of the characters refer back to the analogy of the story with the underlying theme.Julio Zapata (reference to Emiliano Zapata) = lower-middle classTenoch Iturbide (reference to Agust\u00edn Iturbide) = upper-middle classLuisa Cort\u00e9s (reference to Hernan Cort\u00e9s) = \"glorified\" by the inhabitants.The fresh and funny improvisation acting of Diego Luna and Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal make the film a very genuine one, in a way that makes them feel realistic, spontaneous and almost unscripted.",

            "content": "For all you political and social science students who found this film trite:   its a fictional narrative told truthfully - whats wrong with that?  Its their perspective - Julio and Tenoches !!!  So if these 18 year olds don't really give a f*** about politics or social injustices of Mexico and whatever else - then so be it.  As long as we do feel through story and characterization that this is where they are as people and it is justified through their actions- then what is wrong?  They do grow and develop greater understanding towards the end of their journey.  In fact may i dare say the entire trip is an allegory in which at its resolution, the end - Julio and Tenoch live-out and realize their own lies, shallowness, and subsequent \"next stage\" of life with greater awareness.  Ahh whatever...ha !!Look, this is a film that does not dare to make any real indepth social and political commentary - it is after all a small story of three most charismatic and exciting characters who capture you in their gaze and hold you throughout the duration of the film.  This was fun.  It was pure joy following these silly yet most truthfully developed characters.  Their journey is perverse at times - yet you are in good hands - as Cuaron tells it as it is for these three.Thats all !  So enjoy it either way - bitch about it - at the very least you come out with some emotion - something a lot of films never manage to achieve.",
