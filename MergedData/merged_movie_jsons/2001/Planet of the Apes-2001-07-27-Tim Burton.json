            "review_title": "A Remake of a Film that Never Needed to be Remade",
            "content": "If one wants to remake a movie, the best option is probably to choose and original that was good, but not a great classic. Clearly, any attempt to remake a concept that failed first time around is fraught with danger, but an attempt to remake a classic runs the risk that one's film will be unfavourably compared with the original. The original 1968 film of 'Planet of the Apes' is one of cinema's great science fiction classics. More than an adventure story, it touches on some of the concerns of the late sixties- the fear of nuclear war, race relations- and also raises more fundamental issues about the relationship between man and nature, the relationship between religion and science, Darwinism and animal rights. It was therefore a brave move on Tim Burton's part to try and remake it. The main concept of Tim Burton's film is basically similar to Franklin Schaffner's. An astronaut from Earth travels to a planet ruled by intelligent apes. Humans exist on this planet, but they are regarded as an inferior species, despised and exploited by the apes. There is, however, an important difference. In the original film, the apes are the only intelligent and articulate beings on the planet. Although they have only attained a pre-industrial level of civilization (they have firearms, but no power-driven machinery, and no means of transport other than the horse or horse-drawn vehicles), they are a far more advanced species than the planet's human inhabitants, who lack the powers of speech and reason and live an animal-like existence. In Burton's remake, humans and apes have similar powers of speech and intellect; it is only the apes' greater physical strength that enables them to dominate the planet and to treat the humans as slaves. It was this ironic role-reversal, with apes behaving like men and men behaving like beasts, that gave Schaffner's film its satirical power. That film was advertised with the slogan 'Somewhere in the Universe, there must be something better than man!', and the apes are indeed, in some respects, better than man. Their law against killing others of their kind, for example, is much more strictly observed than our commandment that 'Thou shalt do no murder'. There is no sense that the apes are bad and the humans good. Even Dr Zaius, the orang-utan politician, is not a wicked individual; by the standards of his society he is an honourable and decent one. His weakness is that of excessive intellectual conservatism and unwillingness to accept opinions that do not fit in with his preconceived world view. (In this respect the apes are very human indeed). Burton's film takes a less subtle moral line. It is a straightforward story of a fight for freedom. The villains are most of the apes, especially the fanatical, human-hating General Thade. The heroes are Captain Davidson, the astronaut from Earth, the planet's human population who long for freedom from the domination of the apes, and a few liberal, pro-human apes, especially Ari, the daughter of an ape senator. The apes are more aggressive and more obviously animals than in the original film; they still frequently move on all fours and emit fierce shrieks whenever angry or excited. There are some things about this film that are good, especially the ape make-up which is, for the most part, more convincing than in the original film and allows the actors more scope to show emotion. (I say 'for the most part' because Ari looks far less simian than do most of the other apes- Tim Burton obviously felt that the audience would be more likely to accept her as a sympathetic character if she looked half-human). The actors playing apes actually seem more convincing than those playing humans. Tim Roth is good as the militaristic Thade, as is Helena Bonham-Carter as Ari. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, is not an actor of the same caliber as Charlton Heston, who played the equivalent role in the original film, and Estella Warren has little to do other than look glamorous. (Heston has a cameo role as an ape in Burton's film, and even gets to repeat his famous line 'Damn you all to hell'). Overall, however, the film is a disappointment when compared to the original, a simple science-fiction adventure story as opposed to an intelligent and philosophical look at complex issues. It tried to copy the device of a surprise ending but failed. Schaffner's famous final twist is shocking, but makes perfect sense in the context of what has gone before. Burton's makes no sense whatsoever.Tim Burton can be a director of great originality, but with 'Planet of the Apes' he fell into the standard Hollywood trap of trying to copy what had already been done and remaking a film that never needed to be remade. It was good to see him return to form with the brilliant 'Big Fish', one of the best films of last year. 6/10",

            "content": "Thank you Hollywood. Yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect-heavy and redundant remake. The original \"Planet of the Apes\" was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting. This movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues. Instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. Dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on. Instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations. The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The make-up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. However, this does not distract from the fact that \"Planet of the Apes (2001)\" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly non-existent plot. Please Hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters.Oh yeah, the ending did not make ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.\n* out of **** stars, mainly for the visuals",

            "review_title": "Underrated",
            "content": "In the spring of 2001 audiences seemed eager to see Tim Burton's retelling of the 1968 classic, \"Planet of the Apes.\" By the summer of 2001 it seemed to be the movie everybody loved to hate. Were the criticisms fair? Not if you ask me.2001's Planet of the Apes' biggest downfall, in my opinion, is unfortunately also it's biggest strength. Unlike many remakes which often end up as nothing more than weaker rehashes of their predecessor's this version of 'Apes' dared to be different. The plot has been stripped down to its bare bones and then rebuilt into something completely new. This is refreshing, if you ask me. Especially when rewatching it now, because just a few short years after this film came out we launched into sort of a remake renaissance, where half the tent pole films that come out every year are the same lesser rehashes that I spoke of a second ago. This film does take a moment here and there to wink at the '68 original, but Burton and his merry band of screenwriters has created a world completely original...it could be watched next to any entry of that original series as a wholey different film.This is also the film's biggest flaw though, or at least financially speaking, because the original 'Apes' franchise has a cult following behind it that could almost rival that of Star Wars or Star Trek. The core audience for this film really only wanted to see their favourite story told with modern day effects and makeup. I don't think we needed that, but I'm not sure how many would agree with me.Now, if you want to compare the two films plots and decide which one is stronger that's a whole other debate. But I don't think that's fair, that's why I champion it for taking such a different approach. I don't think this movie should be compared to any other movie and with that mindset a much better appreciation can be found. To put it bluntly, this movie ain't bad...in fact it's actually pretty good.I won't deconstruct the plot for you...if you're interested enough to be reading this you probably at least know the jist of it anyway. But it's a solid and interesting plot that sets up a very fun and entertaining action adventure flick. Visually its in many ways a departure from typical Burton fair but his stamp is definitely evident in its art direction, and the atmosphere he creates in this jungle/desert/urban/high tech universe is really something to behold. The apes are not only impressive in terms of makeup but they are also creatively impressive from the choices of the species to match personalities, the incredible costumes and simply perfect performances by a cast who act through all that latex. And while I'm praising I'll also throw up a shout out for Danny Elfman's great score, which just might be one of his best.The only caveat I'll lay on the movie is that the twist ending, obviously conceived to rival the famous twist of the original, kind of falls flat. BUT...considering how many instalments the original franchise had I have no doubt that the producers had hoped to make a sequel had this film been more financially successful, and had that sequel been made maybe we would've learned the story behind this twist and all would've been forgiven.It's a little too late to say, 'long story short,' but I will anyway. Give this movie a fair shot. It may not be without its flaws but how many movies are? Try not to compare it to the original, just watch it with a bowl of popcorn and have fun.",

            "review_title": "Marky Mark's Planet Of The Apes",
            "content": "Warning: Spoilers Galore!Tim Burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking Psycho - oh, that's right, some idiot already did that - I rest my case.Movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation, proving he's not that smart from the outset. Marky Mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing, then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees.The perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting Saturn for no apparent reason, interior of ship a-bustle with genetic experiments on apes. Must we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team decrees it.Marky's chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s sci-fi cinema - the Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the space station's mind-boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep-space rescue mission into a worm-hole for an expendable test chimp, with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies.Before anyone can say `Pointless Remake' Marky has surfed the worm-hole, crashed on an alien planet, removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest, if it weren't for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees.Surprise! It's APES doing the chasing - or at least, it *would* have been a surprise if no one saw Planet Of The Apes THIRTY-THREE YEARS AGO.Since Marky Mark did not get to show his pecs, take down his pants, or bust his lame whiteboy rap, he was characterless. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing *his* lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (aka irritating chimp activist), at a loss without a Shakespearean script, did a fine job of outdoing both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutout. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz. Though I have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie, one review headline captured the essence of this Planet Of The Apes `re-imagining': `The Apes Of Roth'. While everyone else minced about looking like extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, as Chimpanzee Thade, chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously. As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc: Thade is mad when we first meet him... and he's pretty much at the same level of mad at film's end. Nice twist.The original POTA (1968) featured a leading character, Charlton Heston's Taylor, who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets - yet as that film progressed, Taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind's worth - as their sole champion! The original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation, not salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species had NOT prevailed. Is there anything that cerebral or ironic to Marky Mark's Leo? Or Roth's Thade? No, but there's lots of running.The slogans cry: Take Back The Planet .but it's the APES' planet. In this movie, humans and apes crash-landed here together, the humans having degenerated to cavepeople, allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor; the apes DESERVED to inherit the planet! Along comes Marky Mark, in true anthropocentric arrogance, taking it for granted that humans HAVE to be the apex predators, simply because they're there.  `Taking it back' is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001, complaining, `A planet where men evolved from APES??!!' and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses.Heston was cast in the 1968 POTA because he had established his reputation as a maverick: he WAS Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! To cast him as the mute, dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience's expectations: how crazed must a world be where Our Man Charlton cannot command respect? Marky Mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants.Though Heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council, he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting. When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans, it's like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor, who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him. Burton tries to elevate Marky to humanity's icon, but he comes off as a chittering deviant. In the original film, the apes deem Taylor a deviant, yet he was, to audience and apes alike, an icon of humanity. That irony again.It was apt that a man who elevated scene-chewing to an acting technique - Heston - should play the father of this film's primo scene-chewer, Thaddeus Roth. As Roth's ape-dad, Charlton utters his own immortal lines, turned against the HUMANS this time, `Damn them! Damn them all to hell!'The movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end. While Thaddeus is giving Marky an ass-beating lesson, a pod descends from on high with Marky's chimpnaut in it. Apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature, while Marky proves his own hebetude by muttering, `Let's teach these monkeys about evolution.' Firstly, they're not monkeys, you ape! Secondly, it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point, not evolution. And what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution.Giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that Estella Warren's half-nekkid role was actually integral to the plot (be still my pants.).No matter that he was humankind's last underpanted hope; in the end, cop apes take Marky away to Plot Point Prison where he was last heard ululating, `It's a madhouse! A MADHOUSE!!...'",

            "content": "For any sci-fi fan, it will be hard to resist watching this movie. The original Planet of the Apes (POTA) opened the door to this new world and made it interesting and believable.This movie is very different than the original. About halfway though, it is clear this movie is going in a different direction. Basically, a astronaut crash lands on planet populated by apes (the dominant species) and humans (the ones who exist in the wild, and as slaves). Soon after he is captured, he picks up the homing beacon to a rescue ship... and the story progresses from there.That's a pretty great setup, and the story progresses in a totally different direction than the original. I really appreciated that because it made the movie all the more interesting.The special effects were one of the big treats of this movie. Not only do we get scenes with the spacecraft, space station, etc. at the beginning (unlike the original), but the character makeup of the apes was fantastic. The variety of body builds, faces, personalities, etc. was very entertaining to watch. Somehow they made Helena Bonham Carter look \"sexy\" as a young animal rights activist/chimpanzee... and Tim Roth look more threatening and aggressive than just about any character I've seen in the movies. Brilliant work.The ape habitats were also kind of cool. If you want to know what an ape kitchen, dining room, bedroom, etc. looks like, you'll get a peek in side some of them in this movie.All the thematic hallmarks of the original are present (role-reversal, overt prejudice and cruelty, fight for equal-rights). While they are probably not as impactive as they were given how times have change, they still deliver a sting about who unpleasant such a society is.While I wouldn't say this is as strong a movie as the original, it is still a fun movie see and worth checking out.",

The costumes for the apes are incredible with intricate details that look very realistic.

But they could have at least got the beginning right.  Neither Mark Wahlberg's character nor the tension is ever developed, so when he is confronted by the apes: we feel nothing.The humans, though they have the benefit of increased intelligence and speech, are poorly utilized.  And Kris Kristofferson is criminally wasted.The make-up and effects are, as you would expect, fantastic.  However, despite improved flexibility in the make-up, there is little warmth in either the performances or direction that made millions of kids go ape-nuts in the seventies.  Bonham-Carter's Ari, whilst convincing, is not a patch on Kim Hunter's Zira.  Roth's quite brilliant performance as Thade virtually carries this film and makes it the one reason to stick with it to the end.Did I say end?  Well, the less said about that the better.",

            "content": "Visually,this film is sometimes a splendor;the light falls on a crepuscular world.The Apes' town is quite scary particularly when you see it from a distance ,as it stands out against an ominous sky.In the very beginning,the cast and credits are also successful,with an adequate martial music.The first third has some funny,parodic and sometimes politically incorrect lines.In the second third,the movie begins to lose steam,although the discovery in the wrecked spaceship is a rather good idea. But that's not all good news.First of all,the hero lacks charisma and the apes and their sensational make-up simply overwhelm him and drown him out.On the contrary,majestic Charlton Heston,even when he was in chains,displayed a Shakespearian grandeur in the first version.The last third consists in battles,a \"second coming\" and the \"astonishing\" ending without which..that would not be \"planet of the apes\".Actually,the new ending was borrowed from Pierre Boulle 's novel,but not without adding a mathematically unlikelihood which will give you headaches if you begin to think too hard:the least they can do:Everything ,even the proper nouns from the French writer's book have been removed,even if some characters recall some of the Boulle/Shaffner version.Shaffner had contented himself with changing the astronauts' name(eg:Ulysse M\u00e9rou=Taylor) Hats off to Helena Bonham-Carter who brings warmth and emotion in a rather vapid cast:in a part close to that of Kim Hunter/Zira,she really asserts her distinctive identity. Tim Roth is effective as well,but his part is less so.David Warner and Kris Kristofferson are wasted.As a tribute to Shaffner(?)both Linda Harrison (an unidentified woman captured with Leo) and Charlton Heston (moaning his curse,which is,admittedly,funny)appear unbilled.Tim Burton might be a director to remember.Although he has not made a genuine masterpiece yet,his filmography is already rich:\"Sleepy hollow\",\"Edward Scissorhands ,the marvelous \"Ed Wood\" (Martin Landau is unforgettable).But redoing \"planet of the apes \" was a hard task.Shaffner's movie followed a progression,it moved slowly,from the long introduction showing the three astronauts making their way across desolate landscapes to the stunning final shots with Heston and Harrison 's roaming down by the sea.Remember how long it took Taylor to convince Zira he was a thinking man!Here it seems natural to Ari almost as soon as she sees him,that Leo is no dumb idiot animal.And that's the last straw,even Tim Roth (some kind of cross between Shaffner's Cornelius and a pulp fiction baddie)pretty damn quickly believes too that that human is too clever for his own sake.Tim Burton's so-so remake epitomizes the dearth of good scripts.Pierre Boulle's book is a golden mine and one could have written a coherent story out of it,different from that of the first version.Why not,for instance,introduce the two \"astronauts\" whose scenes open and close it,and turn Leo's adventures into a flashback?What about showing the love between the hero and the woman-animal ?And the son they had?And the menace this son represented for the simian race? All these ideas were left over by Shaffner's script writers and could have built a strong new tale.The main flaw lies in the human beings:here,they speak -English!- ,they can reason,they can swim (!),they are (except for bubble head Warren)clever,so why the hell did the apes tame them?",

            "review_title": "Apes for dummies",
            "content": "This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his `vision' to the screen.  He has done it with `Batman', `Sleepy Hollow' and now this.  This is not a remake.  The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo).  Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership.The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time.  During the 1960's America was struggling to redefine its civilization.  It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms.  It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal.  In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day.  POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior.  The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties.  This is Apes for Dummies.  It is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance.  The `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel.  While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `I know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent.  The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding (though I continue to dislike his dark look).  However, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.The story has been reduced to a monster movie.  The humans band together behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous Apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoats (notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari).  The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality.The acting is mixed.  Mark Wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role.  Walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong.  This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire.  Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable.  She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.Then there is Tim Roth.  His is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin.  Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade.  He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time.  Additionally, his physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.This film is a great disappointment.  It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door.  I rated it a 3/10.  From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 9/10.  However the story is an insult to the original franchise.  It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is.  Of course it's true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.",

It does keep the main themes but it doesn't explore them like the original.Also what's disappointing (to some) is that you get a Planet of the Apes that isn't really and a Tim Burton movie that isn't really. It's got tremendous visuals, style and atmosphere but they aren't typical Tim Burton. These are also the movies strengths. Burton branches out to do something that doesn't scream his name.

I could be remembering it wrong though.Tim Roth is very good in this. He's a very cool bad guy. And we have never seen him in anything like this before. I was surprised to learn that it was him when I grew up. All of the designs and costumes are really good. That era when CGI was heading into high gear and each big movie did things we hadn't seen before.

            "content": "Tim Burton's new \"Planet of the Apes\" is actually a remake--excuse me, a \"re-imagining\"--of the first TWO movies of the old series.  Its occasional paraphrasing of lines from the original movie (devoid of any meaningful context), and its cameos by members of the original cast (Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison), only underscore that this new version isn't what the original was, i.e., an original.  Mark Wahlberg, as Our Hero, has none of the cynical, edgy complexity of Heston's Taylor, and is in fact the sort of can-do flyboy Taylor found laughable.  Much as I adore Helena Bonham Carter, her turn as Ari, a sultry, sexy, meddling, annoying human-rights activist, is ultimately tiresome, and absolutely incomparable to Kim Hunter's brave, brilliant, impish Zira of the old series.  The role is also a criminal waste of Bonham Carter's beauty, hidden as it is behind a bizarre makeup that looks neither ape nor human.  Rick Baker's highly-touted ape makeups (which I've enjoyed since the days of \"Schlock\" and \"Kentucky Fried Movie\") are highly uneven here.  Tim Roth's villainous Thade has the best, with most of the rest being just adequate and no particular improvement over John Chambers' work in the original.  And the socko ending (keep reading; I won't spoil it for you) is simply tacked on: unlike the jolting end of the original, it neither ties together nor arises from the movie's earlier action in a way that Explains Everything.  Instead, it begs so many questions (mainly \"How the heck did THAT happen?\") that it seems engineered (or contrived) solely to set the stage for more sequels.  All told, this is \"Apes Lite,\" a comic-bookish caricature of the original, made for the short-attention-span crowd.  It made me want to do something I hadn't done in ages: fire up the VCR and roll the original again.  It's typical of the 1968 movie's gritty, clever irony that the first word of dialogue uttered by an ape--his entire line, in fact--is \"Smile.\"",

            "content": "I tried watching this film probably about five years ago and gave up the effort about half way through. Figuring I might have been having a bad day I decided to give it a try again. I'm glad I did because there was actually some thought provoking stuff here just as you had in the original film, with ideas explored concerning racial/species intolerance, animal rights, and the concept of equality in general. Some of it was presented in clich\u00e9d dialog, which I agree can be a turn off, but if you listen attentively, a lot of it is applicable to the present day. One of the most insightful was the observation that \"The human problem cannot be solved by simply throwing money at it\".There's an idea that occurred to me while watching the picture I haven't seen expressed anywhere else and it has to do with the names of the principal characters. The anagram of each name has a connotation that intrinsically describes the nature of that character. For example, take General Thade. An anagram of Thade would be Death, and he was certainly the personification of violent, deadly hatred toward humans. Others I came up with include: Semos = Moses, the mythical ape who was considered the savior of his race, having insured the place of apes above humans in a 'Promised Land' of sorts.Ari = Air, as in having an ethereal quality required to bridge an understanding between the apes and human inhabitants of the planet.Even the name of Mark Wahlberg's character has a Biblical reference if you will. Davidson = David's Son, or Son of David, a name often associated with Jesus Christ who was descended from the Family of David. I haven't read the Pierre Boulle novel on which the film was based, so I don't know if these were names he gave his characters, but if this word play regarding the characters is merely coincidental, the odds I think would be astronomical.Anyway, that's what I thought about while watching the picture. And what is good science fiction if not making you think about what you're watching and/or reading? Beyond that, there's no question the time/space implications of the story lend themselves to serious head scratching. Upon first seeing the ruins of the Oberon space station, the representation called to mind the spires on the crown of the Statue of Liberty which signaled an obvious swipe from the original movie. But then we got to the crux of the Calima business, and I thought that was done pretty cleverly.So all in all, I thought the film makers did a decent job here in re-imagining the original screenplay, while offering food for thought in any number of areas touched upon in the script. Probably more so than even the awkward ending with the Thade Memorial, my biggest question was why Captain Davidson left Pericles behind.",

            "content": "If there's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film, it's seeing it done by experienced film-makers who ought to know better. This \"re-imagining\" of Planet of the Apes could have used some imagination, to say nothing of essential elements of character development. Nova, the girl in the original Planet of the Apes, was a better developed character than Daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word. One certainly expected a lot better from Tim Burton, a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humour, all of which were notably absent from this production.There were problems in basic plot development. The first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk. This was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made *all* the difference in the original film. Even while he was mute, his ability to communicate was what marked out Heston's Taylor as being different from the other humans. In the current film, Mark Wahlberg encourages the (talking) human slaves to revolt, but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already. They are dexterous tool-users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans, something mute humans can't do. It needs no man to fall from the stars to save them. Indeed, since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre-technology era without (at first) any gadgets to help him, it is Wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage, not the humans who are used to living there.It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall Mark Wahlberg. Her best scenes were with the villainous Tim Roth.The humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, at which point Daena started showing some actual interest in Davidson (Wahlberg), and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung-ho freedom-fighter. This was poor character development. (Estella Warren, in particular, looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script). Wahlberg's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me, as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.Creating the apes: half a plus point and two minuses: Ape make-up was excellent on the males, particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes (which was why he was so good in The Green Mile), and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully. But the ape females looked like nothing on earth, neither ape nor human. The minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as Flash Gordon's rocket: jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a catapult, they had none of the long-limbed grace of genuine apes. Secondly, the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal, probably feline, making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.In the original film, the various \"human\" things the apes do and say are handled as light relief (\"I never knew an ape I didn't like.\" \"Human see, human do!\"). Here, the apes just talk matter-of-factly exactly as 21st Century humans do, and there is no humour in it at all. The only genuinely original idea was Ari writing with her feet.Nothing made me cringe more than the \"V-Ger from Star Trek\" moment near the end of the film. First of all, the apes had apparently been able to read Roman lettering in the distant past, for them to know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partly concealed form. Secondly, the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which Wahlberg just brushes away, something any ape could have done centuries ago. This moment was, for me, far worse than the much-maligned ending of the movie.Things of that nature, however, are typical of most science fiction movies of today. Back in the '60s and '70s, they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets, but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional. I'm thinking of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 1967 Planet of the Apes, THX1138, Soylent Green, Silent Running and the 1972 Solaris. The first Planet of the Apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time. However, this film includes just about every bad science fiction clich\u00e9 going: space storms, anomalies and worm holes straight out of Star Trek; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes (in reality from any one planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points of light); a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from Saturn to Earth in a matter of minutes instead of years; two-thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button. To say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door. In a contemporary setting, you'd have to explain *why* it was bullet proof, but because it's \"science fiction\" you don't have to!Overall, Burton's most disappointing film.",

            "content": "Revisiting this film 13 years later makes me wonder why I hated it. I found this in MovieBox on my i-Pad. Loaded it up, fired up AirServer and streamed it into my main Media PC, then I sat back and got absorbed by this story like I never have been.And I actually enjoyed it - I first saw this when it came out, thinking it was a pompous bloated misrepresentation of the original. Mainly I hated Mark \"Stumbling Rock Star\" Wahlberg- But since then I have seen him in a few roles that suited him, especially his character from \"The Departed\".So I think that is what I had to get past, my initial distaste for an actor I didn't know. I don't know why I didn't like him, I just wasn't familiar with him.Compared to other Tim Burton films, this one keeps the Camp level down compared to \"Sleepy Hollow\" or \"Mars Attacks\" - He returns to the Grimness of \"Batman\". Burton approaches this as pure Science Fiction and treats it with more respect than \"Mars Attacks\". In fact, compared to Mars Attacks, this is a serious movie.In 1963 Pierre Boulle, author of \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" wrote a book called \"La Plan\u00e8te Des singes\" aka \"Monkey Planet\", which is told 3rd- person to a kinky space-faring couple who find a manuscript in a bottle floating in space. That story was the basis for the 1968 film and some of the events in the sequels. One of the aspects of Space Travel used in that 1963 novel was the prospect of Time Dilation, in which time moves more rapidly on Earth than it does for Travelers moving at relativistic speeds. This was used heavily in this film as Wahlberg's monkey's pod gets sucked into a Wormhole and the Ship he is on starts seeing transmissions from all times instantaneously. But we see later that it is just not the \"Time Barrier\" that gets crossed, some heavy Alternate Realities are taking place.This 2001 film returns to some of the original aspects of the book, in that respect, it is not as grim an ending as the 1968 version- So the whole surprise ending of the Heston version is missing- However, the ending of this film is based on the ending of the book.As far as the \"Planet of the Apes\" in this film, it looks good, the CGI is great and does not look phony, and Tim Roth is one nasty piece of work. The \"Nova\" character is played by Lisa Marie but not as a Major Character, in fact they made Nova a Chimp in this one. The Hero's Squeeze is played by Estelle Warren, \"Daena\". The Ape Prosthetics are very well made and it is difficult to see Helena Bonham-Carter as a Chimp or Michael Clarke Duncan as an Ape. But Tim Roth's \"Thade\" is a piece of slimy business and perfect casting. Not to mention Charleton Heston's Final Cameo and statement that denounces his own beloved NRA.We have no modern day Rod Serlings to write scripts, but I think this script has given several nods to his work.I think this is one of those films like \"Bringing up Baby\" that is appreciated more and more years after it's release, as Bringing up Baby is considered to be the classic example of slapstick comedy, this film will have a place in the Film Vaults- Visually it is astounding, it's not at all like any of Tim Burton's other work of the time. Maybe this is why it did not go over that well, just like 2001's \"Evolution\" with David Duchovny, which also was not appreciated that year, but today has been picking up fans who realize just how funny it really is.Ultimately, time is the final judge, not box office figures or the ratings of Websites that no longer exist. Nor does it matter that 1,350 bad reviews of this were posted on IMDb, many of those made by one person. As far as this movie goes, it is worth it to go back and revisit. But when it comes to \"Planet of the Apes\" versus \"The Phantom Menace\" I choose BOTH versions of Planet of the Apes. I can find all kinds of good reasons why this is a much better movie than all three Star Wars prequels.",

            "content": "I'm going to catch some heat for this, but I've found Tim Burton's Planet Of The Apes to be a far better film than any of the three recent versions. I can't explain it, but there's something so otherworldly and exotic about the production design, makeup and effects, a true storyteller's touch used, resulting in a piece with elements of fantasy and world building brought lushly to the forefront, whereas the newer films just felt somewhat clinical and sterile, going through minimalist motions without any real sense of wonder applied. Oh and another thing: real, tactile makeup on actual human actors, which will win against motion capture/cgi any day. There's also an old world, medieval feel to this planet, as the 'humans being subservient to apes' dynamic has already been in full swing for generations, as opposed to a lengthy origin story that takes up most of the newer trilogy. No build up here, just Marky Mark getting marooned on a distant world dominated by simians, fighting his way through their ranks, sort of falling in love with one (Helena Bonham Carter as a monkey=kinky) and attempting to find a way back to earth. There's various apes of all shapes and sizes at war, the most memorable of which is a sleek, snarling Tim Roth as Thade, a volatile warlord who despises humans. Michael Clarke Duncan towers over everyone as Attar, his cohort and fellow soldier, and seeing already be-jowelled Paul Giamatti as a cumbersome orangutan is priceless. The human faction is led by weathered Kris Kristofferson and his daughter (Estella Warren, quite possibly the most beautiful girl on the planet), leading the dregs of humanity as they exist in hiding and fight for their lives. No expense was spared in filling every frame of this planet with lived-in splendour and atmospheric decoration, from suits of armour and architecture to the overgrown thickets of mountainous vegetation that grow on this world. As for the apes themselves, it's terrific how real they feel. It's the same thing that happened with Lord Of The Rings vs. The Hobbit, and the switch from practical Orc effects to the overblown cgi madness of the goblins in the later films. The human eye is inherently adept at deciphering what is real and what is not, and the effects of the later Ape films with Andy Serkis just felt lifeless and orchestrated, whereas here the makeup prosthetics are organic, authentic and wonderful to look at. Don't even get me started on the ending either, it's completely brilliant and will leaving you in cold isolation as the credits roll, a perfect gut punch to a film that could have easily turned sappy in the eleventh hour. So that's my two cents. Bring on the backlash.",

I like where he's coming from, and he shares much of the same taste as me: a liking for the offbeat, the Gothic, a love for the Hammer horrors of old. But his films are a mixed bag and for every great one (MARS ATTACKS, ED WOOD) there are ones that leave me ice cold (CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, ALICE IN WONDERLAND).My favourite Burton film is SWEENEY TODD, so it may be that I get on better with the ones aimed at adults rather than kids. Sadly, his PLANET OF THE APES remake is aimed purely at kids, and in fact there's no material that ever goes above the intellectual level of your average 4 year old. And if ever there was a film that didn't need remaking, it was PLANET OF THE APES! Everything goes wrong with this picture, and I mean everything. The muddled, dumb-ass script which never goes beyond characters running from A to B, then B to C, and so on for what feels like hours and hours. The ridiculous-looking apes, never menacing for a second and looking more dated now than the ones from the original back in the '60s. Burton's clear disinterest in the material, as evinced by his mundane direction. Wahlberg's embarrassingly wooden performance, or Bonham Carter's embarrassingly mannered one.It's all a great shame, in that it wastes money and the talents of lots of interesting supporting cast members whose skills could have been put towards something more genuine and original.

            "content": "Awhile back, I commented on the original 'Planet of the Apes' film prior to seeing this remake at the cinemas. When I saw the original, I was fully expecting the remake to kick some serious butt, and be far superior to the 1960s version. Why? Better visual effects being 2001 and all, one of my favorite actors in Tim Roth starring in it, and a great director named Tim Burton. Nothing could surely go wrong with Burton in the director's chair. Granted, I was never a huge fan of the POTA films, but seeing the potential here for a remake or revision by Burton made my mouth water. Then, in 2001, I got advance tickets and I began to watch one of the most anticipated movies for that year...I left the cinema very disappointed! Disappointment can cloud criticism though, and sometimes makes you bitter towards a movie and not see the positives. So I tried to look at the good. The make-up was excellent, but inconsistent in parts, but I still feel that area should have been nominated for an Oscar. Okay, that's good! Tim Roth was amazing in his performance but his character was not that great and seriously lacked depth. Helena Bonham Carter was also fairly decent in this film. And, finally some of the cinematography was fairly nice. What really let the remake of 'Planet of the Apes' down, was by in large, Tim Burton. This is, without a doubt, his worst film that I've seen! I cannot really compliment the direction of this movie, as it seemed self-aware and indulgent in being the \"remake\". The script was awful, as well as the integration of one-liners from the original films to this new one. I groaned completely during Heston's cameo, particularly due the referrals to the original film. The remake should have been a film in its own right, and should have focused on creating a compelling story and universe, instead of opting for lame jokes revolving around Charlton Heston in ape make-up as Thade's father. The hero of the new film in Mark Whalberg was one-note, but he was given such a boring character who just went through the motions. Going to take a risk- check, gets sucked through a new dimension- check, captured by Apes- check, escape- check and so on and so on. I never felt anything for his character at all, and that was partly his performance and partly the woeful script/direction. Estella Warren was awful, and Kris Kristofferson played the obligatory predictable role of the her father. Michael Clarke Duncan suited his part, but never became a well established character, and Paul Giamatti was okay as Limbo, but was obviously the comic relief. I also did not like the art direction was the Ape City, and found the original far more convincing in look and as a story.\nWhile, General Thade was certainly a memorable chimp because of Roth's performance, it's a shame the character was wasted in an extremely formulaic and cliche story! 'Planet of the Apes' (2001) is nowhere near the worst film of 2001, it certainly was the most disappointing for me, considering the potential it had with the dynamic vision of Tim Burton and the modern visual f/x to create a film that stands out in its own right. It's just a pity Tim Burton chose to make a Hollywoodized self-aware gimmicky version that ends up being significantly inferior to the original film, instead of on par with it! And yes, Burton's 'Mars Attacks' is also better than his remake here! 'Planet of the Apes' gets a reluctant pass for Tim Roth's performance, the superb make-up and the decent cinematography, however that still doesn't save it from silly mediocrity.**\u00bd out of *****!",

Almost all arguments against this movie are based on the premise that it is a remake of the cult classic from 1968. If that was the case, compared to the original, this movie sucks. But it is a very wrong angle and it is understandable that conclusions based on the wrong premise, filled with emotion and prejudice, will be wrong conclusions.Just try to watch this movie from a point of view of someone who did not see the original franchise and have no idea what is it all about, and you'll enjoy a great movie. Because this is not really a remake. The only thing they share is the basic idea that in distant future apes will rule the Earth. Other than that those are two completely different movies. Characters are new and different, the story begins slightly similar, but develops and ends completely different. This is typical Tim Burton's dark fairy-tale, original in every way, except for stealing the basic idea from cult classic. The story is interesting and brings completely new ideas that make it essentially different from 1968 movie. The way apes rise to be on the top of the evolutionary scale, the event that stops the battle and the way the main character ends his adventure are three main and totally unexpected twists that are completely new. I saw all five movies from the old franchise and I was still surprised by every plot twist here. Nothing was already seen or too predictable. Because this is not really a remake. The crash-landing scene is the only one visually similar to '60s movie. But if you think about it, he had to land somehow, and there are not so many ways to do it and survive. I mean, he could not teleport himself or catapult from ship and land by parachute from outer space...8/10",

The thing is this remake(or re-imagining if you like) is not, in fact this could very well be Burton's worst movie, even worse than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and that could have been much better. Tim Burton, what has happened to you? Before I get to the many negatives of this film, I will say the apes are very well done. Their mannerisms and the way they move are perfectly convincing. Plus Danny Elfman's score was pretty good, it's no Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish but it's good enough. And the scenery and special effects are fantastic.However, that is all the praise I can give it. I am briefly going to say it is vastly inferior to the 1968 classic, which was much more exciting and much better written as well. The script is awful, not quite Pearl Harbor kind-of-awful, but some of it is lame and unintentionally cheesy. The story takes a while to get going and meanders all over the place, not helped by pedestrian pacing and drawn out scenes and very rarely gets interesting. Plus is it me, or does the film get unnecessarily loud at times? Tim Burton's direction was also a disappointment, usually his films are full of heart, that's what made Edward Scissorhands especially such a gem, but here he seems lost, bogged down might I say. On top of that, the character development is non-existent, as is the chemistry between the actors and the characters are extremely clich\u00e9d, especially Kris Kristofferson's character. And the acting didn't fare that much better, Mark Wahlberg is a bland lead, while Estella Warren acts like a zombie throughout. Then we have Tim Roth trying hard and giving the only credible performance as Thade, and Helena Bonham Carter wasted as sympathetic Ari, while Paul Giamatti is useless. Not even the talented David Warner can save this film. And don't get me started on the ending, what a bummer, so predictable and obvious.Overall, a case of all style no substance.

Leo escapes captivity and leads mankind against evil chimpanzee general Thade (Tim Roth) and his army.The moment local humans opened their mouths to speak, I knew this was doomed. Not that a remake should fanatically mimic everything about the original (for example, Van Sant made a carbon copy of Psycho and the result was absurd): I'd argue some departures are necessary, otherwise why bother? But there are changes and changes. Humans being mute and beast-like was the WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY. In this remake they behave like normal human beings - it's as if a kid saw the original and grasped just the basic premise of \"a planet with talking apes\", with the meditation on humanity and religious fanaticism whooshing over his head.Roth, an actor who can play effectively both nice and despicable individuals, is in full villain mode and chews scenery with glee. Helena Bonham-Carter also has fun as Ari. Wahlberg is bland as the insipid Leo; much like Brad Pitt, Wahlberg is a fine character actor whose talent appears to melt whenever he plays a conventional lead. Other cast members don't have much to do, their performances overshadowed by their costumes (and, in case of statuesque former swimmer Estella Warren, by her lack thereof). Make-up by Rick Backer is exceptional, the only real achievement of the movie.The ending is terrible. First, a simian deus-ex-machina (now that's a satisfying climax!). And then, a final twist which does not and will never make *any* sense. What a sad, desperate attempt to find something as shocking as the original's brilliant twist.4/10",

            "content": "This is a sorry excuse for the Planet of the Apes title. It doesn't make you think, it doesn't hold your, but it does re-affirm the belief that Marky Mark is one of the worst actors in Hollywood.The movie starts out with Marky Mark and his funky bunch floating around in space for no apparent reason. They use monkeys as subjects for experiments and also send them out in pods (very similar to Kubrick's in 2001, in fact their whole space station looks the same, more to come on that...) to do experiments. Well they find some weird force field stuff and send a monkey out. What else happens but they lose communication. Well Marky Mark, being the animal lover that he is, goes out and tries to save his monkey friend. But, alas, he is sucked through the force-field-black-hole-blah-blah and crash lands on a strange planet. He lands in the midst of a human round up where the apes are getting the humans to sell in the slave market.The main symbolism in this movie is racism. Unlike the first movie, the people in this movie can talk. After the apes catch the humans, they sort them out in groups of male and female. Hmm, sounds like a Nazi concentration camp to me. The apes don't notice that Marky Mark is wearing a weird space outfit and everyone else is wearing rags made from animal skin.Marky Mark realizes that apes don't like humans too much so he tries to escape. He is helped by an \"human-lover\" Ari to escape the city.\nSPOILER ALERT: They get out of the city and Marky Mark finds his old ship via GPS or something. He then realizes that the ship has been there for thousands of years and figures out he traveled through time. The movie never tries to make you think it is earth though. It's just some weird planet. You also find out all the monkeys they had on-board, all CHIMPS, are the apes now on that planet. Pretty hard to believe considering there are all types of great apes: gorilla, chimp and orangutan. Anyway, they have a battle with the apes (hmmm, reminds me of....SPARTACUS, another Kubrick film). The humans win and Marky Mark leaves, without saying a word the entire last 10 minutes of the film, not even to the very hot Estella Warren who looks very good in her costume. He goes through the portal...blah blah....lands on earth.blah blah but is greeted by a monkey statue at the Lincoln memorial. (He crash landed right on the steps, don't ya know) and the movie ends. blah. The first movie had a good surprise ending, leaving us realizing that man destroyed themselves as a result of their violence. This movie doesn't explain why apes and humans have changed places except with some stupid blurb by Charleton Heston explaining that man is violent, blah blah, that is why they cannot regaion control, blah blah. It's a case of \"always has, always will be\" or \"segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forver\" blah blah. Stupid movie. blah.",

            "content": "Inferior remake from first and best of the primates series ; despite time passed the original energy remains and resulted to be an agreeable fantasy ; however this re-imagination of the tale looks more to the original novel by Pierre Boulle , titled \u00a8Monkey planet\u00a8, that it does to 1968 Franklyn J. Schaffner rendition . It deals with an Air Force astronaut , Captain Leo Davison ( Mark Wahlberg) crashes lands on a mysterious planet where evolved, talking apes dominant a race of primitive humans . As he encounters a culture where the simians rule over humans . Later on , he discovers humanity has gone awry and now is slave and reduced to beasts . Man is treated as animal of burden and regarded as scum . He escapes , being accompanied by a gorgeous native (Estella Warren) and with the help of a sympathetic chimpanzee activist named Ari (Helna Boham Carter) and a small band of human rebels (Eric Avari , Kris Kristofferson) . Leo leads the effort to evade the advancing Simian Army led by brutal General Thade (Tim Roth) and his most brave commandant Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) . Now humans and simians are on to reach a dark secret within the Forbidden Zone .This is a retelling from classic and energetic science-fiction movie with metaphysical significance and reflexion about origin of human being, though also packs action, adventures , intrigue , satisfying brisk pace and entertainment . This known story provides full of sour and intelligent references to first adaptation but doesn't have its sense of political commentary , neither sociological implications . The picture delivers enough energy and results to be a passable flick full of action , battles and suspense ; however it is light-years ahead of original . Mark Wahlberg as an action man takes the Charlton Heston character but without his charisma , neither impressive screen presence . Tim Roth stands out as a furious militarist with loathing for all human beings . Helena Bonham Carter excels as a clever as well as sensitive simian . Remaining cast formed by enjoyable players playing as Gorilla , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice . Superb makeup courtesy of Rick Baker creates realistic pseudo-simians of Paul Giamatti , Michael Clarke Duncan , David Warner , Chris Ellis , Lisa Marie , Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, and even Charlton Heston who appears as an old primate , a feeling homage to classic flick in which gave one of his more plausible acting . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and colorful cinematography by Philippe Rousselot . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Danny Elffman , it's full of fury and sound .The motion picture was professionally directed by Tim Burton , using a great visual sense but with no originality . Other adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are the followings : The original and the best is \u00a8Planet of Apes\u00a8 by Franklyn J Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\" (1970) by Ted Post with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it's followed by three inferior sequels that get worse and a TV series , such as 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes' (73, J.Lee Thompson) . And recently , \u00a8Rise of the Planet of the Apes\u00a8 (2011) by Rupert Wyatt with James Franco , John Lightow , Freida Pinto , Andy Serkis and preparing \u00a8Dawn of the Planet of Apes\u00a8 (2013-2014) by Matt Reeves with Judy Greer , Gary Oldman , Keri Russell and Jason Clarke .",

            "content": "Many people think that the original 1967 Planet of the Apes is a classic and a master piece. Sure its one heck of a film especially back in the day when it was made. It had great costumes and makeup with great music by Jerry Goldsmith and a tremendous shocking end. This Planet of the Apes has awesome costumes and very realistic makeup and/or masks. The music is outstanding by Danny Elfman and the 2001 version has even a more shocking end. It seems to Me many people are against or hate this POTA. I really don't know why, it has such an interesting cast and they play their parts very well and sure it may not be director Tim Burton's darkest film but in My opinion it is one heck of movie! The way I see the film it has a lot of emotion and all of the characters are so likable. I'll try to explain this as best as I can about Helena Bonham Carter is a very good looking woman and her character Ari is beautiful. I know she is under tons of makeup and looks very realistic as an ape but whenever she is on screen I can't help but think how neat she is with her voice and personality. Tim Roth's Thade is an awesome character and his character deserves a lot more credit. Roth's performance is truly menacing. Charlton Heston put on another solid performance as Thade's father. Another thing that gets into this movie so much is the music. Each scene is so great with the fantastic score! Below is in My opinions an in-depth look at most of the characters that is in the 2001 Planet of the Apes!-------------Mark Wahlberg as Captain Leo Davidson - Leo Davidson, after the incident of going after Pericles he is stranded on another world thanks to a magnetic storm. The planet he lands on has unbelievable talking apes. He is prisoner but after Ari frees him he gets to know her and her mentor, Krull and some other humans. He joins these two different factions of intelligent species and travels to the forbidden area Calima! Leo is out for himself and to go back home as soon as he can!Tim Roth as General Thade - The great General Thade, a mighty warrior who is afraid of nothing. His mean voice sends shivers down his soldiers back and he hates humans to death!Thade and Ari were once in a relationship but now Ari has other things to do. He loves his father Zaius very much and he is very saddened about his father's illness. Helena Bonham Carter as Ari - She is a beautiful ape and very intelligent as well. She helps Leo escape. She is through with Thade and even though she has feelings for Leo even though he is human. She loves Krull as he is her mentor and in fact he is with Ari all the way with her,Leo,and other escapees from the city.Michael Clarke Duncan as Colonel Attar - The huge Attar is a force to reckon with! He is General Thade's great warrior and best friend. He is a very religious and serious ape.Paul Giamatti as Limbo - The always funny Limbo loves to smell and look good. The human keeper if you will takes his job seriously but when he is forced to follow the escapees his life turns around. Estella Warren as Daena - One of the many prisoners in Ape City,Daena wants out just as much as everyone else but when she meets up with Leo and escapes with the group she has feelings for him but much like he does for Ari he doesn't think much of it. She loves her father Karubi very much and she is shocked and very sad about his death.Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Krull - The massive Krull was one of the greatest warriors and a brave leader. He is the mentor of Ari and he is one of the apes who is in the escaped group. His favorite weapons are swords and handles them excellently!David Warner as Senator Sandar - Ari's father, Senator Sandar let Thade have control. He is an ape that believes in manners such as washing hands. He tries not to get on Thade's case and he loves his daughter Ari.Kris Kristofferson as Karubi - The father of Daena,Karubi loves his daughter very much. He is a brave human man but his death in a fight against Attar didn't last long and he never knew what hit him from behind which it was General Thade.Thade's sword decapitated him.Erick Avari as Tival - The male house human is one of the escapees in the group with humans and apes.Luke Eberl as Birn - A stubborn teenager, Birn is a brave young man.Evan Dexter Parke as Gunnar - Another escaped male human. He too is brave.Glenn Shadix as Senator Nado - The great senator Nado. He loves his job and his mate!Freda Foh Shen as Bon - The female house human is one of the escapees in the group with humans and apes.Chris Ellis as Lt. General Karl Vasich - Leader of the Oberon.When the magnetic storm caused malfuctions in the ship a video image played on the monitor. Little does he know that what he just saw was himself in the future!Anne Ramsay as Lt. Col. Grace Alexander - She really cared for the modern day apes in the Oberon.Lisa Marie as Nova - Senator Nado's mate. She is very attractive for an ape and she is always worried about her looks.Linda Harrison as Woman in Cart - Could it be possible that this woman was on another planet at another time or in another lifetime? Could it be that she is reincarnated?Charlton Heston as Zaius,Thade's Father - Thade's father is very ill. Before he passes he wants to make sure to tell and show his son the shocking truth about humans.---------------I just like how everything is in the film. The ending may have been rushed and not make sense to others because it really had several endings but Burton could only pick one. In fact you can also tell as great as the music is if you listen closely some of the tracks are alternatives than the released music on the CD. Also a short time before the final release of the film the producers wanted the movie to be more epic than it was and they wanted it to be like or more like Gladiator and back to the music they wanted the composer Danny Elfman to change the music. I thought it was silly for the movie makers to do that and I am glad it came out the way it did even if the ending is sad and is a mistake or an error. I hope you have enjoyed this in-depth look at Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes. Like I said I love the 2001 version!",

A great director, a cast full of Oscar winner and nominees and extremely well made visuals and make-up, so what when bananas and made this film so bad?For ones it is almost the same with the original, second dialogue that makes me wish to be deaf, third a stiff acting and finally one of the most idiotic ending in film history. I honestly am unable to say anything more .If something is to be said is that this film destroyed the reputation of Tim Burton as a great director and from this point on he is but a shadow of his former glory, many actors reputation was stained by that film and it took them years to come back in to the spotlight. However in all this disaster there is one good thing that came out: A guide of how not to make a remake ,which future directors and studios can uses in order to make good films and I believe that it has help ,if the new trilogy of the Planet of the Apes films is any indication.",

If my memory serves me, I think Dick Zanuck, who at one time was running mighty 20th century fox, was sitting around and thought to himself, why don't we remake planet of the apes and get an A-list director for it?  It's not a bad idea... problem is, the script isn't up to par.  In fact, it's pretty bad.  Secondly, Mark Walberg is way out of his league trying to carry the lead in this film.  I remember reading all the publicity for the film and laughed when Burton and Zanuck tried to compare Walberg to Steve McQueen.  Look, I like Walberg, I think he's a decent enough actor, but he's not at the point where he has the emotional gravitas to carry the lead in a film. The story has no emotional pathos.  It's just a simple A to B to C, nonstop chase film.  And what was the point of trying to keep the ending secret?  It doesn't even make sense.  They were trying to bring back that feeling of the \"oh my god, they were on earth the whole time\" feeling from the original POTA, but here it's just absolute rubbish.",

A test-monkey in a shuttle from a space-lab enters a space- time rift and the scientist in charge follows him, crashing on a planet where the dominant species are intelligent apes that enslave humans; the scientist is captured but manages to free himself and from here on out the movie is escape-pursuit action until the climatic final confrontation, with some stops here and there to add short dialogues that add nothing to the story. The final sequence divides opinions, being ambiguous and leaving questions unanswered, promising a sequel that never happened.As incredible as it may seem, the 'apes' act way better then the humans.

Even though I had heard nothing but negative things about this film I went in with an open mind because most of the bad reviews I heard were from die-hard fans of the original but the film turned out to be a major dud. The most shocking thing is that Burton didn't bring any energy or excitement to the film. The first hour drags by so bad that I was having a hard time staying awake. The film picks up during it's final act but even then the battle scenes aren't as good as they should have been. I did like the ending though. Wahlberg sleepwalks through his role but I enjoyed the supporting cast. I thought Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter were very good in their roles and I also enjoyed Michael Clarke Duncan. Kris Kristofferson and Charlton Heston also come off good in their small roles. The screenplay is rather weak and the reworked lines from the original film come off very lame. Burton tries a lot of things in the film but I think he's held back by the PG-13 rating.

The original movies managed to create a final \"setting-up\" for a perfect cycling in time. Maybe we didn't get a perfect happy ending, but we left satisfied about the reasons behind the first movie's social setting.I believe that a sequel has to be made to explain *clearly* why the movie ended as it did. I think there's too much arrogance behind the current ending; someone is ignoring the population of viewers who aren't well versed in sci-fi versions of warps, portals, etc.Hint: When Thade finds himself in what looks like a control room pay attention to what he sees.

            "review_title": "Marky Mark and the Monkey Bunch",
            "content": "I find a lot of movies require a second glance to see exactly what you make of them. Summer blockbusters in particular, with their expansive special effects and distracting explosions; often have to be watched at least twice in order to get a clear view.When I first saw Tim Burton's \"reimagining\" of Planet of the Apes (\"Reimagining\"? Reimagining it as what? A pile of cack?) I was reasonably dumbstruck by the scale and spectacle as to be uncertain exactly what I thought. I had it pegged down as sort-of average, with the possibility of it either being very good in its own right or a soulless, braindead money-maker. Sadly, seen again, it's the latter. By far.Watching it again on video doesn't help either. When a film is so heavily reliant on the big screen then this says a lot about its content. Without the panoramic views, we're forced to concentrate on plot, dialogue and characterisation. Which is unfortunate as there isn't one, it's rubbish, and there isn't any.There are good points: the opening space scenes are beautifully realised, shot with a cinematic grace, and not just computer generated FX thrown in your face. Also, credit must actually be given to the twist ending, which, while it may seem contrived, does credit the audience with some intelligence (the only part of the movie to do so) and is far more faithful to the source novel than any of the 60s/70s Apes movies. And there's also the scary bit that they ripped off from Jaws.Screenwriter Mark Rosenthal pointed out the redundant subtext of the original by noting \"Today, I think we're living in the famous saying, 'The world will end not with a bang, but with a whimper.'\" However, it's unpleasantly ironic to note that since the release of this movie the prospect of nuclear destruction is again a possibility, and the 1968 picture has once again become as relevant as it ever was. Even without this it took pot shots at racism and famine. Burton's view sees it take on only the novel's Gulliver's Travels-style ape/human reversal, with the odd religious musing and little else. So because it has less to say, it's forced to expand those issues, and basically beat you over the head with them for two hours. Every single line Helena Bonham Carter has is a corny platitude, while I almost heaved my guts at the moment where Wahlberg claims \"sometimes even a few can make a difference\", to the tune of a full-blown orchestra. Yes, the dialogue is the weakest element all right, and while the originals could be a little hammy, this one makes them look like Shakespeare. There's not one exchange approaching a genuine conversation throughout, and the trademark warmth and charm of the original is blown wide apart by a breakneck pace and one-dimensional caricatures. There's no time to react to anything, yet despite the pace, I also found myself looking at my watch several times in boredom.One bit of merchandise I got my hands on was \"Leo's Logbook\", a child-orientated intro to the series with lots of glossy photos. A short affair with just a few words here and there, it lasted less than 30 pages, though told me more about the characters and their backgrounds than the film itself did. Surely that's wrong somehow? In the 1968 film we learn that Charlton Heston's Taylor has both liberal values and is embittered, both within the first five minutes. These contrasting character traits forge three-dimensionality, yet we never get to know or care about Wahlberg's desperately underwritten Leo. Little is known about him from the movie, he's just a bland nobody with a bizarre chimp fetish and nothing else. Maybe it's that he's too young, too \"pop\" to really work in the expected way. Yet look at how we're supposed to believe that Carter's chimp wants a romantic involvement with Wahlberg, and that the Nova replacement is jealous... yet neither of them have exchanged more than a few words with him the whole time. Bonham-Carter (is it just me or does she remind you of Lisa Minelli?) seems ten times more irritating than I remembered, and the sexy but dull Estella Warren fails to make an impact also. I won't even mention the comedy Orang-U-Tang (the \"comedy\" tag a misnomer, of course) or the obligatory irritating brat.What's worse, rather than condemning humanity as the original franchise did, this movie seems to exonerate it. No longer are they the mute ancestors of their own destruction, but \u0096 in a very Hollywood decision \u0096 the all-speaking, innocent victims of fate. That the apes are reworked as mediaeval, right-wing sadists is also a character-lessening development, and makes Bonham-Carter's role as the sole liberal even more unlikely. Warren heads the batch of human slaves, proving that even in the wild there's still room for lipstick and mascara, if not Imac.And what of Tim Roth? Roth's a good actor, and his performance cannot be faulted. But, sadly, the character is one note throughout. Whether he's holding his dying father's hand or just having dinner, he spends the entire time angry. That's right... he keeps going ape-sh*t! Even when he meets the chimp prophet, he smacks it across some caves. Maybe that's why he's so tense all the time... he needed to spank his monkey! Tee-hee! It's violent, too. I'm not against violence, but this is just ugly, repetitive violence. Violence that only exists because there's nothing else to fill the film. I didn't remember it being so brash before, either: it seems less a coherent story, more one never-ending cacophony of noise.Two quotes from screenwriter Rosenthal, talking to magazine SFX: \"the thing was given its start date and its release date before the director thought he was conceptually there; before the script was ready.\" \"the post production on this is probably three times faster than it should have been. I think that making a film at this speeds mean that there is no time for reflection.\" Doesn't that say it all? Tim Burton is said to be a huge fan of the Apes movies. Maybe that's why he made this: so that Battle no longer carries the title of worst Planet of the Apes movie. If that's the case then it's a job well done. 4/10.",

            "content": "PLANET OF THE APES / (2001) ** (out of four)By Blake French:\t\"Planet of the Apes\" is a $100 million remake that makes its points so many times that we eventually stop caring and begin to lose interest. The film is well made and has a lot of interesting material, but it's been done before, and we don't need five or six examples of grizzly apes abusing humans just to prove the fact that apes treat humans harshly. \"Planet of the Apes\" quickly becomes redundant and outstays its welcome. The production turns into a  tool to impress us with the amazing set pieces and dazzling make up effects. This movie is a waste of the talents of director Tim Burton.\n\tThe year is 2029. An astronaut named Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) lives on a large United States Air Force space station that contains a large selection of apes used for space exploration. One of his beloved apes gets launched into space\u0085but something goes wrong. He decides to go against the captain's orders and take a ride on a small space pod to rescue the animal and explore the unknown territory himself. Again, something goes wrong.\n\tWhat kind of scientist would launch himself into some unknown abyss in space when an experiment just proved the area dangerous? Leo must be suicidal, stupid, or both. Anyway, he finds himself stuck in some kind of time warp that blasts him into the future on a mysterious planet where talking apes control the world and humans live in cages.\nHe meets several resident humans there, like Karubi (Kris Kristofferson), and his grown daughter Daena (Estella Warren). They are captured by military forces and delivered to a human slave trading ape named Limbo (Paul Giamatti). Leo has a difficult time understanding this world, but luckily, there is an ape who shows compassion towards humans. Her name is Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), and we are not surprised when she offers Leo and his fellow humans a chance to escape from the planet of the apes.\n\t Although none of these characters are particularly memorable, one stands out in my mind as an absolute nuisance: General Thade (Tim Roth), the planet's head military leader. He isn't scary, shocking, or disturbing, just really, really unpleasant. Tim Roth, a good actor, goes way over the top with this simple-minded character-to the point where I hated him. Not because he's the villain, but because his screen presence is irksome. It's just an unpleasant performance for an unpleasantly stupid character.\n\tSomething about the time frame doesn't seem right. Let's examine this: Leo jumps into the future, where apes rule the planet. Once on the planet, he discovers his old space crew came to rescue him and crashed. This is where the apes become out of control, and take over the planet. Good insight there. But the crew crash landed on the planet thousands of years earlier, according to a character in the movie. Leo has only been on the planet for days. Hmmmm. Something here just doesn't add up. I guess I am thinking too hard  for a movie that isn't supposed to make you think that much. If you can clear this up for me, please drop me a line. It'll be much appreciated and save many hours of sleep that would otherwise be spent wondering about this. There is something else that bothers me about \"Planet of the Apes.\" The make up effects are stunning-so good that I could not tell who the actor was under the ape makeup and costume. So here's my question: why spend millions of dollars on big name actors like Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Helena Bonham Carter when you're going to smoother them in make up beyond recognition? The actor could have been my neighbor for all that I knew. The filmmakers might have liked the voices and energy of the actors, I guess.\nI give the movie credit for making us care about the humans. By the end, during an involving and intense war sequence between human and ape-kind, I was definitely rooting for the humans. I also liked the way it reveals the plot. But \"Planet of the Apes\" could have been so much more. Tim Burton's style isn't obvious here, either. He does inject a convincing and masterfully crafted atmosphere, but it doesn't entrance us like \"Batman,\" \"Edward Scissorhands,\" or \"Sleepy Hollow.\" It think that's because the movie concentrates so hard on the plot and special effects, it never relaxes and explores such themes as isolation, loneliness, or racism. \"Plant of the Apes\"  is a wasted opportunity.",

Lots of jumping and screeching later we are released, and nothing whatever sticks.Here's the thing: Burton is an art director, not a `real' director. He can create a `feel' when he's cooking. Forget the story, the actors altogether. That feel can stick. The less he has to work with, the better he seems to do. Here, he has a lot and delivers... almost nothing. No real notion of an alternative world, certainly not `dark' as his publicity machine would have it. And that's despite the costumes.Two interesting actors though. Ms Carter has a lovely face, which really can work against her. In `Merlin,' she had a few scenes with `ugly' prosthetics, and her character came alive for those few moments. Here, she gets to act without the burden of her physical instrument. She's pretty intelligent, and it is interesting to see what she's worked out with her sort of face puppet.Quit different is Tim Roth. he has always been a full body actor in the tradition of grand theater. He's ask to snarl a lot. Subtract that out, and you see his own solution. Guildenstern writ large.Bad news when the film is so lacking, one spends ones time figuring out just what the actor is thinking under all that rubber.",

            "content": "Ah, Planet of the Apes. Sniff it all you want; it smells enough like a case of the remake to fall in line with this summer's sequel monotony, but upon closer inspection, it's clear that this is a chimp of a decidedly different breed.Director Tim Burton reinvents the aesthetic and tonal gestalt of the 1968 classic without ditching the original's thematic underpinnings, creating a world that is both visually fascinating and painstakingly complete.\nWhen Air Force pilot Leo Davidson, (Mark Walberg), leaves his space station in search of a test chimp deployed to survey a magnetic storm, things go awry, leading to a crash-landing on a planet where humans are enslaved by a breed of apes that are uniquely advanced, cognizant and cultured. But their refinement is little more than a thin veneer hiding their aggressive animal drives, which can lead them to the brutal treatment of their captured humans. Leo, who isn't acclimated to the Apes' tyranny, revolts against them and becomes a heroic figure and leader to the enslaved humans who know little else than the servitude and submission they have faced since birth. Helena Bonham Carter (you know, from Fight Club) plays Ari, an ape with compassion towards humans, while Tim Roth brilliantly portrays Thade, a snarling, aggressive (really pretty damn scary) ape general, who wishes to see his planet cured of humans, and his fellow apes cured of their human-derivative tendencies.Under the fa\u00e7ade of a fast-paced sci-fi/action blockbuster lays an entirely different animal. On the most primitive level, Apes is gargantuan, pounding its fists with energy and a capacity to amaze that makes this film monumentally entertaining. But like the skillfully crafted latex ape masks through which the actors' subtle, universal, seasoned human facial expressions are transmitted, Apes breathes life of its own beneath the glaze of action. Burton paints a textured portrayal of man's struggle against subjugation, with settings and characters that are unearthly, yet dually dark, gritty and present. The director ditched the early-proposed ideas of digitally animated apes or live apes with computer-generated mouths, enlisting A-list actors instead to give each ape a uniquely human core.Perhaps the real feat here is that Burton was able to make these apes so utterly creepy and animalistic (much more so than their original counterparts) yet still found a way to maintain their human characteristics. Roth and Bonham Carter learned an entire behavioral language for their roles, complete with loping, off-kilter strides and dexterous, long-armed gesticulations. It takes a while to get a grasp of the full complexity of their movements, but once the language is understood, you quickly see how the ape dispositions intensify the actors' capacity for human emotional expression.Other apes include Limbo, a pandering human-slave dealer played by Paul Giamatti, and Attar, Thade's loyal silverback, played by Michael Clarke Duncan (who incidentally, is perhaps the only Ape actor that sounds as though he's using his normal voice). Charleton Heston makes a cameo, donning full ape regalia to play Thade's dying father, and Lisa Marie Pressley appears briefly as a snooty socialite chimp.On the human side, two words: Estella Warren. She says close to nothing (perhaps a throwback to the mute humans in the original, perhaps not). With a character that grows envious of the affection formed between Walberg and Bonham Carter (yes, a man and a chimp) Warren is left to primarily convey her dissatisfaction through looks and body language. And looks plus body are a definite can-do on Warren's checklist. Things seems a little exploitative at times; her garb is close to non-existent, and the camera, perhaps a bit too kind, but Warren certainly helps heighten the degree to which this film is visually fascinating. Unfortunately, it isn't all bananas and cream pie. The Apes script incorporates a few narrative devices that are just too convenient, such as the illogically timed event that causes the wrap-up to the climatic battle scene. Although the majority of dialogue in the film runs smoothly, certain characters (take for instance, the shifty-eyed comic relief, Limbo) are developed in a stagnant and predictable way. Walberg's pre-battle scene speech, despite its relative brevity, is still a little laughable. The re-vamped surprise ending is creatively done, carrying certain light-heartedness to it, but the film leaves things too easily opened ended. However, with a sequel planned 'open-ended' is something that was planned.\nUltimately, Burton's overall design is so meticulous and aesthetically comprehensive and his ape characters, so believable and culturally complete that you can't help but be lured into his stunning visual world, which seems (if not only momentarily) to take precedence over other concerns. You haven't seen anything quite like this. The film may have aped the original, but it stands on its own two feet.",

            "content": "This is a remake of the old classic starring Charlton Heston, though as happens with a lot of remakes these days, while following the theme, the plot works out differently. In the original film, Charlton Heston travels to the Andromeda Galaxy and when he returns 2000 years in the future, he discovers that he has landed on a planet that is ruled by apes. It is only by the end of the film that he discovers that it is Earth. This film had the memorable lines of 'take your stinking paws off me you damned dirty ape', and 'You Maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!' This version doesn't end as dramatically as the original (he returns to Earth to discover that the Earth that he knew was gone and is populated by apes) and the first line spoken by an ape to a human (instead of the other way around as in the original movie) is 'Get your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!'. Further, the film begins in a space station orbiting Saturn where they are investigating a magnetic vortex and the hero lands up on the planet of the apes when he travels through the vortex and lands up a thousand years in the future.I have probably given away a bit too much of the movie, but considering that it involves time travel, and also involves changes to the time stream (such as the space station entering the vortex and arriving at the planet centuries before our hero) I am at a loss to see how 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' (which I have not seen at the time of this writing) could possibly be a prequel to this movie. Somebody has suggested that it involves the scene at the end, however it is clear from the inscription behind the statue that Thade, the bad guy in this film, somehow came to earth prior to our hero and upset the order, so we have another time travel dilemma. It is quite clever how Tim Burton constructed this movie since it is its own sequel and prequel (though we do not know how Thade managed to get off of the planet of the apes and to earth).Like the original film, the apes are an advanced iron age culture similar to Rome, and they borrow the title of senator, and also have their weapons and armour similar to that of the Romans. However a major difference is that the humans can speak in this film (though as slaves they are forbidden). However, that is likely to be because in the original, the action occurs after two thousand years had passed, whereas the action in this movie only occurred centuries (though it appears that the genetic manipulation of the apes on the space station had quickened the apes rate of evolution).There is a subtle dig at religion in this film. The apes have a religion and they worship the first ape who had created them, and believe that he left and will return. However, an ape does come from the sky at the end of the film, and it turns out that it is the ape that our hero had originally gone out to find. I guess the suggestion is that while our religion may have some truth to it, in reality it is simply a load of myth that is manipulated by the power brokers to create the world that they want and to force the population to submit to their will. Well, all I can say to that is that we live in a pluralistic society, and the times when one denomination would call the shots in any one country (or region) are long gone, at least in our Western Society. These days, if we don't like what our church is teaching us we can simply walk out and find one that we do like. Some say that is good, others say that is bad, however as far as I'm concerned, the bible is legit and I shall continue to believe it.The other interesting thing that I noticed is the idea of the animalistic nature of us humans. The idea is that despite all of the trappings of civilisation that we surround ourselves with, in our hearts we are still barbarians. While the apes have rising to become dominant, reducing the humans to the status of animals (much in the same what that certain races of humans were relegated to the status of animals in the past), in many cases they are still beasts. While they can talk and reasons, their behaviour suggests that they are still little more than animals. In a way this aspects reflects us as humans because despite the fact that we are able to put somebody on the moon, we still behave in a way that would make an onlooker believe that we are mindless animals driven only by lust and desire.",

            "content": "SPOILERS - Watching the DVD of \"Planet of the Apes (2001)\" with the director's comentary \"on\", the most revealing thing is when Burton mentions \"comments on the internet\" -- folks like you and me, puzzled with the ending, actually got director Burton's attention! Before the internet, and DVDs with commentary, this sort of feedback was impossible. Think about that for a minute, to realize the possible future impact!!\"Planet (1968)\" is a fine, fine movie. The pacing is just right, the acting is first-rate, and when we get to the end, and see lady Liberty sitting there on the shore, everything in the story comes together. \"Planet (2001)\" is not that kind of movie. Director Burton didn't want it to be. He wanted it purposefully to be ambiguous.SPOILERS, again - When Leo gets back to Earth, in what looks like our current time (judging by the vehicles, the D.C. buildings, the clothes, the cameras, etc) he encounters something he did not expect. Although Burton could explain how it got that way, he chooses not to, for the sake of a possible sequel by the studio. He, or we, could think up a number of scenarios, but we must assume that the events depicted in this film are responsible for changing the past some time way back, so that evolution proceeded on a diferent path. You see, the \"apes\" he returns to are quite different from the apes he encountered at first, and escaped from. These apes did not shuffle around, but walked like we do. They drove cars, rode motorcycles, used cameras, flew helicopters.The whole point of Burton's film was to show the \"circular\" nature of time travel and changes it might trigger. If Leo had not chased the chimp, then his crew and mothership had not chased him, and crashed, allowing this ape race to flourish, then history would not have changed. That is the only germane dramatic element here, that Leo instantly felt the whole burden of this adverse change in the history of mankind, his decision to chase the chimp dramatically altered the history of mankind.This is only a story, a fictional film, so let's not get too wrapped up in it. However, it does illustrate a truism that we seldom focus on. Each of us, in everyday life, make decisions, do things, that trigger other things, and so on. If we could go back a day, or a week, or a year, and make a totally different yet still \"correct\" set of decisions, our whole present and future would be different. And that's what happened in \"Planet (2001)\" -- Leo's decision had an unimaginable influence on mankind. I wonder if the writer and director thought that deeply about the message??This is not a very good film, but not nearly as bad as a few reviewers say it is. I found it fairly entertaining for the most part, and generously rate it \"7\" of 10. Much has been made of the \"13 hours of extras\" in the 2 DVD set. Well, unless you are a die-hard \"Planet of the Apes\" fan, most of the \"extras\" are just not that interesting, once you've seen the movie. Aside from Burton's choice to not explain the story, I found it interesting how he has difficulty completing a sentence with a complete thought. Maddening to listen to. I'm sure he is a fine director, but the guy just doesn't have the ability to complete a thought!",

            "content": "YEAR: 2001 DIRECTOR: Tim Burton COUNTRY: USA RUNTIME: 119 minutesTHE PLOT: An astronaut (Mark Wahlberg) crashlands on a planet ruled by apes where humans are considered animals and slaves, even though they are intelligent and can speak. The astronaut soon leads the humans to revolt.I don't think there's any question that Tim Burton really knows how to make a film look great. And so it is with this remake of \"Planet of the Apes.\" The locations, sets, ape make-up, costumes, cast, score (Danny Elfman) and direction are all outstanding. Just as good as the original film and, in many cases, even better. Unfortunately, the overall results are a mixed bag.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The biggest problem with this remake is that there is no build-up of mystery. Wahlberg crashlands to the planet very early on in the story, just like in the original film. Unfortunately, as soon as he lands he's IMMEDIATELY thrust into the ape/human conflict, captured and taken to the ape city. This flashes by so quickly that the viewer could easily MISS IT ALL if s/he got up for a few minutes to get something from the kitchen!! The original took its time in this matter; Taylor (Heston) and his fellow astronauts obviously crashland in the middle of nowhere and explore the planet for a long period of time before eventually encountering the inhabitants of the planet. It's all very mysterious, and there's a lot of build-up to the ape revelation.It's also highly unbelievable that Wahlberg would crashland right into the midst of the human/ape conflict. The planet is the size of Earth, so what are the chances that he'd land right in the middle of the fray? I suppose Burton and the writers didn't want the film to bog down once Wahlberg crashlands, but couldn't they have at least given us FIVE MINUTES of exploration time, giving the impression that Wahlberg searches for a fairly long period of time before encountering the humans and apes? As it's presented it's simply too unbelievable.This is a major misstep; and because it happens so early in the film it strongly tempts most intelligent viewers (who naturally MUST have some reasonable amount of believability to enjoy sci-fi) to lose faith in the picture and tune out or, at least, become excessively critical of the remainder of the film.Another problem with the picture is that I just simply failed to really get caught up in the characters and their story. There needed to be more character-defining dialogue. A well written script causes the viewer to be CAPTIVATED by the storyline. Well, I never fully got captivated.These factors explain why I was severely let down when first viewing the film at the theater in 2001.WHAT WORKS: Seeing the film again recently, I was braced for these flaws and willing to suspend disbelief to (try to) enjoy the story. I now conclude that there are numerous worthwhile qualities to the remake.For one thing, although Mark Wahlberg is no Charleton Heston (Taylor was Heston's greatest role and performance IMHO), I think he does a great job as the protagonist. Helena Bonham Carter is also fabulous in the Zira-like role of Ari; she really brings Ari to life and makes her unique. And as beautiful as Linda Harrison was as Nova, Estella Warren pretty much blows her out of the water in the counterpart role of Daena. Unfortunately her character is shallow and we never get a satisfyingly good look at Estelle in all her voluptuous glory. But, no matter, what we DO see is breathtaking.Tim Roth is utterly evil as the villainous Thade. This is very much in contrast to Dr. Zaius in the original, who was actually a very noble character. Lastly, the giant Michael Clarke Duncan is magnificent as the gorilla general, Thade's \"friend.\"As to be expected, the ape make-up is WAY better than the original, even though I still love the job they did in the earlier film. The ape characters don't only look more like highly evolved apes compared to the original, they walk, talk, howl, grunt, jump, fight and climb more like real apes.The ape city sets are fabulous too, albeit a bit too dark for my tastes. I find this unbelievable and verging on cartooney. I know Burton is into Goth and therefore prefers dark lighting, but it would be nice to actually SEE the wonderful sets made for the film (or perhaps he doesn't want the viewer to get too good a look and see how artificial they really are? I don't know, I'm just guessing).I also liked all the homages to the original film -- the various lines, Linda Harrison, Charleton Heston as Thade's dying father, etc.Although numerous people had a problem with the ending, I think they did a good job. How else better to end it? Notice how the camera mysteriously shoots from behind the \"Lincoln Memorial\" just like the original does with the Statue of Liberty.FINAL ANALYSIS: Despite a couple major flaws there's a lot to appreciate in Burton's remake. It's not as good as the original or \"Beneath,\" but it's, at least, on a par with \"Escape.\" And it's certainly better than \"Conquest\" and, especially, \"Battle.\"The bottom line is that Tim Burton's remake of \"Planet of the Apes\" is a worthwhile addition to your apes film collection. For serious \"Apes\" fans it's even mandatory because, even though -- OVERALL -- it doesn't come close to the greatness of the original (or \"Beneath\"), it has numerous singular aspects that surpass it.GRADE: C+ or B-",

Even though the original is over 30 years old, it doesn't feel like it at all.  I felt there was no need for a remake.  I saw the new film on opening day, and I have to say I was disappointed.  The movie wasn't as shocking as the original.  It wasn't as captivating.  It wasn't anything like the original. The only thing that seemed to save it was the truly shocking twist ending. It really made me think for a while, but, eventually, I gave up.  It didn't make sense to me at all.  Then, I decided to throw all my initial thoughts of the film away and decided to go see it again for a second opinion, and, this time, I was blown away.  Rarely do I see a film and loathe it only to go see it again and absolutley love it.  I didn't compare it to the original as I did the first time, and I think that's the reason I completely hated it the first time around.  Tim Burton really did an amazing job creating a whole new world of apes where humans are slaves.  The cinematography, the set designs, and just about every technical aspect of the film is a marvel, especially the make up and costume designs.  Danny Elfman's score is one of his best, and at times, very frightening.  The acting is also top notch, from Wahlberg's subtle but heroic portrayal of Leo, to Roth who is absolutely stunning as General Thade.  This has got to be the most impressive movie of the summer, if not the year, easily on par with \"Hannibal\".  Just don't go see it and compare it with the original.  My grade: A-",

(One of them is the fact that this movie should never have been made at all but let's put that aside.) It might sound strange but the thing that troubled and disappointed me the most was that the humans in the movie could all speak normal English and all acted like almost normal humans and some even seemed to have make up and hairdressers! Another troubling thing was Mark Wahlberg. Now, I'm not one of those people who have something against Mark Wahlberg, not at all but he was simply totally miscast. He is too much of an hero, which is not the right type of guy for this movie. And let's not even get started about Estella Warren or Tim Roth's overacting and some of the unneeded and weak characters in a disappointing story with an ending so weird that not even the smartest person will understand it.Now, I must say that the movie has some nice sets, costumes and make up that are typically trademark Tim Burton, the special effects are also quite good. It's also good that there still is plenty of humor to enjoy but it's not enough to make the movie interesting.There are some nice scene's but there also are some extremely disappointing scene's. The hunt is pretty cool (although still not as cool as the '68 hunt version) but the end battle is extremely weak and disappointing and ends too abrupt. Especially the Colonel Attar vs. Krull battle is laughable and a disgrace for the two characters that were about the most interesting two in the movie.I do not hate this movie I simply did not enjoy it.

Well, when Tim Burton (the genius behind the secrets of the masterpiece THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS) signs on to do a project like PLANET OF THE APES, you just know it's going to be good. The actors are very well cast and everyone fit into their parts perfectally. But, for some very odd reason, most people found this wonderful version to PLANET OF THE APES to be a disappointment. I can't see why, because I enjoyed the film to no end. In my opinion, it couldn't have been made better. This really doesn't seem to me like a project that Tim Burton would sign on to direct, but hey, he did it. And did it well.\nMark Wahlberg is tremendous here, and so are remaining cast members: Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, Helena Bonham Carter, David Warner, Kris Krisstoferson, Chris Ellis and lots more. If you haven't figured it out already, I was entranced by this film.The usual action-adventure will place you in an environment with a highly intelligent creature that will then procede to roam around and kill you off one by one. But, here, Mr. Tim Burton has given us something better. He throws our typical cast of \"survivors\" into an environment where they are being hunted by a species just about as intelligent as they are. It actually almost resembles the apartheid of the 1930s in a way, only it is in reverse. Instead of the whites in control of the blacks, it is the apes (black people) in control of the whites (but in this case, it would be all humans).The story is well-told and is actually more of another sequel than it is a remake, but either way, Tim Burton's visual gem will be a fun to stun people for generations to come.PLANET OF THE APES: 5/5.",

In other words, not convincing as the original Planet of the Apes which do deserve an 8. This one is one of those movie I won't recommend my friends to watch except for the beginning ape chase scenes. The story falls on a couple of things that makes it difficult to accept. Time traveling through the future in an electrical storm in space seems too far fetched compared to the original movie, which traveled near light speed. The fact that the space station had a couple of \"space pod\" and Standard Operating Procedures, it's unlikely that any space station would be traveling around chasing space pods lost in electrical storms. Space stations' aren't built for chasing or rescue missions. They could have sent a couple of space pods, with a chimp is more plausible. The fact that humans became a slave, and yet they can speak English and talk, makes it unconvincing compared to the original movie which they aren't able to talk as the Apes are convinced that humans are unintelligent. The original movie the Apes assume humans to be stupid since they can't communicate is a more convincing story. The ending of the movie, I believe spoiled the movie completely and this is where the scoring is bad. In any good movie there are three things that's is key to scoring. The plausibility of the story, the beginning movie to pull us into the story, the ending that wraps up the entire move is the most important. The story fails on plausibility as mentioned here. Why are humans too passive is unconvincing. The fact that humans in this movie has no capacity to use weapons and being unorganized is very unconvincing. Humans are well known to be organized in times like these. The ending is really hard to rationalized into the story and no plausibility at all. It creates a Pandora's box. So if I were a movie producer and I was to do something different, time traveling through a wormhole, a black hole is more convincing, if we want to add to the old original story. The fact that a small space pod to travel long distance is unconvincing also even with all the technology in this movie. A human slavery is only possible through greater limitations of freedom as in concentration camps conditions is more convincing I believe, or the fact that the humans brains were \"neutered\" into stupidity, as in the removal of frontal lobe is another possibility. The fact that human slave they became a butler and a maid is an unintentional comedy and too unbelievable. The fact that they put humans in wood cage and to assume humans are too stupid to find a way to break those bamboo wood sounds unrealistic. Humans intelligence couldn't be that stupid given a slight 2000 years or more of evolution. I can continue to criticized this movie because of it's many mistake. In my opinion the movie compares slightly better than Snakes on the Plane movie. You can make another Planet of the Apes...if the story line is a plausible one, I believe and make some of the fixes mentioned here. As you noticed directors in general ignore good story writing but in animations where changes are very difficult and costly, a good story is much more possible. This is why Pixar Studios and Disney have such an impressive list of classic movies in spite of the fat that its a cartoon. While story writing can be written on the fly, it is this reason why Xanadu flopped, or in more recent one Disaster Movie was a complete flopped. The movie was made before the story and they had no idea as to the title of the movie.",

Davidson plans to lead a rebellion and prevent the war hungry apes from wiping out the human population.In the summer of 2001 many films were released that were heavily hyped and were meant to be fantastic.  The vast majority of them were poor \u0096 even without the disappointment from the hyping, they were still poor.  The remake of Planet of the Apes stands out as one of the biggest letdowns to me.  The plot has been changed slightly but the bones of it remains the same.  However we have already seen the monkey/human role reversal done before and that isn't gone into in very much detail here, opting instead for more action and drama.The main changes are superficial \u0096 the monkey makeup is better of course and the gorillas move very fast and with the agility you'd expect from them rather than moving like humans.  However this a great film does not make and all it served to do was to remind me how much better the original was. Wahlberg is OK in the lead and Roth is fantastically nasty but other than that the casting is either OK or just poor.  Duncan is OK, Carter is iffy and comic relief Giamitti is misfiring the whole way.  Heston's cameo is good and is actually quite funny but stands out a lot more than I suspect it was meant to.Overall this is hugely disappointing and will likely not spawn a sequel that relates directly to this film (if at all).  If you have to watch one movie that has humans being ruled over by monkeys then I suggest the original is a much better option.  Oh, and don't get me started on the ending!  It would be powerful if it made ANY sense at all, again, it just made me think how good the original was.",

The effects were good, but I would wait until they had a movie double with Battlefield Earth. That way you can feel really ripped off.Spoilers don't read on unless you really want to see this movie. When you see a movie the last thing I hate thinking is how silly, why did the hero do that. Example, After he escapes the ape city then he gets his survival kit from his ship rather than when he first crashed. The Holes - If they descended from the original space station and the only animals they had on board were chimpanzees. Where did the horses, gorilla's, orangutans & parrots come from? The worm hole? It was so convenient. I can imagine the scriptwriter, William Broyles saying to himself, \"gee I have painted myself into a corner here, I'll just use the worm hole, nobody knows how they work\". And worse of all he did it a couple of times. Very weak writing, with no understanding of plausible continuity.Finally I could see why they were training chimps to fly the Pods (That incidentally can reach speeds 6 times that of light.

I don't know why all the movies I happen to despise became huge successful films. Probably because the general person now-a-days is just looking for visuals, special effects, and action sequences.What happened to plot? I suppose it's dead. If you even remotely liked the original \"Planet of the Apes (1968)\", then don't see this mockery. It was definitely up there with, \"Hannibal\" as one of my most hated films.Even the score of \"The Planet of the Apes (2001)\" is repetitive, slow, and unoriginal - admittedly similar to the film's plot. The only surprise I found in this movie was Tim Burton's cunning idea of putting a frame of Hitler in the start of the film. The background for the frame or two of Der Fuhrer was some kind of nonsensical sci-fi blur that couldn't even logically happen in a galaxy far, far away let alone our own. However, don't worry Burton even hinted bestiality in this film (Not a surprise, I suspected it). I know that's horrible, but it's worth a good laugh... at how bad this movie was.Tim Burton: Does this movie even smell of his style? No. This movie doesn't have anything that would make me remotely think Tim Burton directed it. It has none of his early style and ideal that made his earlier work appealing and launched him into the mainstream. If you think you like Tim Burton's work and this movie's got to be good because he directed it, think again. If you liked his earlier work like, \"Edward Scissorhands,\" an excellent film in my mind: Don't go see his remake of Planet of the Apes. It will make you nauseous and annoyed.This film eliminates most of the great ideas of its original, which inspired so much wonderment, joy, and captivation, i.e. In Burton's version every single human can talk. The ending is all wrong, distorted, and makes literally no sense. All of the appeal of the original is casted away. Even the acting in this remake is quite dull.I need to warn you again, if you liked the original Planet of the Apes, or Tim Burton's early work, this movie will make you sigh - big time.

I saw this DVD on sale in the local DVD store for \u00802.50 - so I bought it. First mistake. Let me start with the director / plot. Tim Burton is a hot and cold director for me - I loved Scissorhands but not Batman. He's a gifted individual for sure but not everyone's cup of tea. Certainly not mine. However, he must have been on some sort of sedative when he decided to do this movie. The script was poor to say the least - which could have been written by a team of monkeys - such are the glaring inconsistencies and holes in it. I read somewhere that Wahlberg agreed to do this within 5 minutes of meeting Burton. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he never read the script because if he had - then I don't think he'd be so ready to sign on. The sets on this film looked just like they are - i.e. sets. Never was I ever convinced I was on a space station or in a spaceship or in an Ape city. Everything looked like it was made of cardboard and plastic and inside a huge hangar. I was extremely disappointed with Burton here as he has gone out of his way in the past for visually fantastic creations - here it is just lazy. Some of the cuts in the \"action\" scenes were laughable. Wahlberg supposedly gets thrown a distance of 30 to 40 feet in one scene and lands on the ground with a thud. The cut to him landing looks like he just jumped two feet onto the sand. Poor editing and no excuse for a director this experienced. Now the cast. Wahlberg - I must admit that he is a likable guy in movies normally and gets by. He always seems like a guy out of his depth though and someone punching above his weight. His brother Donnie is the more talented actor of the two - but because of Marky Mark's physique and modelling background, he gets the better gigs. Here though, he carries about as much dramatic weight as a wet rag. He whispers his lines without any tension or pathos - so much so that we as an audience do not care what happens to him. As I was watching, his character made no connection with me at all. He goes out in a pod in space, he crashes, he gets captured - and all the while I don't really care. Some of this is obviously script-related, but Marky has to take some of the blame too. Personally, I don't think he was ready to lead a movie at this stage of his career. He doesn't have an ounce of charisma. Roth - A talented actor normally - reduced to looking like \"Teen Wolf\" here and snarling in almost every scene to an off-screen object whilst close to the camera. He chews the scenery but underneath all that make-up he must have been so embarrassed. I was embarrassed watching him for God's sake so I cannot imagine how he felt. Bonham-Carter - The best of a bad lot to be fair. But she looked scarily like Michael Jackson that it put me off each time I laid eyes on her. But I thought she did the best she could with what she had. Warren - her part was just pure eye candy. Her character had no relevance to anything. Kristofferson - barely spoke and killed off early. Lucky him. Giamatti - unrecognisable under the make-up. Comic relief part only that wasn't even very funny.What's left to criticise here? It is not the worst film in the world - but it is not far off it. The ending just beggars belief. You will find yourself shouting the word \"What???\" at the screen on at least 5 occasions in the last 10 minutes - at plot contrivances that are so absurd, you'd wonder did ANYONE read the script before shooting began.A dead-in-the-water movie that in all honesty I would recommend only to my sworn enemy.3/10 - and the 3 is just for Estella Warren's lips alone.",

With the gifts of computer animations and the advancements in the craft of movie-making, why couldn't one care less what happens to these characters. I don't like Charlton Heston, but when he told off those apes in the first movie, I cheered him. As with the original, why are the humans so docile and disorganized. They have evolved to the upright state, fully clothed, communicative--but they aren't more than silly critters to the apes. How would you feel if your dog started making sweaters, got married, and lived in a cave? Would you be interested in whether he had become a sentient creature, capable of more advance thinking.Another question is why those apes were able to bounce in the air so much. I've never seen a monkey bounce; I've seen them swing, not bounce. The bad guy (excuse me, bad simian) can come flying like an oversexed kangaroo at any point. I have to admit, I liked the battlefield scenes. They reminded me of a kickoff at an NFL football game. Apparently they planned to take over the planet by running into each other.I really did like the physical appearance of the apes--there was great expression. I got a kick out of the humans being sold as pets in stores. As usual, of course, the gorillas are the dumb ones (It's because they are big--right--big people are supposed to be dumb). Oh, wait!

            "review_title": "This movie with great potential was ruined by the ending and lack of development of characters...",
            "content": "First of all, this movie is not as bad as a lot of the reviews make it out to be.  Second, it didn't bore me and I was actually pretty content with the film until the last 10 min.SPOILER**** When the chimp landed on the planet during the \"big final battle\"  I just knew that this film was spiraling down, and in my opinion it did.Mostly everyone knows the story of this movie regardless if they've seen it or not.  It's about a human pilot Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) who crash lands on a planet ruled by apes a few thousand years in the future and tries to escape because the living conditions of humans there are very poor due to the tyranny of the apes.  This simple plot I think would have made for a good movie.  Also, I'd like to mention that I haven't seen the original Planet of the Apes so I'm making no comparison.  However, what ruined this movie was the fact that there were too many plot holes.  A big part about enjoying a movie is to understand the story and when a movie is presented with a plot-holed story-line, you'll be spending a lot of time wondering instead of letting yourself enjoy the film.Anyway, the plot summary seems very simple, yet the movie is cluttered with so many different things going on.  This proves to be a big obstacle for portraying the development of the characters.  This was unfortunate because I believed that the characters were worth relating to, especially Daena (Estella Warren).  Actually, now that I think of it, she had about 5 lines in the film, other than that all she had to do was pose, and by the time of her last scene, I still didn't know her name.Another thing that bothered me about the film was the somewhat love-triangle between Leo, Ari, and Daena.  Throughout the movie, it was so obvious that a romance between Leo and Daena would've worked well, but they didn't even have a conversation together.  As for putting Ari in this equation it was just a bad idea because why would Leo even give Ari a second thought as a love interest when he has the HUMAN Daena right in front of him.  It was clear from the beginning that Daena was smitten with Leo, yet he doesn't even notice because he's too busy with trying to get off the planet which is understandable, but I think it would have been good for the film if Leo and Daena had connected emotionally.  First of all, Estella Warren who I think has enormous potential would have had a better role.  She could have been sort of the woman behind the great man, helping him believe in himself and just being there for him.  They really wasted the character of Daena in my opinion.  It's also unfair for others to criticize Estella Warren's acting, I mean how much better could she have been with the script she was given?Thade, annoyed me after a while because he sneered and growled too much. However, overall I didn't think Tim Roth did such a bad job.\nI've mentioned how Daena's character was wasted, well actually all the human characters weren't much for the plot.  Karubi, Daena's father had absolutely no relevence to the film.  Birn (Luke Eberl the boy) was a waste of screen space, and then they try to make him important during the end of the film, but that falls through because his character didn't develop just like everyone else.SPOILER*** Attar's (Michael Clarke Duncan) conversion at the end of the film was also unbelievable.  It's also hard to believe that when Thade gets stuck in the ship and starts shooting off his gun, that he didn't get hit at all even though there were like 7 bullets ricocheing off the tiny room at the same time.Finally, the ending.  A movie's ending can make it or break it.  This movie's ending broke it.  It left far too many questions unanswered, but not only that, it didn't make any sense AT ALL!  I have a feeling that the movie makers only put this ending in so that people will hear through word of mouth about this twist ending and make them want to see it.  It's nothing but a money making sham which unfortunately is working.  It leaves room for so many different types of sequels, what bothers me is that it doesn't seem to leave room for most of the characters to return for the sequel (eg. Daena, Ari...).Well, this movie was a feast for the eyes, it's visually a masterpiece, but unfortunately visuals aren't enough to make a great movie, a story and characters one can relate to are still the key and unfortunately this movie lacked this.  It's definitely a movie worth a look at, just not at the price of today's cinema admission.",

The worst complaint is that the film was not Satirical enough. This is a new movie.  A satirical version of this movie already exists.  Why would Tim Burton want to do another satirical version???  He wouldn't, that would be redoing a movie.  This is a re-imagining! Perhaps this is why tim burton decided to create a more literal interpretation of the subject matter.  And in so doing takes nothing away from the original and actually amplifies the sentiment of the original while actually maintaining a social message!  It may have be in a different area and more straight forward but it still echoes the sentiment of the original.  As for the complaints that the film makes no sense, it makes perfect sense.  One gets the sense that much of what happened will be explained later, in a sequel.  I could think of several explanations of various plot \"holes\" and inconsistencies.  It just depends on what they have in mind.  Just remember how much was left out of the original POTA.  To watch that film alone without all the sequels prompts many questions.   Also, I thought the small homages to the original were brilliant and fun.  And, The Special effects were astounding.  The makeup alone is completely worth seeing.  It really saddens me to see such a backlash against this film.  I left the theater actually feeling like this film stands right in line with the rest of the Apes films.",

Character development, which is crucial to any good story, is completely lacking - some characters sort of get a real cheesy and formulaic revelation near the end, but the hero and antagonist stay the exact same throughout the whole movie.Sure, everyone's saying \"well, they were up against a lot when they decided to re-make an old classic,\" which is true, but they didn't make a good movie - they just took the standard sci-fi / horror / action movie plotline and put apes in the place of villans.

It wasn't.Helena Bonham Carter pretty much walks away with this one, as she makes about the cutest chimp anyone can imagine.

Science fiction aficionadosshould take note that, unlike the original PLANET OF THE APES,this non-remake makes no effort to lay any kind of logicalconnection between the different time frames alluded to in the plot.If you have ever seen any time travel films before, even mediocreones, you will have come to expect some logical inconsistencies(reflecting that time travel is theoretically impossible in the firstplace), but Burton seems intent on simply giving the finger to anysemblance of logic here. If you haven't seen the film yet, you haveprobably been told to expect a surprise ending; I would tell you toexpect a surprisingly stupid ending that is surprisingly insulting tothe audience's intelligence.Burton's fondness for dark sets is apparent here,  but instead ofthe decadent, wildly overgrown urban landscape of his GothamCity,  all you get here is sensory deprivation and an urge to nod offduring one of the film's frequent and lengthy periods of inactivity.The ape makeup, which was groundbreaking at the time of theoriginal film, has not really improved much. Some of it is quitegood (Tim Roth as Thade), but it is otherwise uneven, as is theacting.Burton makes much of the difference in strength and agilitybetween apes and humans, but the way he shows this is not byendowing the apes with natural animal-like grace, but by loadingthem onto hidden catapults and launching them into the scene. It'slaughable.The DVD has a few extras, including commentary by Tim Burtonand Danny Elfman, but I got the best laugh from the cast biosection, which gives page after page of gushing plaudits forBurton's untalented girlfriend, Lisa Marie, who is alleged to haveappeared in the film.

It looked silly as she did the same thing he did, like jumping in the water when the question was asked, How long can a human hold his breath under water? It seemed to hokey to me. And even though her lines were not that long, even when she spoke it gave no passion, no heated conflict to be aware of. Her role just did not fit the story. Everything else was fabulous, Tim Roth as thade, Paul Giamatti that played the slave trader, which to me was a wonderful addition, for the humorous side to a mad world. And yet Micheal Duncan Clark also gave a great role as Thades general and subordinate. But one other that seemed to throw it off another notch was the irritating kid, who thought he could do everything in the face of danger, yet bungles it up just as badly as he rode the horse. This in itself did not make the stories strength, the strength came from the apes, and that to me is the story. Estella to me just wasn't the right one picked for her character, she was too flimsy... and too blank to be believed. And as for the runt, I couldn't see it he just did not look the type to play a would be hero. Yet besides these flaws i still thought the movie was a great adaptation to the novel, especially the features of the apes and mannerisms. Which to me seemed more real than the old seventies version.

The plot holes are so gargantuan that one fears the bored looking cast members may tumble into them never to return.

Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) works with chimpanzees teaching them space flight aboard a space station. When they come close to a space storm, they send out the chimp Pericles but he flies off course. Davidson flies out after it, disobeying orders, and is warped further out in space and time. He crash lands in a swamp and abandons his ship as it sinks beneath the water. He quickly encounters other humans who are fleeing an attack by apes. The humanoid chimps and gorillas have amazing jumping abilities and easily catch the humans, throwing them in carts. Leo is shocked to find out that the apes can speak. Using humans as cattle, Leo and the other captives a brought back into the ape city, full of all sorts of astonishing sights. The apes do not treat the humans with respect though Ari (Helen Bonham Carter) scolds the child apes that throw stones at them. The trader orangutan Limbo (Paul Giamatti) purchases the humans and stores them in prisons. The leader Thade (Tim Roth) inspects them with his right-hand man Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan), looking to purchase one for his daughter. As Limbo brands the humans like Daena (Estella Warren), Ari interferes on their behalf and purchase Leo, bringing him home. The apes debate possessing humans at dinner and Thade visits Ari after professing his love, though she spurns him. Leo escapes with Daena who makes him help her father Karubi (Kris Kristofferson) and family. The humans can all talk and Leo organizes an escape with them and Ari, though Karubi sacrifices himself.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",

To do otherwise would invite comparisons and I want to minimize my negative review. My thoughts/summary on Tim Burton's \"Planet of the Apes\" remake is as follows:The \"hero\" (Wahlberg), a highly trained and professional astronaut, blatantly disobeys his commanding officer to rescue a space monkey. After being sucked into a convenient local time warp that just happens to appear outside the space station. The hero crashes his tiny space pod on some strange planet, without getting a scratch on him. He gets out and immediately runs into some oppressed humans being chased by leaping killer apes. The hero becomes a slave, escapes, and finds his pretty space station has crashed on the planet and all of his friends are dead. The hero realizes that he is on earth and thousands of years in the future. With a look of \"shock\"(or lack of), the hero says \"oh no, it's not possible.\" Then the hero, using some old rusty technology and an expected plot twist, holds back an army of apes, stops the fighting, and brings peace, love, and harmony between humans and apes. The hero then hops into his sub-compact space pod and takes off for his own time period (going from Saturn to Earth in thirty seconds) only to crash land again on a planet and discovers the big surprise ending which leaves one bewildered. Watch the movie and see what I mean.In the background of this riveting tale is Helena Bonham Carter, playing a sympathetic, human loving, but annoying representative of the ape equivalent ASPCA/PETA. Tim Roth plays the ultra-violent, bellicose villain Thade, who flies/jumps through the air with the greatest of ease (Short of having a cape with an \"S\"). The other characters are little more than window dressing for the hero/villain/heroine triangle. Overall, a simplistic movie with great special effects. IMHO, the movie should have explained more about Thad's genetic killer ape ancestry, ape/human history, man's technological failures. There should have been believable spaceships and space suits. Also, the movie devoted too much time to the cute and funny bits of ape society.",

            "content": "Clearly, Burton didn't direct this one with the enthusiasm that he put into his previous movie, \"Sleepy Hollow\" (or \"Ed Wood\", for that matter). I may be wrong, but I get the impression that he was simply hired as a replacement for Cameron who was wise not to direct it. Visually disappointing, except in the scenes showing various landscapes; all of Burton's post-Batman movies are visually superior to this one.The apes look quite unspectacular; I had expected more in this regard from a 21st century movie. (But then again, they're just apes, aren't they, so how thrilling can they really be?) The apes are too similar to the silly-looking ones from the original, or perhaps it's just that the whole premise of talking apes is too stupid to work, period. This is the one time they should have really taken advantage of computerized special-effects and used them on creating the apes, instead of having humans in silly make-up. Burton must have confused apes with kangaroos or grasshoppers or even frogs, for this movie's apes leap very high into the air; the planet doesn't appear to have such low gravity. In fact, the apes practically glide through the air. I don't know why they simply didn't give them wings; after all, the ape-soldiers' costumes are right out of \"Wizard Of Oz\", so they might as well have stolen the winged-apes shtick, too.The aggressive \"bad guy\" apes don't even look so bad - when compared to the \"good\" ones like Bonham-Carter. Her make-up is awful. I never thought that she could be made to look more unattractive than she already does - but they succeeded here. I don't know if I should be grateful that she wears an ape-mask so I didn't have to watch her mug for the duration, or whether I should be disgusted that she looks worse than ever. Still, I guess that to cover a face that resembles man-boy Billy Armstrong from Green Day is always a good thing. Then there is that character she plays: the same one from the original, plus the very trite and obligatory politically-correct, pacifistic, left-wing aspects thrown in.Time is wasted in making obvious and predictable allusions to race problems, when there should have been more time and effort spent on other areas. The movie is watchable enough, but nothing more. It lacks energy, and there is a constant \"seen-it-all-before\" streak running through it, and I am not only referring to the obvious similarities with the original. The ending is stupid; makes no sense.For a truly unpopular IMDb comment (0 out of 90 votes or something like that!) see my review of the original \"Planet of the Apes\"...",

Tim Roth steals the show as the psychotic Thade, Charlton Heston's cameo is still worth the price of admission (a rental?), and the Ape Lincoln ending is STILL funny, after all these years. Carter's makeup, however, DOES look like- as more than one reviewer has put it- the late Michael Jackson. Paul Giamatti is great in a supporting role as a slaver and the late Michael Duncan makes the most impressive gorilla since James Gregory as General Ursus in BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES. The Rick Baker makeup is (of course) the Highlight of the show and underscores the problem I have with cgi (no matter HOW competently executed it might be): cgi removes the ACTOR from the equation. From the beginning, it's been the makeup- and the ACTORS BEHIND THAT MAKEUP- that made these movies worth seeing. (Of course, the philosophy didn't hurt one bit, but most of that was abandoned this time around.) The music was another plus that's often overlooked (at least, the martial music that opens the movie). Humor supplants horror this time around, but it's the overall weakness of the writing that makes this one not quite the classic it should've been.",

            "content": "Tim Burton's remake of the classic 1968 film of the same name and in many ways the film that shows both his strengths and flaws as a filmmaker. Many have praised its visuals while also condemning its confusing story, weak characters and an ending so baffling and weird that the film would instantly jump a couple of ranks if you left it out.And yeah, there's a lot of truth to that. The visuals are great, which has always been Burton's main forte. The ape costumes are still amazingly beautiful, the set and background designs are innovative and filled with small details. The colours are great, the cinematography is nice and it's an all-around good visual experience. Plus, some of the characters are nice. Mark Wahlberg as the main character is pretty bland, as he usually is, but he's a decent actor in his own way, so I guess we could have had worse. I especially like Helena Bonham Carter as Ari, our proxy for Zira from the original film. Easily the character with the most charisma in the film.But yeah, then the flaws. The story is pretty weak. At times it simply copies the plot of the original film to the nth degree, while at the same time making lame jokes at its expense. And at times it does not do that it veers into directions all its own, none of them making much sense or serving the overall story. The third act, when we learn all the secrets behind the world, is especially weak and will leave you at least somewhat disappointed.And then there's the final twist ending that tries to up the ante from the original film. but with none of its shock value or finesse. It's simply moronic.There is value in this film. If you haven't seen the original film, you'll probably like this one fine. It's not a very clever piece of science fiction, but it's not insultingly stupid either \u2013 aside from the ending \u2013 and the visuals are good enough to warrant a viewing.",

            "content": "I remember the original quite well, it having made a great impact on me as a 10 year-old boy.  I remember awaiting each sequel as it arrived in theaters in the 70s.  Tim Burton's film comes as totally different take on POTA, and this time with mind-blowing makeup and outrageous action sequences.Movie-goers who cannot appreciate the joys of \"Planet of the Apes\" have become too mired down in investigating plot-points and errors in logic -- all of which could be explained away by any talented sci-fi writer.  Tim Burton (surely one of today's greatest film makers) isn't concerned with exposition and plot contrivances -- only in entertaining his audience like a great showman would.  And that he does in a big way with this epic-scale adventure, which hardly resembles the original 1968 movie in character or theme, so pre-conceptions best be left at the door.Burton's \"Planet of the Apes\" supplies more black comedy than the first, often jumping over-the-top in its ability to constantly amaze and amuse the viewer.  The scene of a \"mixed\" ape dinner party has to have the most outrageous and amazing makeup effects ever created.  Tim Roth as bad-to-the-bone chimpanzee General Thade is terrifying, evil and ugly and probably gives the best performance among excellent company.  Mark Wahlberg makes for a perfect leading man, understated in manners and voice as a contrast to the bizarre and outlandish apes.  And Paul Giamatti as Limbo (a stand-in for old orange Dr Zais?) gives one of the best comic performances ever seen.This is \"popcorn\" style cinema, and it really bends over backwards to amaze and amuse the viewer.  Credit must be given to Burton and his art department for the campy sets, costumes and obviously the convincing makeup jobs which trumped any similar ones ever on film.  Rick Baker (the great makeup up artist) has taken his art to a higher plane in this monumental effort, and really should be acknowledged for giving audiences such thrilling creatures to view.  They're like no others ever seen on the screen, and to watch the expressive faces of these apes is a remarkable experience in viewing. The faces appear so life-like that you begin to believe you're watching actual apes.Kids should love this outing, with the violence all being decidedly PG and usually occurring off-screen.  Parents can also sit back and enjoy the trip to this wild planet since its loaded with symbolism and cultural references all cleverly packaged in Hollywood's best style.",

Worth seeing again and again. The characters of Ari and her loyal companion the former general remain with you long after the film ends.

            "content": "The modern remake has two purposes, A. to modernize the setting, characters, film technologies, etc., and B. to generate interest in the original work it remakes. The latter is used only when the former is weak and they have no idea how to really make the remake a better attempt than the original. This is one of those times.The main problem with this work is not the other the top apes, the shortened story line, the effects, the story itself, or the premise. The problem with this work is that Mark Walberg, though I do like him as an actor, is NOT a lead actor. Sorry Mark, but you're not. Mark Walberg is a great supporting actor, but he does not bear the presence on screen to bolster any movie, unless it is something small and weak enough to make him seem stronger. It's not his acting, it's his presence, or lack thereof.As far as this film goes, he IS the weakest element of what otherwise could have been a successful attempt, but Burton's works seem to deteriorate in the third act, with few exceptions, thereby calling for a strongly-written ending, something completely unexpected, or something totally over the top, in order to strengthen his inability to keep it together. Sleep Hollow is one example of a Burton work which does not fall into that generality, but only barely. A good example would probably be Ed Wood, which was bad enough on its own, and for other reasons.The reinvention of the Planet of the Apes was generally despised by Baby Boomers who loved the original campy, sometimes horrid Apes run, by virtue of fond childhood memories. The idea of combining several of these \"beloved\" works into one movie failed to generate the positive response the studio hoped for, and even served as a catalyst to bring down the work entirely, were it not for the name Tim Burton.As it is, this work went on to almost quadruple its initial budget, but the studios listened for once, and did not continue on with this line. At the base, this whole work was weak, from script to post production work, and in every way in between. So why the 6.8 rating? Because it served well to make younger audiences seek out the originals, and in spite of it all, this work IS entertaining! It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",

The spaceship sets and on the location night scenes have a unique atmosphere and edge about them. Even Mark Wahlberg tries his best to handle the half-baked script and there are a few welcomed cameos from some of the original cast. On the flip side there's some choppy editing, an uneven story, the ape city and the sandy finale are emotionless and uninspiring. Slipped in is some unnecessary humour, usually supplied by Paul Giamatti (aptly named Limbo) and you never feel any danger or threat from the apes apart from Thade. Also, there's no likable characters to really root for. Nothing can save nominated director and visionary Tim Burton's incarnation of Apes.The fist ten minutes and the last two are probably the most attention-grabbing of this version but with an estimated budget $100,000,000 there's no excuse for the travesty in between.",

A decade later I decided to pop the movie in and give it another go. Yep, I still feel the same! Love the movie, love the makeup and costuming, love the themes discussed and by all means, love the cliff hanger Tim Burton uses in the end. I have all kinds of love for this movie. Seems like Tim Burton had a vision of more movies in the Ape regime; sadly for some of us it just did not see its way through due to the entire mixed acceptance back in 2001. Tim Burton as all you readers are aware is quite unorthodox and eccentric in his directorial choices. For those of you who are not as familiar as some of us, he gave us \"Alice In Wonderland\" , \"Sweeney Todd\", \"Corpse Bride\", \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" \"Sleepy Hallow\" & \"Edward Scissor Hands\" to name a few. If you are a reader who follows movies not by trailer but by director, 8 out of 10 have watched all of the above. \"Planet of the Apes\" with comparison to Burton's style is quite different. It's a Sci Fi that discuss themes of Animal Cruelty, Humans vs Nature and also if you want to be scoffer who hates this movie, a remake of classic Sci Fi from 1968. I respect classics, however what if I can watch it done slightly better. The costuming and make up is brilliant in comparison to the classic. However my intention is not to compare this with the reputed classic. 5 Stars and a round of applause for the magnificent work put in by the team with the makeup and costuming. For a movie made a decade ago this is brilliant, I have watched movies done in the past 2 years that can't even hold a candle to this effort. There is a lot of emotion that is required to be conveyed, which was a vital element to carry out the emotional wave. Giving the extra advantage of excellent facial movement makes it so realistic, never would I have for a moment felt, it is false and it is just a movie. I was right there in the middle of it all. Thumbs up yet again! As much as I respect Mark Wahlbergs performance, I have to side with Tim Roth on this one. Bold performance! The ferocity, the valor, the true determination to make every human suffer he nailed it all. Tim Roth although under so much of makeup, has his presence; he is just scared to look at. He is the meanest Ape I have seen so far. Helena Bonham Carter, who later marries director Burton in real life, was convincing and also was the vital link that ties human affection and animal cruelty on a broader perspective. Personally though I felt that Carter has so much more potential is capable of contributing more. (But wait! Am I comparing her to who she has become before she became?)We do not realize what it is like to be caged, or to be treated as pets or even as beasts, but seems like there is much to fathom from this, animals feel as much as we do. These are lessons for some of us who beat our pets up, or for those who don't leave a clean bowl of water for your dog every day. Doesn't look too great when the tables are turned does it? Also we humans don't realize that once done, certain things can never be undone (You have to watch the movie till the end to understand this). Wahlberg clearly states in the movie that we humans hurt each other way more than we hurt animals on his home planet? Have you ever stopped to think how true that it is? With such beautiful themes that are very well deeply hidden it disheartens me that this movie never got the place it rightfully still deserves. A decade is a long time, but the copies are still out there. I am pretty certain that most of the younger generations never have seen this one; just like back in 2001 I had never seen the 1968 classic!",

            "content": "Apparently Tim Burton was very excited about making this film, but ended up being incredibly disappointed with the outcome. The film itself was a dud, and got a ruthless beating from critics and the general public, despite making a profit in theaters.The problem is that they tried to \"re-imagine\" the original much in the same way that \"Batman Begins\" was a restart of the Batman franchise - but \"Begins\" did it well, and \"Planet of the Apes\" was not as skillful.Tim Burton has some die-hard cult fans on this site who are quick to blame studio interference, but I think the real problem is that Burton was given too much free roam. Armed with a $100,000,000 budget and a very mainstream, action-oriented picture - something he had only ever ventured upon with \"Batman\" more than a decade prior - he just couldn't get a grip on any aspect of the feature. It's a very loose, jumbled, unfocused picture - full of absurdity, stupidity and downright hammy acting.Mark Wahlberg plays the hero, an astronaut who is transported through a black hole to another galaxy where apes rule the world and humans are their slaves. Leading a revolt against the apes, he fights for the rights of humanity - becoming a Jesus Christ figure for all the other humans...a \"savior.\" The ending throws in an illogical and pointless twist that is just there for the sake of shocking people. It undermines the rest of the film and makes you kind of go, \"So what was the point of everything that happened before this?\" Burton's worst film, and one of the more disappointing films I've seen.",

            "content": "Planet of the Apes starts in the near future of 2029 where Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) is stationed on the Oberon orbiting a distant planet, a huge space station where Leo looks after the genetically altered Apes who perform test flights. The Oberon detects an electromagnetic storm & sends a Chimp out in a space pod to collect data but the Oberon loses contact with the pod & Leo pilots a pod himself to go after it, Leo also flies into the electro magnetic & travels far into the future where he crash lands on the planet only to find that talking human like Apes are the dominant species & rule the planet while any humans are treated like animals & enslaved. Leo is captured & manages to convince human sympathiser Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) to help him escape, however the evil General Thade (Tim Roth) hates all humans & wants to kill them all & after learning of Leo's origins h sets out to hunt down & kill him before he leads a human uprising against the Apes...Directed by Tim Burton this big budget remake of the sci-fi classic Planet of the Apes (1968) completes my Planet of the Apes double bill today, I watched the original & then less than an hour later I watched this remake which I believe Burton actually described as a re-imagining rather than a straight remake & I have to say I enjoyed both films, sure the original is maybe the slightly more intelligent & better film overall but this remake is none to shabby despite a more shallow script & a baffling twist ending. I mean I think the ending is supposed to evoke memories of the original classic Statue of Liberty twist ending by again including a instantly recognisable world renowned iconic monument but no matter how many times you think about it or how many explanations you can come up with it doesn't make a blind bit of sense & will leave most of us scratching our heads in confusion. Again based on the novel Monkey Planet by Pierre Boulle this remake follows the original's basic first half premise fairly closely, astronaut crash lands on a planet where traditional roles are reversed as Apes are the dominant species & man considered the mere animal before all sorts of religious & moral issues raise their heads, this doesn't have the biting satire of the original & the moralist is kept to a minimum & dumbed down somewhat but at least it's still there in some form. The second half of the two films is where they differ the most with a huge battle between Apes & humans here & an A to B trek across the forbidden zone, there's a bit of comedy relief here as well while the main villains are different as the original it was a superstitious scientist & here it's a power mad General warmonger. The general idea that all Apes are afraid of water is also a stretch & the way our heroes escape hundreds of Apes is to simply cross a stream since they can't follow. The ending is also different with a definite answer to the origin of the Apes & their history. This remake places heavier emphasis on action & adventure than the original too which is fine I suppose as it's nicely done.Like the original 1968 version the make-up effects are outstanding here, even better in fact with some fantastic Ape make-up that just looks so realistic & utterly convincing as you can even make out details of the actors face beneath the mask's. The CGI computer effects are alright, there are one or two dodgy ones but nothing too major. The fights & action scenes are cool with particular detail given to the Apes like mannerism & movements which look great on screen, unlike the original the Apes here actually act like Apes as the swing in trees, leap high in the air, write with their feet & run on all fours into battle. The tone of the film is also darker than the original with creepy jungles & dark Ape cities.With a supposed $100,000,000 budget (almost twenty times that of the original made just over thirty years previous) this looks great as it should with great effects, sets & production values. The acting is good although Walhberg is given virtually nothing to do while Tim Roth makes for a good bad guy & original star Charlton Heston has a cameo as Roth's father. Kris Kristofferson has a small role as does David Warner.Planet of the Apes is a decent enough remake to a classic sci-fi film, having seen both in the space of a few hours I can honestly say I liked both of them & while seeing similarities between them I could also see differences too. Maybe not as good a film as the original but this is still a worthwhile watch.",

Luckily for Wahlberg, a female ape (played by Helena Bonham Carter) has the hots for him (!) and sets him free. With the help of a couple of apes and a band of humans Wahlberg has set loose, they search for his ship that contains a device that can send an S.O.S. to Wahlberg's mother ship. Closing in behind Wahlberg's group is a large, ape army all stirred up to kill Wahlberg and any human who dares defy the dominance of apes.My most memorable, movie moment of \"Planet Of The Apes\" is the final scene, which is a surprise, twist ending. Unfortunately, it doesn't make sense. I suspect idiot, studio executives were to blame, probably counting their chickens before they hatched (or should I say counting their monkeys before they were born), looking for a way to introduce a possible sequel and didn't care that it made no sense. Damn you, idiot, studio execs! Damn you all to hell! In a nutshell, this remake of \"Planet Of The Apes\" is a rock covered in a fancy wrapper.

            "review_title": "Tim Burton and the Apes",
            "content": "After the original film of the same title and it's numerous sequels, you have to ask the question, did the world really need another version?  Even with the advancements in technology and special effects since Charlton Heston first landed on the planet, it's kind of like an aging actor getting yet another face-lift; it looks good but it just can't recapture that original beauty, no matter how good the surgeon is.  And `Planet of the Apes' couldn't have had a better man to hold the scalpel, but even director Tim Burton couldn't make this one any more than what it is, an imaginative adventure story that basically just puts a new face on something tried and true.  It looks great, and the atmosphere Burton created fairly crackles; but as a story, we've been there, done that, and even with a slightly different twist at the end, this one simply does not have much to add, with the exception that the apes really look good.  But does being able to showcase make-up and F/X wizards justify resurrecting this one?  I guess the bottom line is, this movie's going to make a killing at the box office. \n\tIt all begins on a space station where some highly advanced chimps are being trained to go into space and do amazing things.  One of those in charge of these wannabe astronauts is Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), and when his special ward, Pericles, is launched and lost in a huge electrical storm, Leo jumps into a space capsule and takes it upon himself to go where no man has gone before.  He quickly gets swallowed up by the storm himself, and after some exceptionally good visual effects, he not only gets spewed out onto an unknown planet, but he's some four to five hundred years into the future.  He emerges from his landing with nary a scratch, but after barely having enough time to catch his breath or get his bearings, he finds himself caught up in the middle of some kind of hunt, and the prey happens to be humans.  And it's then, of course, that he discovers that something is terribly wrong here.  Apes are the hunters, and they seem to be in charge of everything.  He readily discerns that there doesn't seem to be much percentage in attempting a parley at this juncture, intelligent as the marauding primates appear to be, so he opts for that which is often the better part of valor:  He runs.  And the adventure begins in earnest.\tIf this movie had to be made (which obviously, it did) at least the right man ended up in the director's chair, because Burton has a way creating a look and a mood that suits this kind of material perfectly, just as he did with `Batman,' `Sleepy Hollow' and `Edward Scissorhands' (just to name a few).  But there just isn't that much story here.  It's an incredible journey, to be sure, but it's just not fresh enough to maintain interest for very long, even as good as it looks and exciting as it gets.  And, whereas the original had something of a message about the miasmatic direction society was headed, about the only message here is the one that can be found in the `Cha-ching!' of the cash register.\tAs the hero of the tale, Wahlberg comports himself well enough, but in all fairness, this wasn't a role that required much emoting.  Basically, if he could run well and look alternately confused and determined, the part was his.  He did and it was.  And to his credit, he did it very well.  Character development was unnecessary for the purposes of this film, so with Leo, what you see is what you get.  No surprises, and you never really get to know much about who this guy is or what makes him tick-- but it doesn't make any difference.  He's the hero, he cares about his chimp, and that's all you have to know.\tHelena Bonham Carter does a terrific job as Ari, the Ape who champions the cause of the humans, in whom she sees a value beyond the level of degradation to which her peers have consigned them.  Of all of those in the cast, she actually manages to do some acting, and she does it exceptionally well, expressing herself much better than what anyone would have the right to expect here, especially taking the cumbersome make-up into consideration. You cannot help, however, getting a sense that this is what it would have been like had Merchant/Ivory made `Gorillas In the Mist.'\tAs General Thade, the ruthless military leader of the apes, Tim Roth adds a villain to his resume that is quite unlike any he's played before and, like Bonham Carter, actually gives a remarkable and agile performance, all things considered.\tThe supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Attar), Kris Kristofferson (Karubi), Estella Warren (Daena), Paul Giamatti (providing some comic relief as Limbo, the slave trader),Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Krull) and features a clever cameo by Charlton Heston.  Taken at face value for the action/adventure film it is, `Planet of the Apes' is entertaining, but lacks the substance of the original and may be disappointing to anyone hoping for anything more than a visually engaging foray into a kind of twilight zone of the new millennium.  For what it is, it's well made and delivered; it just seems that the talent involved with this project could have been better served elsewhere.  I rate this one 6/10.",

            "review_title": "Planet of the Apes, the Remake: Now with 75% more snarling!",
            "content": "SPOILERS (also for original PoA, 1968)You would have to look far and wide to find a bigger fan of the original Planet of the Apes. I nearly went berserk a few months ago when a woman I know said that Planet of the Apes was a so-bad-it's-good type of movie. It took all of my mental power to remain calm (she wasn't even speaking to me). Yes, I worship the original Planet of the Apes and disdain its cheap, money-hungry sequels. It was those that lowered the original's reputation. Now comes the remake, directed by Tim Burton, a director whose work, IMO, is often visually brilliant but more often narratively incompetent. After I saw Sleepy Hollow, I wrote on imdb how I thought Burton should make sure his next script is okay before filming commences. Obviously Tim doesn't care what I think. His Planet of the Apes is a decent, run-of-the-mill summer actioner, but it has these weird attempts at social commentary and, even worse, at comedy.The jokes referencing the original are very cheaply made and only inspired embarrassed laughter. Charlton Heston's cameo is so gauche it's unbelievable. I pity him. The only self-referential gag that worked was a visual one that few people in the theater seemed to notice: the spaceship that Leo (Mark Wahlberg, who is so bland I almost forgot he was in the film while watching him) and his crew find in the forbidden zone is a visual pun on the Statue of Liberty ending of the original, even quoting camera angles. I laughed at that bit of cleverness.The make-up ought to be criticized a lot, for it is so much worse than the make-up of the original that it is startling. People nowadays might scoff at the original's make-up, not realizing that it was Academy Award-winning at the time. It is not bad at all, and the emotions could be seen on the faces of the actors. My favorite expression is one that a gorilla soldier has on his face when he is hosing down Taylor, Taylor exclaiming: \"It's a madhouse, a madhouse!\" The ape shouts back \"SHUT UP YOU FILTHY HUMAN!\" The expression on his face and his tone of voice are powerful. In this one, the make-up artists foolishly tried to ape real apes. What results is once and a while amazing (the orang-otans, especially Senator Sandar, whose corpulent orang-otan politician is the greatest and most underused creation this film has to offer; the other orang-otan, Limbo, is the best character in the film (Paul Giamatti, a good character actor all-around)) but more often terrible (Ari (Helena Bonham Carter, a poor actress in most respects), apparently a chimp, looks so much worse than her counterparts in the original, Zira and Cornelius; Thade seems more like an invented ape or a werewolf than a chimp). The apes' movement in this film is also ridiculous. They move basically as humans in the original, simply because they were supposed to have evolved. Evolution has given us humans straight backs. These apes run on all fours and jump a hundred feet in the air. What is this, Crouching Chimp Hidden Gorilla? Maybe a chimp can do that, maybe even an orang-otan, but not a gorilla. Thade (Tim Roth) at one point throws a fit where he leaps around like crazy. It's so ridiculous, several people in the theater were laughing. Also ridiculous was the decision to make these evolved apes sound just like their natural counterparts. There is so much squealing in this film that it ends up hurting your ears. Heck, I wish they would have just gone for broke and had them whip feces at the humans during their battles.In the original, characters were well developed and defined. The apes' society and civilization was well displayed, including the complex ape class-structure. The original film had patience in setting things up, it didn't overburden us with unnecessary action sequences. All in all, the new Planet of the Apes is only worth seeing if you are bored and in desperate need for an action film. It does not work on any intelligent level. 6/10",

            "content": "This version is a remake of an older film that was not exactly one of the best films under the sun. Here Tim Burton manages to give some new life to the main story and to add a punching line that is most surprising.In 2001 Tim Burton played with black holes and he could since the famous 2010 the Space Odyssey had come out some time before, exactly seventeen years before and everyone started knowing that in space we have these black holes of highly concentrated anti-matter that maybe lead to another time or space dimension, if we believe Stephen Hawking and his Brief History of Time published thirteen years earlier. It starts a little bit romantically since a monkey, an ape if you want, is being trained to go in a special space shift into one of these highly tormented and agitated areas to see what is in there. Unluckily he is lost within minutes. So his trainer decides against his own superior officers to follow suit to recuperate the monkey or share his lot.He falls onto a planet that is dominated by apes which enslave humans who are living in some forbidden zone. The description of slavery is just banal in many ways except that we are dealing with apes dominating humans, and of course no matter how intelligent these apes can be or may be they of naturally, like most slave masters, neglect the simple fact that these humans are maybe intelligent. You will not be surprised of course that everyone speaks English, including the apes who must have gone through a lot of mutations since their normal anatomy has never made them able to pronounce more than three vowels and four or five consonants assembled in seven or eight frozen signals. They can't pronounce more sounds and they have never been able in their many hundred thousand years of life as a species and evolution to even come close to the rotation of consonants or vowels that produce series like bat-cat-dat-fat-gat-hat-lat-mat-nat-pat-rat-sat-vat-wat-yat-zat, some of which words do not exist in English but do in other languages and some being spelled differently in English like \"what.\" Note with three vowels and five consonants you can produce fifteen consonant-vowel words, fifteen vowel-consonant words and seventy-five consonant-vowel- consonant words. In other words monkeys have the sounds necessary to invent at least 105 words and these monkeys only have seven or eight frozen calls. And in this film they speak fluent English. All the humans do to and they are hundreds on this planet. Where are they coming from?Note the hunt for human slaves looks a lot like the Morlocks against the Eloi in H.G. Wells' Time Machine. But that is all as for this resemblance.The new comer, the astronaut, space man if you prefer, Captain Leo Davidson, gets a human psycho-mechanism working again, resistance, rebellion and escape, and then an all out battle. In the mean time he will have found the space ship that brought all these humans or all these apes, or both on this planet. Why and How is beyond any real explanation. It is a fairy tale after all. And the humans will win when a monkey ghost appears from the vast sky and is at once considered as a god by the apes. Lucky Leo Davidson who is saved since he will leave the monkey with the apes and use its space craft to go back home! Well back home will be a long trip in ten seconds back to Washington DC where he crashes smoothly on the steps of the Lincoln Monument. And there a surprise is waiting for you.Of course Tim Burton could not resist and have two women fall in love with the handsome Leo Davidson, an ape woman and a human woman, and as a normal human male, he leaves both of them behind on the now pacified planet of the apes that has become the planet of the apes and the humans.Gosh it is sweet and honey-sugar-pie-licorice. Luckily the punching line gives some humor, very black somber humor, to this Hollywood-picaresque fable of war and love.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",

This film was an absolute mess and should never have been made in the first place being a remake of a movie that didn't need one!Mark Wahlberg essentially plays the same character he played in THE BIG HIT (a blandly \"nice\" guy in some sort of trance), except this time he's landed on an ape planet in a small spacecraft which can miraculously keep track of what year it is when he goes through wormholes.  Of course he stumbles onto an advanced tribe of apes slightly better made-up than in the original, but at a technology level further back (these ones don't even have guns).  It isn't long before he's walking in Charleton Heston's footsteps in befriending an ape woman and, (sort-of) falling in love with a human woman, and leading a small revolt against the although this time around there isn't even a legitimate reason for him to be doing so.  The entire premise is completely ruined by changing it so that all the humans on the planet can talk and think at pretty much a 20th century level. The original PLANET was based around Charleton Heston trying to prove to the apes that humans were just as smart as they are, but politics and religion alike suppressed the historical truth.  This film has none of this. It's just a dumb action sci-fi movie with little action (most of the violence is off-screen, a la BATTLEFIELD EARTH - an eerily similar sci-fi disaster) and no plot! What semblance of a plot there is is completely ruined by the multitudes of red herrings, plot holes, and a general lack of depth in any area.  Never is the ape society really explored or revealed, nor are any of the characters fleshed out.  We never learn who the other servants are or why they bother tagging along with Wahlberg in the first place.  We never learn how many apes there are or why they have superior technology to humans.  For some unknown reason there are several different species of apes (Gorillas, Orangutans, Chimpanzees) on the planet, yet the ship they all originated from carried ONLY CHIMPANZEES!!   More uncalled for changes: They made the monkey women way too \"pretty\" in this one, not looking any different from normal women except for their hairy hands and big noses (most of them could actually probably pass for humans) and the human women are all in full make-up with manicures and perfect teeth... when the humans are supposedly living in the stone age!  I know it's just a movie, but COME ON!  How dumb do they expect us audience-members to be.This all wouldn't be so bad if the film hadn't resorted to so much useless parody, such as an ape saying \"Get your paws off me you damn dirty HUMAN\" or later when Charleton Heston's ape character says about humans \"Damn them all to hell!\"...  my jaw just about literally hit the theater floor for that one.  What were the scriptwriters thinking?  Do they imagine the few of us who remember those lines from the original will be amused at all by this mutilation of the franchise.  I think even BATTLE FOR... was better... at least the ending of that movie made sense!  I'm not going to ruin it for you but the ending really surprised my by how awful it really was... not that I couldn't see it coming miles away but I honestly never imagined the writers would be THAT tacky.I'm usually very forgiving watching bad sci-fi movies, but this one was WAAAY below lowest common denominator...insulting to my intelligence, confusing, AND boring.  It hasn't been since I watched BATTLEFIELD EARTH or STAR WARS EPISODE 1 that I have sat in the theater completely appalled at what I was watching.  Let's pray that this disaster acts as a career killer for director Tim Burton.  He's made a few very good movies but the magic is over.",

            "content": "I am a fan of the original but was looking forward to Burton's take on it. Ive enjoyed many of Burton's other films: Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands were imaginative, beautiful and clever. Sleepy Hollow was gorgeous and had wonderfully creepy moments but the wrap-up of the story was clumsy and rushed. But, THIS, THIS thing he has stitched together is so god awful that I was shocked. First off, yes, he has shot it well, he always will, but the script (HA!) just stunk of guys pitching various \"let's think out of the box\" type ideas that just lay there like some well-intentioned pot-soaked student film. I'm a huge fan of Tim Roth and I felt he was terrible. All he did, over and over and over, was glare up at the camera from under his \"brow\" snarl and do a villianous voice out of a Scooby Doo cartoon. It was so one-note. Wahlberg just played it monotone and flat. I thought he accepted the idea of being in a cage being pulled by other humans while being beaten by talking apes - pretty well. All in a day's work as a chimp-studying space man. And (SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS***********this so called twist ending was like out of a SCTV sketch. I expected it to read Apraham Lincoln for goddsake!) And I know I'm really in the minority on this one - but I kept thinking the make-up wasn't that great. The gorillas were amazing, probably the best of the bunch, but the way they tried to make the chimps look a tad more human with that strange nostril configuration was just bizarre and hokey. And I congratulate Estella Warren for giving TWO AWFUL DEAD EYED performances in the same year: first the Stallone stinker\"Driven\" and now \"Apes\". My god, yes, she's beautiful, the blond hair, the bee-stung lips, the model's body, but talk about the lights are off and no one is home!!!! NOTHING behind her eyes. Ever. At any point in the movie. She walks badly, she rides a horse badly and the way we're supposed to FEEL anything when her and the female chimp are eyeing each other with jealousy over Wahlberg was ridiculous.",

Near the end, the astronaut chimp that Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) lands on the planet, days after Davidson did, but he was behind the chimp in the shuttles when leaving the spacestation, which did not ring true with the story! and the twist ending was a bit odd, but possible, the odd thing about it was the apes as 70's style over-the-top cops, I assume made intentionally like that.Mark Wahlberg plays it Ok, however he did not look too surprised to discover the apes and the fact that humans populated this new planet in a different time, also his dialogue was a bit quick at times. But apart from that it was good, The others did ok, Helena Bonham Carter was quirky, but the best was Tim Roth as General Thade, you can see he put his all into the character. Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison from the original even had cameos in this.It was made well, the Ape costumes were much better than the originals, hardly surprising. the scenes were good, and photography excellent, as were the special effects.It does not have the style of the original, so that is why I only gave it an 8 rather than 10 for that, but apart from that it is very good, apparently Tim Burton wanted longer time and more control over it, but didn't get it, if he had I think it might have been a lot better.",

The epic battle at the end was very well-done and just plain badass. The makeup for the apes and the art direction were just sensational (as these two aspects always are in Tim Burton's films). The style is pretty un-Burton (there's no Gothic elements or anything like that) but it still immerses the viewer and Danny Elfman's score does a great job of putting us into the world. In blockbusters you're never really looking for great performances, but Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth were both very good.

            "content": "Never mind about a \"plot\" for this thing. This film is Tim Burton's ultimate disaster, an abomination of a re-imagining that should never have been made. Burton hasn't got a clue as to what made the original Apes Franchise so appealing and timeless to its legion of loyal supporters. I know that as a lifelong fan I had waited nearly thirty years for Twentieth Century Fox to green light another Apes project, and my hopes were high because I had liked Burton's dark and dreary BATMAN. But - as some behind the scenes footage would prove - Tim just thought of this whole undertaking as a goof and a joke, as he would break out into laughter after yelling \"Cut!\" while trying to maintain a straight face. Indeed, there is an over-use of comedy a-plenty in APES 2001, which appears to take precedence over everything else compelling, and it just made me sick. There are some gag-worthy perfunctory elements from the original 1968 classic tossed in which come off as an obligatory bone to throw fans: idiotic turns of iconic phrases, such as \"Take your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty Human!!\", and even a non-credited (thank God) cameo by Charlton Heston himself in ape makeup as he parodies his own persona with a mighty \"Damn Them All To HELL!!\" yell. The human characters in this version can speak but are completely undeveloped; even Linda Harrison's mute 'Nova' in the first two original APES movies had managed to make her someone we could relate to and care for! Oh, and I forgot about Marky Mark Wahlberg in the part of the lead astronaut who lands on this dopey planet ... the less said about him here, the better.Many people are completely confused by the ending of Burton's picture (so was Burton, if you hear him stammering and trying to make sense of it himself on the DVD commentary). I get it all right myself, but it was just badly realized. Within the whole movie you get the feeling that there is no story attempt, or that maybe a lot of things were edited and then just haphazardly reconstructed. But the main insult is that the core idea behind Planet of the Apes is not supposed to be about laughing at a bunch of silly monkeys in clothes bouncing all over the walls and shrieking and hollering. That misses the entire point of the message behind the series. However, as vomit-able and insulting as Burton's pile of gorilla manure may be, there are a merciful few things which prevent it from being totally unwatchable: For starters, Tim Roth makes a delicious villain as the evil chimpanzee Thade. Paul Giamatti's comical orangutan character Limbo is spirited, but overstays his welcome and would have been tolerable only in very small doses. I must respect Rick Baker's new apes makeups to some extent, even though I don't think they can best John Chamber's original 1960's designs. Whatever compliments I'd give to the makeups are only with respect to the male apes; the females are very badly realized... Helena Bonham Carter's female chimpanzee here is just terrible ... she looks more like Paula Abdul rather than an ape. Fox would fare better with its second stab at a reboot ten years later. But Tim Burton really dropped the ball for this instantly forgettable travesty. Yes, Tim, you did it alright -- you cut out this series' brain, you bloody baboon!!! * out of ****",

Indeed, there are only two problems I have with the film, and they're familiar problems other people have with it. I just don't think they sink the film. (1) Where did the horses come from? The film should have answered that. (2) The ending is both unnecessary and tough to explain. For me, the film ends when the craft launches back into space.Instead of being a laughable moralization about war, dependent on ridiculously fast human-controlled speeds to get there, this is a more stripped down story about what happens when the descendants of your pets evolve capabilities similar to your own, while you're tossed about by an unknown space phenomenon. It's more watchable, and more believable.That said, while I prefer this over the original, I don't prefer it so much as to give it a different rating. Both films deserve 7/10. They are good, but not great.With the original film, it does share the flaw of failing to understand how evolution works. There is not a single \"direction\" for evolution, and not all species, or offspring within a species, will follow the same path.

The 1968 classic was a fantastic sci-fi vision with a bubbling undercurrent packed with issues at the forefront of the era like race-relations and the ever-gnawing fear of nuclear devastation. On top of that, it had a gripping and involving storyline and quite rightly ensured its place in cinema history. However, with Tim Burton attached to this new version you could be easily forgiven for imagining it would be a taut, character-driven new film with much to commend it. After all, it's not like Paul W. Anderson was handed the reigns was it? So it comes as a massive disappointment to say that the 2001 Planet of the Apes is a disaster on every level. The normally reliable Mark Wahlberg is terrible but considering what he was given to work with it'd be unfair to place all the blame on his shoulders. As Captain Leo Davidson he takes on the equivalent to Charlton Heston's lead from the 1968 version but has none of the gritty determination that his predecessor had and spends most of the movie looking utterly bemused, possibly because he's found himself running around a world ruled by apes, possibly because he's been given such a terrible script to work with.The rest of the cast are no revelation either. Tim Roth is an unrestrained monster, but rather than being a credible villain is simply yet another cardboard cut-out Hollywood bad guy whose only separation from cinema's other dastardly Brits is the fact he's done up in a chimpanzee outfit. Burton's squeeze Helena Bonham Carter meanwhile turns in an especially cringe-worthy and highly irritating performance as the daughter of a lead ape senator who helps the humans escape. Funny how it's always family members of incredibly extreme politicians who believe in what's right isn't it? And as she spends most of the film running around talking about how unfair her kind treat the humans, fawning over Mark Wahlberg or screeching wildly, it's very hard to give her any kind of sympathy. Looks like the attempt at making an ape sexy back-fired spectacularly there fellas.It also suffers from Hollywood's tendency to move things along as quickly as possible in case the audience gets bored, for no sooner has Marky-Mark set off on his trek to find a human spacecraft than he's arrived at his destination and is ready to lead a resistance movement. The climax is a huge let down as the ruck between the apes and humans is over within minutes and before you know it, Wahlberg's jetting off into space and returning to Earth for the much talked about ending.Elsewhere, the clich\u00e9s and general sense of corporate film making abound. Ape suppression of humans means they hit them with sticks and talk like the Uruk Hai from out of Lord of the Rings an awful lot and the script is packed with cringe-worthy tributes to the original (\"Get your filthy paws off me you dirty stinking human,\" urrgh). The finished product is nowhere near the film you could imagine Burton making unless you'd seen it and the whole thing feels like an extended episode of a fourth rate science fiction show that takes itself too seriously.

I bought if off a drugstore book rack because the title was interesting and I was crazy about science fiction. I was somewhat disappointed when the book turned out to be more an allegory on the human condition than hard sci-fi.In the book, two space travelers, one male, one female, discover a canister drifting in space. Inside it is a manuscript which, conveniently enough, they can read. The unnamed author of the manuscript tells his story: He is an extreme misanthrope, so disillusioned with the human race and man's inhumanity to man that he builds a spaceship and, along with two or three other men (no women), he travels at relativistic speeds (hence there is time dilation amounting to centuries or millennia) to another solar system, where they find an earthlike planet. It is, you guessed it, the Planet of the Apes. The apes have an advanced civilization and the humans are the oppressed animals. The humans are mute and naked and really do live like animals. The ape civilization consists of the three ape races: The chimpanzees are the scientists and the engineers, the gorillas are the military and laborers, and the orangutans are the philosophers and statesmen. He is separated from his companions, captured and paired for mating with a woman, whom he names Nova. The senior member of his crew, a scientist, is eventually rediscovered, but the scientist has regressed to a subintelligent level by having to live as a human. (His degeneration was not the result of brain surgery, as in the 1968 film, which was a big goof anyway, because the man's operation was on the right, whereas in the normal human brain, language function is in the left hemisphere.) The protagonist learns the language of the apes and becomes a celebrity among them. With this new life comes disturbing revelations: The apes behave much more like 'animals' than they would like to believe of themselves, and he discovers old documents that reveal that on this world, as on his own, the humans were originally the superior race. Their downfall came when they began to perform experiments in intelligence amplification on apes. The enhanced apes overthrew and subjugated the humans. The protagonist is appalled by the discovery that the apes can be as degenerate, corrupt and \"inhumane\" as humans. At the same time, his position is increasingly jeopardized as the apes' distrust of him grows, along with their fear of him as a potential leader of a resurgent human race. I don't recall whether he escapes and finds his old ship, or manages to build a new one, but he leaves the Planet of the Apes with Nova, who is now pregnant with his child and learning to speak, and travels back to Earth (more time dilation), or what he thinks is Earth, only to discover that it is now also a Planet of the Apes. Here the manuscript breaks off, and the two space travelers ponder its meaning, whereupon it is revealed that they are---surprise!---apes as well.You can see how far the original film departed from the novel, and threw in a lot of hokey nonsense as well. Yet it retained some of the flavor, essential ideas and philosophy of the book. The new Planet of the Apes has not even done that much. It is a tame (no pun intended), essentially mindless exercise in special effects. Why did they even bother?",

Ah... finally, this summer there is a true summer movie, featuring not only the big budget, cool special effects and the action, but also a seasonable plot and acting to rake in tons of teenagers' (as well as their parents') summer-job money.While I don't know/care to discuss the budget, it certainly went to good use.  The make-up effects are amazing (the make-up in the original was just as amazing when it was released, but look how far make-up artistry has come!); the big action scenes near the end featuring flank after flank of the ape army are truly a sight to behold.  Unlike in the original series, there are multiple species of ape on this planet, including chimpanzees, gorillas, and even a few orangutans.  All look amazingly realistic, physically way more intimidating than any \"human\" character could ever hope to be.  It must have been a nightmare for the actors under the makeup though.Besides, looking fantastic, the apes actually act like apes!  It's just so interesting and exciting to see an ape character such as General Thade yelling at someone in English, then jumping and climbing around, screeching in anger.  Next to that, it's really not possible for the human actors to contend at all... I mean they're not bad, but they are easily overshadowed by the apes, especially the soldiers, who not only look menacing, but through their harsh tones of voice and shrill screeches, are menacing.  It's too easy to forget that there were originally people underneath all those apes. Along with their appearance and manner, the apes' society is also interesting.  There is an ape religion, with the belief in a soul (and subsequent belief that the human \"animals\" don't have souls).  Other aspects of their society mentioned in the film include inter-special marriage (e.g. a chimp and an orangutan), a senatorial government, and humans, depending on age, sold as pets or slaves; there are even \"human rights\" activists.  While it may not offer as much social commentary as the original series, it's still enthralling enough, and it's great that the writers decided to offer details on the ape's religion, which is also a vital part of the plot near the end.  The only complaint I could offer about the society portrayed is that, like the original film series and unlike the book, the apes don't use vehicles.The unfortunate thing about summer films is that they usually end up sucking a few years later, as they are based solely on the special effects.  Tim Burton and crew have broken that mold with Planet of the Apes, which holds through all the way to the twist/ending (which is different from the original, and, though definitely an unexpected surprise, just a little bit of a let down).  See it for the special effects, and see it again for the intricacies of the ape society, religion and plot.",

Tim Roth was terrific (villain of the year?), great special effects, great action, great humour, even some satire.  What else would you want from a summer movie?  Not the best or most logical script in the world, and not a patch on the original movie, but this is not unknown in a remake.  If you believe what you read Hollywood has been trying to make a new \"Planet Of The Apes\" movie for years, and Tim Burton was the man who actually managed it.  For that at least he should be applauded.The ending didn't really make any sense.  Many people have already commented on the ending, and I will not add to the comments here.  What I would say is that I wonder if Tim Burton, who has said that he will not be involved in a sequel, chose this ending as a challenge to whoever will be doing the sequel - and surely there will be a sequel.  You know \"explain that, if you can?\".  Just an idea.",

The last time I remember having that feeling was when I came out of Caligula back in the early 80's.I really can't hardly figure out where to begin because the number of insanely, ludicrously, mindless flaws in logic (or is it ludicrously, mindlessly, insane) were so overwhelming that I truly thought anyone with an IQ of over 60 would NEVER admit to liking this movie. Incredibly, there are actually humans that know how to type (unless some ape is doing it for them) on this web site who liked this pile of garbage.I'm serious. I don't even want to waste time on the number of impossible coincidences and ridiculous plot holes and staggeringly insipid assumptions that were made. It was cheesy, predictable, boring, stupid, insulting and, did I say MINDLESS?The ape costumes were decent, but decent special effects nowadays are assumed.

            "content": "The 2001 remake of the original 1968 classic, \"PLANET of the APES\" is directed by Tim Burton and starring Mark Wahlberg as the lead character and since I'm only doing three of the PLANET of the APES film reviews, I decided to start off with this one.The sixth film produced in the Planet of the Apes franchise, it was loosely adapted from Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel of the same name and the 1968 film version. It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but with the help of an ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion.The film also stars Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella Warren Development for a Planet of the Apes remake started as far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the pre-production stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled Return of the Apes, would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox. Chris Columbus, Sam Hamm, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes brothers later became involved.With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Tim Burton was hired as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. Planet of the Apes was released to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised.The story is a little confusing, but it is easy to look at for me, but for everyone else, a lot of people and critics and also fans of the franchise hates this story and the ending. The ending is just confusing also, but it's easy to overlook these two major flaws.The music by Danny Elfman is just awesome and the song that plays during the end credits titled, \"Rule the Planet Remix\" is awesome, mixed by Paul Oakenfold and composed by Danny Elfman. The rest of the music including the opening theme music is just spectacular and the film does wonders with the music.The visual effects and makeup is just spectacular also, but Rick Baker did the prosthetic make-up effects for the apes and it is a blessing of him. The visuals are a little cheesy, but works for this type of movie.The acting, is just good and bad. The only credit that will be given to is Mark Wahlberg, his performance as the lead was amazing. Helena Bonham Carter, Estella Warren and Michael Clarke Duncan puts on really good performances as well, but they can get way too over-the- top in some of the scenes. Paul Giamatti is hilarious and he does an amazing job. Luke Eberl and Erick Avari is in the film, too, but they're performances were a little confusing. Charlton Heston has a cameo as Thade's dad. Tim Roth plays the villain, Thade and he is okay, but even then, he is over-the-top as well.Overall, with the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes, it's not a bad re-imagining, but it could have done much better than this. I like and hate this remake of the 1968 original classic.Despite its financial success, 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and later rebooted the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes.",

Tim Burton could have sexed up this simian saga & given the adults in the audience something to look at. Even the chaste Helena Bonham Carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain. She's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks & a little bitty kiss at the end. As in Artificial Intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots & humans but never delivers - Planet of the Apes hints at inter species romance between the humans & the apes but only hints. Lisa Marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy. This movie has three great actors Tim Roth, Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes & they are fun to watch. Superlative  make up (a certain Oscar) costumes, sets, music make this the hit summer movie of 2001.",

The screenplay had all the depth of a fourth grader's story contest submission, stooping so far as to have a character say (and I'm not making this up) \"Can't we all just get along?\" I swear, Paul Giamatti's bad comic relief character was pulled from a thrown-out Disney script. This movie was cliched at its best, at its worst it was painfully stupid.

I was very excited to go see it, and I hoped that this would be the one good movie this year, after a long, long list of absolutely TERRIBLE movies for 2000.  Of course, it did not break the trend. This movie was just as terrible as all the other over-hyped crap that came out this year.  SPOILER ALERTA little warning here:  I am going to reveal the ending.  But it is of no consequence because the movie is total garbage and the ending makes no sense, so when you see the movie for yourself you wont even care how it ends, you will just be hoping that it DOES end!A laundry list of complaints: The script has too many holes in it to be forgiven.  There is WAY too much dialogue.  So much so, this movie cannot be considered an action movie. I almost fell asleep!  The make up for the apes was not as great as everybody makes it out to be, and the actors have a really hard time spitting out their boring lines with those big, prosthetic teeth in their mouths.  Its very distracting.  The acting is poor and the sets are TOTALLY CHEAP!  The Monkey City looks like something out of the Pirate Tour at Disney Land.  I mean REALLY CHEAP!  There is no edge to the movie.  The viewer should keep in mind that this movie was rated PG-13.  There is very little violence, and when a character does die, the camera conveniently cuts away to something less disturbing, giving the movie a very \"MADE FOR TV\" feel.  I mean it looks like something slopped together by the Sci-Fi Channel.  Humans should have been getting ripped in half like so many phone books at a strong man contest.  But they weren't.  Also, Tim Roth's character of General Thade was acted well, but he had nothing to work with!  He was supposed to be the big, evil protagonist.  But in the movie, we never see him do anything all that evil. Instead, he just grimaces in an evil way and hops around a lot when he gets mad.  By the way, there is a lot of unbelievable jumping in the movie.  It looks terrible, you can almost see the wires and the harnesses on the actors.  It does not look like they are jumping at all, but SWINGING through the air. \nAt the end we discover that all these stupid apes evolved from the experiment apes on board the crashed space station.  But there are MANY species of apes inhabiting the world, and there were ONLY chimpanzees on the space station!  This is ONE of many, many plot holes in the movie that are just unforgivable. Then, at the end, the little chimp flies his space pod down to the planet and makes a PERFECT three point landing and then hops out like a little pro. Marky Mark INSTANTLY jumps in to the SAME exact pod and flies off to space and then tries to land it, but totally crashes it for NO explained reason. Is the chimp a better pilot than Marky Mark?  HOW STUPID!After CRASHING his perfectly good space pod, Marky Mark discovers that he is on a planet just like Earth, but again, totally ruled by Apes.  And he sees the \"Lincoln\" memorial, and there is a statue of General Thade with a STUPID Lincoln like hair do.  The ending makes ABSOLUTELY no sense at all and it was the final down point to an already over-long, boring, and under-achieving film.  These are just a few of the glaring plot holes in the script.  Doesn't anybody proof read scripts in Hollywood anymore?  I hated this movie, I was disappointed by this movie, I was BORED by this movie, and I strongly, STRONGLY recommend that you do not see this poor waste of celluloid.",

In fact, since all the humans were killed on the space station, who were all those long-haired Harley Biker dudes (the \"humans\") descended from?  Without the constant philosophical criticism of man's evil nature(throw in guilt and original sin too, what the heck), it turns into Humans versus hairy Roman empire-Mafiosa-Nazi-etc.-type aliens (Tim Roth is a composite of many movie evil archetypes). It looks like they borrowed the plot twists and F/X from the new \"Lost in Space\" movie, but that movie didn't really have to compete with the original series. The ending is reminiscent of the book BUT doesn't make sense in terms of time travel in our universe, so if he went back in time in an alternate universe, all quantum universes being equal, then it's just a coincidence he returns to an ape-ruled earth (rather than an INEVITABILITY which was THE POINT in the book/original film). To put it another way, if Burton's movie came first, noone would be inspired to remake it 30 years. Great effects, costumes and menacing apes but very uninspiring.",

All I know is the story had me hooked, and the ending had me leaving the theatre with a punch in the gut, I was begging for more. I awaited the sequel for so long and it's such a shame they didn't make one with the apes in the present day. That could've been such a cool movie. Tim Burton was perfect for this at the right time. Maybe it's because I was a kid who knew so little about the world that this was movie magic for me. I love it.",

In fact I was twelve when I saw it in the cinema -- the violence disturbed me, but I love the ending. I still love the ending Not enough films (or at least big films) have a finale like this, in fact that was one of the criticisms on Minority Report (which I need to watch again) But my favorite director of all time has made a film people consider his biggest fault, they don't like Alice in Wonderland either I love both, I love all his films.I'm proud I have the DVD, and don't need other people to like it as much to make me feel like I'm allowed to feel that way Oh and the cast and acting are wonderful, so is the make-up.

            "content": "First off, I am a very big Tim Burton fan.  I could go on forever about how much I love his films, but this is about PLANET OF THE APES and not Burton's career.  The original PLANET OF THE APES movie is a favorite of mine.  I have loved it since I first saw it as a child.  And I could never realize why so many of my friends would laugh at me.  No one ever understood the film.  Well, none of my childhood friends.  When I first read that Tim Burton was selected to direct the new APES film I was a little confused. He is a brilliant director, but an APES film?  A number of months later I saw the theatrical trailer and was very impressed.  Well, not entirely.  I have a very strong hatred for Mark Wahlberg.  Other than his casting, the film looked good.  When I saw the film summer of 2001, I was utterly disappointed. If any of you have seen the movie, you know what I am talking about.  I think the main problem with the movie was the script.  And that brings my attention to a possible problem with Tim Burton.  Visually, he is amazing but his taste in scripts or screenplays is lacking.  Hell, maybe he decided to do the movie before reading the script. That would probably explain a lot. This was the first Tim Burton movie that I not only did not like, but rather hated.  The movie is incredibly slow, boring, and very expensive.  However, visually (if you were to watch the movie with no volume) the film is great. With the exception of a few action sequences. For some reason every other action sequence or so by Burton is terribly filmed.  I thought he did a wonderful job with the action in his previous film SLEEPY HOLLOW, but the climatic battle in PLANET OF THE APES has some horrible shots.  On the other hand of course it had some beautiful and provocative scenes too.  One in particular is of the chimp Tim Roth running on all fours towards a fleeing Mark Wahlberg into the old space ship. And also the shots of the Ape infantry charging on the frontline on all fours was incredibly brilliant and scary.  As I stated earlier, great film visually and Burton is amazing but the dialogue and script for this movie are horrible. In conclusion, I'd give this film a D.",

But, it surely was not worthy of a remake, revisioning, or regurgitation.What is most disturbing about this movie is how slow and illogical it is. It plods along through scenes with very little energy. I kept thinking about how hot everybody must have been in those monkey outfits. There are points where Mark Walburg does the most illogical and pointless things. For example - why doesn't he ever talk! I mean if strange animals were locking me up AND they happened to also speak my language, I would make every effort to reason with them. But Mark just stands there .... duhhhh. When he finally gets a gun - which could flatten the apes does he protect it with his life - heck no. Another ape grabs it from him and breaks it.And the woman with the overly red pouty lips. What the hell was she doing there other than looking pretty? Her role has no purpose whatsoever other than somebody who can receive the animalistic affections of Mark.\nThis is a pathetically bad movie. Worse than I even expected.

            "content": "Directed by Tim Burton, this has all the things that you would normally associate with him - fabulous costumes, gothic scenery etc etc. These are visually stunning and serve as an excellent background to the movie. What's missing is a good storyline, good dialogue or (apart from a few notable exceptions which I will come to later) decent actors. It takes the plot of the original film and \"updates\" it (although why it needed updating, I don't know).Why do I think it is so awful - let's start with the dialogue. From the moment Mark Wahlberg utters the line \"I'm going to get my monkey\" the script is laughable.Now on to the storyline - well as I said, did it need updating? Take the original, add in some human talking (although it was mostly Wahlberg) and a truly cringe making ending and you have the disaster that was this movie.The acting - I've watched a couple of Wahlberg movies now and I really don't rate him. He seems to think a perma frown relays a pensive side and that if he stomps, he will appear powerful. As a main player, he doesn't convince. Tim Roth - love him but overdone. Helena - don't get me started - ape sensitivity, I don't think so! Michael Clarke Duncan - hang your head in shame. And Estella Warren - god love her, she didn't have a chance. She gets so few lines and is blatantly there as eye candy alone.The human characters who deliver the lines don't even have the decency to look embarrassed. The one exception is Kris Kristofferson who I can pass off without comment, mainly because he wisely keeps his mouth shut for most of the time. The ape actors are well hidden and we won't know if they were embarrassed or not - and they should be. I really respect Tim Roth as an actor but this was ape ham that I was watching - overdone evil, a flat performance. The only decent ape performances that I saw were by Paul Giamatti as the slave trader and the brilliant minute or so that Charlton Heston was on the screen.If you choose to watch this movie, remember you will never get the time it took to watch it back.",

However after the second watch, I felt much more touch with the Ape girl. She is a noble birth in apes planet, yet she is smart, curious and full of sympathy to human unlike other ruthless apes, they treat human as pet or slave. When she was attracted to a human, she was so brave to fight the society. I couldn't figure out this conflict when I was little, because kid only knows hero and heroine should be together.

I enjoyed this re-imagining but it was just okay - not great. The acting was mediocre - the sets and special effects were good and the make-up was of course spectacular.What really lets it down is the plot. For example, in the original film the human slaves couldn't speak, reinforcing the fact that the apes saw them as savages. When Taylor (Charlton Heston) spoke, it was a potent weapon against the apes' prejudice - the fact that he had language and thus cognitive abilities shook their entire belief system. In this movie the humans are chatting away normally which lessens the importance of Davidson's (Mark Whalberg) arrival.And could somebody please tell me what the point of the blond woman was? Sure she is beautiful, but her character just felt tacked onto the plot to provide some eye candy.I found the ending to be a big let down - again it was clumsily stuck into the film to provide that twist in the tail. It just didn't feel like it was part of the story, but more of an afterthought.Despite my criticism, I enjoyed the movie. There's some great action scenes and hey - it's Planet of the Apes!

            "content": "Well, it turned out as I expected: visual overload but nothing else added to the original. What did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick. Initially this awoke my interest, but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns (a) were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical Hollywood-like product and (b) made the whole storyline improbable! The 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward, and included no time-storms or any bogus of that sort: it just stated that when you come home after a long journey, things might have changed a bit. Earth might have fallen in the hands of apes, for example. Like many 'old' movies, it's main ingredient was suspense (hell, does anyone understand that word these days?). In this Burton movie, an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie, but at what cost? Surely, the images are overwhelming, and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape-culture (even ape-music!), but what's wrong?First, the suspension of disbelief is made very hard, because the apes have a lot of Hollywood-human traits. I refer especially to Ari and the slave-trader. These traits include emotional skills like irony, sarcasm, and an overtly displayed array of 'subtle' emotions. It makes you forget that the apes are apes, which is essential.Second, the humans TALK. Of course, we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak, but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didn't made the ape/human role-switching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version. The wound in the throat that Charlton Heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that Dr. Zira has in him (so, no need for things like human rights activists or ape-human love in order to explain things).Third, the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility, but is a necessary twist in the new movie, since Capt. Davidson has to play the Hollywood-let's-save-the-whole-world- and-have-a-good-ending-for-everyone- and-still-make-it-to-the-lounge-bar- for-a-cool-diet-coke character. Oh my god, will they never learn? I new it from the start, when there was only one guy who got lost! They were in need of a hero! And then the script writers go on reasoning: we need one guy... so, why would one guy get lost... because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm... implausible! But it's necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes! Since, in these modern and politically correct times, we can't have a xenophobic ape-hater like Charlton Heston's 68 character loose on the screen: let's give them a bubblegum version!Fourth, okay, the general twist of the original 'discovering the truth' of the 1968 film to the modern version (he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab-apes developed their society, where Heston simply discovered that just, somehow, the apes overtook the earth while he was away) is nicely done. The second, battle-part comes as an anti-climax. That's because this movie has added the first two Planet Of The Apes movies in one plot. Nice try, but the chill you feel when Davidson and you discover that he's lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battle-part.Fifth: the ending!!! For chrissakes, who came up with that?! (a) Davidson crashes TWICE with his escape pod, which seems an unsteerable object, while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully? Come on, who'd believe that? If the pods are really small space crafts (Davidson simply flies off into space at the end) and not merely escape vessels, he might have managed a safe landing at least once, no? And what about that ending???? I mean, in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth. But here: the whole movie takes place on a distant planet, and suddenly the same (there's a Thade statue) ape culture is on earth??? How come? Did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically, flew into the time storm and colonised earth before Davidson's mission took off? Why is Thade worshiped? Stupid stupid stupid.Helena Bonham Carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape, but I'd expected no less. I preferred her ape above Estella Warren as a human, but maybe I got some loose wire in my head. Nevertheless, the only convincing apes were Tim Roth as Thade (wonderful!) and Ari's household ape (the ex-general, but I forgot his name).Nonono, a lot of things could and should have been added/altered to the 1968 pic, but not the plot, at least not in that way. It was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining. It was nicely tongue-in cheek and caricatured. Don't stylize everything...",

Also the characters have less charm, humor and coolness that came with the first one; Wahlberg has nearly no emotions in scenes that parallel the ones in the first, and I can see why Heston is now Sir Heston.Only things to possibly watch for- a hilarious cameo from Sir Charleton Heston himself (I'd just as well sneak in the film for that one scene again), makeup that nearly matches the first one, although the first one was a breakthrough, and some OK visual effects.  Some Die-hard Burton fans will find some use here (once in a while it gave a thrill or two), but other than that, keep your damn paws off of this damn, dirty film!  Between C- and D+",

So I finally see it and when I came out of the theater I was very surprised about the ending it made me wonder like most people, but I won't say any more don't want to spoil it. Tim burton has done again just like with all of his other movies he has made in the past this one i think tops them all in my opinion his movies are in a eyecandy way oh and don't let me forget about the great Danny Elfman his music it so great I bought the soundtrack the next day, but I must say it's better then the original I mean Rick Baker did such a fantastic job on the make-up you would sometimes forget that those are actors up their with all this make-up on. I know that some people wouldn't agree but i hope that there is another Planet of The Apes so to speak sequel I would only see it only if Tim Burton direct's it. Well I must give this movie a 10/10 it's by far the best movie I've seen all summer long.",

The same thing at the ending because there couldn't possibly be evenough fuel and oxygen left in that small vessel for the 'final trip'. The main battle was also a dissapointment because 'the plan' didn't make much sense, it didn't work, and choppy editing at times.

Burton delivers his usual chuzpah in his own dark and twisted way, and his long time friend, Danny Elfman delivers one of his best scores ever.

            "content": "Yet another Hollywood attempt at cashing in on a proven franchise, Tim Burton's supposed \"re-imagining\" of the 1968 sci-fi classic Planet of the Apes is a dreadfully dull, meandering affair, which consistently fails to engage the viewer on any meaningful level. Sure, it tries to live up to the lofty social-political commentary of the original, but here there's nothing to back it up-- the plot is shallow, the dialogue lame and the characters are so underdeveloped we can hardly recall their names.\nFor example, near the end of the film, a human boy stands up to his ape oppressors in what I assume was meant to be a moving moment. But it has little impact because the character has never been properly introduced; the scene is the first in which he figures prominently. Similarly, two Ape generals square off at one point in what is clearly intended as a battle between two giants. But the set-up for their feud is so scant (the bland line of dialogue inserted earlier in the film) that the pay-off is virtually non-existent. They fight, one wins...whoopee.Characters like these appear throughout the film. The lead female human seems to exist solely for her cleavage; Kris Kirstofferson appears as a human male who does almost nothing and who, like his counterparts mentioned above, engages in a Big Moment that fails to have any impact. It's hard to feel bad for human slaves who are this dull. As for the apes, they're so one-dimensional they're better described as types than as actual characters. Most notably, there's the evil general (played with wonderful vitriol by Tim Roth), who seems to simply hate all humans, period. His behavior is entirely one-note: he stomps about, growls and acts viciously at every opportunity, and almost always without sufficient motivation. As a villain he's about as interesting as Skeletor was in the old He-Man cartoon. Likewise, Helena Bonham Carter's character, an ape with a soft spot for humans, is little more than a caricature of good will.Finally, the lead character, played by Mark Wahlberg, walks through the film in an apparent daze. Never does he seem amazed by this monkey planet he's landed on, nor does he appear distraught by the predicament in which he's found himself. Charlton Heston's lead character in the original POTA film may have been over-the-top in places, but he at least struck the right notes of paranoia, amazement and outrage. By comparison, Wahlberg seems drugged; and this is a problem because we're supposed to be seeing this world, at least in part, through his eyes. Recall the introductory portions of the original POTA, in which the team of wayward astronauts slowly makes their way into Ape territory. Their journey becomes stranger and stranger as they encounter human skins, a tribe of primitive humanoids, and finally the fully-clothed warrior apes. Never does this new film approach this level of horror and amazement. Instead, its protagonist runs through its world like a blip in a video game. And that's a shame.On the good side, Rick Baker's makeup is, on the whole, extraordinary; Danny Elfman's score is rich and bombastic; and the physicality of the ape characters' performances are fun in that they are much more simian in nature than those featured in the 1968 original. But even fans of Tim Burton will have a hard time finding his personal stamp on this film.\nAnd what of the surprise ending? It's there, and it's fun. But it feels tacked on and most viewers will probably figure it out a minute or so before it actually happens.If you really want to enjoy this movie, go buy the action figures. That's the point, right?",

            "content": "Reinventing a classic film is one thing, but if you're going to remake something beloved by film fans worldwide, do it for a reason. This Planet of the Apes reboot brings little to nothing new to the series with a brutally dull outcome.Look, it's easier said than done. Remakes and reboots have a lot of pressure and usually wind up being a waste of time. But there was serious potential here. With Tim Burton coming off a few solid films with Johnny Depp and box office success with Batman, you'd think he would have a grapple on what to do with the Apes franchise. Sadly, it was the exact opposite.The original 1968 classic was thought provoking and lead to a couple really well done sequels, but Burton's take is disappointingly more creepy and awkward than it is cerebral. I'm sorry, but I just don't care for seeing Mark Wahlberg have a strange romantic relationship with a female ape. Or, rather, an equally dull relationship with a human, played by Estella Warren. No chemistry between the two, whatsoever.But there are a few redeemable qualities surprisingly. Instead of a massive Statue of Liberty reveal at the end, Burton makes a few middle act changes that actually benefit the story in the long run. Having the very cause of the apes taking over earth being due to Wahlberg's mistake was interesting, but I'm just not sure it was earned. Something else that wasn't earned is the entire third act. Talk about an atrocious piece of mess, the third act tries to propose so many ideas and take twists and turns that it just all feels tiresome. Unfortunately, by the time the big battle comes around, you just don't care.It's easy to look at a film in hindsight and say it shouldn't have been made, but seriously, this Apes entry should not have been made. It wasn't yet the time where visual effects offered up the opportunity to do great motion capture or picture perfect-looking Apes (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 2014) and using old make-up was the wrong choice. It's nice for the 60's but using it in 2001 is a completely different entity. But the main problem is that the characters and story are second to an attempt to build out impressive set pieces. Tim Roth's one-note villain and the film's choice for romances make for one brutal viewing.+Some interesting subtle changes-Lack of reinvention-Awkward romances-No reason for 2001 to be the time for a remake4.6/10",

He instead walk as if it's his daily road to work and not once do you get a sense that they are being chased. There's a scene where all the soldiers are ready to march and at the last minute the general played by Tim Roth, gets called away because his father is dying. Yes it was perhaps a pivotal scene (which isn't saying much as there aren't any pivotal scenes) but why place it just before marching off? The movie is just not worth watching. Really watch the original if for nothing else than the famous lines by Heston.And for those of you who think the makeup is good...well...maybe I've gotten accustomed to better things because I was not impressed. I mean...The Lord of the Rings had way better makeup than this one, and they premiered at roughly the same time. No, watch the original or if you want the more modern take on the franchise go watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes - now THAT'S an epic movie largely because of an excellent Andy Serkis.",

Apparently, Burton decided to do this commentary at the very last minute, and, have no doubt, the spontaneous accounts from the fevered mind of Tim Burton are something to behold. It truly gives you an idea of the intricacies that went into crafting each scene of this visual feast.Some highlights from the commentary include Burton talking about what it was like to work with real apes. He said, 'you get this weird vibe from having a relationship with apes. There's a definite connection between humans and apes but its weird, so primal, and so shocking.' Burton's comments reminded me of what Michael Aped, director of Gorilla's in the Mist, had said about working with apes. He said there were many times when he thought there was a real person staring at him and when he turned to see who it was, it had been an ape. He said the experience was eerie, yet fascinating.Burton also talked a lot about this idea of his version of Planet of the Apes being a circular thing. About everything coming back to the beginning or the middle or something. I couldn't quite understand fully what he was talking about, however, it reminded me of Joni Mitchell's Circle of Life song. Oh well,...a creative mind like Tim Burtons is not to be completely understood, only enjoyed.Anyway, the movie is great and Tim Burton's commentary makes the DVD spectacular.",

            "content": "Absolutely the worst film yet by Burton, who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs.  A miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film.  This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shout out \"he's lost his gun!\" or whatever it is to let everybody know.  Carter is really awful and so is Wahlberg, who can't play this straight and be convincing.  Very nice effects and photography, but poor music in the John Williams mold by Burton's crony Elfman.  Heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch-phrases from the first movie.  Very poor results.If anyone else out there also saw \"Sleepy Hollow\", they will probably have noticed, as I have, the declining quality of Burton's films.  I've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was brought in as director, in which case his judgement should be questioned. But I think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; the evidence is there in the films.  In \"Sleepy Hollow\", he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of british character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film (those are never scary, as horror fans know).  The movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to smooth the two together.  \"Planet of the Apes\" is much the same way, and the result comes off more like \"Total Recall\" or \"Tango and Cash\" than like sci-fi.  He's also fallen into the rut of so many other \"big\" directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience.  Word to Burton, if you're out there -- pick something and do it straight, or use some style to peice it all together (as in \"Mars Attacks\" or \"Beetlejuice\") or you might as well retire, because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going.",

When this movie was announced I was very interested in the way this remake would re-actualize this movie.Let's be short about this: They didn't.Not only didn't they translate the original into something current audiences would relate to, they also used some lines without giving it any relevance to the rest of the new story. At some point General Thade is warned about the dangers of humans...about their inherent violent nature and such. In the original this was caused by the key-event responsible for apes-taking-over, namely the nuclear war. In this new remake this warning has NO basis in the story at all!

Not only were the films pleasing on an aesthetic level, but I was better able to appreciate the complex political subtext that had been inserted by Rod Serling and later screenwriters. These are angry, intelligent films, which in many ways, despite diminishing budgets, get better as the series progresses. The revolutionary implications of the fourth film, Conquest (its climax was modeled after the Watts riots), were so extreme that the studio forced a re-shoot of the ending, which originally had Caesar (played with amazing Shakespearean grandeur by Roddy McDowell) leading a final slaughter of the hopelessly debased human population.How can a film over two hours long contain so little? There is not one good line, there is not one good SHOT in the entire remake. Given Tim Burton's track record, I expected at the very least a memorable visual experience. Instead we get a dim bluish murk, clunky editing, and shoddy, oppressive studio-bound sets. The oh-so-clever 'relevant' dialog wouldn't pass muster on a lackluster episode of Politically Incorrect, and the 'shock' ending is just completely incomprehensible. Also, why did they make Helena Bonham Carter's ape character look like Michael Jackson?In 1968, Chuck Heston, as the misanthropic astronaut Taylor, ran around in a loin cloth, bared his ass, and roared bitter imprecations in his great, gravely voice. Now Mark Walberg (the new Cary Grant, according to Vanity Fair - go figure) keeps his bulky, restrictive space suit on for the entire film, and DOES NOT EVEN BOTHER TO ACT. His voice never rises above a whisper. His facial expression never changes. Well, that routine only works when you have charisma to spare. Had I been casting this film, it would have been Bruce Willis all the way. He would have known how to empathize with an ape.How sad that the three-dimensional characters of the original series have been reduced to platitudinous stereotypes; or that the story is now nothing more than 'heroic astronaut liberates oppressed humans from evil monkeys'; or that, had I not read the reviews ahead of time, I would not have known who played the apes (in the old days they put distinctive voices under the make-up: McDowell, Kim hunter, Paul Williams, John Huston).

The Holes - If they descended from the original space station and the only animals they had on board were chimpanzees. Where did the horses, gorilla's, orangutans & parrots come from? The worm hole?

He's trapped on a planet (not Earth of the future as in the original) where apes rule over humans.  He tries to find a way home.The visuals are impressive--visually Burton knows how to direct. Unfortunately, he's never been very good with scripts and actors. That is painfully clear here.  The script moves slowly and the dialogue is comic book level.  The acting is pretty bad too with the sole exception of Helena Bonham Carter as a kind scientist ape.  Tim Roth as an evil ape scowls all the time and throws tantrums--it's not funny or cute or scary--just dull. And Wahlberg is truly terrible in the lead.  His character is so passive and accepting--a total wimp.  At least Heston's character in the original had some edge--Wahlberg has nothing.The makeup on the apes is good, a definitive improvement over the original. Also there's a good score by Danny Elfman and a terrific battle sequence at the end, but it's too little too late.  So, I give it a 6 for the visuals, Carter and the score.

It was right at the time the starship of the movie's hero landed in the strange land. And I told him that yes, more or less, at this point, the movies were pretty much the same. Right there and then, similarities just vanished. The starship of this new version landed, and then the new version began to orbit around the old one, as tough admiring its excellency, but never getting into its atmosphere. The thing is that this new movie remind me of the old one over and over again, not because the latter is revived, but because its essence completely absent, and I missed it. Where the original gave us a science fiction story with RATIONAL twists of imagination, the new one develops as a succession of events that happen just because somebody said so. And when things happen just because they have to, the wonder of science fiction disappears, and we are left with a boring movie. And I heard about the `surprise' ending before I saw the movie. It is surprising, all right, but for the wrong reasons. Just when you think that nothing could be worse, well, it does. At this point, the new version just decides to give up the orbiting and finally heads for the space of oblivion. This ending leaves interrogations, not about the argument, but more like `What was Tim Burton trying to accomplish with that?'. I admire the fact that Tim Burton wanted to do something different, not just copying the original version. I mean, he dared to go against the odds and try and build something new inspired by a true classic. But as expected, he has only shown, once again, that you better don't mess with classics of that caliber.",

            "content": "'Planet of the Apes' was originally made in 1968 and turned out to be a box office smash, despite a rather limp plot and none too subtle allusions to the racial problems wracking America. It went on to spawn a number of weaker sequels and a short-lived TV show with ever decreasing results.Having said that, any of them have to be better than this luke-warm effort from Tim Burton. The studio was clear that this was not a sequel or remaking of the first film, it was a 're-imagination' - but it is quite clear that imagination is one thing missing from this movie.As with almost all big studio movies in 2001, the plot has been released back into the wild and is noticeable by its absence. To make up for this oversight the movie lurches from set-piece to set-piece throwing off any semblance of thought and coherence. Rather than have a plot, the movie sets up all sorts of gimmicks to get the heroes out of difficult situations. Mark Wahlberg has a gun in his survival kit, uses it to scare off some hostile apes. But two minutes later the gun is destroyed - oh no, what will they do now? No problems, right at the end of the movie ANOTHER gun is introduced from thin air to help out the heroes. Why not just keep the first one, or not have a gun at all?Instead of having the heroes, (or heaven forbid), the audience think, the movie always plays dumb. The climax is set in a ruined space ship that has been sitting in the desert for thousands of years. This ship (a hugely impressive set) has rusted through almost entirely, collapsed in places and is filled with sand. Yet little tiny switches work first time, convenient doors open and close with satisfying swooshing noises and there are video clips to explain the plot to the hard of thinking. There is simply no magic to the film, no satisfaction in working it out for yourself.And when its not playing dumb, it has gaps in the logic that make you go 'eh'? For instance, if the apes and the humans are both only on this deserted planet because of a crashed space ship, where did the horses come from?Is there anything worth seeing? Yes, Tim Roth's performance *IS* excellent, he does convince you that he is playing an ape and has a fine time chewing the scenery in the finest pantomime tradition. This is helped by some truly astonishing prosthetics used on his face. The rest of the ape designs are less successful, particularly Helena Bonham Carter's mask which is so thick and expressionless that she looks like a Muppet and forces her to talk with an irritating lisp.But if there is one thing that sums up all that is wrong with the film it is Estella Warren - beautiful, blond and completely and utterly pointless. Long lingering shots are devoted to her pouting and flicking her hair, but she does nothing else. Perhaps it's my age I couldn't help but think of Raquel Welch in 'One Million Years BC', but at least she had the decency to be chased by a dinosaur, Ms. Warren just stands in the background like a sulky teenager appealing to the teenage demographic. Perhaps I'm being too hard on her, because she does provide a tiny glimpse of hope for humanity. Apes may well be ascendant, mankind is reduced to savagery and the whole edifice of Western civilisation has come tumbling down but thanks to Estella Warren we know there is a bright future for orthodontistry, a girl can be sure of a fabulous leg wax and there is no shortage of non-smear lip gloss. A planet run by apes doesn't sound quite so bad now does it?",

Although it has vastly different bookends to the 1968 original (in which respect it is, perhaps, closer to Pierre Boulle's original novel) it treads broadly similar grounds in terms of a spaceman from Earth whose arrival disrupts ape society in a big way.There is much to savour. There are quite a number of very well-known faces which you don't see because they are covered in ape makeup. That ape makeup, and the ape physicality of the actors, are both fantastic, and far superior to their 1968 equivalent. And Tim Roth's chimpanzee General Thade is a stunning performance - very physical, and very intense. On the other hand Mark Wahlberg was not, at this point in his career, the right man to play the lead, Helena Bonham Carter's society gal chimp doesn't work visually, and the final twist scene is a downright cheat.The fact remains that although the remake is not a disaster by any means, the original didn't really need remaking. Even so, there is something poignantly pleasing at witnessing Charlton Heston, at the very end of his career, revisiting his classic line from 30-odd years earlier from the other side of the species divide.",

When remaking the 1960's classic, it created some ticket sales because of the original franchise. The trouble with this remake is that the golly-gee whiz special effects of today are put in as replacements for the original dramatic script of the past epic film.The result is definitely mixed, and skewed towards the lower end of the scale. The remake is so focused on using these new special effects, they create a new ending for this film which is truly horrible compared with the original Rod Sterling epic.The story of reverse evolution theory is classic with Ape evolving from man, and Tim Burton's legion of fans might get a kick out of this, but my take is to see the original. It tells the story better and is dominated by drama more than special effects.",

But I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, which was very entertaining and - if I recall correctly (although it's been many years since I read it) is more consistent with the story of Pierre Bouille's original novel. So, my advice is that if you're either avoiding this or watching it because you expect it to be like the \"Apes\" movies of thirty years ago, plan to watch it on its own merits instead.The cast was in general very good. Mark Wahlberg did a fine job as the astronaut Leo Davidson, stranded on this nightmare of a planet (for him) with no obvious way of getting home. Tim Roth as his primary ape antagonist, General Thade, was also very good. I had a mixture of reactions to Helena Bonham Carter's role as Ari, the human-loving ape. Her performance was quite good, but, frankly, I found her character to be rather irritating. It's a necessary role. We have to see these divisions in ape society, but the character just didn't appeal to me in the same way as, say, Cornelius and Zera did in the original movie. I also thought the ape makeup was rather weak. Frankly, they did a better job thirty years ago.But those minor criticisms aside, I really did enjoy this movie. It was a fast-paced story that held my attention, there was enough humour to make it fun, and enough drama to make me wonder how Davidson was ever going to get out of this. And - as I said at the start - the end itself is worth watching the whole movie.I rate this as an 8/10.",

I havent seen an actor do such a bad job in....well, ever actually. He has got the face of a robot, and less talent than one. And why does he make such a big difference in this world? He has got no charisma, he displays no leadership, he has trouble raising his voice, he delivers all of his lines with the same tone of voice and is generally as inspiring as a taxaccountant.

The visuals are obviously not as great as the more recent films due to technology and even so the story and content isn't as great.Now as a stand alone film, it is watchable and not as bad as some fans and critics are claiming. It could have been better with more humor and more lightheartedness. A lot of the hate for this film seems to stem from the fact that this remake wasn't necessary and that it's a downgrade from the original.Yes this film is strange and the plot doesn't go very far, as the pace is somewhat dragging at times. Much of the plot focus is Mark Wahlberg's character trying to escape from the Apes planet, doing so along with the help of other humans and some other apes.Not much of note left and the very ending was somewhat confusing. Where exactly was he? Did he not go back far enough in time? As a rewatch 11 07 21' opinions remain relatively same. This 2001 version pales far in comparison to the 2010's trilogy of the Planet of the Apes. Although watchable, this film is only decent. We can see why there wasn't a sequel to the film.",

So in that regard, the film fails.At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\". Here's how I would have written it:An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He's a rotten director inspite what of people think. He's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no. If anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.",

It's a true masterpiece because it said more about ourselves & society then any other movie, so when you try and remake it your really asking for trouble. The expectations would be so high that such a film would be doomed for failure, which is kinda what happened.I don't care what anyone says, it's always a bad idea to remake a classic like Planet of the apes, hell look what happened to Psycho! it's just better off not to be remade. Heres why this movie ultimately failed: For one thing this really doesn't fit directors Tim Burton's resume. Tim Burton has done masterpieces like Edward Scissor Hands, Sleepy Hollow, Nightmare Before Christmas, Big Fish, etc. So how does a Sci-Fi Action movie fit his bill? I give him credit for having the balls to try but come on! The Lead character (Mark Whalberg) was stupid, Shallow, Arrogant, and bone headed. Whalberg could never fill in the shoes of the late great Charlton Heston. Heston was Larger than Life, Whalberg is kinda annoying in this film. Besides him most of the acting is shallow & over the top. Seriously the dialogue is ridiculous, were the screen writers monkeys or something. The best performances by far were Tim Roth & Michael Clarke Duncan, they were the only bright spots in the film. I thought the Make up was fantastic and worthy of Oscar consideration but that's it for the positive's of this film.I've heard from many people who like this movie and say don't compare it with the original. Of course were gonna compare it to the freaking original! They both have the same titles and similar story what do you guys expect!? My problem is that there are many references to the original, but this film lacks any soul or message that the original had. The original made a serious political statement on society and where were going in the future. This remake is basically a way to cash in. It lacks any of the magic of the original, It doesn't take itself seriously, there are way too many moments of comic relief, The ending made no F*****g sense, and it's just totally forgettable.Planet of the apes probably should have never been remade. Perhaps with a different director, and definitely different writers, a Remake could have been meaningful. Unfortunately this film is a major disappointment, and is totally forgettable. 10 years from now we will still be talking about the original, and the remake will be largely forgotten.",

And some movies are bad because a director goes hopelessly out of control... pounding home his vision with the force of a gorilla's fist in an iron glove. Joining the ranks of \"Water World\", \"The Wild, Wild West\" and \"Battlefield Earth\", \"Planet Of The  Apes\" comes yelping and screaming to the screen as a comic book come to life. The trouble is, it doesn't know what it is. A science fiction thriller? A horror story? A comedy? High Camp? Unintentionally funny. Stilted. Stupefying. Kris Kristofferson is left hung out to dry as a sort of latter-day Tumak from \"One Million Years B.C.;\" loincloth-clad Estella Warren appears baffled throughout and although a love interest, has surprisingly little to do . Various human characters are introduced only to later stand around and gawk. Some great ape makeup is wasted on some of the sorriest, most hapless ape villains in movie history. Apes snarl. They grunt. They scream and jump on a planet that seems to have the gravitational pull of our moon...one blow will send an ape or human flying 20 feet into the air on obviously ill-concealed wire harnesses. We have comic(?) relief in the form of a Gilbert Gottfried patterned ape slave trader who is one moment sadistically brutal, the next moment a wise-cracking borscht-belt comedian who may be the most annoying movie character this side of Jar-Jar Binks.  Hero Mark Wahlberg makes one yearn for a real hero in the mold of a Charlton Heston or a Harrison Ford...his heroics consist of simply unfastening a few poorly locked chains and walking free. Couple all this with a some outlandish spacecraft wreckage that functions perfectly after 3,000 years and an army of 10,000 apes that inflicts absolutely no damage to its enemies and you have a turkey that defies description. Tim Burton slips on a Kong-Sized banana peel. A  stupendous, colossal, preposterous yawn.",

How did the clock in the mini-spacecraft know what year it is? You see the year quickly moving forward - on what signal or date is this based?2. In the original movie, the humans could not talk. This made it believable that the apes would treat humans like animals, because in our own world, animals do not talk. One of the biggest problems in this remake is that the humans CAN talk. This makes the idea that they would be treated like animals ridiculous. You can bet that if apes could speak English in our world, we probably wouldn't keep them in zoos, animal rights notwithstanding.3. How is it that a chimp is able to land a spacecraft but that a human crashes it TWICE?!4. How is that when Capt. Davidson (Wahlberg) lands on the planet, he enters it in the future, but when the main ship crashed on the same planet going after him, it was thousands of years in the PAST? Wouldn't the time be the same for both - after all, they are going through the same space-time distortion?5. It's never clearly explained how the chimps mutated to become apes, and intelligent, English speaking apes at that.6. How did those monkeys survive the blast unleashed on them from the crashed ship?7. Last but not least - that ending made no sense on any level whatsoever. How did the apes get from their planet to Earth and replace all the humans? And even if they did, the timeline would have been completely different. There wouldn't be anything like the Washington monument, the Lincoln statue or even Washington itself, because Earth would have been a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT place!Unfortunately, \"Apes\" is another in a long series of films by Burton that are visually appealing at times, but lack any kind of coherent plot.

But this ape film not only undercuts the original (while trying to look oh-so-much-more impressive), it also trivializes the novel by Pierre Boulle.Pierre Boulle's novel was a fable exploring the post-WWII problems of racism, nationalism, war and nuclear war. The world had already danced close to the brink of self-extermination in WWII: if we believe all the reports (and alas, there's no reason to doubt any of them), some 150 million people lost their lives during ten years of one major conflict after another, from the invasion of Manchuria and the Spanish Civil War to VJ day. That was a larger number than that of the population of the US at the time.Military-Industrial Complex profiteers notwithstanding, it became clear to intelligent people across the globe that ethnocentrism was not healthy for children and other living things, and it was a decent person's duty to say so as clearly and decisively as possible. \"Planet of the Apes\" may not be a great classic of literature, but it's no throwaway for a rainy day.To rip the heart and mind out of Boulle's story - well, what is the point? The world doesn't need yet another \"alternate universe\" comic book display of flexing ape muscle and tasteless jokes masquerading as wit. If all this is merely taking place in an \"alternate universe\", just so we can have a peek at a possible \"alternate universe\", then the \"adventure\" is nothing more than the protagonist's daydream.All we can do is shout \"Wake up!\" at protagonist and film-makers alike, and hope never to see such a self-indulgent waste of money on a theater screen again.",

            "content": "When I first saw Tim Burton's 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes, my first thought was of how it was totally different from the classic 1968 original. Other than a smattering of obvious character similarities, the ONLY similarity to that film that this remake has is that apes rule and humans are enslaved. Yet, while the original film's social commentary was enlightening and provocative, this remake's social commentary is done on a much more superficial, generic, flimsy level. It is nothing more than a \"summer action movie\", with no substance to speak of.Burton's basic premise is completely different from the original. Mark Wahlberg stars as astronaut Leo Davidson, who in the year 2029 defies orders and leaves his space station to save his test pilot chimpanzee, whose space pod gets lost in a cosmic storm. Davidson himself gets lost in the storm and ends up on a planet ruled by apes, gets captured, is enslaved, and embarks on a rescue attempt with several humans in order to find a way to get back home. The usually reliable Tim Roth plays General Thade, military leader of the apes and the great Helena Bonham Carter plays Ari, a scientist and \"humanitarian\", who hates the enslavement of humans. Ari joins Davidson in the rescue, which includes humans Karubi (played by the iconic Kris Kristofferson) and Daena (Estella Warren in an extremely bland and annoying performance).I find this remake to overall be very cheesy and one-dimensional. The only character that has any depth is the ape Ari (superbly played by Bonham Carter), faithfully playing homage to Kim Hunter's memorable Zira character from the 1968 movie, while sporting a unique portrayal of her own. Carter is such a great actress that she manages to overcome the flimsy material, but unfortunately, the other lead actors Wahlberg and Roth are failed by a by-the-numbers script. Wahlberg's Davidson isn't remotely compelling and doesn't have the stature of Charlton Heston's iconic astronaut Taylor from the 1968 film, who spoke for ALL humans! Davidson is rather uninspiring and selfish throughout the movie. And Roth's Thade is simply evil without any complexity.The worst character is Warren's Daena. It really doesn't help the film that Davidson is stuck with such a bland, blonde bimbo for the bulk of the it! Daena is obviously SUPPOSED TO BE like Linda Harrison's enchanting, beautiful Nova character from the 1968 movie, but I don't even think Warren is very attractive, much less enchanting. Harrison evoked more feeling and spoke to the viewer through pure emotion and expression than Warren did with TONS of dialog! But the biggest culprit as to why Burton's remake is a failure is that the premise and plot is utterly absurd. I know it's science fiction, but too many things in this movie just don't make any sense, especially the ending, which is ludicrous. Also, the movie has an obligatory, \"summer blockbuster movie\" comedy element that is rather unsettling, as if Burton isn't even taking the film seriously. The dialog is generally silly, including borrowing a famous, powerful line from the 1968 film and turning it into a joke. The ape planet settings looks very cheesy and fake, like a costume drama. The climax is the typical summer action fare.Unfortunately for Burton, this remake was really the beginning of his downfall as a director (discounting Mars Attacks, as he rebounded successfully after that one and I honestly only ever saw that movie once, recalling it so bad that I vowed never to watch it again!), as virtually every film he did after and including \"Planet of the Apes\" was a remake of a prior classic film, and so far, NONE of them have been well-received or successful.

He also wars with the various tribes of apes, to deliver the promised land of equality to all... or some such thing. There's the chimp god from the stars, too.It's an entirely unwarranted remake. Although the makeup and CGI effects are OK, I, at least, had no desire to see an attractive, talking, super-intelligent chimpanzee, such as Helena Bonham Carter's Ari.

At the end of the 1968 original, astronaut Charlton Heston, having crashed on the Planet of the Apes after a long space journey and having escaped from its inhabitants, the partly civilised Apes, wanders along a beach and discovers lying in the sand the head from the Statue of Liberty. He realises that he had crashed back on Earth, where the human race had managed to nearly wipe themselves out with a nuclear war, thus setting the stage for the rise of the Apes. The sight of the statute was one of the most chilling moments I have experienced in the cinema.At the end of this version, Marky the astronaut, after sorting out the politics of the neo-medieval ape-human divide, flies off from the planet into the electro-magnetic storm nearby to try to get back to Earth. His instruments show him going back in time, and he crash-lands in a familiar looking Washington, DC, right outside the Lincoln Memorial. The only trouble is, Lincoln seems to have turned into Tim Roth. . Marky's instruments must have been wrong. The only possible explanation is we have gone into the future again. It seems that the Apes have triumphed over humanity despite Marky's efforts \u2013 but so what? Evolutionary biologists point out that no dominant species has ever produced its successor. Our successors may well be descended from apes, dolphins, or even cockroaches (if we ever do have a nuclear holocaust). In short, there was no punch in the punch-line. In a few billion years' time the Earth is going to go up in flames when the sun explodes; the apes, or cockroaches are welcome to it.I quite liked Helena Bonham-Carter as the kind-hearted liberal-minded ape Ari. While you should never confuse the background of actors with their roles there is something cosmically appropriate in the casting. Her great-grandfather H H Asquith was a leading British liberal politician in the early part of last century and prime minister (1908-16). She is a 'limousine liberal', but as Seinfeld says, 'there's nothing wrong with that'. It's what you do that counts, not where you come from.I also love the confidence shown in technology when it's apparently possible to fire up the spaceship's engines and get a tolerably good picture on the control panel TV monitor thousands of years after it has crashed \u2013 maker's name please!",

            "content": "Warning! May contain spoilers.What I have always found incredibly funny and yet at the same time downright scary about us as human beings is our ability to be so stupid and so cruel at the same time.  We are the best at cruelty.  As far as I know, we are the only species that hunts for sport and kills for pleasure.  Everything else in the animal kingdom does so for it's very survival.  When lions hunt gazelle, it is to feed their young or to feed themselves.  Even the fearsome and loathed Great White Shark hunts and kills for it's very survival.  But human beings are nothing but charlatan when it comes to our apparent benevolence.  Not all of us of course, but a good majority of us.  Even myself, who I consider to be somewhat of an animal lover, will go out and eat the latest slaughtered cow from the supermarket and I can justify that because in mind, that cow has been killed more humanely than a pig ( which I will not eat, have you ever seen the way a pig is killed at a Portuguese barbecue, well it is even worse when it is killed for mass consumption ). Human beings are not magnanimous in the least.  We take what we desire, not what is necessary.  That makes us gluttonous and that is unacceptable.  But no one does anything about it because we are used to living the way that we do and for some reason, we have laws and human rights for criminals ( including rapists, murderers, child molesters and arsonists).  But we have very little regard for our next meal and how it dies.  Doesn't anyone else out there think it is inhumane to boil a live animal before you eat it? Well?I begin this review of Planet of the Apes with this sanctimonious \"holier than thou\" sermon because I think this film and the writers do think about these things.  Planet of the Apes is a great action film and has some outstanding special effects but the core of the film is one that is perhaps overlooked.  This is a film about man's comeuppance and what would happen if another species could do to us what do to them.  Battlefield Earth, as awful as it was, touched briefly on this subject matter.  Instinct, the under-rated film starring Anthony Hopkins was also critical of man and our abuse of not only this planet but the inhabitants of it.  See also the Matrix and even Free Willy.  Sometimes movies come out and have outlandish theories and sometimes they thrive at the box office.  This is going to be one of those films.  But people do not often advocate change after they see these films.  They makes hundreds of millions of dollars but that is all they do.  They entertain.  But maybe films like this are about more than entertainment.  Maybe there is a message that Burton and company want us to hear.  Maybe what we are watching is not just about entertainment.\nSpoilers ahead!!!What was fascinating about this film is that the theory that it subscribes to is that this ape world would not have gotten as bad as it did if it wasn't for human beings.  When captain Leo Davidson ( Mark Wahlberg ) lands on this distant planet, he travels through time hundreds of years.  He is immediately thrust into a chase involving humans and super intelligent and herculian apes.  He is captured and brought to their camp and here he learns that the world has been ruled by the apes for years now.  He can't understand this because not an hour earlier he was on a his ship that used animals to try and figure out complex problems and to basically use them as guinea pigs.  When there is a dangerous mission to embark on, they would send out the monkeys first to see what the danger was.  If the monkey did not survive the ordeal, then their human soldiers would not go.  So this is a great shock to Davidson.  When he asks the humans how the monkeys got like this, they don't understand what he means.  To them, it has always been like this.The apes, lead by Thade and his right hand ape, Colonel Attar, rule with an iron fist and want to rid the planet of the humans.  They enslave them and put them to work.  But there are human rights activists that think the ethical treatment of humans should be advocated by all so for now the humans are allowed to live.  But most of them live on the outskirts of the world, cowered in little huts or caves and living like rats.  There is great detail that goes into reversing the fortunes of man as we are used as pets.  We are chained up at night and kept in cages and it is even a far fetched theory for the apes to believe that we have souls.  Humans are also branded like horses and are forced to wear the mark.  This is a little like Naziism but more like humanism.Aside from all of the politics of the film, it has to be said that it is a treat to watch strictly from an entertainment form.  Burton never lets us down with the action sequences and the team of art directors, costume designers and make-up artists should be nominated for Oscars this year. Rick Baker leads the team of make-up artists and his work here is absolutely incredible.  Actors, and that is plural, meaning hundreds of actors, spent six hours in the make-up chair ever day.  But it pays off as the apes look fantastic.  Michael Clarke Duncan was the most impressive to me.  He transformed wonderously into Attar and even though it is not the kind of performance that you would say is Oscar material, it certainly is fun to watch.  Others that should get mentioned for their work is costume designer Colleen Atwood.  She too should be remembered at Oscar time.  The set decorators, Rosemary Brandenburg and Peter Young, created a wonderfully dark and sinister home for the apes from the ground up.  It is truly remarkable to see the village and realize that it was once nothing but a vision on some scrap piece of paper.Planet of the Apes is an excellent film in all areas.  It is entertaining, action packed, littered with humour and it is a great summer film.  It is actually the perfect pastiche of a summer film.  It has all the ingredients. But to me it is much more.  This is a smart film and it has a little more on it's mind that just talking monkeys.  It would be interesting to see a film like this produce more than just hundreds of millions of dollars for 20th Century Fox.  It would be nice to see someone out there take a film like this and truly re-examine how we are to the species that we depend upon and for our very survival and abuse in the process.  It would be interesting, but impossible.  After all, we are human.8.5 out of 10",

The twist of Leo being indirectly responsible for the apes creation and domination over humans yet also being directly responsible for getting apes and humans to live in peace is genius.  I'm very curious as to how exactly the apes got smarter and stronger.

The story is flat with no real tension created in line with most of the characters. Mark Wahlberg is a dull paleface astronaut and Tim Roth is great, unfortunately his character is so foreseeable it adds little to an already poor suspense.The beginning is neither creative nor tense and the subsequent chase scene is hardly impressive. Two points that could have been easily improved from the original. Hence the film is never working so as to have you get into it. The novel was a good material to make something different if not better. I do think a human massacre as the one right after the chase described by Pierre Boule would have helped to write a good scene. And seal the audience right in! Unfortunately the lazy penbums focused on how to match the 1968 version's ending so they only read the very end of the book. And they adapted it to issue an ending halfway between the book and the Schaffner film.(spoiler ahead) Halfway is never the right way (sat half-buttocks between two chairs as we say in French) and the Burton ending looks more like a quick way for him to get to an end with such a painful script. Burton reportedly shot 5 different endings (to pack the DVD with some supposedly creative stuff). Eventually they decided to stuck that one. It's all the less clear and eludes the fact that to impress audiences in the end it should at least be easily understood. So it only aims to revive the image of general Thade (as for King Scorpion in the Mummy) for a possible sequel. With the Abe Thade Memorial the explanation lies somewhere in the imagination of some scriptwriting genius.Be right back next season and we'll let you know if Marky Mark is to mary Ari or to go damned with Daena.

Yes, I am essentially a purist so for me if you find an equation that works don't mess with it! At least not much...this version simply did not have any of the magic, the wonder that was in every minute of the 1968 masterpiece. It felt like a pasted together puzzle of several story lines. Chimps are taught to fly souped up space pods for exploration, space storm captures pod with chimp inside, \"handler\" goes frantic and takes another pod to rescue chimp and gets sucked in to a space warp. OK, that's story one. Story two: chimp handler exits space warp and lands hard on \"Earth\", only to run into a Super chimp raiding party hunting humans as pets and workers...OK OK, so that is a sorta direct clone of the original. But the remaining 90% of the film is a third story of the handler being befriended by a \"cute\" female chimp who sympathizes, then she helps him free the oppressed humans. They fight a mini-war with thousands of war apes led by a deranged chimp general, and at the last second we have \"missing chimp\" arrive in his pod and all the warring apes bow down to \"missing chimp\" who just happens to resemble their God ape from antiquity...well, that takes you up to the last five minutes of the flick, which turns into a misguided attempt at irony.

The special apes that don't follow these ideologies are the good sensitive beings.

While the ending of the original (and far better) Planet of the Apes was integral to the story, the surprise in this new version has that unmistakeable \"tacked on\" feel.  It comes out of nowhere, goes nowhere, and does not make sense at all.  It is as if the film makers wanted a visual surprise ending for no other reason than that the original had one, but that they didn't want to put very much thought into creating it.That is the overriding problem with this movie.  It goes for the easy sell visual, without putting any thought behind it.  As a result, it is only good for shutting off your brain for two hours.  If that's all you want from a movie, go for it.",

            "content": "Remakes are a hazardous business. Shown not least by all the completely wasted remakes floating around out there. And it seems remakes are all the rage today, considering how many movies are actually based on previous works. Right now the Asian industry is the one being plagued the worst by this trend.When it comes to unnecessary remakes i would have to rate this 2001 remake of the classic \"Planet of the apes\" as one of the foremost. This version of the movie is not without it's qualities, but in general it's a step down from the original in many ways. The social pathos is more or less completely removed, replaced instead with a focus on action and comedy. While the original movie commented on segregation in society and the arbitrary treatment of certain groups as lower standing, this movie doesn't deal with the themes at all. Of course there is a general discussion going on through the movie, and a tension between liberal and conservative powers, but it never feels like more than window dressing.The qualities here lie mostly in the sure-handed visual style that is director Tim Burtons hallmark. The effects as well as the set designs are top notch, as is the sound and music. The acting leaves a mixed impression. Tim Roth is quite astounding as the evil ape commander Thade, Mark Wahlberg is his usual pale self as the protagonist. The acting from the rest of the cast is decent enough.The qualities of this remake fall tragically short of making up for it's weaknesses. I feel that a remake should always have something new to offer if there is to be a point in remaking a movie in the first place. Not only does this movie have nothing new to offer, it even deducts many of the points of the original. And that makes this one of the most pointless, and even degrading, remakes ever. I rate it 3/10 for the entertainment it still provides despite it's obvious weaknesses as a remake.",

However, the script is seriously lacking pace in the first half hour and the ending is an abomination! One of the worst movie endings in years. Doesn't stand a chance in comparison with the ending in the first Planet of the Apes. After the slow beginning, the movie builds up nicely to a final battle scene, which is great, but that ending... My, my... What a mistake.In a fine cast (though Mark Wahlberg is a bit boring) Tim Roth is certainly the stand-out. He delivers a great performance as Thade.In short, an entertaining sci-fi adventure which is let down by a silly ending and a slow start.

Burton does well to convey the Wahlberg character's sense of desolation after crashing on the planet and an interesting subplot ensues, involving Helena Bonham Carter's ape character and the attempt to escape from their masters. Tim Roth is absolutely outstanding as the general - you won't see a more expressive pair of eyes! The love triangle element with Estella Warren's character (what a beauty!) is also fairly well handled.The film simmers along nicely for the first half and then completely degenerates towards the end. The first absurdity is when (*SPOILERS AHEAD*)Wahlberg's monkey jets in and stops the battle - the scene just looked silly, it did not look like it could turn the tide of the battle...then later the henchmen (sorry henchapes!) of the general capitulate too quickly without really being convinced.And the \"twist\" ending was just well...incomprehensible I thought...another writer here said he found it easy to understand because it was a take on the original film's ending....but for someone like me who hasn't seen the original, I just thought - huh?

After crash landing they are enslaved by ape warriors. Ending is a laughable mess that makes one wonder whether Tim Burton is losing his touch. This is not the superb work he demonstrated with Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow. Wahlberg delivers one of his worst performances as this space captain thrust into a constant ass kicking by apes. Helena Bonham Carter plays a female ape who has compassion on him. Unfortunately that compassion boarders heavily on bestiality. It is disturbing watching these two ogle each other. Tim Roth plays a heavy tempered ape who just wants to use Wahlberg as a trampoline. Michael Clarke Duncan plays a humungous warrior ape because this is what we all call type casting. Paul Giamatti plays an orangutan meant for comic effect but the joke is on him. The makeup effects and visual elements are about the only aspect worth going ape over.

Tim Burton has made some great films -- Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow. He also made some turkeys in Batman Returns and Mars Attacks! Put Planet of the Apes down as another turkey, one of his worst.This movie is billed as of the Sci-Fi Action genre, but there is little science in it. We are supposed to believe that a chimp and later Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) flies through a cosmic storm and is instantaneously transported through time into the future. Not only that, the ship that tries to save the insubordinate Davidson ends up crash landing on the same planet but in the present time. They were carrying a cage full of chimpanzees and one of them starts a colony on the planet. Some of the humans who survived start a human species, but yet on this future parallel world, for some unexplainable reason the chimpanzees evolve faster and become masters over the humans. The air and water is equal to that of our own Earth but mysteriously the planet was uninhabited before.Given the chance, Burton can make some great character driven and imaginative movies such as Batman, Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. In Apes, he doesn't have a chance with the poorly written script and weak direction. The movie instead focuses more on the action and we don't see a buildup of Wahlberg's character except towards the end. Other characters are introduced, but there are few connections with the audience. Helen Bonham Carter's performance as Ari is worthy, but we don't know exactly why she feels a connection to humans enough to risk losing her life. Kris Kristofferson is there to be killed off. Tim Roth does a creditable job as the angry and malevolent General Thade, one of the descendants of first chimpanzees on the planet. Both Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa are good as Attar, General Thade's friend and trusted warrior Krull who is Attar's foil and Ari's guard.The cinematography, set designs, and technical aspects of the movie are fabulous. Rick Baker and Colleen Atwood does superb and remarkable work as the make up and costumes. Danny Elfman, who won an award for the Batman score, does a fantastic job again with Apes. This was a big budget picture and money was well spent in these areas.The ending made no sense whatsoever. If you get that far, suffice it to say the final scene looked as if it was added just so there would be some storyline in order to make a sequel.

So I decided not to see it. Another friend of mine who hadn't seen the movie yet, advised me to watch it in spite of this because `a Tim-Burton-movie is still a Tim-Burton-movie'. I decided to do it, and I found that he was right.It's clear that a remake of such a famous film as `Planet of the Apes' is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. Still, Tim Burton managed his film to represent his weird playfulness just as well as `Beetlejuice' or `Batman'. If you are already fond of Burton-movies, it's hard not to like one of his films, even if it has some flaws: nerve-racking monkey squeals, over-dressed apes and a leading actor who could have been, without difficulties, replaced by anbody else.What the film gives us in the first place, is an answer to the question: What's the result when Tim Burton is instructed to create a remake? First of all, Burton wouldn't be Burton, if he wouldn't refuse to call it a remake from the start; it's a `re-imagining'. On the other hand, Burton knows that almost every viewer of his movie has seen the very first film version starring Charlton Heston (as human), and he knows that a remake doesn't exist without its model and that the two films will not stop being compared. So all he does is playing with this comparison at every moment of his film, e. g. by referencing to quotes. Concerning the story-line, Burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions of the original first, and then driving the whole audience to despair by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with \u0096 AND HERE IS THE SPOILER \u0096 Leo coming back to earth and finding himself inside a world that seems to have been ruled by apes forever. Now, this is the burtonesque answer to people's expectations they hold because of the astonishing, shocking ending of the first `Planet of the Apes'. An ending, even more unexpected, more astonishing and: completely confusing, because \u0096 and here I'm disagreeing with various `Planet of the Apes'-homepages and -platforms \u0096 it does not make any sense. There cannot be a meaning to it, or just a so complicated one that it becomes ineffective. Tim Burton is playing his cruel games, he does it with a grin and he does it well. Burton fans will sure like it, others may feel betrayed and complain about some sort of manierism. Well, and I don't think producers will ever ask Burton to direct a remake again",

The balloon ego of an overrated director is pricked, and although he must still put his signature to it, decides to punish the studio for its blindness to his genius vision, by handing them a bomb that they all hope people wont recognizes. Who knows, I actually believe that while movies in the past have been miscast, this is an example of a movie having been misdirected. Burton's world creation just doesnt work here. Its completely claustrophobic, and unrealistic. Contrast to the original classic, which utilized all open panoramic scenery that was disturbingly too realistic. Burton creates a Gilligans island atmosphere, and coupled with the horrible story - you get a bad bad movie. So lets recap, you have a good book to work with, a great original movie to study, and the end result is this piece of junk that ignores both. Again, its not Burtons fault.

Burton, not wanting to be a slavish devotee to the original (and not wanting the audience to know everything about the story in advance of entering the theatre), attempts a similar `surprise' ending here, but the execution of it is so ludicrous, confused and clumsy that all one can do is scratch one's head and giggle in bemused befuddlement.Much of the effectiveness of the original `Planet of the Apes' lay in its deliberately paced buildup.  The early stretches of the film, in which Heston and his fellow astronauts wandered the desert in search of life, helped immensely in generating an atmosphere of suspense and mystery.  In the new version, however, the lone hero, Thade (Mark Wahlberg), crash lands on the planet and, almost instantaneously, finds himself caught in this strange world in which evolution seems to have taken a reverse course, where apes speak and have dominion over docile humans - though they're not quite as docile as they were in the first version since in this edition the humans speak, rendering absurd the idea that the apes would consider humans to be a subspecies.   Also, in the original version, much of the time was spent focusing on Heston's attempts to convince the apes that he was every bit as smart as they were.  Thus, much of the pleasure of the film came from the fact that there seemed to be a duel of wits going on between apes and humans \u0096 a contest that often took the form of high-spirited, clever and even witty dialogue exchanges.  For all the ludicrousness of its premise, the original `Planet of the Apes' was not a DUMB movie.  I wish one could say the same for the remake.  The plotting in this version essentially boils down to little more than an extended and distended chase story, with apes racing madly after humans from one dimly lit locale to the next. \nAnd here we come upon another problem with the movie \u0096 one it shares with many modern action flicks, actually, especially those made by Burton.  It is simply shot too dark.  One of the qualities that distinguished the original film from most of the sci-fi adventure films that came before it was the near-epic feeling created by its beautiful wide screen images of the desert setting.  These shots lent a visual impressiveness to the potentially childish material and helped to bring an aura of seriousness to the proceedings.  In Burton's version, however, the visual style is often dark, cramped and confining, not at all conducive to the sense of majesty and awe that Franklin Schaffner's version afforded.Wahlberg is a bland substitute for Heston who, dressed only in a loincloth and hissing virtually every line through clenched teeth, seemed to sense the camp potential hidden beneath the story's surface \u0096 a fact not acknowledged by the stolid Wahlberg (or by Burton for that matter).  How we miss the charming personalities of Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter as the sympathetic ape characters.  Poor Helena Bonham Carter, in the Hunter role, doesn't get to recite even one vaguely amusing line.  It seems amazing that a movie made thirty-three years ago would take itself so much less seriously than a film made today.  One would expect that a filmmaker like Burton, known for his ability to find humor in the most macabre of situations, would be the last director to take such a humorless, deadpan approach to material like this.   The original `Planet of the Apes' managed to combine the elements of originality, suspense, humor, irony, surprise and visual acuity to create a work of lasting value and interest. My prediction is that copies of it will still be on video store shelves long after this remake has hit the bargain-price recycling bins.",

She did nothing. At least the female ape did something.  (SPOILERS): And that chimp landing the space pod at the end, which basically saves the humans, is so convient. I mean, come on, why did it take so long for the chimp to land when Leo crashed his ship days earlier.  And leo is not well written.

The movie is great-looking. Rick Baker's makeup is convincing even in the extreme closeups, and his apes sparkle with personality and presence.

I thought all the actors were great, apart from Wahlberg who I find a little wooden, I thought the same about him in The Italian Job but he's not that bad. Tim Roth is the best and makes a great villain, one of his best performances since Rob Roy I feel. I'm actually surprised how many of the IMDB users seem to hate this film, probably because the ending doesn't seem to make sense. I too found the ending baffling but I enjoyed the ride in getting there. I must say It took me a long time to get round to seeing this movie, I eventually picked it up very cheaply in a supermarket and I'm glad I bought it. Sadly I think the overall reaction to this film has killed any chances there were of there being a Planet of the Apes II. Pity because I would have loved to have to seen how they would have tried to explain the ending.

The movie starts promisingly enough with a space station time-slip introduction. But having gone to enormous lengths to create the situation and life-like apes, the whole thing is ruined by resting on awful dialogue and corny 20th century jokes that are guaranteed to avert any suspension of disbelief. These super-intelligent apes toy with humans that they capture and one can't help feeling the filmmaker is toying with the audience too. One is reminded of Director Tim Burton's reputed comment that he only wanted to make movies in order to make money.

No, not a short fat penguin, but I'm sure he has a unsettlingly dark and creepy film adaptation of Bloom County up his sleeve somewhere.  After all, you saw what he did to poor Batman, once a proud superhero who often found himself in goofy contrived plots fighting pastel colored villains, he now is a dark, scary, menacing type inhabiting the now perpetually nocturnal Gotham City.On the other hand, Tim Burton actually isn't that bad of a director when he's working with original material.  I rather liked Ed Wood and I thought that Edward Scissorhands had some good moments.  But when it comes to doing remakes of older movies, or film adaptations of television shows, he just plain sucks.  Case in point, Planet of the Apes.  What once was a fascinating film with a biting, socially relevant anti-war message has become a \"Taco-Bell commemorative cup free with purchase of a large soda\" kind of movie. Imagine if this kind of thing catches on, someday we may see a remake of Dr. Strangelove with Gary Oldman playing the base commander, Bill Pullman as the president, Tom Arnold as the Joint Chief of Staff, and Will Smith riding the bomb to his death in blazing color, followed by a hip-hop remix of \"We'll Meet Again\" playing over the closing credits.Anyhow, getting back to the movie.  There is one particular scene in this movie I find particularly troubling.  Toward the beginning, when the whistle/spaceship thing the hero was flying crashed on the planet, it came in at an acute angle through the trees and crashed in a swampy, wooded area. The ship then subsequently sank.  This is a BLATENT rip off of Star Wars. When I saw this scene, I forgot what movie I was watching and was temporarily disoriented when I didn't see Yoda shortly afterward.  Now, I know that ideas are sometimes borrowed from other movies, and that's okay. But I would appreciate it if they could at least TRY to change it around a little, or give it a new twist.  But no, they didn't.  They could have saved some money if they had just reused the scene from Star Wars (which probably cost one-tenth as much to film).Well, it happened, they remade Planet of the Apes, leaving a nasty stain on the rich tapestry of western culture.",

It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but with the help of an ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion. The film also stars Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella WarrenDevelopment for a Planet of the Apes remake started as far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the pre-production stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled Return of the Apes, would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox. Chris Columbus, Sam Hamm, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes brothers later became involved.With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Tim Burton was hired as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. Planet of the Apes was released to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised.The story is a little confusing, but it is easy to look at for me, but for everyone else, a lot of people and critics and also fans of the franchise hates this story and the ending. The ending is just confusing also, but it's easy to overlook these two major flaws.The music by Danny Elfman is just awesome and the song that plays during the end credits titled, \"Rule the Planet Remix\" is awesome, mixed by Paul Oakenfold and composed by Danny Elfman. The rest of the music including the opening theme music is just spectacular and the film does wonders with the music.The visual effects and makeup is just spectacular also, but Rick Baker did the prosthetic make-up effects for the apes and it is a blessing of him. The visuals are a little cheesy, but works for this type of movie.The acting, is just good and bad. The only credit that will be given to is Mark Wahlberg, his performance as the lead was amazing. Helena Bonham Carter, Estella Warren and Michael Clarke Duncan puts on really good performances as well, but they can get way too over-the- top in some of the scenes. Paul Giamatti is hilarious and he does an amazing job. Luke Eberl and Erick Avari is in the film, too, but they're performances were a little confusing. Charlton Heston has a cameo as Thade's dad. Tim Roth plays the villain, Thade and he is okay, but even then, he is over-the-top as well.Overall, with the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes, it's not a bad re-imagining, but it could have done much better than this. I like and hate this remake of the 1968 original classic.Despite its financial success, 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and later rebooted the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes.",

Obviously, he couldn't do the same ending as the original, it wouldn't be a surprise.  So it became necessary to come up with something totally different, but would still have the power and impact of the original.  Well, I guess they couldn't think anything so they decided to go with nonsensical instead.  Yes folks, the big surprise is that the movie's ending MAKE NO SENSE!!! None, zero, zippo.",

            "content": "This remake is headed by the renowned Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands (1990) Batman (1989), Big Fish (2003), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2004), Alice in Wonderland (2010)) and tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson, that in the near future, participate in space exploration. For farms, monkeys were trained to fly small space capsules recognition not to expose humans in danger and the unknown chimpanzee Pericles ends up being swallowed by a temporal rift in space. To investigate an electromagnetic storm and recover your trained monkey who had not returned to the ship, Leo, opposing his fellow ship enters a small ship and goes to rescue him. But Leo has an accident and ends up landing on a primitive planet and dangerous primates where tyrants and intelligent speakers that form the local, enslave humans who are mistreated and treated like wild animals. Leo ends up being captured as you arrive on the planet along with a group trying to escape, and after the initial shock and disgusted with the way humans are treated, he plans a social revolution on the planet and becomes a threat to primates. Aided by Ari monkey, human rights advocate and a veteran former Army Military ape, deposed by dishonestly fearsome General Thade, a chimpanzee who hates humans and violently defends his extermination of the planet, Leo and a group of humans will try escaping the place.The criticisms made in Pierre Boulle's book and which are on a smaller scale or do not exist in the two adaptations for the cinema are many and well punctuated, such as, for example, the way man treats animals and acts as the owner of the planet Earth and everything in it is criticized with the reversal of roles. And because monkeys are the target of experiments and resemble humans, they explain their choice to stay in our place. The common laboratory tests are also applied by primates, who dissect their brains, observe their behavior in captivity, and do all kinds of tests. Some primates are disgusted by humans by treating them as simple animals. This could certainly be inserted in the films. It would certainly shock the audience in surreal and impressive scenes. Through these same surveys carried out by the apes, the same curiosity that we have to know about life on other planets through research is evident.The organization in society of monkeys is also very similar to that of humans. They are divided into three different varieties: that of the chimpanzees, that of the gorillas and that of the orangutans, where each group has its characteristics and purposes. Even though peace and equality have been decreed between them, the \"differences\" still exist.Another issue addressed is humanization, at least how we treat this issue in the sense of being civilized. The book is approached through some characters on the planet of the monkeys, where one of them resists instincts and struggles to be recognized as being logical and thinking and the other undergoes a curious process of dehumanization. This issue could also be better addressed in the films.In this version of Burton, there were also some adaptations in the script in relation to the book and the original film, starting with the change of names of the characters and the fact that Leo fell alone on the planet and not with his companions. Monkey society and buildings are better developed. Humans can speak, walk dressed and not naked as described in the book for obvious reasons, and are used as servants or pets of monkeys. Firearms were replaced by spears and swords. Not to mention the evolution in the physical part of the monkeys, now they are no longer people with ape heads and start convincing like real monkeys, being differentiated by races and characteristics, chimpanzees are faster, gorillas are heavier and slower etc. . All this thanks to the fantastic special effects and the makeup artist Rick Baker, an incredible professional who is also behind classics like An American Werewolf in London and The Grinch. Unfortunately, the film was wronged at the Oscars and other awards for makeup. Some actors took two to three hours on average to become monkeys. But the result is chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas with human faces.Another different factor in this version is that the monkeys of the 70s were more peaceful and similar to humans in their attitudes as well as in the book. Here, monkeys are extremely agile, violent and scary, that growl all the time and that jump and run in an incredible way, more like the reality of these animals. This caused the monkeys of the 70s to be far surpassed by the monkeys of Burton. Also impressive is the attitude of the new monkeys in the way of walking and expressing their characteristic attitudes. Furthermore, in the book, society seems more advanced and in this version of 2001 with more resources, this can be evidenced better.After problems with the delay in hiring a director for the film, fans of the ape series were reassured by knowing what hands the project would be in. Burton did seem to be an obvious choice after all, despite not being one of the first candidates for the job. He certainly better than anyone would be able to explore the conflict between humans and monkeys well, as well as, as expected, be able to use all his known visual competence in the composition of the work. Burton chose to show apes at a similar evolutionary stage, but a little higher than that of classic films. Of course, with the generous amount released by Fox, Burton and his excellent art direction team have achieved far more impressive results than before. To begin with, the makeup is detailed, organic and much more natural and, at the same time, much more complete than those simian masks that drowned out the voices and features of the actors, although for the end of the 60s and the mid 70, they were extraordinary.Undoubtedly, his vision in creating the planet that gives the work its title is in the best Burton style, having seen in his several fantastic works before and after this project. The settings are grand, with a primitive and rustic texture, a dry climate and above all dark, inviting and intriguing. Most of the scenes take place in the dry \"Zona Proibidia\" where the Oberon space station is found, and in indoor and night scenes, giving a more tense and sinister atmosphere many times. A caveat is that although Burton managed to print his authorial style especially in the graphic motto of the work, it is clear that he ends up being stuck in the not-so-deep script, which accelerated the pace many times in favor of the action scenes rather than in the ideologies and criticisms that were not so explicit.The cast is cohesive and does not at any time compromise the greater realism given to a fiction. Mark Wahlberg as the revolutionary, Tim Roth composing the cruel and ambitious General Thade, Helena Bonham Carter as the rebel Ari, Michael Clarke Duncan as the strong Attar, Paul Giamatti as the comic Limbo, in addition to the participation of Kris Kristofferson as Karubi. paper. Technically, I highlight the soundtrack of the always competent Danny Elfman, Burton's longtime partner, in addition to the impeccable photography by Philippe Rousselot, which deserves applause.Also noteworthy is the scene that pays tribute to Charlton Heston, playing General Thade's father at one point. He saying the last sentence said to General Thade before he died, \"Damn you! May they all be condemned to hell !, it was the same used in the original but when he referred to humanity, as a self-destructive and threatening race after unraveling the mystery of the last scenes. In fact, this scene was marked in the history of cinema, in which the astronaut George Taylor managed to escape from the tyranny of monkeys and fleeing by the shore of a beach in the \"Forbidden Zone\", he ended up finding the ruins of the American \"Statue of Liberty\", discovering he was in reality in the distant future of planet Earth itself, destroyed by the human race in a nuclear war, and which was now dominated by monkeys. In fact, the 68 film is one of the few films in history that deliver the ending already on its poster, although we only notice this at the end of the projection, but for the most attentive, it is a serious mistake of the distributor that seems not to have seen the film before releasing it.The big problem that made the film not become a success as it happened with the first ones, was that the essence of the Planet of the Apes written by Pierre Boulle, from which the film was adapted, was not present during the narrative. The Planet of the Apes of 1968, for example, is faithful to the book and shows itself to be full of intelligent dialogues, which carry social, theological and political criticisms. There is an intellectual dispute, while the 2001 remake bet only on the war between monkeys and men and departs from the true proposal of Boulle's dystopia. Plot Twist is maintained, but it happens in a different way than seen before and it can be interesting even for those who already knew the outcome of the plot, thanks to well-used elements of science fiction. In fact, the final plot twist, without a doubt, does not have the same impact as the 68 film.Overall, Burton delivers a more commercial film, one of the most commercial of his career, bringing more action than the original half-stopped movie. But that does not mean that this posture is all bad. Undoubtedly the franchise has been reinvigorated with new elements and does not deserve the most exalted criticism from some who even abhor this version of 2001. They are different versions and present their variations in language and technology. This can be considered an alternative version with the same argument, with interesting differences and fictional alternatives, leading the audience to reflect and travel on new horizons, all within the most dark and peculiar world of Tim Burton, making this film a great science fiction .",

            "content": "It's indicative of today's Hollywood machine, that a great story, with real bite, and genuine originality, can be so mercilessly reduced to just another action blockbuster. It's also very depressing to realise that the director responsible was once a 'maverick', with a unique take on his usual subjects, with a propensity to stay away from the commercial, and eke out the esoteric.Tim Burton's re-imagining required little imagination at all. Comparison with the original 1968 film is, obviously, unavoidable, which is as it should be. Because only with this comparison can you see what a major disappointment this version is. Practically all essence of the themes of evolution, religion, the questions of the way we treat our planet, and the way we treat each other (which are probably more pertinent in this age of genetic modification and cloning etc) are either ignored or dealt with swiftly to bring on the next set piece. Charlton Heston's spaceman has to deal with an inability to communicate with both the apes and the humans (through his lack of speech and their lack of understanding) making him an outsider from both species. We go through that wonder and frustration with him. In Burton's film there are no such devices, we are simply given the 'us and them' option, and all philosophising is glossed over in order to accommodate the next chase. Which is what this movie ultimately turns into..one chase after another. The original's council meeting is replaced with a flippant, and jokey dinner party scene. And, tellingly, there are no allusions to human experiments, instead it appears that humans are good enough as slaves and not much else. One of the many lasting images from the 1968 version is Heston's discovery of his lobotomised co-astronaut. It makes no sense that humans who can communicate with one another, and who outnumber the apes by four to one are not the ruling species. Just one of the holes in a weak and dumbed down plot.Much has been made of the ending, but here, at least, Burton has the sense to at least try something unexpected. Once again, however, he has fluffed it in order to quicken the pace. The apes seem incredibly open to the suggestion that the humans were there first, just as Leo gets over the shock of talking apes rather swiftly so, too, do these apes have an unlikely ability to accept Leo's 'understanding' and explanation of 'Calima'. Heston finding the doll in the cave at the denouement of the first movie is a revelatory moment for both audience and ape - nothing in the remake surprises us much.If you can forget the original (or if you haven't seen it), and if you can bypass the dire script, there are things to enjoy here. Although the first half is far too set bound (with some unimaginative CGI), the climactic battle scenes are very well realised. So, too, are the apes themselves, with some incredible make-up effects, and physically engaging performances (mainly by the extras!). Tim Roth injects the much needed energy in a scene-chewing, but also scene-stealing turn as General Thade, arguably the highlight of the whole picture, and Charlton Heston's cameo is good fun, the only glimpse of any humour and irony in the movie. Paul Giamati's slave trader is simply embarrassing.Major disappointment all round.",

However, if the work to be done is too complex, far out, too detailed and involves much explanation, then it wasn't a movie at all but instead a homework assignment. We become the movie and finish the tale to keep ourselves content and to have a sense of closure. There are some good scenes, acting, and high hopes here and there. But when you expect the paying audience to have to explain a movie so they can understand what they just saw? This is not the best approach and you can forget about a comeback experience. In other words, once is enough. If one likes the Planet of the Apes world, the novel it is based on and the stars like Wahlberg, by all means see the movie. Just don't expect more for less",

As for Clark- Duncan and Helena Bonham-Carter I don't really want to get into my opinions as to how they fit into their parts, but I will say they performed satisfactorily.

Just don't call them monkeys...they've killed humans for less.This movie was very entertaining and captivating with very few lulls.  Mark Wahlberg (once known as the rapper `Marky Mark' from the turbulent nineties) performed quite well, although he did not seem to have the proper demeanor for a soldier of the US Air Force.  He seemed to be a bit too `common.'I was also equally impressed by Tim Roth as General Thade.  Thade is a chimp, but not like the cute and loveable ones you see on television.  He was a homicidal maniac with a deep hatred for humans, so deep that he would go so far as to betray his own kind.  He made Adolf Hitler look like the Easter bunny by comparison.The special effects were marvellous.  It was amazing how they were able to design the make-up such that the simian masks mimicked their human facial expressions.  Some of these actors must have spent some time at the nearest zoo or something, because some of them portrayed the instinctive reactions of apes, such as throwing their hands up in the air and screeching loudly. Fantastic.  I also loved the way the apes would leap through the air and land on their opponents.As with the majority of the movies I like, I do not watch them for their artistic content.  If you want artistic content, watch `The Piano' or something like that.  If you want a movie for the adrenaline rush and you have an open mind, then do not hesitate to watch this one.The saddest part about this movie is that I had once seen on tv that Tim Burton is not planning to direct a sequel.  That would be a shame, but you never know - once Tim sees all the revenues generated by this movie, he may reconsider.  Or perhaps another director will take up the mantel.  We can only hope.***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***SPOILER ALERT***I was not kidding about the spoiler alert.  One of the paragraphs mentioned below will briefly discuss the ending of the movie, and if you have not seen the movie yet, I would not recommend that you read any further.First of all, I did not like it that the movie started out in the year 2029. So am I supposed to believe that we as a race will be capable of space flight and capable of designing self-sufficient space stations away from the Earth's orbit in just 28 years?  Unless there's influence from an alien specie, I cannot believe that we will progress that well in such a short period of time.  However, despite this `flaw,' it did not affect my overall view of the movie.Another question I had pertained to genetic diversity.  With so few humans and apes aboard the space station, how is it that they were able to populate that planet?  With all of the inevitable in-breeding (and I do NOT mean inter-species mating), how is it that either specie is not riddled with disease or deformities?  And for those of you who did not catch it, they were on a distant planet.  It even had several moons, so they were not on Earth the entire time.Finally, I was not impressed by Capt. Davidson's flight home.  In a matter of what appeared to be a few seconds, he escaped the planet's atmosphere, flew into the storm, arrived back into his own solar system (near Saturn by the looks of it), and then immediately arrived at Earth.  What makes this all the more amazing, this was done in a spacecraft not much larger than my car (apparently it is capable of deep space flight), and it's fuel and oxygen reserves were likely expended beforehand, yet Davidson made it some in one piece in about 30 seconds.The ending itself was fantastic.  Davidson landed on an Earth that had evolved the same as ours with the exception of one difference - the apes became the dominant species, not us.  Apparently, not only can the storm bend the laws of time and space, but apparently it can throw someone into an alternate reality.  I would just love to see a sequel to determine where this movie left off.",

            "content": "I will admit I only saw this the once and thought it wasn't a great film, in fact, for a while I hated it, but seeing it again, I can see why critics give it three stars out of five, and that it actually is a pretty good film from director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street). If you have seen the original 1968 film, plus the sequels (\"Beneath the...\", \"Escape from the...\", \"Conquest of the...\" and \"Battle for the...\") then you would know this is a new vision, and mix of all of them (well, besides Escape from, that takes place of Earth). Basically it is 2029, and in a space station, where monkeys are trained to carry out missions, one monkey is sent out, and disappears in the large space cloud, and without permission his friend Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) speeds after him in a space pod, and doing so gets sucked into the wormhole, and crashes in the jungle of an unknown planet, similar to Earth (well, it is). Soon enough though he is captured along with many other humans by human acting and talking apes, and like Charlton Heston before, almost the first words spoken, by ape warrior Attar (The Green Mile's Michael Clarke Duncan) are \"Get you stinking hands (paws) off me, you damned dirty human (ape)\". Anyway, the planet is afraid of humans, and will only use them as slaves, and sympathetic chimpanzee activist Ari (Helena Bonham-Carter, Burton's fianc\u00e9e) is pretty much the only ape who thinks humans should be treated equally. Eventually Leo manages to escape with some other humans, including Daena (Estella Warren) with the help of Ari, and they head to where Leo sees a signal on his still working locator. When they get there, the ships appears to have crashed, and there for thousands of years, well, you did the see the travel clock going up rapidly. Meanwhile, the army lead by the great vicious villain Thade (a very aggressive performance by Reservoir Dogs' Tim Roth) is preparing an army to fight the battle for the planet. In the end, thankfully Thade is trapped for lying about humans and apes originally getting on, Leo gets a new pod when his monkey friend lands, and he heads back to Earth, but when he lands in front of the Lincoln memorial, it has the face of Thade (!), just like the ending of the original with the Statue of Liberty buried on the beach. Also starring Paul Giamatti as Limbo, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Krull, David Warner as Sandar, Blade's Kris Kristofferson as Karubi, The Mummy's Erick Avari as Tival, Luke Eberl as Birn, Chris Ellis as Lt. General Karl Vasich, Lisa Marie (Burton's ex) as Nova, Deep Roy as Gorilla Kid/Thade's Niece, and a cameo by the star of the first original, Charlton Heston as Zaius, Thade's Father. The changes besides most of the story are that the humans are not dumb, there's no Dr. Zaius (Heston's character isn't him, he's a general), there's no Roddy McDowall or Kim Hunter, and of course the make-up is obviously more updated, a good remake. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up/Hair. Good!",

In addition to that, the actors played the apes in realistic costumes. Prior to this movie the costumes were funny, to say the least, and the 2011 prequel used CGI.Personally, this movie was a huge improvement, because the only thing worth mentioning in the old movies has been the scene with Charlton Heston confronted with the Statue of Liberty protruding from the sand.

Burton's big mistake (I think) was creating a different, unfamiliar ape universe from the previous series. Strangely, I believe the film he achieved in remaking here was the Wizard of the Oz. Mark Walberg, the lead, is no Charlton Heston. He's too short and grim. Someone needed to tell him to lighten up. He spends the entire film behaving like \"Dorothy.\" I know. I know. He wishes to go home despite meeting two potential love connections--one human, one ape. AND he starts a global civil war for good measure. Nice fellow. He mopes around the planet like some kind of self-centered jerk. Tim Roth's character is the worst kind of evil: boring. He jumps around the cheap sets as if he was suffering from a terminal case of ants-in-his-pants. I did, however, enjoy Danny Elfman's pulsating score. And Rick Baker's make-up for the apes deserved more recognition and some awards. Also, I felt the Christo-like red tents, that the ape army used on their march across the wasteland, were beautiful and abstract. There are occasional stabs at social commentary--but they fall flat.

Boy am I glad I didn't waste my money buying a ticket. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is no plot, no character motivation, no life, no story thru-line to carry the picture and the ending is so bad, it reeks of a low-budget, straight-to-video, sci-fi flick. I am a HUGE fan of Tim Burton and I think he is one of the most brilliant directors Hollywood has to offer. In fact, \"Sleepy Hollow\", in my opinion, is his best film to date. But POTA is a film that could best be described as never-should've-happened. Why does Hollywood see the need to remake classic, highly rated films and turn them into pure trash? This is one film that should NOT have been remade or reimagined or whatever you wish to call it. Why can't Hollywood remake films that were terrible when they were FIRST released instead of doing things the other way around??? The screenplay for this film is drenched with cheesy dialogue. (In one scene, David Warner tells his daughter, Helena Bohnam Carter to wash her hands before dinner after she has been touching humans!!!) The writers saw fit to throw every kind of silly convention of humor that one could relate to humans and apes at the screen and expected us to eat it up.

When I heard about this flick, I though that this \"re-imagining\" would be at least visually better than the original film. Well, it's not. The new makeup is more complex than the appliances used in the firs film, but the apes are grotesque. Ari, for instance, has hilarious ape features, and so David Warner's character. The problem, I think, is the \"realistic\" sculpture of the masks, made by Rick Baker. I don't know if \"realism\" is a good choice in a movie called \"Planet of the Apes\". The general concept is quite bizarre, and realism can make things even worse.In the original, the characters looked like apes, but had a more sophisticated appeal, a noble aspect. It's very difficult to achieve this balance, and perhaps it explains why the makeup of the new \"Planet\" wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Add to that a bunch of apes running like rabbits, \"primitive\" humans that think and talk like evolved humans and poor sets, and you have a natural looser. But what really upset me about this film is the title: it should be \"THE VISITOR\", as Burton had originally envisioned. \"THE VISITOR\" is more accurate in the sense that the movie is a \"re-imagining\", not a remake.",

            "review_title": "Burton provides an entertaining yet flawed ape escape",
            "content": "Tim Burton has a unique, dark style that sets him far apart from other filmmakers of his generation, and he has a knack for getting the best efforts from his crews and actors.His \"reimagining\" of \"Planet of the Apes\" is a rare instance in which those qualities never come to the fore. I won't bother with prattle comparing this to the 1968 original, simply because I haven't seen it and don't plan to anytime soon.He brings back nearly the entire crew he worked with on the superior \"Sleepy Hollow\" \u0096 costume designer Colleen Atwood, production designer Rick Heinrichs, editor Chris Lebenzon, and composer Danny Elfman, but this formidable unit fails to fully click this time around.Makeup guru Rick Baker (the \"Nutty Professor\" series) is responsible for the impressive simian facades, but most of the time they look instead like very expensive Halloween masks that muddle the actors' voices. The diction left much to be desired; some characters speak too low and fast (I sat in the fourth row and the theater had THX sound), and some baritone-voiced males sound as if they're talking with their mouths full.The acting is adequate but sometimes as stiff as the monkey mugs, starting with a wooden Mark Wahlberg as the centerpiece of the film, Leo Davidson. He is an Air Force captain, yet he works way up in space. The setup for his eventual crash landing onto the Planet of the Apes is flimsy and rushed. When that time comes, he doesn't look too concerned about being alone and stranded, and eventually imprisoned, in a strange new world, and he goes through the film as if this is all small potatoes to him.Thanks to bad dialogue, he inadvertently forges what may turn out to be the new pickup line of the 21st century: \"I can show you something that will change your world forever.\"Needless to say, the simians are the best thespians, and that's not saying much. Tim Roth hams it up to the hilt as the villain Thade, but he can only do so much in a movie of this style. His chief henchman, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, verbally berates and knocks a few humans around here and there, and snarls lines such as, \"Get your stinkin' hands off me, you filthy human!\" and \"Bow your heads!\"  And, that's it.Helena Bonham Carter is solid as Brit-accented human sympathizer Ari. Coincidentally, out of all the Apes, she looks the most human as well (and is nearly a dead ringer for Michael Jackson). Paul Giamatti, on the other hand, is annoying as Limbo the orangutan, the film's thin attempt at comic relief.The weakest link, as if it isn't too obvious, is Leo's gang of human fugitives, especially an annoying teenage boy and the token Black man whom we all know will get knocked off at some point in the film. They have no personality and serve no purpose in the plot whatsoever except to chip in with a cheesy line here and there. Supermodel Estella Warren, playing a slave girl whose father (Kris Kristofferson) is killed by the Apes, is as pointless as a broken pencil. Her skimpy outfit contained more depth than her screen presence. Most of her activity consists of staring into space with her mouth agape.By the way, I didn't realize the Planet of the Apes contained any beauty salons, because she manages to look like she just stepped out of one whenever she appears on screen.Oh, and Burton brings aboard his squeeze Lisa Marie once again for no apparent reason. This time around, she's buried under an Ape mask. As usual, she has nothing to do here except display her one-dimensional feminine wiles.The cinematography, courtesy of Phillippe Rousselot, does a nice job of stressing the foreboding, moonlit jungle environment. It's the only saving grace of the lackluster action sequences, especially in the beginning just after Leo crash-lands and finds himself in the middle of a wild huntdown of humans by Ape soldiers. Elfman comes through on the music front; because of his powerful score, I loved the opening credits sequence.Unfortunately, while Heinrichs' sets are always a visual treat, they aren't as gripping as his Oscar-winning work from SH. They are small and constricted due to the fact that there are sometimes too many characters cavorting on the screen. Upon seeing the Apes' village for the first time, I couldn't help but think of the planet Endor from \"Return of the Jedi.\" The wreckage of Leo's USAF space station, however, is fantastic. It's also the location of a surprising twist in the story.Now to the plot. The reason why it falters for the most part is what ultimately crippled \"Shrek\": it has an unpleasant air of preachiness to it. By itself, the plot is as thin as Wahlberg's music career, but in a twist that seems rather uncharacteristic of Burton, \"Apes\" plays the race card. This I didn't care for. I'm aware that this angle is in the original, but it's a white elephant in Burton's version.And yes, an Ape actually utters those infamous six words...I'm sure you know what they are.The suspense factor is all but nil, and the plot twists leave behind numerous holes, such as, for example, the controls on the destroyed space station being able to work despite the wreck apparently being thousands of years old. (Plus, where did all those horses, the Apes' sole means of transportation, come from?)Then there is the well-publicized \"love triangle\" between Wahlberg, Carter and Warren that Burton hinted at in interviews. To make a long story short, if you plan to watch this solely on the basis of seeing this angle, you're in for a disappointment.Sorry, but I won't waste my breath on Charlton Heston's forgettable pot-and-kettle cameo.Save for the aforementioned chase sequence after Leo's crash landing, the action and fight scenes are pathetic. Simple punches send both humans and Apes flying a few dozen feet into the air. And don't ask the Apes to hit targets in the water that are two feet from the shore. The huge Apes-humans showdown near the end is a yawner.The much-ballyhooed ending is both surprising and ambiguous. Though Burton has vehemently denied any rumors of his helming a sequel, the conclusion is like that of a comic book and does leave the door wide open for a second installment.The film's most comical moments occurred offscreen. Before shooting began, the actors had to undergo \"ape training\" to learn primate mannerisms, and spent hours in makeup before stepping in front of the cameras. On \"failing\" ape school, Bonham Carter quipped, \"I was told I had AADD \u0096 Ape Attention Deficit Disorder.\" On becoming an Ape: \"It's flattering to be cast as a chimp, because you know they haven't cast you for what you look like.\" Duncan hurt his ankle while filming a pivotal scene with Kristofferson, who slipped, fell, crashed into Duncan and wound up having to get stitches. Duncan was rushed to the hospital (yes, rushed for a turned ankle \u0096 that's Hollywood for ya), in full makeup, no less. When he announced himself to a room full of patients, they burst into applause.While \"Planet of the Apes\" has some major flaws, it doesn't mean it's not entertaining, which it indeed is, but it just doesn't have that signature Tim Burton look and feel to it. It's ultimately just another Hollywood action flick.After all is said and done, his best effort to date still remains \"Sleepy Hollow.\"  7.5/10",

His style of filmmaking pretty much couldn't be further from what was needed here.The film abandons just about every detail from Pierre Boulle's original book. At the start of the movie, Wahlberg's character, Davidson, is working on a space station, and he is involved with experiments with primates. While the back-story behind this seems interesting, you don't get to know much about it because not long into the movie, one of the chimpanzee's from the station disappears with his spacecraft, Davidson follows and ends up on the eponymous planet. Unlike in the original movie, here all humans have the ability to speak and are completely civilized. Since the apes are in that sense not dominant over the humans, that removes a lot of the suspense present in the original movie. The humans still are slaves though, but Davidson escapes with a female slave and convinces a female ape to sort of join their cause. Two apes, military commanders, start chasing after them and we get to see some uninteresting chase scenes. The Ape City also looks badly compared to the one from the original. Later, scenes take place at Davidson's old space station, which crash landed at the planet hundreds of years before he did. The apes apparently created some kind of temple there. Eventually, there is a battle between the humans and the hostile apes.Now, I've heard people say they were interested in seeing this movie because of a cameo by Charlton Heston, but his appearance is so short and since he is unrecognizable I would hardly say it would be worth sitting through this movie just for that.This movie is also infamous for the horrible ending, which deserves a special mention of its own. They must have worked really hard to make the last scene especially as bad as possible, in the vain hope they would get to make a sequel to tie up the infinite number of loose ends they created in this.Fortunately, the series got a proper reboot with \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" in 2011.

Still, this movie not only violated real-world logic, it violated its own created logic, thus making it one of the messiest, frustrating movies I have seen, ever.  Mark Wahlberg was brilliant in Boogies Nights and Three Kings, but here he is unspectacular.  There is never any reason given why he stands out among all other humans as being special, though the story depends on Ms. Carter's interest in him.  He wears a white shirt, that is all.  Otherwise he is quiet, and does nothing out of the ordinary until later in the movie. Roth's Thade also takes an interest in Wahlberg's character, but again, without reason or logic.I believe Thade was the worst villian, ever.  He had no logical reason for wanting to wipe out the humans.  And this is where the story really breaks down.  The motivation is gone.  The apes have achieved supremacy, but yet there is still a need to kill all humans, who live like wild animals, and are thus harmless to the much more powerful and advanced apes.  Apes who ride horses (which the movie refuses to explain why they are on this planet, though it explains the origin of the Apes and Humans).  The logic comes to a complete break down when Thade's general turns on him, for no reason.  He has not seen anything to warrant his turn-around, and this unexpected and unlikely twist further diminishes the story.I thought I was going to vomit and retch, I desperately tried to plead with this movie to make more sense, that if you set up a fantasy world, you must abide by the rules of that world.  But it did not, and it caused my head to explode in complete pain.I give it a 3 out of 10, for costumes alone.

What few special effects are in the movie (make-up, set design, and stunts are totally separate categories, and should never be included under the heading of \"visual effects\") could have been much better.  The ape makeup is Oscar-quality good, and is perhaps the only thing in the movie worth noting.The story seems like someone accidently dropped the screenplay into a wood chipper, randomly taped pieces of it back together, and then tried to shoot the movie from that: The story leaves us wondering too many things that are not explained, and most of what is explained is downright laughable.  This movie is funny when it tries to be serious, and never funny when it tries to be humorous.  I was so bored watching this, I tried counting (and lost track of) all the plot holes, but the big one at the end completely made me lose faith in this movie as anything but a 99-cent corner store rental to watch with your friends during a night of serious drinking games.Excellent talent like Tim Roth, Paul Giamatti, Michael Clark Duncan, and Charlton Heston (and even the far less-tolerable, media flavors-of-the-month \"Marky Mark\" Wahlberg and Helena Bonham Carter, whose names we probably won't even remember in two years) are wasted in this contrived piece of junk.  I never once felt anything for any of the characters in the film... except maybe sympathy for being trapped in such a lousy movie.This film is extremely unrealistic (even assuming that you accept the idea that evolved apes have formed a civilization, which itself is an excellent premise for a film, but a premise that could have - SHOULD have - been handled much better than this movie does it).In a summer boxoffice where intelligent dinosaurs roam, a misunderstood ogar finds love, and deceased Egyptians seek vengence, Planet of the Apes (2001) brings nothing of interest or quality to the table.  I usually come out of a big-budgeted, heavily-marketed, action/effects movie ready to get right back in line and see it again.

So Burton decided that instead of merely retelling the original story, he would put his own spin to the tale. As such, it should be appreciated as a film in its own right and not a mere rehash. The cast, namely Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, etc., gave pretty impressive performances. One of my favorite bits has to be Charlton Heston's cameo. In ape makeup, no less. I will not spoil the ending here. it has to be seen to be believed, but I can assure you, you won't forget it. Highly recommended.",

I don't even know where to begin with how disappointing this movie was.The action sequences were non-existent. Times when there should have been a good scene (like the horse-ride through the camp, which could have been really great) were very detached from the action, and consequently quite boring. Both the cinematography and the editing in such scenes were really, well, bad.The acting was stiff. I guess Burton was trying to do this whole thing where people actually moved like apes. But that was annoying. And they seem to have spent two or three times as much time and effort on that as they did on more typical (and effective) elements of acting--you know, emotions, character development, little things like that.The CGI was pretty transparent. When Marky Mark first lands and is standing in the forest looking around, for example, it's SO clear that he's in front of a bluescreen. Ugh. The makeup, on the other hand, was really well done.The score was stifled, I thought. But maybe it was just because it had nothing decent to accompany/illuminate.I expected more cool references to other movies. 2001 was a completely obvious allusion, for example, and they only made one (probably accidental) allusion to it--when Pericles is about to take off in the pod. They could really have done a lot of cool stuff with that--both on the planet and in space. So, what was good about the movie? The makeup, as I already mentioned. That's it, as far as I can recall.

(small spoilers follow) First we get this DS9-like space station shot with the wonderful title card that informs us that it's the year 2029!!! Hello! I knew right then that this was going to suck. Science fiction needs to be smart. Then he finds himself on the Ape Planet and the next 90% of the movie is just simple \"escape and chase\". Yawn... But to try and make it interesting they throw in some clich\u00e9 and ever-not-so-subtle comments on racism and religion. The script was lousy, let's face it. Then the end of the movie improves slightly (this doesn't say much) until we get the \"surprise\" ending. Whatever. Tim Burton has the imagery skills but except from Edward Scissorhands and Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, I'd say he's a failure as far as making good stories. The similarities between Planet of the Apes and Battlefield Earth are remarkable. And considering how lousy that movie was, why would anybody allow this script to pass?

            "content": "`Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty critics!'  Director Tim Burton's update of Planet of the Apes is here. Is it as good as the 1968 version? Is Charlton Heston likely to support gun control laws? No, of course not. But, that's hardly the point.A clever screenplay by Rod Serling, engaging performances and John Chambers' groundbreaking make-up - the original Apes is a sci-fi classic. However, Director Franklin Schaffner's visualization of  writer Pierre Boulle's source material works on  levels beyond simple aesthetics.In the late sixties, society takes a stumble. Civil unrest, Vietnam and the counter-culture - wow, man . . . the times, they are changing.Enter a film about a white, male astronaut (Heston). Marooned on a strange planet,  Col. Taylor  is not a happy man. In fact, he spends much of his time criticizing the arrogance of mankind. This guy makes the rock band Radiohead seem upbeat and optimistic.He encounters a group of primal, uncivilized humans. However, much to Taylor's astonishment,  talking apes are the dominant species on this world. Confronted with a new social order, Heston yells, : `It's a madhouse, a madhouse.'In one of cinema's most brilliant twist-endings, Taylor learns that he is not far from home. Furthermore, man's own worst enemy is himself.Timing is everything . . . The first P.O.T.A finds an audience because it explores themes pertinent to a volatile era of activism and transformation. The movie casts a long shadow.The 1968 film is  iconic. It transcends the medium and holds a place in our pop culture collective. Burton can't remake the original and hope for the same level of success.The  filmmaker (Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow)understands that point. So, he doesn't try. Instead, Burton and company re-invent Apes from a different perspective.This time around, Mark Wahlberg crashes on an ape-ruled planet. Faster than Curious George can get into trouble, a primate patrol captures the new arrival. After being sold into slavery, he befriends a left-leaning, pro-human chimpanzee played by Helena Bonham Carter. Along with a group of fugitive homosapiens, Wahlberg's band must elude the tyrannical military leader, Thade (Tim Roth) and flee to safety.Burton's Apes has a quirky tone. The movie isn't as substantial as the earlier incarnation - but, it is entertaining. Take a cameo by Heston. As Roth's dying father, he playfully re-visits dialogue from the first film. Given Heston's political convictions, his anti-gun rant is deliciously ironic. Remember, he's the guy  who  defiantly announces before  National Rifle Association meetings: `You can have my gun, when you pry it from my cold, dead paws.' Calm down, Moses.Make-up specialist, Rick Baker, supplies the latex for the simian characters. This guy has more Oscars than \u0091NSYNC has bad songs for good reason. Baker gives each ape its own incredibly detailed look. In a distinguished career, this film is his best work.Still, even more impressive are the actors within the monkey suits. The way Bonham Carter, Roth and their fellow contemporaries totally transform themselves with body movements, ticks and facial expressions  is outstanding.Burton gleefully turns his primates loose - letting them bound across the screen, arms flailing and voices screeching. These factors give Planet of the Apes a manic energy.Although, the movie suffers when the action shifts to the human contingent. Wahlberg is acceptable as the lead. He is distant. Still, his spaceman realizes the absurdity of his situation and just wants out. Wahlberg's detachment is an interesting counterpoint to the ape's dynamism. However, the emerging star's dour delivery does overstay its welcome by the third act.The remaining humans are sadly underdeveloped. They are bland and boring. I've seen more exciting people at Republican nominating conventions.Burton ends the film with an obligatory surprise finale. The closer is hysterical. It is more abstract than the original's final scene. But, if you take the time to piece it together, the conclusion makes perfect sense.What else could Burton do? Audience expectations are high for a shocking last act. At least he answers the call with good-natured playfulness.The new Planet of the Apes is a mixed bag. It's inventive and exciting -humorous, not campy. No, it's not the 1968 version. Who cares? Burton's movie stands on its own merits.  Still, Apes is lacking in just enough areas to hold it back.  Oh, well - better luck in the sequel.This film is a six out of ten.",

            "content": "Let me first off say that I fell victim to the hype of this summer ape-fest. I had high hopes for this recent installment of what might have been Burton's genius manifesting itself again on screen.My proposed delight in seeing something harkening back to days of Sleepy Hollow and Batman, was dashed mercilessly on the rocks of apedom by this very \"Mars Attacks\" type movie.  The plot does not meander in the least bit for there is nowhere for it to go.  It drives on endlessly whilst my company and I waited anxiously for death or the credits, whichever came first.The acting is quite weak, the characters have no development at all and the only performance worth mention is that of Helena Bonham-Carter.  She plays the role of Ari with gusto, albeit there is no explanation of why she does anything she believes in doing.  The role of Attar had so much promise being played by Michael Clarke Duncan, but there is little to enjoy in his character's action or motives.Everyone loves the villain Tim Roth plays as Thade, but even I could not stomach the growling and snarling of a pointless villain for 2 hours.  His angst-filled dialogue and actions do nothing to advance the story or draw in the audience.There are numerous plot holes that would be passively filled in if the movie made any attempt at epicurian status, but it falls short of even the humor or action of a M.A.S.H re-run.  I would have rather watched a full day marathon of old C.H.i.P.S than see this movie again.  My limited edition lunch box and movie poster will be auctioned off to lowest common denominator to be sureI may not have said much about the movie itself, but there is little to comment apon.  Average effects, weak plot, poor writing, aimless ending. The first 45 minutes is like a walk through the life of apes, which are exactly like human in their mannerisms at the table, in company, and with the help, as we are.  Burton didn't need to bludgeon us to death with the similarity.Spoilers:Don't worry about spoilers because nothing I could say will make you enjoy the ending or plot line, with my robust affirmation or denial.  I can say there was one moment I enjoyed.  I truly enjoyed Charlton Heston's role as Thades father.  It was epic Heston.  He even got to say his most famous of lines, but in reproach of the humans he once fought for 35 years ago.",

            "content": "I'm one of the few people out there that made the mistake of seeing Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes a good while before seeing the original. What kept on making me look away from the 1968 original more or less was the fact that it's over twice as old as me, which I guess you could attribute to me as being ignorant. And after hearing so much complaining about this remake with me and my best friend not seeing why (who also had never seen the original), we decided to just rent both this and the original and see what the fuss was all about.I think after seeing the ending alone you know how I feel.If I'm not mistaken, this film was handed down to several directors before Tim Burton was finally \"credited\" as the main director (and towards the end of the film's production unless I've misread something). Either way this film really doesn't feel like a Burton film to me, if it did I'd be calling this film \"gritty\" or \"dark\"; at least, for a few of the scenes. But other than some great visual style and excellent make-up on the apes it's tough for me to mention Tim Burton along with this film, it just doesn't feel like something he actually directed; not the whole way at least.It's funny that this film is supposed to be a \"remake\" when the only things it has in-common with the original are the name and the fact that the apes are superior to the humans. This is another odd thing that another reviewer pointed out; the apes don't seem to have that much over the humans other than brute strength most of the time. Whereas in the original the apes were both tougher and far more intelligent than the humans.Outside of this the film has little to nothing in-common with the original. The plot, characters, location(s) and even the ending are all different from the original. The only similarity you might be able draw is that one of the apes (a female that sees the humans as more than the other apes give them credit for) decides to help a few of them escape the ape city and go to the lands of their origins. Beyond this, and maybe a select few throwbacks to the original (the scarecrows part was pretty clever) you might be wondering if this is really a remake or just a very different re-imagining.As I mentioned earlier, this version has some great art/visual style and excellent make-up on the apes, which are even better than those of the original (even though in this day and age it's really a given for that to be the case if enough effort is put in). Really this is the film's biggest strength because outside of all the excellence visually there isn't much of a film to be had. The performances from almost everyone is average at best. Mark Wahlberg really isn't given too much to work with and you'll get plenty of his typical \"shocked\" stares. Tim Roth as General Thade actually does pretty well with his character and is arguably the most effective character. Needless to say, Helena Bonham Carter was intentionally given a bit more of a human look than the other apes, possibly to reflect her character's views on the humans in the film. Michael Clarke Duncan does well with what he's given and while he likely won't stand out for many he is a very convincing character given his size and voice (hopefully that doesn't sound too odd). Everyone else just feels like they're tagging along so there really isn't much to praise in the characters or actors other than that two of the main ape characters were handled very well. Oh, and I thought the cameo with Charles Heston was neat.Aside from this, a fun battle towards the end with the rebel humans and apes and an ending that'll likely leave those that haven't seen it puzzled as to what exactly happened, there really isn't too much to the film. My biggest problem with the ending is that we likely will never get an answer or resolution to it because of how negative the reception has been towards the film. I hate it when movie studios and the crew make a movie and leave room for a sequel but they never fully take into account possibility that the film will flop or just not do well. And in this film's case we're stuck with a film that had and in a sense still does have potential but are left asking \"when\" and \"what\".This film is very, very different from the '68 classic it's based on and as a result, it assumes you haven't seen the remake; or at least hopes you didn't. Since I saw this one before the original, my views on this remake were defensive and while I think it's far from as bad as some might make it out (and even as I myself might have made it out as well), it's very tough to fully appreciate it after seeing the original. So if you haven't seen this film yet (or even the original for that matter), I would personally see this one first so you can make a verdict on the film itself, then see the original and then make up your mind. As for those that have seen the original but not this, just go into it with an open mind and don't expect the same movie. And if anyone has seen both and wants to at least try and like this movie, try and watch it without having the original in mind. Keep the original in mind, and this film stinks. See this as its own film, and you should be able to find some redeeming values.",

Any reference to the original novel is non-existent.All that hard work recreating the (improved?) makeup has come to naught when the movie doesn't ride on a good script. At least the 1968 original took its time to pace the story properly to create some sort of suspense. The 2001 remake jumps from one scenario to the next in episodic fashion that leaves no room for the viewer to really care what happens to anyone. And except for the last half hour, you never get the feeling that you're out in the open air. Everything feels claustrophobic; like being on an over crowded sound stage.I still appreciate many of Burton's other films, but this is a misfire with too many cliches that most of us have seen before. And it seems that so much time was taken with the makeup; so much time was taken with paying visual homage to the original and its sequels; that they forgot to let a proper narrative flow take over the story and at least include a LITTLE logic (and I'm not even referring to the ending). The homages? 'Ari'...spell it backwards and put a 'Z' in front. Any more, I'd rather not spoil...you might have fun spotting them on your own when referencing 'Planet..', 'Beneath..', Escape..', 'Conquest..' and 'Battle..' (and the short lived TV series and cartoon).Stick with the original...as long as it is in wide screen (the pan & scan sucks to the point that you miss half the movie, especially when there are characters and events taking place on both ends of the wide screen).Perhaps the writers should have spent a little less effort calling this a 're-imagination' and instead used some 'real imagination' to create a compelling staple in the sci-fi genre that this deserved.5 out of 10",

I'll start first with the character development. There is none. Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg)is so one dimensional that at no point did i care if he ever got off the planet and back to, well, whatever and whomever. His entire time is spent throwing out cliched lines instead of being awed, inspired, terrified, or confused of his surroundings. Any emotion would have worked. As for the humans who live on the planet, I'm not sure what their problem was, they werent savages, they outnumbered the apes supposedly, they could communicate at the same level as the apes (unlike the original movie), so why exactly were they living in the hills scared for their lives. Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and General Thade (Tim Roth) are by far the most interesting, and well acted, characters.  Miss Carter brings a sensual aspect to her character that is very appealing (yes, i know shes playing a simian, but it doesnt seem to matter). While Mr Roth plays Thade deliciously evil and cunning, and his ape-like movements are a sight to see.I was especially disappointed with the relationship between Leo, Ari and Daena (played by model Estella Warren, who is way to beautiful here to pull off a role as a jungle woman). There are obvious hints of attraction between Ari and Leo, yet these scenes go absolutely nowhere in developing the awkwardness of it all. The script doesnt go beyond yearning glances, which is a shame. The last half hour of the movie was basically the standard action plot. The movie builds up to an inevitable war between the humans and the apes, with Leo devising this absurd plan to stun the first ranks (out of thousands of CGI created apes) with the remnants of his old ships ignited fuel tanks. Never mind the fact this would only eliminate maybe 5 percent of the total forces they are up against. The final conflict is never exciting, but then how could it be when we have no emotional investment in the characters.I will not discuss the \"surprise\" ending, except to say not only is it not surprising, it doesnt make sense, and i defy anyone to explain it.In fact, i read an interview with the higher-ups involved in this fiasco, and they revealed that the ending isnt supposed to make sense, its supposed to leave the viewer confused and guessing. Well, thats just what i want after watching this for two hours, and ending that insults the viewers intelligence by admitting \"we didnt even care enough ourselves to give you a plausible ending.\" Thank you Hollywood.

Which it is.But having said all that, I have a suggestion for a sequel. In the sequel, Wahlberg, Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Burton play themselves. They all get into a spaceship and try to go back in time to change the future where no remake of the Planet of the Apes will appear on their resume. After 2 1/2 hours of mindless hijinks and special effects, they emerge in modern day to find they didn't change a thing, because as Alec Baldwin's character states so glibly in Glengarry Glen Ross: \"a loser is a loser!\"And anyone who read the script for this film and didn't walk away was -at least in this instance - a loser.",

Here, astronaut Leo Davidson (played forgettably by Mark Wahlberg) crash lands on a distant planet ruled by intelligent apes. From there, he treks with a small band of outsiders towards these mysterious, ancient ruins which may hold the key for his return home.Where do I begin? Well, the cast is thoroughly wasted and this film has quite a cast (David Warner! Michael Clarke Duncan! Paul Giamattei!), the special effects are pretty generic, and the production design is slimy and claustrophobic. On top of all that, the final battle is very lackluster.Adding to all this, the ending is a joke. While the original film had an ending that was surprising and strangely appropriate, this one feels forced and confusing. Additional sore spots include a bland score by the usually reliable Danny Elfman and a pace that BEGS for a steroid shot.You may be wondering are there ANY redeeming values?

I still have no idea whether he went to Earth the first time or if he's on our Earth at the end. We'll have to wait for the sure to come sequel. RATING: 6 out of 10. For a comparison, rent the 1968 original. This is a 10 out of 10.",

Roll over Heston, as Mark Wahlberg now rules the planet as head human.The story is different from the original movie, however, director Tim Burton did a very credible job in this film. The movie begins with Mark Wahlberg going after his lost chimpanzee into an electrical storm in space. This electrical storm sends our hero hundreds of years into the future, where he crash lands onto the planet of the apes. I will stop with the summary here, as there are many unexpected occurences throughout the movie.The greatest part of this film, is the casting of Tim Roth as Thade, the ape general. This is definately the best acting job he has ever done.\nTake a chance on this one, I really do not think that you will be disappointed with it.",

Equally, I imagine the screenwriters probably did an admirable job with their story. But any hope of a performance by Wahlberg, as anything more than a stereotyped dosage of testosterone, was trashed. It's really a pity. And to think that Tim Burton's name is attached to this film leaves me reeling... Having seen so many of his films and his genius revealed, I cannot help but believe this latest project suffered nuclear fall-out. Just think back: \"Sleepy Hollow\", \"Nightmare Before Christmas\", \"Edward Scissorhands\", and so many more: I could just keep writing... They were all fabulous.The most to be said for the end-product is that it allows Wahlberg to be likeable. Tim Roth, on the other hand, comes off so badly that he reminds me of Gary Oldman (whose talent, by the way, is huge and underutilised...) with too much make-up and a bad hangover. Only Helena Bonham-Carter and the special effects (read: Tim Burton) make this film worth seeing. Bonham-Carter is not only likeable, but believable, convincing, and showing real talent despite the obvious handicap of the costume. She really does deserve high marks here, but I don't think the voting public will take the end-product of this film seriously. Again, what a shame... The Marketing Gurus and Editors really need to be strung-up for hacking to bits what could have been fabulous.Entertainment value. Go see it for the special effects and noted items above.

Marky Mark, er, Mark Wahlberg (excuse me) all muddied up running around a Tim Burton set and B. that they were even remaking this accidental classic, which easily is near the top of America's Cheesiest Films Of All Times list (right below Blackula, Killer Tomatoes and Jon Waters' purposely cheesy farces of course).For those too young to remember, Planet of the Apes first appeared in 1968. It was a sensation with audiences and panned by critics. The costumes were state-of-the-art for the times and the sets were as other worldly as they could portray in a sixties Star Trek quazi-realism way.Those who enjoyed the first version(s) even passed up the concession stand goodies for fear of losing that comfy close-up seat. The suspense of what the apes would look with all the modern gizmos the FX folks have at their disposal nowadays was almost unbearable. Like with The Grinch's recent successful transformation into 21st century-gadget- hoopla- infused- bing- bam box-office magic, TPOA does not disappoint on that level.As for the the rest of the film? Well, the plot is as deep as Green Eggs and Ham and the \"human\" cast is about as exciting as an instructional video on an anal polyp removal from the lower bowel of a brown field mouse, yet still, mad-director Tim Burton left just enough camp to keep it, surprisingly, enjoyable.The story goes...Astronaut; Leo Davidson (Mark \"softly spoken\" Wahlberg) is aboard a space station USS Oberon, training primates to play Astronaut. One starry night he is told to send one of these Chimps out to research a menacing energy field approaching fast on their starboard side.The \"canary in the coal mine\" never returns...So, Leo, bored with his mundane duties anyhow, jumps into a delta pod to rescue the fellow, and, surprise, gets transported through time to a place ruled by...He crash lands safely in an eerie swamp. But, before he can shake his banana dry, he is over run by a group of fear-for-their-lives types ricocheting through the forest being pursued by dressed, orating, violent apes. Leo is trapped, along with these ratty anorexic -Mad Max looking- extras each with a perpetual glaze over their faces like deer locked on headlights (or Nick Cage in an emotional scene), and sent to market. The market is run by Limbo (brilliant Paul Giamatti) a sleazy Orang creep.Leo and a boopsie faced tribe gal, Deana (Estella \" be careful of bimbo typecasting  dear\" Warren), meet in one of Limbo's human slave holding cells. She's smitten, but he's focused on his personal inner dialog, his sequel, \"Exit El Quicko from the Planet Of The Apes.\"They end up working together and gather a few others including, human rights activist girly ape Ari (Helena Bonham Carter). They all escape the city and head to \"rendezvous\" with Leo's space colleagues who have been sending out a signal to him via his space age transmitter he rescued from his sunken space pod. The humans hope Leo is their savior fallen from the sky to save them from the mini-Kongs that suppress them. Leo hopes his friends are waiting for him, just over the mountain range\u0085The fleeing party faces some pretty mean mother-apers en route to Shangri-La! One ape in particular, General Thad, (Tim Roth) hates humans in a Hitler- southern plantation owner-circa 1800 way. He wants the filthy creatures (humans) completely annihilated and is schmoozing with the ape senate to get his wish. Leo is just what the nefarious Thad ordered when praying to their almighty Semos for a sign the humans must all go. With Leo's frightening display of intelligence and back bone, the senate will be scared bananaless into giving Thad the Marshal Law decree he so desires.\nWill Leo and his new tribal friends make it to the space command center before Thad's wicked army finds and crushes them? Is Leo the god they have waited for all these years? Could the last fight scene be tackier?Don't worry, I'm not ruining anything here for you...It's so telegraphed G.W. Bush would know the ending half way through. Okay, maybe right before the credits at least.The story is a tad blas\u00e9. You may find yourself adrift about the screen, looking for something to busy your brain when Mark and crew aren't battling the Apes. Which brings up a kind of humorous point of observation, Wahlberg's \"Leo\" has like three sentences of dialog in a scene, then smacko, he's immediately in primal combat again; like an odd ballet of film you watch and keep a mental metronome swaying in your head\u00851-2-3 fight, 1-2-3 fight.TPOA is really all about the visual treats; like watching intense thespian Tim Roth bounce about like an extra at Ringling Bros. & Barnum Bailey Circus of the Cruel in his cute little money, er, ape suit. Tim Roth's \"Thad\" was super creepy. Hate oozes from his furry little pores to the point were you feared he may really have gone rabid. Even with all the schtuffamagal Roth had burying his features, the feeling and depth from the actor beneath came through. Or Helena Bonham Carter, all made up in ten pounds of latex, a far cry from the West End beauty she is, for sure. Still a lady, even as an ape.Then there's MM Wahlberg. His picture is in Compton's Encyclopedia under \"example of the Male Homo Sapiens \" -In my version anyway\u0085 The man's body is, simply, dare I say, perfect. He's a double cream serving of Pistachio Ice cream with a hidden layer of marshmallow fluff. Scrumptious. Leo was a dull character so MM's signature \"whisper\" delivery worked. I think I need a Boogie Nights fix...TPOA has quite a few exciting moments. Enough to recommend it. Those nostalgic for the original take heart- there's still only one Cornelious (Roddy McDowall) and this is not a replacement, it's just another look at a pretty wild concept , modernized for the new generation to enjoy.\nAn aside: Danny Elfman, Timmie Burtonski's favorite music man, is back incahoots producing the film's score. As always, Elfman delivers a catchy, flowing gently ominous orchestration of notes.Snack recommendation: Banana nut pound cake and Pistachio ice cream.",

Complete with his groomed beard portraying some kind of a caveman. One wonders why he isn't wearing cowboy hat and boots. Then we have little Tim Roth as a British(?) chimp. Burton orders: \"You're a chimp! Act like one! Make at least 10 grimaces a second!\" And Roth obeys. He is the bad chimp, so he tries to look really mean, but doesn't. Roth also hops around a lot. It's real method acting, you know. As if the bad apes aren't, well, \"bad\" enough, there are also \"good\" apes, who talk like liberals, so the kids who watch this mess hopefully will turn out as \"good\" citizens one day. Of course they won't listen to the drivel of the good apes. It's too boring. Talking of boring: Wahlberg gets captured by the bad apes in a boring way and soon escapes in a boring way. Then he's on the run and has to talk a lot to the other humans and a female chimp (Carter) which has the desire to be just as smart as him. Sometimes we see Roth the chimp, who wants Wahlberg back. he gives orders to his favorite gorilla, then hops out of frame for the most time. At the end he and a lot of other apes get whacked in the head by Wahlberg and his feel-good-posse. Some big apes roll around on the floor in deadly combat. The final duel belongs to Wahlberg and Roth the little chimp, which leaves the monkey completely bonkers. Finally a real chimp saves the day and shows Roth and the others how to act. Obviously Burton had no influence on the animal. The last minutes gives us a tiny impression what this remake maybe should have been about, would it have been made by a director with a vision.",

            "content": "How do I put this lightly. . . . I loathe this movie with the entirety of my being.This isn't a Planet of the Apes movie. I can't just turn off my brain and enjoy a mindless \"re-imagination\" of one of the most thoughtful movies I've ever seen. Watching this movie made me feel physically sick. Writing about it made me feel physically sick. I was literally on the floor. I can't handle this movie. That being said, this movie isn't necessarily an assaulting kind of bad. Some will find entertainment value in it, at least it has a plot, and (generally) it has a nice aesthetic quality. But it's still bad.Tim Burton is someone who I have a lot of respect for. I think he's a fantastic filmmaker, and more blame belongs to the writers than anyone else on this project. Burton's hands however still aren't clean, and he's committed his fair share of offenses here. On the commentary he actually explains that apes make him uncomfortable (which would explain the apes' performances), and he gave the impression that he didn't want to direct the film in the first place. It shows.This is one of his weakest efforts in terms of direction. For example, we actually don't get to see all that much of the Ape City--only dimly lit, claustrophobic sets and homogenous formations can really be observed (though what we do see looks pretty good). We get a few wide shots, usually attached to other sets like the forest, adding a kind of close-knitness that detracts from its sense of scale. Making that issue worse, relatively little time is dedicated to travel, so even the military camps and the set from the battle scene don't feel very distant. This simply isn't the best effort Burton could have given, but was maybe the best we could've hoped for given the script.The screenplay for this film was written by William Broyles Jr., Lawrence Konner, & Mark Rosenthal, the last two of whom worked on such hits as Superman IV! Now, to the writers' credit, at least there's a plot for the most part, but that's about all I can praise them on (if that indeed counts as praise). I'm not really quite sure where to begin with the flaws actually. As I watched the film I started making a list of questions regarding anything that disregarded logic or broke my suspension of disbelief. I can only use so many words, so I guess I'll just post the list:Why send a baby chimpanzee into space? Or a chimp at all? Humans pulling the carriage instead of horses? Wild humans have the time and resources to curl and dye their hair? Where'd she get that 20th century hair dye? What's with the stoner apes? He's feisty? He just grabbed your leg on accident and looked at Thade all confused- like. Where were the doors in the houses? Why won't the humans talk? They're not mute so. . . . Why'd the one human signal not to talk, then? Do the apes not know they can talk somehow? They didn't seem surprised. If humans are lower on the evolutionary chain than monkeys, why can humans talk but not the monkeys? Are there talking monkeys we don't know about? Were there even any monkeys on the ship they came on? Considering the ship's population, they'd be really inbred by now right? How were the apes in that blast only stunned? Did they see the 1968 film? Did they even read the book? It's closer to the book, but still nowhere near it. Should have just called the movie something else, like: \"Inbreeding: The Movie\".A few other points: There's some almost-commentary on religion, but nothing that pans out. Any allegorical content is an afterthought at best. It's tonally unsure of itself: half wants to be taken seriously, half cartoon. Mark Wahlberg's character really just doesn't care, and is too blank to be relatable. The apes might be talking about something expository or of their interest, and then Leo just mentions something unrelated that pertains only to him. It's almost pleading you to assume character depth for it, but you don't because there isn't any. The apes in this movie are completely cartoonish, including their preposterous fear of water (maybe they can't swim because their prosthetics will fall off, as my sister observed).Mark Wahlberg and the Chimp are pretty damn cute, I'll give it that. Otherwise, Tim Roth is a cartoon. Paul Giamatti is a cartoon. Helena Bonham Carter is a cartoon. The humans are all bland. I suppose the actors are into it enough to pass as flamboyant caracachures. They sell it, but it's for the wrong movie. And I love Paul Giamatti. He doesn't belong in this movie, but I love him.The wirework is pretty bad. The CGI is fine. Though the sets and colors are nice. If there's one thing I can give Burton credit for it's for making a (generally) good-looking movie. The prosthetics for the most part actually look pretty good, sometimes as good as Chambers' work from the 1968 film. Some of the makeups look out-of-proportion or bizarre though, like stuff conceived on mutations or not-to-be-named perversions-- genuinely concerning designs.The score by Danny Elfman is simply fine. It's inoffensive, maybe slightly better than the average modern-age film score, but that's not really saying much. At least there's actually a melody (even if somewhat derivative of his Spider-Man score), and as bombastic and obnoxious as the drums are at least they have personality, though it's a far-cry from Elfman's best.This is not a Planet of the Apes film. It's a movie with apes in it, completely unrelated to Planet of the Apes. If you're a die-hard Planet of the Apes fan, maybe watch it once. Otherwise, seek out the 1968 film. Don't bother with this.Score: 3/10",

            "content": "When I first heard that Tim Burton was going to \"re-imagine\" the original \"Planet of the Apes\" (which is a much nicer word than \"re-hash\"), my question was, \"Why?\"  Now I've seen it, and I still don't know.  When you remake a movie, it will inevitably invite comparison with the original. You need to bring something new, interesting, and different to it, and most importantly, it helps to know what that something is.  And that is the chief weakness of the new \"Apes\".The original movie had weirdness and originality, plus satiric bite and subtext out the wazoo.  The apes in Burton's movie behave more like real apes, which is neat, but part of the original's charm was that its human-ish apes lent it a surreal \"Twilight Zone\" quality, no surprise given the involvement of Rod Serling.  Plus the original had that ending, which has become a classic cinematic moment.  The new \"Apes\" obviously lacks that dramatic punch, and the makers were wise to alter its premise accordingly. But to what?  The new movie works best as a comic takeoff on the genre (since the original spawned four sequels and an armada of imitators).  It's fun to spot all the references in this movie, both to the \"Planet of the Apes\" series and to other cultural icons.  But the movie fails to keep the satiric edge through the second reel until the bravura, witty finale (which suggests that any sequel might be funnier and better than this one). Otherwise we get a lot of ho-hum posturing and a surprisingly yawn-inducing battle scene.  The movie also leaps over gaps in the plot like a steroid-crazed chimpanzee.  As an example, the hero is confronted by an army of human refugees who have come from all the land to \"see the human who defies the apes.\"  That's impressive communication: he'd only escaped the night before.The story is weak and wandering, and the cast isn't up to the task of buoying it.  This is especially true in the pivotal lead character. Charlton Heston's performance in the original was hammy (but admit it now; we love Charlton BECAUSE he's hammy), but his character had fire and emotion.  You could identify with him because he was trapped in an insane situation, and his fear, confusion and rage were palpable to you.  Mark Wahlberg in the new one barely registers.  Wahlberg is not a bad actor, but neither is he a lead actor.  He is subtle, and best when playing quiet supporting characters to more vibrant leads, like in \"Three Kings\" or \"The Corruptor\".  He also has a flair for deadpan satire (he was the best thing in the misfired \"The Big Hit\").  But this is a role that requires less subtlety and more big expressiveness.  Wahlberg comes across not as an ordinary man trapped in a bizarre nightmare out of time, but just befuddled, like a commuter that has gotten off at the wrong stop.  And, just before the big battle, he gives what has to be the least inspiring speech-to-the-troops in film history.  If Marky Mark had been at Valley Forge, we'd all be mailing our tax returns to London.Heston, incidentally, crops up in an in-jokey cameo as the wizened old leader of the apes.  He shows his son Thade (Tim Roth) an ancient pistol which he says is proof of the ingenuity and wickedness of humanity, in one swoop spoofing both his role in the original and his day job as NRA President.  Between this and playing a gun-toting nut job in \"Town and Country\", Heston seems intent on retiring the Good Sport Award for this year.It happens that all the good performances in this movie are among the apes (hmm, maybe they ARE superior).  Roth is magnetic as the power-mad, swaggering Thade, and kudos also to Michael Clarke Duncan as his adjutant, with a booming voice that was made to say things like, \"Bow your heads!\" Estella Warren is very cute in buckskin, but contributes little else to this movie (this is not all her fault; for an ostensible love interest, her character is woefully underwritten).The movie is not all bad; I'd certainly say it's worth seeing.  It has visual flair, there are a lot of funny lines and moments, and the ending is inspired; but as comedy it's too dull, as drama too flat, as allegory too unworkable to rise above the ordinary.  In the \"Apes\" ouevre, I'd place it above \"Escape From...\" and \"Battle For...\", but that's below the level of ringing endorsement.And if you do see it, one last thing to ponder:  Where the hell did the horses come from???",

I admit with each new sequel the quality of the story went down, but one tends to be forgiving because they were made so closely together and had some cohesion.  This new film doesn't have that luxury. They took a chance and changed the story and failed miserably.  The original had implications of mankind's destructive nature which caused this twisted society to be born. In the new version the ape society was born from an astronaut not following orders.

            "content": "This was one of summer 2001's big event pictures, it had lots of hype and lots of people talking but everyone in a fashion knew that this reworking would never top the original even with a solid director and good cast. They were right! Leo Davidson (Mark Whalberg)who works on a large space station goes out in a spacecraft to save his chimp that has gone into a mysterious cloud formulating in space, he too is sucked in and lands in a planet ruled by apes where humans are the prey and are tortured and are pets to the apes.Davidson must get back to his main ship and along the way finds friendship in a female ape called Ari (Helena Bohnam Carter) who helps him and he helps her. But General Thade (Tim Roth) is intent on destroying all humans and Davidson and his band of rebels are top of his list.The film as a whole is very good and i was much surprised at how much i enjoyed it, i was very skeptical with it being that i really didn't get the original film but this film i got.I really got Burtons vision and really saw this as a good attempt at a reworking from the man i like to call a hero of mine, i did think in places his usual directing skills lacked in some places but for the most part he did an ace job.Mark Whalberg put in a very good performance as the hero of the picture, in places i found him to be slightly annoying but like with Burtons direction for the most part he put in a very good performance as did Tim Roth who comes across very evil in his portrayal as a bitter and twisted ape which i don't think would be an easy feet for any actor.The dialog i have to say in parts is poor as is some of the character interpretation. One of the best and great things about this picture is the production design and once you watch the film you really see where the money for this film went and it really is a well deserved effort of the production designers part. Job well done! For the most part this film has spectacle and awe and this is needed for a summer event picture and i wasn't unhappy with the final product at all. Burton gave his usual unique vision to a classic film that many regard as the ultimate Sci-fi film and in comparison many may feel that this film is no where near as good as the original, but if were honest when are they ever!

He longs to leave the planet and get back HOME to Earth.  The shocker at the end of the movie is that he already IS home.The new Apes could not hope to compete with that and, given that so many people already know the ending, tried very hard to end with an equal, if different, shock.  It didn't work.One thing about the ending (no spoiler here): you either loved it, or you hated it.  I hated it.  There has been so much discussion about whether or not it made sense...all I can say is that if you have to argue about it, then it wasn't clear enough.  I think the movie would have been much more entertaining if the story line brought you to the ending, (like the original did), instead of throwing it at you from out of nowhere.\nI'm glad I saw it.

My friends told me how great the original was and i could only think of how awesome a writer must be to create such an original story.  Oh, i was a fool.Burton has had a successful streak, hasn't he?  Batman, Batman Returns, Sleepy Hollow, and the cult favorite Nightmare Before Christmas.  Yes it is an awesome life.  But every career has a hitch.  This is his.  Mark Wahlberg's career has also been rising.  From the innovative Boogy Nights, to the highly rated Three Kings and The Perfect Storm with another blockbuster (Rock Star) on the way.  Maybe this can be an oversight.No matter the director or the stars, our hero, Leo Davidson cannot see that his ape costars are real actors.  Whenever speaking to them, he inserts a short pause, as if trying to prove to himself that these are real people. His eyes are blank and emotionless.  He plays a hero just as well as Steven Seagal, take that as you will.The apes are frighteningly lifelike, but you can't base a movie on its makeup.  The film is dark, very dark (visually) for the first 3/4.  As if these future apes couldn't figure out lightbulbs, or even gas lights.  The film also uses the rope and pulley system made popular by the Matrix.  While it looked new and exciting in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and even Romeo Must Die, seeing apes jumping vertically eight feet (from a sit down) is just silly.None of the \"human\" characters, beside Leo, play an important role.  It makes you wonder why he's trying to save them.  Apes have evolved into intelligent, thought processing individuals over thousands of years... but what happened to the humans?  Did we just stop at a certain point in time, and someone said, \"This is enough for you\"?  The ending is so confusing it's physically impossible.  Burton rearranges time so much i think HE get's lost.  Overall, it's a 4/10- saved by the makeup and the ape's acting.",

It just doesn't ring true. It would come across as, if not ridiculous, then certainly somewhat odd. This is how I felt about this film. Mark Wahlberg plays a United States Airforce space pilot who also trains, luckily for the plot, monkeys. It would be easy to harp on about paying peanuts, getting monkeys and other such witticisms. Instead of blindly denigrating this film, as many have done, it would seem more politic to look at the reasons why. Hammy acting, cliched one-liners, `Never send a monkey to do a man's job', for instance. Lack of plot; Star thrown into space turmoil, gets stranded on an unforgiving planet dominated by Apes. Apes catch star. Star escapes from potential slavery. Star gets home again safely. Everybody's happy. Apart from the audience. Widely slammed by critics and punters alike, and fairly so. A poor excuse for a film which tried, and miserably failed, to live up to the original. Bad, bad, bad. Even the token appearance from Charlton Heston could not save this from ignominy.",

Sure, it made money, but even the ending - spoiler, the Lincoln Memorial is now dedicated to General Thade and everyone on Earth is an ape - is the most nonsensical surprise ending of nearly all time.Mark Wahlberg - the man who potentially could have stopped 9/11 - plays Captain Leo Davidson, a United States Air Force astronaut who opens a portal to another world and ends up captured by the apes sometime in the future of 5021.After being captured, Leo and a female slave named Daena (Estella Warren) are bought by female chimpanzee Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), who brings them to work as servants in the house of her father, Senator Sandar (David Warner). Of course, Leo is destined to free the slaves and battle for freedom against Thade (Tim Roth, who turned down the role of Snape in the Harry Potter films to be in this movie) and Colonel Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan).This is a movie packed with actor spotting opportunities, from Paul Giamatti as slave trader Limbo to Kris Kristofferson as Daena's father Karubiv, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Shang Tsung!) as General Krull, Lisa Marie as Nova, Erick Avari (who has portrayed 24 different ethnicities in his career) as Tival, Glenn Shadix (who was the voice of the Mayor of Halloween Town in The Nightmare Before Christmas) as Senator Nado, Freda Foh Shen (the voice of the Chinese takeout in Hey Dude, Where's My Car?) as Bon and cameo appearances by the two actors most associated with the human side of the original films. Charlton Heston plays Thade's father Zaius and Linda Harrison appears as a slave.The films looks great, the Rick Baker effects are amazing, but sadly the film has no soul. There was plenty of studio overinvolvement in the film and Burton was in the midst of ending his relationship with Lisa Marie and beginning a new one with Helena Bonham-Carter. When asked if he'd make a sequel, Burton replied, \"I'd rather jump out a window.\"Planet of the Apes won Worst Remake at the 22nd Golden Raspberry Awards, while Heston (Worst Supporting Actor) and Estella Warren (Worst Supporting Actress) also won awards. For what it's worth, Tim Roth had major issues with Heston and had no idea that the NRA spokesperson would be in the film with him.Wahlberg would later say to MTV News, when the next series of reboots was released, \"I haven't seen it yet, but I heard it was pretty damn good. Well, ours wasn't. It is what it is. Ours wasn't. They didn't have the script right. Fox Studios had a release date before Tim Burton had shot a foot of film. They were pushing him and pushing him in the wrong direction. You have to let Tim do his thing.\"One last weird thing: Two apes in fill makeup appeared on the August 6, 2001 of WWE Raw. They entered the building to the theme song of Kamala and briught gifts for Stephanie McMahon before helping Chris Jericho throw a pie in her face. However, the apes were presented as real and not actors, which made the whole thing appear leven more ridiculous.",

What a mistake.I didn't simply dislike this version because I'm a fan of the original, it is truely a horrible horrible film.  The script is pathetic and the ending seems like it was made by someone under the influence of heavy narcotics who didn't care about whether it made sense or fit into the movie or not.\nThis film is almost ridiculously campy with the bad dialogue and lines thrown into it simply to elicit a slight grin beased on a connection from the first film.  The apes act ridiculous and you're never left with the feeling that this could actually happen given the absurd things they do. I'm surprised Burton didn't throw in a monkey car that runs on bananas or something.  There's even a little dwarf that runs around collecting money like a chimpanzee would do at the circus.  Even if they took all the \"ape camp\" out, it's still a pathetic movie. Mainly because of the script and the horrible directing by Burton.  The stunts look pretty bad and fake. Many things don't make sense, like why apes would ride horses if they can move faster than horses anyway.  Even Wahlberg gives a pathetic performance.The only entertainment value in this entire movie is the \"funny\" things that an ape society does that compare with what humans do.

Tim Roth creates a truly evil being in Thade.  His walk and talk had me believing!  The sound, make-up and costumes are outstanding, and really had to be in order to pull this off.  Burton provides a few nice nods to the original, but none better than including Chuck Heston in a real flip of roles.  The usually outstanding Danny Elfman (yes, Jenna's bro) has some fine score moments, but overall a bit of let down.  Marky Mark is OK in the lead, but Estella Warren (from \"Driven\") is downright awful.  No other human has highlights in their hair!  Michael Clark Duncan (\"The Green Mile\") is chilling as the sargeant of the ape army.  Again the sound comes into play everytime he speaks or roars.  Not really sure of the purpose of the ending.

I marveled at the apes, and their culture, but even then I knew there was some dumbness in the script. Like why didn't Taylor place one of his 2 other crewmen on guard duty while they were swimming? They each had a gun in their survival backpack(and didn't all my friends and I want those cool metal packs with guns and stuff inside!)? So my dad and I groaned at that one! But the rest of the movie was cool, and had some important sociological stuff to say. Tim Burton's movie has none of the coolness or important stuff to say!(IMHO). It DOES have what I call \"idiot disease\"---the current(since 1980 or so) brain rot of writers and filmmakers, which says \"let's assume the audience all has double digit IQ or even single digit IQ !\" Well, maybe the writers and money men in Hollywood DO have single and double digit IQ, but unless all of my generation and the one before it(and slightly immediately after it) are all dead, and I'm a dinosaur who forgot to extinct, some people who drop large amounts of money for a night at the movies, DEMAND Smart(read that common sense-ical and intellectually adult) writing in our movies. Burton took a totally \"let's make money\" aim with this \"re-imagining\" of what was a beloved series. He went for:boobs,babes,interspecies sexual encounters,cgi headache giving animation,and stupidity masquerading as \"Art\". How in the hell does the spaceship remain \"dormant but operational\" after what has been declared \"a couple thousand yrs\"? why not arm the humans with the guns STILL IN THE SHIP? Uh, if the recording said they were fighting, and only holding the apes off because they had the guns, then the guns in THEIR RACKS, must have had AMMUNITION!

Military trained people just DO NOT behave like Captain Marky Mark did in this film! These may seem bitterness driven quibbles, but I'm an English Professor darn it, I cannot see wasting my life trying to educate people who are happy with a world in which there is no common sense, no intellectual discourse, and no intelligence in their choices of reading(?) materials, music, movies, Art. Burton should be spanked for making this trash--He's a brilliant visionary, and a talented thinker--where was his head during this? As for actors, Marky Mark hit the high point in FEAR, with Reese Witherspoon. Helena Bonham Carter threw Lisa Marie from her place in Tim's bed(i was there as a fly on the wall), and Estella--dear, you need to get a life, honey!

The action scenes were exciting and fun.BAD: The escape from the ape city was terrible.  The characters are going in circles, then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape.  Plus, what escape route leads through everybody's bedroom?The story was pared down to include as much action as possible.

And this movie did change things up a lot compared to the original but it took a lot away from what made the original good. The movie felt like it was more about racism than sci-fi ideology and theory which I found to be interesting in the original. And it lacked the creepy and mysterious sci-fi elements that was in the original. It's a watchable movie but it just goes in a very narrow and direct direction and not in a good way either. Nothing is really imaginative and it just didn't get me immersed or interested on what was going on. I was just going along with it until it ended. The original \"Planet of the Apes\" was far-fetched but this was is more non-believable and even absurd. Also maybe if it tried to modernize it in a cool sci-fi direction it might have been at least somewhat entertaining but it lacked that as well while having the similar corniness of the original. The apes being apes didn't even play a crucial part in the story.4.5/10",

Such a pity.The film offered no surprises, other than the guffaws of disbelief from many in the crowded theater.  I'm still trying to understand why somebody felt the original movie, deserving of much praise, had to be remade.The primate characters looked like actors wearing rubber masks.  Nearly every set looked like... well, a set.  Several characters (ie. young warboy), invisible during the development of the story, somehow become important near the end of the film.  But without character background, I felt nothing for them.  The requisite buxom blonde was easy to look at, but left me wondering why she was even there.  Any romance angle between man/blonde or man/girl-illa was undeveloped and anemic, and shouldn't have even been attempted.This was one lame waste of a Friday night, and my hard-earned money.",

            "content": "Okay, if you don't know... the original Planet of the Apes movie was hailed as a classic. Despite being basically a B-movie with a load of men in rubber masks, it had a unique ending which will be remembered throughout cinema history (if you don't know what it is, then I won't spoil it by telling you). Therefore, now we have the remake (or 're-envisioning' as the film-makers like to call it), it had two choices: either copy the original ending and leave everyone saying they ripped off the first, or try to match it for shock value.I don't think they would have won doing either. They tried 'shock value' and failed.However, if you ignore that, Planet of the Apes (the remake) isn't actually a bad movie. If you like sci-fi (and can forgive the blasphemy of remaking such a classic) you should at least enjoy the make-up - which is awesome for creating new and varied races of apes.Not counting the ending, there are other negatives, too. There are more human characters, most of which don't get the screen time they deserve to be fully developed (and any fans of Kris Kristophen will feel short-changes as his addition is basically an extended cameo). Plus the action isn't that action-packed (but then Tim Burton is hardly an 'action director').However, despite the negatives, it's still not a bad movie. It'll never be the classic that the original was and it was a disappointment at the box office (meaning the ending will never get the explanation it deserved). Don't expect too much and enjoy the grisly performance of Tim Roth as the evil ape leader and not being able to recognise Helena Bonham Carter in her make-up.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",

Being a big fan of the original POA film & TV series (& cartoons), I was looking forward to this film, though with some apprehension.

Heston: \"Damn them...Damn them all to Hell!\" and of course, he had a gun in his room.While watching this film, I had a problem with almost everything. From the gigantic halls of the space craft to the pathetic sound stage of Ape City. Don't you think that by the 22nd century, people who work with primates would figure out the difference between apes & monkeys? How many USAF captains would disobey a direct order from a 4-star general by flying out into danger? Probably half of the ape actors really walked correctly (as an ape's pelvis would allow). It sure was great that the spaceship worked after so many thousand years. Boy, they don't make 'em like that anymore. At least the apes bungee jumping around didn't look as pathetic as Crouching Tiger.I still can't tell if this was supposed to be a serious sci-fi drama or a spoof on the original. I guess I should have guessed what was in store when I saw in the opening credits \"Based on A novel by Pierre Boule\" and not \"Based on THE novel by Pierre Boule.\"On the plus side, Helena Carter was excellent, the ape costumes were fantastic and the cinematography was very good. However, they didn't save the movie or the world. Avoid this film unless you are a hopeless Apes fan...like me.",

The production is cheap, the image is blurry and the cast is a big disappointment: Wahlberg does his macho type as usual, Warren is totally transparent, Carter begins her boring relationship with Tim. Roth is the only character that makes efforts to act actually like a ape.The end is a good surprise but it's too little, too late and above all it shows an entire movie behind: as some wrote on the board, during the absurd fast return trip of Whalberg, we must understand that Thades uses the second time-pod to get back on earth before Walhberg.

            "content": "When Charlton Heston fell to the first planet of the apes, it offered something profound. It neatly and cleverly captured much of the social climate of the late 60s. Though not without its antecedents, it certainly has to stand as one of the more important social commentary films posing as sci-fi. Burton's remake, however, doesn't even seem to have a coherent story line. I first saw the Burton film upon its release and found it sorely lacking then. But I worried that my reaction might be too colored by my affection for the original. Remakes are frequently hated by fans of the original, and I didn't want to spout off with an unexamined emotional outburst. But I just sat through it again (this time on TV) and my loathing hasn't diminished. Wahlberg's performance still strikes me as wooden and lacking in purpose. From the very moment of his arrival to the ape world, his only objective is to escape from the planet. So why did he travel out to the planet in the first place? Heston's character of more than 30 years past at least went to explore (to see if there was anything better than man out there). Baker's ape makeup in the remake was good, but effects alone can't make a movie. The humans were no doubt the worst characters in the remake. Like Wahlberg they lacked any depth, and their passivity to ape domination produced more annoyance instead of sympathy. In the original the humans were primitive mutes whose mannerisms were bestial. They brought on pity one might feel for a hunted animal, which they were supposed to be. Another strikingly annoying element in the Burton film was the strange love triangle formed by Helena Bonham Carter as a chimp (albeit a very cute chimp), the collagen-lipped Estella Warren as a primitive human, and Wahlberg. I have no idea what Burton was going for there. While Burton's early films didn't wow me, they nonetheless didn't annoy me. My first impression was simply that he could churn out glitzy Hollywood pablum. Then he made Ed Wood and I suddenly wondered if I had overlooked a film genius. But the profound lack of substance in Apes convinces me that I was right the first time. (And Big Fish hasn't caused me to alter that view).",

            "content": "I'm not entirely familiar with all of the other Planet of the Apes films, but I don't think there could be anything in any of them that would change my mind about the 2001 version. We start off with an electrical storm in space that results in some serious time travel, just like we saw in Lost In Space, which results in our hero winding up thousands of years in the future and on an unknown planet. Seconds after surviving the crash landing of his pod on this mysterious planet, Leo Davidson (Mark Walhberg) finds himself surrounded by fleeing HUMANS. The first thing I thought was that there are humans and apes on an unknown planet in an unknown galaxy roughly 5000 years in the future, but later we learn (also as seen in Lost In Space) that Leo's ship also passed through that time warp and landed in the same place, leaving the humans to go into submission to the out-of-control apes that were on the ship for experimentation, and the apes themselves were left to evolve and take control, ultimately turning into the hard-nosed apes that ruled the planet when Leo crash landed. That was a mouthful. Pretty creative though, once we are eventually informed as to what the hell is going on. So Leo is stuck on this planet where the roles are basically reversed and exaggerated between humans and apes, and now it is entirely up to Leo to save this planet's version of the human race from the oppression of the apes. Tim Roth delivers a horribly annoying performance as General Thade, the militant leader of the apes who is so filled with hatred for the humans (for reasons never made entirely clear) that he operates just like a machine. He's always grunting and growling and always has his head tilted downward like he's expecting physical confrontation at all times, and his constant guttural tone of voice makes him almost amusing after a while. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that the apes are so well made up, but they also have tremendous intelligence, as is made evident by their strikingly human eyes, and yet they switch back and forth from normal speech to the same screeching and screaming that you hear from the monkeys at the zoo. There is a scene where General Thade is told that the humans crossed the river using the apes' own horses, and he jumps all around the place, screeching and jumping and breaking things, and then he's back on the ground talking like a warrior. It's so hard to take this stuff seriously.Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as Ari, the weirdly attractive ape who is disgruntled with the way that the humans are treated by the apes, and who turns against her own kind to help the humans escape. There is a childish scene at the end of the film where Leo kisses Ari that is sure to get a laugh from any audience, while the stunningly but almost weirdly beautiful Estella Warren provides the human love interest. It's a good thing that they had a human woman in this movie to take romantic interest in Leo, because without her we only have Ari, who is 100% ape but who acts exactly like a human woman while interacting with Leo. For the first half of the film, I was a little nervous about the possibility of a little bestiality happening somewhere in there. So we know that Ari is helping the humans because she is disillusioned with her violent species, but they are also accompanied by another ape - Attar, I think (hey, half the fun was trying to figure out who was underneath all that make-up, right?) - and we never know why he agrees to go along, knowing that he will face severe punishment upon returning, which is one of the movies more simplistic but peeving oversights. It is, however, the ending of the film that ruins it beyond all hope for being saved.\nAt the beginning of the film, when Leo took off in the pod toward the electrical storm, he was going after the pod of his chimp, with whom all communication had been lost. He gets swept away in the same electrical storm as the chimp got caught in, and winds up on the planet described above. At the end of the film, the chimp comes through right in the middle of the climactic battle between the humans and the apes, and the apes bow down to him as their god. This was actually a pretty clever scene, because he was, in fact, one of the first apes of their civilization, and then Leo trades places with him, leaving him with Ari (and with an obviously broken leg, which we're left to assume turned out okay) and taking the ship back to his own time. And General Thade, I guess, was just left sulking under that console on the ship forever, doomed to live the rest of his life as a loose end in a sub-par sci fi movie. It was bad enough that everything on the ship still worked after thousands of years, now they have to leave stuff everywhere unexplained.So we get back to Earth, Leo survives the entrance through the atmosphere and then miraculously survives another violent crash landing without a scratch, and he finds the Lincoln Monument is an ape (when I saw Lincoln from behind, I jokingly said to myself that it would be an ape. I was disappointed and amused to find that I was right). This could, of course, mean only one thing. Seeing how there was barely an explanation for the English speaking humans and apes on the planet on which most of the film took place, and there was literally none at all given for the apes replacing the humans on Earth, we can only assume that they ran out of money or they are just setting up for a sequel. My money is on the latter. Stay tuned for part 9 (or so).",

My theory is that he desperately wanted that his films make money again after the not-too-enthusiastically-received likes of Ed Wood and Mars Attacks, (how else can you explain his fruitless endeavour to resurrect the Superman franchise?) and after the relative success of Sleepy Hollow, he managed to gain access to Fox's resurrection of the Planet of the Apes franchise.

It was filmed by Tim Burton, but he really was just a gun-for-hire, a film that was not made with his usual Gothic style.Planet of the Apes is set in 2029, and focuses on Leo (Mark Walberg), a US air force pilot based on a space station. On the station the air force use apes to help do tasks and pilot small pods. A wormhole opens and one of the apes is sent to investigate. When it seems that the chimpanzee was in trouble Leo follows the apes through the wormhole. After going through it Leo crash-lands in a strange jungle and encounters humanized-apes. He is captured with other humans and sold to slavery. Leo is brought by a human-sympathiser, Ari (Helena Botham Carter), and with other humans escape from the city. This leads to them getting chased by the ape army, led by General Thade (Tim Roth).As I say, the make-up by Rick Baker was very good and truly Oscar-worthy. The special-effects were good, and there was some good action scenes. However the film was lackluster and really a by-the-numbers affair. There was a poor script with this film, and the story telling was nothing like the original film. There was nothing deep about this film and just shows apes as evil and humans as good. In the original film humans were neutral and all except Charlton Heston were mute whilst the apes were more of a mixed-bag. The original Planet of the Apes was seen at time as a satire, for example the backwards issue of not teaching the theory of evolution. In this film the idea of religion was decent, but could have been more. The remake was really just a chase movie. The acting for the apes was good and well casted. Helena Botham Carter is always good and Tim Roth loved playing the evil general. Michael Clarke Duncan was also decent in it. However, the human actors were not so well-developed and this film was not Walberg's finest hour. I also didn't like Paul Giamatti as an Oranga-tan slave trader, he was only in the film to add comic relief. The other major problem with this film was the ending. The original had a great ending which everyone should know. This film's ending was sub-par. I did not like how the battle ended and the aftermath of the battle (similar to my opinions to X-Men 3). Everyone has also criticised the plot-twist at the end.I admit, when I was younger I did enjoy the film from an action-adventure viewpoint; but even then I did not like the plot twist. However, this film does have it fans like Mark Kermode and Richard Roeper.One to miss in my opinion.",

The makeup is impressive, but it can't make up for bad writing. Then there's the plot holes. The apes have mastered the art of warfare but can't figure out how to get across a pond. The humans run around in what look like costumes from \"Caveman\", yet they speak modern American English. Mark Walhberg looks like he's trying to escape from the movie, not the planet.

Even his most flawed movie (up til now) 'Mars Attacks!' was more interesting and entertaining than most of his contemporaries best efforts. Everything about this film is a mess. Not just the asinine script, but the direction is dull, the decent cast is wasted under the unimpressive make up, and the \"surprise\" ending a complete anti-climax.

            "review_title": "Rushed, shallow, and uninvolving",
            "content": "It's hard to talk about this movie without touching on its production history. This is a poster child for a studio using a recognizable name to hit a release date. They were going to release this in July of 2001 no matter what, and they rushed everything along. It's possible to deliver a good movie with a constantly changing script like The Great Escape, but it's more of a recipe for a mess. Tim Burton was not given any time to figure out his vision for the film, and he just filmed, at breakneck speed, a script that didn't know what it was or what it was about.Captain Leo Davidson is a pilot on a space station orbiting Saturn who's in charge of ape pilots. When an unusual electro-magnetic storm sweeps by, they send in an ape who promptly gets lost, and then Davidson jumps into a pod without orders to try and find him. He gets hit by stuff and crash lands in a forest on a new planet. Before he can settle, he's swept up in a chase of apes looking to round up humans. By the time Davidson is in a cage, being carted off to Ape City, a grand twenty minutes have passed in the film, and that's the greatest source of the movie's problems. It just simply moves too quickly, covering everything too shallowly, and more concerned with visual spectacle than actual storytelling.On the space station, we get introduced to two humans beyond Davidson, and neither of them matter once he's off the station. On the planet, we get views of about half a dozen humans who are going to tag along with Davidson through the end of the film and they never make any sort of impression. The apes do a better job, though. There's Thade, an ape general and the chief protagonist, and Ari, the human rights loving daughter of a senator. The thing is that this movie feels like their story, but they don't get introduced until the half hour point and they are very much not the focus. Davidson never gets any sort of emotional connection to anything on this planet, insisting on just getting off as soon as possible. So, our main character is a vessel obsessed with a single object and refuses any emotional attachments, while two of our supporting characters have the actual emotional support but are so far pushed into the background that every moment feels like it comes out of nowhere.Davidson escapes, brings along his human companions and Ari, picks up the slave trader, Limbo, who had bought the humans from the military (whose only purpose seems to be picking up humans in forests), and they walk into the Forbidden Area. Meanwhile, Thade visits his father in the one scene that probably exemplifies everything wrong with this movie in microcosm.So, Thade's father is played by Charlton Heston, proving that he's a great actor even under fantastic ape makeup. In this scene, we get introduced to a character who's never been seen before and gets discarded by the end, an object of great value we've never seen before and gets destroyed by the end in what's supposed to be a great dramatic moment, and callbacks to the original movie that end up falling flat. There's no setup to anything that happens in this scene. It all just happens in quick succession, and none of it impacts with any emotion. It's a dead scene that's supposed to be full of meaning and winks to the audience that end up working against it. Much like the rest of the movie.The thing about callbacks is that they are jokey by nature. It's hard to make a callback of something extremely well known work dramatically because we all have the, \"I know that reference,\" reaction that undermines the dramatic import of the moment. So, when Attar looks down at Davidson and says, \"Take your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human,\" the audience is chuckling instead of feeling any kind of fear. When Charlton Heston says, \"Damn them...damn them all to hell!\" we have the same kind of guffaw instead of any other emotion at the death of a character, who we haven't seen before this very scene.I'm not sure when it became de rigueur for pretty much every action/adventure movie of a certain budget to end with a battle scene against two armies, but Planet of the Apes is one of the most ridiculous of them. An army showing up out of nowhere in the minutes before the battle, flying apes with super jump abilities, and the death of side characters with dramatic feel that fall flat is how this whole thing works out. It's bizarre and it betrays the fact that no one understood where the dramatic core of this movie was.There are no ideas at play in this film. It's just a bunch of people running around for two hours without ever giving the audience any time to think about any ideas or characters or even setting.I've avoided talking about the original because this re-imagining of the idea works so poorly on its own that there's really no need for comparison, but I do think that a comparison is justified in order to help explain why the 2001 version fails so badly. Just look at the first half hour of each of them. In the original, we get a very clear idea of who our main character, Taylor, is and what he believes. We get a steady build on the setting of this new world that comes to a shock at the sight of apes riding horses. In the re-imagining, we have a bevy of characters running around talking in inanities that don't matter, special effects, and then an action scene without ever getting to know anything about our main character, Davidson, other than that he loves his ape and wants to get it back. It's thin at its absolute best, and that's not very good.This was Tim Burton's lowest point, but because of studio pressure on the production timeline, it could be excused to a certain extent. However, he went on to make Alice in Wonderland, so we all know that he had further depths to explore. This is a prime example of how not to reboot a moribund franchise. But, the ape makeup is absolutely fantastic, the movie looks pretty good most of the time, and this might be my favorite Danny Elfman score. So, it has that going for it.",

            "content": "In 1968, the world's fascination with outer space was still largely in the science-fiction realm. Sure, we'd put some men in space, but no one had landed on any foreign worlds. We imagined, through the voices of such authors as Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, interstellar travel and advanced civilizations. But all of that seemed to be part of the distant future in 1968.Here were are 33 years later, and while we haven't traveled to other galaxies or met any other civilizations (advanced or otherwise, Whitley Strieber's experiences notwithstanding), we have put a man on the moon and are hard at work on the international space station. In short, in 33 years we've come a long way, baby.Anyone who has seen the original 1968 Planet of the Apes knows that the ending is a real kicker. I certainly won't give it away here, because there's an entire generation that hasn't seen the movie and most certainly should. Suffice to say that the original is unique, not simply another sci-fi flick.The new one is termed a \"rethinking\" of the original. Tim Burton, who gave us Edward Scissorhands, Batman, PeeWee's Big Adventure, and Sleepy Hollow,is the director here, and the film is full of his stylish touch.Mark Wahlberg is Captain Leo Davidson, an astronaut in 2029 on a small space station that is conduction experiments on chimps. An electrical storm strikes, and a chimp is sent out to survey the cause. When the animal does not return, Davidson launches himself - against his commander's orders - to find him. Next thing he knows, his space pod is crash landing on an unknown planet inhabited by talking, aggressive apes - with humans as slaves.Davidson is captured by the apes along with other humans, but escapes. His plan - get back to where his pod crashed, find his GPS-like device that will allow him to locate his mother ship, and get back home. But it's a long way back to the pod, and he suddenly has thousands of apes after him.Luckily, he has on his side Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), a kindhearted ape who feels empathy toward the humans. Ari, of course, symbolizes animal lovers on Earth; she cannot understand why her fellow apes treat their humans so badly. \"We can learn much from them,\" she claims, but her claims fall on deaf ears. Davidson, with the help of Ari, leads a small band of refugee humans (including the Daena, played by the delicious Estelle Warren) to his pod, where he makes some startling discoveries, none of which will be revealed here. (If you've seen the original and know the surprise ending, the discoveries Davidson makes are as intriguing as that ending.)Hot on the trail of the astronaut and his friends is the evil General Thade (Tim Roth) and his fiercest warrior Colonel Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan). The makeup jobs on all of the apes are astounding, and the actors are completely unrecognizable under their disguises. The general has been told by his ailing father (an uncredited Charlton Heston, who starred in the 1968 original) that humans, in the time before time, humans brought violence to their planet; now that apes dominate, humans must be destroyed.\nAs with the original, this is a fascinating treatise not only on how we treat  other animals but on how we treat ourselves. Is it truly accurate to say that humans are civilized and the apes are the savages? The film actually makes you think about such things, but it's no philosophical hodge-podge of mumbo-jumbo. It's a exciting, powerful movie, worth watching on just about every level.",

It's an excellent movie, which didn't need a remake, if not to make it more appealing to a new generation of film-lovers. Tim Burton's \"reimagining\" of the movie was interesting on paper, no doubt about that, but it's also the most disappointing film he's done so far.Burton already did sci-fi in 1996, directing the hilarious Mars Attacks!. Now, that movie may have looked like his most un-Burton-like project, but it worked, thanks to the witty script, which perfectly reflected the director's freaky sense of humor, and the terrific cast (Nicholson, DeVito, Natalie Portman, Pierce Brosnan et al). Planet of the Apes, on the other hand, contains the quintessential burtonian theme (outcasts feared by other people), and it's really, really dark compared to the original, but its strength is all in the style: from Rick Baker's utterly realistic make-up to Danny Elfman's \"simian\" score, the movie is perfect, technically speaking. It's the storytelling and acting that aren't always as good as expected.The screenplay, while repeating the same basic idea - human astronaut ends up on another world where intelligent apes have enslaved mankind -, is supposedly more faithful to Pierre Boulle's novel, especially the ending (I won't spoil it, but it's far less shocking than what Charlton Heston saw back in 1968), although it suffers from one detail: much of the original version's charm had to do, among other things, with the fact that humans didn't talk on the Planet, making Heston's presence more intriguing. In Burton's movie, they can talk, which leads to an obvious question: why did no none try to have a reasonable conversation with the apes? Sure, that would have killed the movie right away, but it just feels pointless to introduce this new aspect and not develop it.The other weak element is the acting, particularly the \"humans\": Mark Wahlberg has none of the charisma he had in Boogie Nights, and his co-stars (Kris Kristofferson, Estella Warren) don't impress that much either. It's the monkeys that deserve our attention, most notably Helena Bonham Carter as the human-loving scientist and Tim Roth as evil general Thade (a treat for fans: Charlton Heston plays Roth's daddy). They bring intensity to their characters and Carter in particular succeeds in bringing new life to one of the most loved primates from Franklin J. Schaffner's classic.Overall not a very bad film, but we expected more from the man who gave us the \"new\" versions of Batman and Ichabod Crane. Too much studio interference, perhaps?",

Having already had to take one of the most popular comic book characters to the big screen in Batman, he then had to recreate the legend of Sleepy Hollow, before turning his eye to one of cinema's all-time classics in Planet of the Apes.Mark Wahlberg was cast in the role of main human (likened to Charlton Heston's in the original) whereas Britain's Helena Bonham-Carter was given a chance to rip up the bodices and put on the make up to become an ape along with Tim Roth and Michael Clarke-Duncan.After being dragged through a wormhole in the middle of an electrical storm, Captain Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) crash lands on a remote planet where humans are the slaves and apes rule. A sympathetic primate named Ari (Bonham-Carter) is against the suffering inflicted on humans by apes however and helps Leo along with the other human slaves escape. Eager not to let their capture get away, the ape army led by Thade (Tim Roth) and Colonel Attar (Clarke-Duncan) give pursuit as Leo frantically heads back to his ship.With so much to live up to in following the original, Tim Burton was always going to struggle to win over fans of the first. His work is as usual, dark and mysterious with most of the action taking place at night. Although adding to the planet's mystique, Burton's style does also often make it difficult to actually figure out what's going on. His re-worked ending is intriguing yet leaves many questions unanswered, with few of the plot lines coming together to complete the picture; this despite the fact that barely an hour of story has been stretched out to fill nearly two.The scenes of violence toward the end are well choreographed, but are also disturbing with all-too-lifelike apes and humans literally beating the life out of each other. It's partly from this though where the one saving grace liesThe quality of the make up work is excellent as Tim Roth, Michael Clarke-Duncan and Helena Bonham-Carter, amongst others, are transformed into perfect ape-creatures. As was shown with Godzilla however, special effects are nothing compared to solid story and the writers fail to offer anything new that can match let alone eclipse the original.Planet of the Apes 2001 is by no means a bad film, but with so much to hype and expectation to live up to it was always going to fall short. It's worth seeing for the make up jobs alone, but if you a real treat then rent the original.3/10",

The ape actors could have been doing voice-overs for animatronics for all the make-up let them emote, which I hadn't felt in the original movie, and Roth's voice really got into the role (he'd turned down the Snapes role in the Harry Potter movie for this?).But sound was the best part of the movie, and it was really loud.

I find it hard to believe that this film, dreadful though it was overall, wasn't nominated for an Oscar in any of these categories, especially given some of the lacklustre work that WAS nominated, like \"Am\u00e9lie\"? and \"The Fellowship of the Ring\".  And it's not as if any of the other art direction nominees are particularly dazzling, either.  But \"Planet of the Apes\" IS dazzling.  The world has its own intriguing version of everything, from tents to buckles to embossed armour designs, and the ape suits are so invisibly convincing we forget that there are human actors underneath even when we have a live chimpanzee as a point of comparison.Tim Burton began life as an animator and the best film he's had anything to do with (\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\") owes almost everything to his fantastic designs.  But, as is becoming increasingly clear, he rose to hislevel of incompetence when he became a director.  \"Planet of the Apes\" is superb visually, but in no other way.  And even to say that it's superb visually is misleading.  The climactic battle scene is wrong in almost every way it's possible for a climactic battle scene to be wrong: it's all confusing close-ups of characters whumping one another, with no overall design, or end, in sight - until the deus ex machina that we'd all seen coming an hour ago descends to bring the tedious violence to a merciful end.Burton clearly WANTS to be able to spin a gripping yarn.  Why else does he tell this particular story?  But he can't draw us close to any of the characters, he can't tell the difference between mushy clich\u00e9 and invigorating simplicity (the \"inspiring\" dialogue manages to be banal without making any sense), and he can't take three paces without tripping over his own irony.  Irony?  More like flippancy.  Comments like \"You can't solve the human problem by throwing money at it - we tried that, and all we got was a welfare state that nearly crippled us\" are the work of screenwriters who live in terror of being caught out being sincere about something, who want to cover their tracks by suggesting that, not only don't they mean what they're saying, they don't mean anything.Anyone who doubts that Burton's film is flippant through and through will have their doubts dispelled by ending.  The original film is famous for the twist at the end - so famous, in fact, that that particular twist cannot be used again.  A pity, for it was a good one.  It made sense - more importantly, it made sense OF the earlier parts of the film - and it had a good deal of poetic force.  Burton decided to ditch poetic force and all that jazz in order to preserve the least essential aspect of the twist in the original - its shock value.  His ending is shocking, all right.  It makes no sense.  It's easy to shock if you're prepared to break off the narrative in mid-sentence and start talking nonsense.Mark Wahlberg is as unappealing as he ever has been, and it can't all be the script's fault.  He goes through the whole film without once dropping the belligerent expression of an ex-rapper who wants to maintain his \"cred\". And Estella Warren looks like one of those almost supernaturally unappealing models who grace the pages of the latest generation of men's magazines (Maxim, FHM, etc.), with computer-generated skin and computer-animated anatomy, dressed up as a cavegirl - not for the film, but for a photoshoot.P.S.:  What the hell did Burton mean when he said that this wasn't a remake, but a \"re-imagining\"?  What's the distinction?  I thought remakes WERE re-imaginings.",

            "content": "Yup, with all the resources available in Hollywood (not to mention the technical advances over 3 decades), Tim Burton has managed to film the 5th best film in the 6 film PLANET OF THE APES saga. Well, actually, I'd say it's a 5th place tie with the ignominious closer to the original series BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES. Advertised as a 're-imagining', it's much closer to 'rip-off' of the original. The thievery even begins with hack composer Danny Elfman's outright mimicking of Jerry Goldsmith's groundbreaking original score. What else has been 're-imagined'? Campy \"ape\" comedy? - been done. Twist on man/ape evolution? - been there. Use of an American monument for the 'shock' ending? - done that. Call me a heretic, but I was disappointed by Rick Baker's makeup. Not the makeup per se (they are to his usual excellent standard), but the design. Why do all the female apes look like simian version of LaToya and Janet Jackson? Sorry, I believe John Chambers' designs were superior 30 years ago. And, the ending(s)? Well, the main plot \"twist\" I predicted sight unseen over 6 months ago (Burton kept insisting that it would be \"different\" from the original, yet have a twist. So, the film's main evolutionary twist was easily forseen). The \"double twist\" at the end is both meaningless and far-fetched. I don't wanna be a spoiler like that #$#$! idiot Matt Drudge, so all I'll say is that the \"shocker\" ending is meaningless because it doesn't evolve logically by the events in the film (as the original's did) - it's just a twist for \"a twist's\" sake. Burton felt obligated to \"top\" the original, so he \"had\" to tag one on. Logically, it's far-fetched because for the ending to make sense, EVERYTHING in this new Evolutionary construct would have had to occur in EXACTLY the same way as modern Earth evolution to have THAT \"monumental\" ending. A disappointment all around",

But an abrupt detour through a space time wormhole lands him on a strange planet where talking apes rule over the human race. With the help of a sympathetic chimpanzee activist named Ari and a small band of human rebels, Leo leads the effort to evade the advancing Gorilla Army led by General Thade and his most trusted warrior Attar. Now the race is on to reach a sacred temple within the planet's Forbidden Zone to discover the shocking secrets of mankind's past - and the key to its future.I was really looking forward to this film and finally, I've seen it. It was a good movie, but the ending ruined it. Let's start at the beginning. The score was appropriately themed with the movie. It was wonderfully cast by great actors and actresses. The action and story was good.Well, what's wrong with the ending? It's one of the most pathetic excuses to leave open a sequel (AKA: The cliffhanger). Ugh, if only that would be different, I would recommend this good picture. The one liners were cheesy but I didn't mind it. The makeup effects were excellent (you couldn't tell which actors/actresses were which). Some CGI shots were also pretty good.I like Tim Burton's look on the whole world is great. The plot was surprisingly complicated (not like a mind puzzle, though). Mark Whelberg plays one handsome protagonist. Tim Roth plays a surprisingly creepy and angry antagonist and Helena Bonham Carter's performance was really sympathetic. And last but not least, Paul Giamatti gives a great comedic role.I'll say it again: The ending ruined the film. I hated it.

He had NO RIGHT however messing with PLANET OF THE APES, a great film that was majorly under-valued critically (NOT at the box-office) even on its release in 1968. \"Are things so bad that BEN-HUR has to start mixing it with Gorillas?\" proclaimed one dumb-ass reviewer! Wonder what he would have written about this?Well guys for whats its worth, here's my assessment! In a word, INSULTING to the original! (and to anyone in the audience of moderate intelligence.) Obviously  geared towards two distinctly identifiable social groups: those who have never seen the original series and today's (for the most part) attention-deficient audiences, who just want some one-dimensional entertainment to accompany their popcorn (or ecstasy tablet). Burton is selling himself short here - he is worth more than that.\nPLANET OF THE APES (2001) is not categorically a turkey, the special effects are excellent, although the incessant use of digitizing becomes wearisome eventually. What IS wrong with it is loopy Wahlberg as an intergalactic Captain....I mean could you take this guy seriously? Would YOU rather fly to Alpha Centauri with Chuck Heston at the controls or under the direction of some guy who flashes his \"jewels\" while boogeying?  Aimed at a \"youthful,\" marketable audience, sure he's your man, but in the interests of credibility, Wahlberg is a 10-1 longshot! The film suffers from ludicrously unstable continuity with a script to match - it is sheerly a visual extravaganza. Obviously in an attempt to play down the social and paradoxical issues of the original (coz you might have to actually THINK!) Burton has gone for noise and movement.The marvellous ending of the 1968 film (probably only ever equalled in power by THE USUAL SUSPECTS) is replaced by an obviously tacked-on \"lets not worry how to explain this - anything to leave us a sequel\" finale.  In the upshot, not the embarrassment Gus Van Sant's PSYCHO was, but totally unnecessary and totally unsatisfying!",

            "content": "(Original: 3/10. Remake: 7/10.)Firstly, let me warn readers that this will be more of a rant than an even-minded critique; so if balance and objectivity are what you're searching for, you'd be better served by seeking out a positive review of the '68 version... I'm in the mood to make possibly unfair comparisons, and I'll make no attempt to hide that - so if you don't find yourself disgusted with me at this point, then read on...* I watched the original last night; Heston put a black mark on the film for me straight away. He has the sense of authority and presence only of a poor man's Clint Eastwood; and he looks like he would be better suited to working in Infomercials, with his manner of gazing earnestly into the camera and intoning gravely. OK, to be fair; Wahlberg is no better here, but it makes for a more believable crew and surroundings if the 'leading man' has gone AWOL and you don't have someone who carries his reputation before him constantly looking to unduly milk significance from the script. Wahlberg makes a better Everyman, so you see him more 'in character' than when you watch Heston, who typifies a Hollywood landmark.* You don't think of Kubrick and his Odyssey, when you watch this update. The sinister overlords are revealed much more stealthily. Unfortunately, Stanley cornered the market for 'primate roaming barren landscape' imagery just a few months after Schaffner's work opened, and there's no doubt which is the more memorable image in these modern years. Such is life. Burton doesn't even try to approach from such an angle, and it works. I suppose that's one reason I can get aboard the 're-imagination' train, because at least we get a newer look...* There's less 'blithe imperialism' tossed about in our politically correct days. \"Give it a few weeks and you could own this place\", someone mentions to Heston on our first trip. OK, now I as the audience think you DESERVE to be subjugated for your arrogance! All our modern young explorers want to do is repair their mistakes, though; so yep, they're the winners of my sympathy vote. Chalk up another 'moral victory'...* A bigger budget and more 'experimental' supporting cast may mean we get better makeup; but what's much more crucial is the improved interpretation of speech. No more do we have to put up with creatures who intimidate and horrify us with their appearance, but nevertheless all have voices that remind us uncannily of the nearest fishmonger from down the high street. Happily, this time our villains manage to sound unfamiliar and scary, to boot!* The forefather possibly started a flagellation fetish for those would be conquerors of brave new frontiers, further exploited by \"A Man Called Horse\", amongst others... Luckily, Burton opted for uneasy laughs instead; hanging our human friends in cages as an in-joke. It would thankfully be another few years before \"The Passion of The Christ\" caused some squirming in seats and revived masochism as the cinematic trend of the age...If you ask me; it looks like the passage of time does favours for ALL civilisations... !",

            "content": "Believe it or not this tale of a time-traveling astronaut faced with a civilisation ruled by super-evolved apes in an alternate universe is director Tim Burton's most straightforward film yet.Leo Davidson's (Mark Wahlberg) love for his monkey impels him to pursue it through a space anomaly that propels him forward thousands of years. Leo finds himself on a new planet inhabited by various types of monkeys, all highly evolved and English speaking, which is a plus\u0085 But they aren't alone on the planet. The jungles and remote areas around the monkey settlements are rife with humans, some more opinionated monkeys say 'infested'. Almost immediately upon landing on this new planet Leo is captured and bundled in with various other newly nabbed humans to be taken to Monktropolis (not really but it should've been) to be onsold to others.This is where Leo learns of the basic role reversal that this particular 'planet of the apes' experiences. The undisputed rulers of the land are all hairy and like bananas. Depending on their background or upbringing they all deem the humans as potential equals (best case scenario), slaves and house help (middling) or vermin to be exterminated (worst case).The obvious parallels between the current human / animal relationship is constantly and often clumsily highlighted, leading to 127 too many 'tee-hee, they're just like us' moments.After introducing the few main monkey characters including ruthless army leader Colonel Thade (Tim Roth), a slave trading orang-utan played by Paul Giamatti and his human friendly daughter Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), Davidson and a few humans escape from captivity and with Ari in tow head to the badlands, hoping to find answers to questions that needn't be asked.The last hour or so in this uneven two hour monkey-fest descends into a straight up actioner, and not necessarily a good one, the 'twist' ending straight up sucks and is likely the reason that a sequel wasn't even considered, and Burton shows that as a story-teller he does great visuals. Speaking of visuals, the sets are all immaculate and lush, the monkey makeup is for the most part excellent \u2013 especially Tim Roth \u2013 and the costumes are all well made, the CGI was wisely limited given the limitations of the time and doesn't stand out too much for the wrong reasons.But all the above merely makes Planet of the Apes an immaculately presented, well acted confusing and frustrating effort. After taking so long to ensure that Thade is the bad guy he is never called upon to do much with all his pent up rage and evil, and just why a monkey driven civilisation is such a bad thing is never addressed.After all, lying around scratching yourself and eating is hardly the worst way to go is it? Final Rating \u2013 6.5 / 10. A couple of decent scenes and some creative visuals can't overcome a bland and often lost plot. Tim Burton does 'oddballs in outfits' better than most, not this time",

People scream that the makeup effects weren't well done. Well, what do you expect from an attempt to synthesise human faces with ape bodies? I felt they were done just the right way... such that they looked like apes but the actors were still recognisable.Tim Burton's deft touch in the set design and photography lends his usual dark edge to the film, making it far more grown-up in appearance than the pastel-like sequels to the original Planet Of The Apes, especially the television series. Everything looks a lot more believeable, and the sets appear much more functional. The Omeron looks much more like a deep-space research station, and the flight pods look more like they were designed for their purpose.Mark Wahlberg is good as a caring human being, and I really believed in his compassion for the monkey, but he doesn't quite possess that leader quality. I think it would have been better if he'd been supported by one or two more humans from the space station. The ending, such as it is, had me a little perplexed too. Here is a man standing on the verge of a brave new world where men and other members of the animal kingdom can be educated to work together in harmony, he has a beautiful woman who wants him, and he decides to go home. Sorry, I just couldn't buy that, but then, it's pretty plain to me that the Earth of 2001 just sucks.Still, with all the barbs about inter-species arrogance, reverse racism, and the origins of cults, Planet Of The Apes is one film that should be given a fairer hearing.

From the same man, we've had a Batman who acts more like a real millionaire whose parents were murdered in front of him as a boy would, and a Sleepy Hollow that reads more like a Shakespeare play, highlighting as Washington Irving's original story does how badly this overrated poet's dialogues fail to reflect real human speech. In this new version of Planet Of The Apes, we get to see an air force pilot who behaves like an air force pilot, an ape civilisation that behaves like an ape civilisation, and a metaphor for the civil rights struggle that reads more like the X-Men feature film than the restrained, \"don't want to upset the powers that be\" style of the television series.I've read on this site that the film is simply rehashed in order to suit those with short attention spans. Not true. All through the film, one thinks of how a simple collection of apes from a research station could have evolved into almost-bipedial, talking ones with more distinctive personalities. The next few sentences may spoil any surprises, so those of you who have not seen the film yet can scroll past them at your leisure. One aspect of the film I found a bit disappointing is the fact that the original talking ape who is referred to as CMOS by his descendants is never fully explained. His origins and the reason he is called that are never really talked about, and I originally thought he would be the monkey that Wahlberg's character shot off into space in order to rescue. I must admit, however, that ending the battle between the humans and the apes by having said monkey land right in the middle of them was a fine touch. The metaphor for religion by showing that CMOS, this figure the apes worship for being the original free ape, got to start his own civilisation by murdering the humans who were originally caring for him, was an ingenious stroke. My only real complaint relates to the ending. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, unlike some internet sites, but were I in this pilot's position, I honestly would have stayed. It's not every day that one gets a chance to help build a new civilisation with two very different races are just learning to work with each other. Compared to the planet Earth as it is today, and it shows no signs of ever getting better, it is a real paradise.Given all the displays in the film of appalling behaviour towards humans and each other by the apes, and how they resolve themselves, I think Tim Burton's reinterpretation manages to drive home a point that I seriously doubt the original films and television series would have been allowed to. The fact that not all racism is white-on-black seems a taboo subject in 2001, but one that this film handles metaphorically in an intelligent way. Give it a try without the prejudice of original Apes series fans to blinker you, and it may just surprise you. Encourage yourself to think of a better ending, though. Encourage yourself to think of all the different ways the apes could have evolved, in fact. This is not Planet Of The Apes Lite... it is Planet Of The Apes non-Disney style, something we need applied to more old \"family-oriented\" piles of cobblers.",

I wasn't heavily anticipating this remake, like about ninety-percent of the viewing public.  In fact, I predicted it would suck. For some reason, I'm not a sucker for all these big-budget Hollywood summer blockbusters.  I thought I'd feel the same way about this movie as I did with that borefest \"The Mummy Returns.\"  Even action movies can put me to sleep, if flashy special f/x is the only fuel to keep them going.  But as it turns out fifty-percent of the time, the movies I least anticipate are the ones I end up liking quite a bit.  First of all, it's directed by Tim Burton.  I've always been fond of his work (minus \"Mars Attacks\").  Just like most of his movies, he creates a creepy atmosphere that deeply engages you--sometimes on a conscious level, sometimes on a subconscious level.  And also like most of his movies, he adds a nice touch of humor.  Some of the humor's pretty silly and obvious and some it's pretty subtle.  Whatever route he took, it often worked.  The ape costumes are amazingly realistic and the set designs are very impressive.  Also we have the great Danny Elfman who composed a great score to help intensify the creepy atmosphere.The premise is quite nifty.  A planet run by apes, where the apes rule and the humans are enslaved and put to work and even treated as pets.  That I found very interesting.  The premise is handled nicely, and it was amusing--sometimes hilarious--to see apes take on a human persona.  Playing card games, running shops, etc.In the comic relief department, we have Paul Giamatti who takes on the bumbling henchman role.  Just like his enormously impressive debut as Pig Vomit in Howard Stern's \"Private Parts\" he is absolutely hilarious.  Now, my mother saw this movie before me, so she pointed out that Charlton Heston had a cameo appearance.  Watching the film and seeing his name absent in the closing credits, I wasn't sure who he played.  I had a hunch he played Thade's father, and I was right.  The hint that sorta gave it away was when he quotes his famous \"Damn you all to hell\" speech on his deathbed.  I wonder if others caught on that it was Heston in that cameo, because I don't hear much buzz about it.  The story's not topnotch.  This is overall shallow, predictable entertainment, but it works.  I enjoyed it a lot more than expected, though it dragged at points (especially in the third act) and went on a little long.  Tim Roth is great as the villain.  If I didn't check the credits, I wouldn't have known it was him.  He didn't even use his British accent (something he's amazingly good at covering up).  And behind all that makeup, he's almost completely unrecognizable.  Though I haven't seen the original, I'm pretty sure Heston played a much better hero than Mark Wahlberg.  I don't think Wahlberg's a bad actor.  It's just, he's one of those actors who doesn't seem to go the whole nine yards for his craft.  He speaks in a moderately monotone voice, and never seems to have much substance behind his performances (even in his acclaimed role as Dirk Diggler in \"Boogie Nights\").  He's good in this movie, but they could've cast a better lead. Someone with a more commanding presence.  Please keep in mind I didn't see the 1968 version, so I might be a little sweet on this remake.  After seeing this version, I'm more anxious to check out the old version.  I heard a lot of buzz about this movie's ending. Though I didn't think it was a bad way to end things, it was...weird.  A little enigmatic.  Something you might have to ponder for a while.  Though it's nothing as subtle as M. Night Shamalyan's ending for \"The Sixth Sense.\" Tim Burton really did an impressive job, this is another score for him. It's good, fun entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously and leaves sufficient room for comic relief.  So I will recommend this movie, but if you're a die-hard fan of the original--please don't get on my case!My score:  7 (out of 10)",

We don' need no steenkin' Angelina Jolie!) is one of the best things, and in both films one of the high points is watching her swim. Unlike the movie that several people here and elsewhere accurately dubbed \"Drivel,\" however, this one does have some other stuff in its favour, but not enough to stop it from being second only to \"Mars Attacks!\" as Tim Burton's least interesting movie to date; note that I said least interesting and not worst, because Burton is apparently incapable of making a bad movie (he can, however, have his name on one - \"Batman Forever\" is billed as \"A Tim Burton Production,\" but that was chiefly Joel Schumacher's fault).The man's never been hailed for his unwavering grasp on story, but his grip on the plot is even more tenuous than usual; he seems more interested in the look than the tale - the elements never really come together (especially the Wahlberg/Bonham-Carter/Warren \"triangle,\" which never quite registers and explains why the ending is a bit weak). In fairness, Burton and the cast aren't helped by the script from William Broyles Jr (\"Cast Away,\" the excellent TV series \"China Beach\") and sequel specialists Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal (who did \"The Jewel of the Nile,\" \"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\" and \"Superman IV: The Quest For Peace\" - is that warning bells I hear?), which doesn't give anyone much to work with and makes the first hour in particular a slow haul.The second half is all told an improvement, although it suffers from some hard-to-believe plot points (the phrase 'deux ex machina' comes to mind)...***SPOILER ALERT FOR THOSE READERS WHO STILL DON'T KNOW THE ENDING*** ...and the ending, though closer to the end of the original novel (in both the book and this film the hero returns to Earth only to find out, thanks to a memorial to the Tim Roth character, that the apes have taken over there as well), is clumsy, illogical and idiotic; see \"Back to the Future Part II\" for a similar twist, which at least had some credibility along the rules the film set itself. There must have been an easier way for Twentieth Century Fox to graft on a set-up for a potential sequel. (That's what you get for leaving Estella Warren behind, Wahlberg!)***END OF SPOILER ALERT FOR THOSE ET CETERA ET CETERA ET CETERA***Technically it's pretty good, with impressive Rick Baker makeup (although Helena Bonham-Carter's makeup, in addition to making her look a bit like B'Elanna from \"Star Trek: Voyager,\" seems to be getting in the way of her speech), fine although non-staggering Industrial Light and Magic (and company) FX - the crash sequence and the climactic battle are standouts - and another good Danny Elfman score (although whoever decided to stick that Paul Oakenfold remix on the lengthy end credits should be taken out and shot). Some of the cast actually manage to come through the makeup, notably Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth (although Mark Wahlberg looks more like an ape than the other humans), and the apes are actually pretty scary... but I miss Roddy McDowall. (Note that I haven't drawn any comparisons between this and the 1968 classic; it's not fair to do so, and I'm trying to look at this on its own merits.)Alas, Tim Burton movies shouldn't be enjoyed for their technical merits - they should and often do take you to another world. It's ironic that the first of his movies that really IS set on another world should ultimately fail to do so; lots of good things (I liked the slave trader, I didn't mind the links to the original movie - good on Charlton Heston for going uncredited, however - and I certainly enjoyed the big action scenes and some of the quieter pleasures, like the unofficial tour the humans take while escaping through the apes' city) but not a success. It's still better than the TV series or the last two sequels, however, but this isn't a real Burton movie. \"Planet of the Apes\" might have seemed more impressive had this identical movie been directed by Michael Bay, but from a real genius it's something to rank below his best work.But Estella is as sexy as ever, which is where we came in.",

            "content": "My Take: A few good moments and some fine make-up work, but not Burton's very best movies. Director Tim Burton, so far, has started and continued a promising career as a Hollywood filmmaker. So far, his first films I saw was \"Beetlejuice\" and \"Batman\", both are well-done. Burton continued such masterpieces like the sequel \"Batman Returns\", \"Edward Scissorhands\" and the highly acclaimed \"Ed Wood\". Even his dark comedy \"Mars Attacks\", which proved a little different from his other films, is still a great funny entertainment, which was a little better than the too-serious \"Independence Day\". Besides, when it comes to Burton's different film, it can only be this, a remake of the classic adaptation of Pierre Boulle's classic \"Planet of the Apes\".Just by looking at the results of this film, I'm sure that Burton was out of place here. No matter how brilliant he is as a director, the epic genre is something he's not in to. His films are usually the bizarre, or fairy tale-like films, combined with some dark comedy and satire. \"Planet of the Apes\" has none of those. It's a full-blood epic that revolves around man battling a more intelligent species that they weren't aware that will out-evolve them. In other words, the plot for \"Planet of the Apes\" is darn serious. Burton, most usually don't take everything seriously, and likes to look at the weird side. Since this film has no room for any of those, it's easy to see a failure. The make-up effects by Rick Baker are truly superb, giving each Ape character its own different look and personality. I guess that more than makes up for the films blander human characters, say Mark Wahlberg as a bland, often unconvincing action hero. Certainly, Tim Roth as the overreacting human-hating ape Thade, Helen Bonham Carter's human-loving ape Ari and many of the other simian co-stars steal the show, providing some terrific performances while under that heavy does of make-up. It ain't Burton at his definitive best, and PLANET OF THE APES certainly doesn't end being the summer's biggest blockbuster (even JURASSIC PARK III has more to offer than this). An intriguing yet misguided disappointment. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",

Actually she is not acting at all but only trying to look good all the time. The only decent performances come from Bonham Carter and her big hulky gorilla companion during the escape (missed his name, some ex-General). Tim Roth is too one-dimensionally \"bad\" to be of any compelling interest. He should have declined this lame role.Terrible, senseless and completely out-of-the-blue ending after the (very poor and thin) \"story\" is concluded already. The costumes/make-ups and production design are good (2001, so no surprise) but do not save this movie at all.Tim Burton clearly can do better than this. I can't understand what he found in this script as he had a very heavy and uninspired hand here. Complete waste of time and money... utterly disappointing.

            "content": "Now I will admit I love Tim Burton and most of his work but I too was shocked and fearful of his agreement to take the helm of this sci-fi action flick revamp/re-imagining. Many directors were considered and to be honest I think many of them would have been perfect for the film but Burton does add his usual unique artistic style which can be glimpsed throughout the film in armour design, landscapes sets etc..So straight to the point I actually liked this Burton version of 'Apes' mainly because its a fun romp which is both silly entertaining cheese and has that classic semi serious sci-fi element to it. First up the visuals in the film are tremendously good and really make the film stand out, total kudos to Rick Baker and his team, the man totally nails the ape look for all the characters to a tee. The best clearly being Roth as Thade with a fantastic makeup job, next up must be Duncan in his gorilla makeup but how about Shadix and Giamatti in their orangutan (I think) makeup...amazing!The film wins with the look for sure, not only is the makeup excellent but the sets are nicely worked, location is well suited, the apes costumes and battle gear is well designed and the space sequences also look and work well. All in all its pretty much like a top class Star Trek film...I mean a good Star Trek film by the way.Casting choices were good accept for Wahlberg who wasn't quite right for me. Thankfully we had no Depp to endure here but the use of many solid character actors such as Warner and the imaginative use Tagawa really help lift the film, who could imagine Tagawa as a gorilla.I really enjoyed the film on my second viewing, my first was on release at the cinema, and I believe its because the 'Apes' classic plot can be made many ways and is open to interpretation from different angles, its not a case of it only works one way like a lot of classic films, 'Apes' is a franchise that you can seem to mould and recreate without upsetting the originals. This Burton vision is simple yet highly enjoyable as a fun sci-fi romp, not too heavy, not just copying the original, touch of artistic license and the attempt at a twist ending which was brave but rather illogical, trying to equal the original but failing there I'm afraid. Still the little use of CGI for much of the film is always nice in my book.7/10",

As everyone will agree, the visual effects and the makeup are amazing.  Rick Baker and crew deserve yet another Oscar.  However, this is where the compliments end.  Let's go down the list of things that I have a problem with:(1) The first 10-15 minutes on the space station looked too much like Buck Rogers for my taste.  Everything was too sanitized and too white. The acting made matters worse especially when it comes accompanied by lines like \"Never send a monkey to do a man's job.\"(2) There was a long period after this where I was happy.  Once he landed on the planet things got better until they reached Calima and it turned for the worse.  Does anyone actually buy the idea that a 3,000 year old piece of equipment that crashed from space would work?  Oh yeah, that's right!  It's NUCLEAR powered.  I guess that the equipment itself would never corrode or rust.(3) Okay... the rest of the humans show up because they heard about the amazing human that will save them.  Uh?  Did I miss something?  Did he do something amazing that I'm not aware of?  At least in the original, Charlton Heston was the only human that could speak.  This ability made him stand out from the rest.  In this version, all humans could speak.  What's so great about Marky Mark?  That's right, he \"came from the stars\" to save them all.(4) Does anyone else find it extremely cheesy that a chimpanzee lands in a spaceship and saves the day?  Ridiculous.(5) The ending reminded me too much of \"Conquest of...\" and \"Battle for..\"\nI hope there is no sequel, but I'm sure there will be.

And they did, changing many key plot points including the ending. But there are serious problems with the script, among them: (1) Humans speak English, but don't have much to say. There's not even a hint as to why they think they're in the position they're in. (2) The movie has a blatant political/social message that is forced-fit in to key dialogues.

We can take them...\" Whoa! Much of \"Planet of the Apes\" is like that. It has the trademark Burton brooding, dark settings-- great attention to detail. Though the story is in-cohesive and uneven. And there is some killer over-acting, particularly by Tim Roth as General Thade. Mark Wahlberg is okay as stranded astronaut, Leo, who wants to go home. Human activist, Helena Bonham Carter as ape Ari, is convincing in a strange \"romantic\" role. Liked Cary-Hiroyki Tagawa as Ari's protector, Krull-- the one really heroic character. All the other characters are forgettable. Even with these weaknesses in writing and acting, \"Planet of the Apes\" is definitely entertaining.

I guess the current leader of the National Rifle Association has a sense of self-mocking humor after all.Tim Roth is excellent as a bad-guy who is one of the most  threatening villains since Dracula. The film is worth seeing just for his performance.The story is an interesting allegory about the injustice of human-animal relations as well as human-human inhumanity. Tim Burton seems to be having a field-day playing around with perspective, human-ape evolution arguments, and even space and time.It doesn't have the surprises of the original film, but that's only because it isn't the original. It does, however, deliver a good cynical and comic jolt at the end just as the original did.",

            "content": "This film reminds me of the brilliant \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\" skit \"Nice Video, Shame About the Song\", though that isn't a perfect analogy since Danny Elfman's score is one of the best things about the film! The make-up and the set design - particularly Ape City and the ruins of the Oberon - are fantastic but it has a host of other problems. Compared with the 1968 classic (my sixth favourite film of all time), the social commentary is very diluted and not particularly well done even when they bother trying to do it. In his review at the time, Roger Ebert said that, \"Intellectually, it's science fiction for junior high school boys.\" I was 14 in 2001 and I loved it then so I think that he was onto something. He was also right when he said that in ten years time, people would still be watching the original film in preference to this one.Mark Wahlberg is no Charlton Heston and Leo Davidson expresses little to no emotion throughout the film. He's a cardboard cutout, really. He lands on a planet of apes and his reaction is basically \"Hmm...\" I had the same problem with most of the human characters. Daena's characterisation consists mainly of giving our hero doe-eyed looks, though the conflict with Ari has the (mostly unrealised) potential to be interesting. None of the other human characters add anything to the plot with the possible exception of Erick Avari's character Tival providing a contrast between the \"wild\" humans and the \"housebroken\" ones. They focused too much attention on giving the apes personalities, mistakenly thinking that the audience would be interested in the humans for the sole reason that they were humans.Among the apes, the best actors - almost wrote \"beast actors\" by mistake! - are Helena Bonham Carter as the principled human rights activist Ari and David Warner as her well-intentioned but weak willed father Senator Sandar, who appears in all of two scenes. Paul Giamatti has some good lines and is quite funny as the orangutan slave trader Limbo but, again, the character doesn't add much to the film. The usually very reliable Tim Roth is a too over the top and not all that creepy or frightening as General Thade. I think that his second-in- command Attar, played very well by Michael Clarke Duncan, would have made for a much more frightening villain. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa was good but not great as Krull. Like Warner, Glenn Shadix only appeared in two scenes but managed to make more of an impression than any of the human characters and quite a few of the ape ones as Senator Nado. My favourite scene in the film was definitely Charlton Heston's uncredited cameo as Thade's dying father Zaius, who is reminiscent of the character of the same name from the original film. It's quite interesting that the only ape on the planet with a gun was played by the President of the NRA! I highly doubt that Heston, then in his late 70s, would have been willing to do an entire film in that make-up but he'd have made a better villain than Thade as well. I also really liked Linda Harrison's appropriately silent cameo as the woman in the cart when Leo enters Ape City.The film was co-written by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal, who previously performed the same duty on the much more stupid \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" and the excellent \"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\" (in which the always brilliant David Warner also appeared in a fairly small role as a liberal, sympathetic politician). The script seems like a first draft rather than a finished product. It's mostly uninspired but there are a few little things that I liked in the script such as the occasional good line, the electromagnetic storm / temporal anomaly relaying all Earth broadcasts from across time to the Oberon, the origin of the ape civilisation, the apes' creation myth and Pericles' return. Oh, and I have to admit that I love, love, love the nutty ending, which is more or less the same as in the original novel. Part of me wishes that there had been a sequel to see how they would have followed up on it! One thing that I really hated though was Leo and Ari's romantic subplot because of, you know, the whole bestiality thing. As for the action scenes, they are decent as opposed to fantastic, with one or two minor exceptions.Overall, this is quite a bad film but I don't think that it's as awful as its reputation would suggest. It's one of the only films that I enjoyed as a young child or in my early teens that I dislike now. In spite of everything, however, I still retain a certain level of fondness for it as it introduced me to the original film series, which is second only to the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy as my favourite film series of all time. Plus, 2001/2002 wasn't the happiest time in my life and watching it over and over again helped me forget my troubles for two hours at a time. Objectively speaking though, Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter's relationship and collaboration in almost all of his later, better films are probably the best things to come out of the film.",

This group deserved to be enslaved simply because they were so pathetically vapid, they'd have a hard time surviving on their own. Mark Wahlberg showed as much emotion and sensitivity as a toilet seat and one just can't imagine him as David leading the robotic humans over the Goliath apes. It also seemed way beyond the bounds of reason that ALL the apes would suddenly become tolerant and glad to consider their former slaves their equals-as we all know too well, racism and bigotry are not so easily erased.

I think that a lot of people did not enjoy this film because they tried to compare it to the original 1968 film. In truth, the stories and characters are different. Remaking the original film would not have been a good idea because most people know the ending; this film takes a different approach. The human lands on the planet, and he is taken hostage with some other humans, and together, they learn the history of the planet. In this film, however, the presence of a villain character is an important part of the film. No, this film is not as good as the 1968 one, even though they are different stories, but it is still enjoyable. The script was done well, but it was not as engaging and not as memorable. It's captivating as an action/adventure film with some science fiction elements, even though it does not go the extra way to create a true classic.

However, while the entire supporting cast, especially Tim Roth, is very convincing and in fact is superlative in its performance, the star Mark Wahlberg never convinced me he was in this fantastic situation that almost defied description. He almost seemed 'ho hum' about it! Also in this version the underlying themes of ethics and philosophy and even the sheer sense of adventure and discovery seem to have been overshadowed by a more a conventional 'action movie' approach.

I always did find it very difficult to watch the movie because of that. This Tim Burton's version is far more easier for the ears and basically the plot tries to handle same issues with the original.

After seeing it this morning, I was surprisedto discover that this evening I felt like seeing it again. So, I'll catch itagain within a week or two.WARNING--SPOILERS The entire gorilla cast was magnificent! Truly and reallyastounding work by the makeup guys-- but more, by the actorsthemselves. Not once did I think-- Hey, there's Roddy McDowell ina gorilla suit! The animal characters were so believable. Thehumans were less than grand, though. Kris Kristoffersen wasamazing-- a welcome and remarkable acting re-appearance, andtotally apt for his role.The blond babe: Whats-her-name, was serviceable, but nothingspecial. Markie Mark -- I mean Mark Wahlberg-- is a fine actor,generally. But here his character is annoying and dumb. I kind ofwanted to see him killed pretty much right away.Helena Bonham-Carter-- all I can say is you've got to see her tobelieve her! Even though any role as a gorilla lady would be,professionally, a bit of a burlesque, she made it into somethingworthwhile. Appropriate to the spirit of the movie-- but I say that hercharacter in this flick outdoes and therefore embarrasses JuliaRoberts, in ANYTHING Roberts has EVER done. Bonham-Cartergets an exquisite performance out of the circumstances, whichspeaks highly of her genius and mastery of acting.The ending, though-- What the F*** was that??? Talk aboutsomething happening simply because the script, or pre-fab cliche,demands it! Knowing critic Roger Ebert's movie law that \"No propis featured in a movie without a purpose/payoff later on\"-- seeingso much attention paid to the real chimp in the beginning was aclear tip-off that somehow he'd show up later, etc. I also couldguess the secret source of the ape planet within 8 seconds of itsfirst mention. I'm sure most other audience members did as well.But when Wahlberg goes back in time to earth and finds that AbeLincoln is a gorilla dude? That is illogical, even in a 1960's vibesci-fi movie. What's the logic? It makes no sense, and thus hadabsolutely no effect on me.On the other hand-- so what? This great flick does plenty enoughof what a movie is supposed to do, and it does it really well. Maybeit ain't Shakespeare-- but from what I've read, in his time,Shakespeare himself wasn't Shakespeare either.Go see \"Planet of the Apes.\" Be glad; be happy!",

But we can imagine what director Burton's penchant for nightmarish landscapes and dark fairy tales would look like if imposed on the well-known Planet of the Apes storyline. With such preconceptions, it's not at all a surprise what this film ended up becoming - in fact, it's fairly predictable, perhaps its biggest weakness. It's no surprise that many of those crowd shots of soldier apes here resemble the scary monkey-things from \"The Wizard of Oz.\" Ironically, the first drawback for this version is its faithful adherence to the novel; the hero astronaut (Marky Mark) in this one really does travel to another planet, where the inhabitants (ruling apes & underdog humans) speak perfect English. The explanation for this bizarro planet and its presumed natives in the final third is not nearly as elegant as the logical one in the classic '68 film. We're asked to go along with the fanciful concepts and not think it out very much - this is fairy tale madness, after all, dressed up as science fiction for the masses. Burton seems to be in conflict with himself here - at once the eclectic stylist at odds with presenting a standard summer popcorn flic for the consumers.Where Burton and some of his actors do succeed is in presenting most of the new ape characters. Roth pretty much steals the movie from everyone as the central villain, Thade. Interestingly, this film was more accurate than the original in that it understood that chimpanzees are the most violence-prone and bad-tempered of the apes in our reality (gorillas are actually more benign). Thade, a super-chimp for lack of a better term, is possessed of power on several levels (physical, social, political) and uses it in displays of ferocious antipathy. Roth so loses himself in the role that, even as I viewed this a 2nd and 3rd time, knowing who it was under that ape make-up, I still could find no traces of him. It's a triumph of make-up FX and stellar method acting. All the actors who play apes in this picture, including Bonham Carter and Clarke Duncan, succeed in dazzling the audience to such a degree that, unfortunately, all the ones playing humans, including the main lead, come off as very bland. The climactic battle between the two armies is exciting and we tense up some more as Thade's villainy appears to near an end. Then everything becomes abruptly copacetic on this weird world and the final (secondary) climax back on Earth still doesn't make sense to me, not after the 3rd time, and probably not when I see it a 4th time. I think Burton's just messing with us.",

Walhberg is so boring as a rebellious captain that he doesn't seem real, but the \"humans\" are worshipping him as a leader? Give us a break.The humans themselves are ludicrious, because they are clean, and have perfect communication skills and the women are half-naked with big breasts. Ghee Tim, are you trying to market your film to horny 11 year olds?What else? Everything, uneven acting, even worse, cliche that puts us to sleep. All we see is how 'evil' the chimp general is, and how 'good' the humans and sanctimonious chimp peace lover are. Yawn, yawn.Even the special effects begin to wear thin, notice how cheap the crash landing on earth looked.I wouldn't see this film again, ever. Burton, grow up and give us something decent to watch, you make enough money.",

            "content": "Remakes come in all shapes and sizes. What's the reason for making remakes of the classic movies that fitted well? Some remakes get to show a different side of view like Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear in 1991 where rather than showing a happy family in peril (like in the original 1962 classic), Scorsese shows a dysfunctional family filled with anger and a disease where it made audience applaud for De Niro's character.Tim Burton is known for making movies in a goth emblem from Beetlejuice, Batman Returns (the best of his work), Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands and much more. Now he directs this 1960's classic about how a man from space gets stuck in an island filled with talking and vicious primates. Mark Whalberg is Capt. Leo Davidson who doesn't do much except try to wow women with his boyish good looks where one of his lab chimps goes inside a space rocket and leaves the space station where he goes into another planet. Leo tries to find his pet until he realizes that once he arrives everything is upside down with humans in cages and use for enslavement while primates (Gorillas, monkeys, orangutans, etc.) rule the planet. The leader is General Thade (Tim Roth, who stands out) who wants to abolish all humans from the face of the earth. His henchmen involves the volatile Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan), Limbo (Paul Giamatti) the fool, and sweet Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) who crushes on Captain Leo.If you seen the original movie about how the humans and some of the chimps fight off the bad primates, there's a twist in the ending. There's no enthrallment, no cheers, it felt as if certain scenes from the trailer worked rather than the film itself while breathing in relief after I walked out of the theater.",

            "content": "I love Tim Burton movies.  I have been a ravenous fan of his since the first of the Batman movies (as we know them today) came out in 1989 (there is another movie made in the 60s based of the classic TV show, starring the one true Batman, Adam West).  Furthermore, I loved the original Planet of the Apes.  It was one of the most well known, recognizable, and thought provoking movies of all time, with one of the greatest twists in cinematic history.  Not only that, but if you look at the series of `Apes' movies, as a whole, you will most likely find that they are one of the greatest, most well fitting together with respect to continuity (if that is even possible to say) franchises ever.  So with that being said, could this movie possibly go wrong?Oh it did. It went WAY wrong. This movie is righteous garbage. The twist at the end (not a spoiler) makes absolutely no logical sense, independently. But if it sets up a plot that will be explained in the sequel, then I don't want to know, and have no desire to see it.  But what is my major grievance with this movie:Marky Mark.  In this movie, he single handedly gives a horrible performance, AS ALWAYS, and disgraces the name of models gone actors, which if you think about it is pretty bad considering they have a bad reputation to begin with. One of the more subtle problems that I have with him, besides his pitiful excuse for acting, is that throughout this and seemingly all of his other movies he has the same facial expression, which is something of a mix between constipation and just got done running a marathon.  Even moreso is the fact that throughout the whole movie, he never seems to be surprised at the fact that not only is he in a world completely different than his, nor the fact that it is primarily populated by gigantic, walking, talking apes, nor does he ever seem to ponder, even ask, or want to find out, `hey, what in the righteous heck is going on here?'Here is my breakdown of the other key players in the movie:Helena Bonham Carter \u0096 brilliant actress \u0096 waste of her talent.Charlton Heston \u0096 cultural icon \u0096 waste of his talent.Tim Burton \u0096 one of the greatest and most imaginative, and visually impressive moviemakers of all time \u0096 completely shot himself in the foot for making this garbage.Anyone else remotely involved in the making of this movie - waste of their collective talent.The only redeeming factors of this movie is that Danny Elfman once again provides a good score to the movie and the shot where they look back upon the city (it's the only shot in the movie that is signature Tim Burton). \nNow I have seen some BAD movies in my day, and not only does this one take the taco, but to categorize it as only a bad movie would be an insult.  This is beyond a bad movie.  This is a complete waste of your life if you watch it.  Please, please, please if you want to see Planet of the Apes, look past the fancy special effects, good makeup and prosthetics job, and the fact that it is a newer movie, and go watch the lower budget, older original.

A kind, female ape called Ari (Bonham Carter) sees something different in these humans, and plans to help them in whatever they need to do.Even with wonderful performances by the actors, a small amount of action and a poorly crafted ending makes this version of the classic ends up as one of Burton's weaker films.Are you trying to put me out of business?

            "content": "Critics are a little harsher on this semi-return-to-form from Tim Burton than I would have thought from how consistently engaging the picture is. While not as bewilderingly impersonal as SLEEPY HOLLOW, APES still bears the earmarks of a Fox  $100-million-dollar movie--which is to say that the third act takes a turn into James Cameron and GLADIATOR territory that is most unwelcome (and seems designed to provide gung-ho trailer fodder).Audiences will probably be divided by the finale, an attempt to recoup the badum-bum finale of the 1968 APES; it's a little hamhanded, but I think it works. And the incredible deus ex machina that cuts short a not very well executed Maximus-style combat climax is so touching and out of left-field it feels almost Spielbergian. But until then, the movie works as a well-masticated mouthful of the original APES' hidden subtexts: Burton's APES proliferates metaphors of racism, animal rights, individual self-destruction, and militarism-versus-effete-government in virtually every scene. The themes buried in the Franklin Schaffner APES may not be as probingly essayed here as...oh, I dunno, they would be in a Todd Haynes movie. But they are rather surprising in the context of this very big movie--which, to Burton's everlasting credit, must be the lightest on action scenes of any blockbuster of its kind in years. The Burtonian wit is there--especially when Mrs. Burton, a k a Lisa Marie, does a simian dance of sex for her bloated orangutan husband, who trembles like Pontius Pilate ogling Salome. And it's there in Paul Giamatti's side-of-the-mouth quips as an amoral trader of human slaves. (This is the kind of humor George Lucas was attempting, and failing at grotesquely, in THE PHANTOM MENACE.) Much has been made of the \"flatness\" of Mark Wahlberg's performance as the human hero, but I think he gives the role just what's necessary--an unsentimental desire to get the job done and get out of Dodge. Much has also been made of the hambone-chewing, sucking and swallowing of Tim Roth, who plays the evillest of the apes; as with Ben Kingsley in SEXY BEAST, Americans seem to respond to British villainy when it's spelled out with a magic marker. Better performances come from Helena Bonham Carter, who weaves bits of chimpanzee physical behavior into her role as a tremulous human-rights activist--a sort of chimpish Patty Hearst--and even from the model Estelle Warren, who is perfectly credible opening her mouth and perfectly heart-stopping when closing it. The script is a sound one (even if there's a bit too much time spent following Wahlberg walk around a wilderness staring at a Palm Pilot-like compass) and Burton brings more flair to even the most expositional images than any of the other eligible hacks could possibly bring to bear. Since this movie is  guaranteed to make a sockful of loot, will somebody let Burton  make another ED WOOD or MARS ATTACKS?",

            "content": "After all those reviews and comments, I feel that I have to add mine.I'll start with the things I liked:The make-up is fantastic. The always-amazing Rick Baker did an incredible job here and created some truly realistic apes - I'll risk in saying that it's probably the best ape make-up ever made, and - as some people have already mentioned - a lot better than the make-up used in the original series. I especially liked the make-up for Thade (Tim Roth). My least favorite is the make-up for Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), which looks quite different from the rest; I guess Rick wanted her to look \"half-human\" (a similar approach was used for the wolves animatronics in the 1994 \"Wolf\"), but for me it was too distracting, as it looked too fake. Actually, she's the ONLY ape who looks fake.In addition to the make-up, costumes (Burton's regular Colleen Atwood) and sets, I realized that what makes the apes especially realistic is their movement and their use of space (jumping all the times, using trees and roots, etc.). This aspect is another credit point for Burton, who always put special attention to the behavior and movement of the characters (Lisa Marie as the Martian Girl in \"Mars Attacks!\" immediately comes to mind) and made the actors go to \"ape school\".Danny Elfman's score is always fantastic and this one is no exception. The use of primitive tools and jungle motives in the main titles is great. It starts quietly, as a simplified and primitive tune and builds up (as usual in Danny's themes) to a march piece of heavy metal instruments, \"like bars closing in\", as one review described it. While the theme reminded me past works such as \"Men in Black\" and \"Dead Presidents\", other cues reminded me of Danny's earlier works such as \"Mars Attacks!\", \"Edward Scissorhands\", \"Batman Returns\" and the \"March of the Dead\" from \"Army of Darkness\". Now that I listen to the soundtrack, the final part of the track titled \"The Return\", which ends the movie, seems to be highly influenced by the work of Bernard Herrmann (Danny's mentor).One thing that I liked about the plot *SPOILER ALERT* is the added explanation for the apes being \"smart\" - the genetic treatment, which is unfortunately ruined totally later on (I think. Depends on how you understand the ending). *END OF SPOILER*Two bits that made the movie entertaining for me were the parts of Limbo, the slave trader (played by the hilarious Paul Giamatti), and the two guest appearances by Glenn Shadix and Lisa Marie (as Senator Nado and Nova) - I wish they had a bigger part in the movie.And now to the things I didn't like:First of all - Estella Warren. From the very first moment she appears on screen, early in the movie, I felt her casting is wrong. Except for putting her as an attraction for the male audience (me amongst them), I saw no reason for using an amazing blonde model, dressed in small rags, for this part. It simply distracts you from the movie and damages its realism. I wanted to see Lisa Marie in this role, just so she could have a bigger part, but this one wouldn't solve the real drawback -Aside for the casting of Estella Warren, the role of Daena (and her entire family, for that matter) seems absolutely redundant - She has almost no interaction with the hero, and seems to exist only to fill the role of the traditional \"blonde girl the hero kisses at the end\" - not to mention that this kiss seems completely out of place, since they had no interaction before that. The same, though on a smaller scale, goes for the rest of her family, which seems to be \"dragging\" along with the hero for no apparent reason.I think the biggest drawback of the movie has to be its script. There are lots of things to say about it, and I'm not sure where to start. Here are several points: The script (especially the last quarter) seems like a big mishmash of bits from the movies in the earlier series; The script has no \"social meaning\" at all - the writers seem to have taken an everyday-life cruel behavior towards animals (and a politically-correct objector) and reverse the roles, without debating any valuable issue; None of the characters seemed to have depth and we get no reason for Ari being so fond of the ugly humans; *MAJOR SPOILERS ALERT* The fact that the apes and humans, who live as primitives without any technology and don't know what a gun is, are not a bit surprised by digital gadgets, spaceships and \"a weapon that blow-up everyone\", in addition to the fact that is made by primitive humans who can't invent anything; The ending that didn't make much sense to me, other than trying to give a shock and a surprise that would be different from the one in the original movie - one which you simply can not top; This in addition to the disappointment in revealing (a minute earlier) that the \"planet of the apes\" is indeed a strange planet and not Earth (which, as I mentioned earlier, destroys the rather good logic that was built up to this point). For a moment I thought the writers were trying to play a trick on us: because we were expecting to hear that the humans destroyed Earth, we instead see that apes have overtaken Earth - so perhaps they are the ones to destroy it? But then, the earlier planet is not Earth\u0085; There also seem to be some plot-holes concerning the time traveling, both of the money and the spaceship itself; I also found it highly unbelievably, after the money came down from the skies, that all of the apes, who up until then considered humans to be filthy and primitive, decide in an instant that humans and apes are equal - the only reason for that seemed to be that the writers needed to get to the end of the movie. *END OF SPOILERS*",

            "content": "While this film is visually far superior to the original from 1968, the plot and characters fall far short, due mostly to a poorly written script and some wooden acting. Burton's style is out in full force on this one, and it works very well for the film, but the plot dives into action when it should be focusing on plot & character development. The first third or so of the movie works very well, homaging the original while retaining its own style. Unfortunately, the story falters and the suspense, horror, and sci-fi thrills - which were built up very well - are sacrificed for the sake of big action scenes. The final battle is a complete mass, topped only by the unbelievable, albeit intriguing, ending. The twist defies logic in all its forms, but it's still cool to see. A disappointment, to be sure. Something tells me this would have worked much better as a sci-fi horror/thriller than an action/adventure.There are some intriguing concepts at play within the film, mostly dealing with the evolution of the apes and their culture. The fact that they all evolved from the monkeys that the humans took with them is quite an ingenious idea, made even more so by the fact that the apes all worship these simple monkeys. A nice jab at our own religious beliefs when Ari states that their story of creation is nothing more than a fairy tale. The ape culture is interesting because of its apparent similarity to, yet stark difference from, our own - seems to suggest that evolution turns out the same regardless of species. A thought, though - if the apes evolved from the monkeys who rebelled against the humans, then where did the humans on the planet come from? Definitely a plot hole. Still, the overall concept is quite good, marred unnecessarily by the poor storyline.Technically, the film is superb. The makeup, costumes, production design, music and special effects are all top-notch and very cool. The apes look, act, and move like real animals, not just humans in monkey suits. The score, especially during the opening credits, is excellent and quite appropriate for the film. The ape village is very Burtonesque, which suits it well. Some of the early scenes are startling in their dark beauty. Most of the cool shots in this movie are in the first half, save the final scene. The second half goes awry with silly battle scenes and lame attempts at character development. Once again, the script is to blame. The acting is all over the place, ranging from scenery-chewing (Roth) to mediocre (Wahlberg) to downright bad (the blond chick). In general, the apes seem to do a much better job than the humans - not sure why Burton felt the need to make the humans talk in this one; the muteness of humanity in the original is one of the contributing factors to its greatness. The only human that should matter in this film is the lead character - the rest of the humans are just animals to the apes, and if they can talk, it ruins the idea. Still, the film looks beautiful.All in all, this was a great disappointment. A director as visually skilled as Burton, a classic film just itching to be remade, and loads of money for effects? It's too bad the script fell far short - this would have been a modern classic. Still, the first half or so is great to just look at, if you ignore the inane plot and annoying characters. The twist, however cool, is nothing more than a sorry attempt to top the original's ending - but it's not happening. Burton should have just stuck to homaging the original ending, rather than trying to beat it. Maybe have Wahlberg encounter an ape Statue of Liberty - that would have been cool. Overall, a beautiful film marred by a poor script.",

There was never any real drama or suspense invested into the script. The interaction between the characters is often stale and almost wishing to be something more redeeming. Another aspect that really confused me was regarding the humans on the ape planet. These humans were obviously able to speak, thus they were intelligent. So, why were these humans unable to have formed a much stronger resistance to the apes?  (In the original Planet of the Apes movie, the native humans were more underdeveloped like cavemen who still could not speak.)

            "content": "(spoiler warning)No matter what can be said about the remaking of classic films, \"Planet of the Apes\" makes for the best of them. This can be attributed to not being very much like the original since only some basic premises and plot lines are the same. And being so lush with fantastic scenery, great makeup and effects, the 2001 edition is much more exciting to watch, despite being a little less concerned with afterthought. Tim Burton is a favorite of mine. His dreamscapes are sometimes a tad lacking in the meaning department, but they are always resplendent with true artistic ambitions. \"Planet of the Apes\" is no exception.One could argue about some of the differences from the first movie of 1968. A major one is making humans able to speak, which can be seen as a weak spot. Though helping Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) considerably, this \"new\" feature makes some of the philosophizing somewhat dimmer - the apes ask themselves whether humans have souls. But would one actually argue that a being that is able to form its own thougts and speak them would not have one? I wonder. On the other hand, since Davidson is responsible for the entire future scenario on this planet of apes, ancient grudges can make the apes selective in their thinking: humans tortured them for so long. Philosophic arguments might not go a long way with them.Humor is an important ingredient in the new \"Planet of the Apes\". While the original is sternly sober and not very witty at all (Heston's grim look is heavy to bear), this one flirts quite handsomely with human characteristics transferred to apes. Very funny and Burton-esque. I also appreciate the careful depiction of the apes movements and behavior. While clearly developed beyond their ancestors, the apes still retain a great deal of \"monkey\" characteristics - growling, aggressiveness and jumping around rather than walking. The original \"Planet of the Apes\" had the monkeys walking around much like ordinary humans, which flattened some of the impact.Still, it is unnecessary to compare them in other respects, since the new one is not really a remake and not really a sequel either. I for one welcome it. It doesn't contain the same degree of commentary on humanity that the 1968 movie did, but that one is not anywhere near as spectacular. A good job. I bow my head to Tim Burton and his crew.",

The only apes in this remake that aren't mad all the time are Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and Limbo (Paul Giammatti), and that's only because Ari is the \"hero ape woman\" and Limbo the comic relief.  Of course, the humans in \"Planet of the Apes\" aren't really any better.  They're either really nervous all of the time, or really angry.  Maybe if both races calmed down a little, they'd have some peace!Aside from the prozak prescription, this was a reasonable remake.  Not Burton's best, not by far, but his directing it makes it a lot better. The fight scenes are entertaining, and Tim Roth delivers as the evil General Thade.  Unfortunately, Roth is the only actor who delivers a great performance.  Sure, the others weren't bad, but they didn't match Roth's ability to basically \"become the ape\".  Even Oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan moves a little roboticly sometimes.Still, a good, dark sci-fi thriller, 7.5/10.",

It is pretty much a straight forward remake of the 1968 sci-fi classic as opposed to the recent Andy Serkis fronted reboots which takes the premise in a different way. There are pretty good moments including the opening titles which are delightfully scored by Danny Elfman, making us feel we are certainly in Burton's take of this world. Tim Roth is very good as General Thade; a sadistic warrior ape who is frighteningly murderous and untrustworthy. Roth has a lot of fun with the role and does provide the films standout moment towards the end, delving into the scary energy that chimpanzees can have. The classic twist ending is effectively done and a good homage to the original. Paul Giamatti is also pretty good as the comic relief of the film and it's a helluva role! The production was documented as pretty troubled. As soon as Tim was recruited to direct, there was already a release date a year away as the studio were desperate to start the franchise up again. Script rewrites were being done while sets were being made just weeks before shooting began. Under immense studio pressure, the shoot sounded stressful and tight with editing having to take place in conjunction with the shooting. All the while undergoing personal issues, it's no wonder that the film unfortunately doesn't fully stand up on its own. It's no fault of any crew or cast member who do give it their all; it's just circumstance and bad timing culminating in a rushed and churned out Hollywood flick. There's a certain charm however to seeing Rick Baker's ape make-up work which is a nice homage to the original while also embellishing on their more animalistic mannerisms. It also marks the first collaboration with Helena Bonham Carter who has started a family with Burton since and went on to star in all of his films throughout the '00s",

Unfortunately this movie's mid section drags mercilessly and I wanted to leave the theatre.  It starts off very well and ends well in the last 40 minutes or so but about 45 minutes in the middle of the film is just plain bland.  Mark Wahlberg wasn't well casted.  I didn't buy him as an astronaut and adventurer at all. Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and especially Tim Roth all have their characters nailed down perfectly.  Roth's General Thade may be one of the top five villains in movie history.  The savage nature of his portrayal made him a great sadist and the make-up spoke a lot for him as well.  Rick Baker could earn another Oscar for his make-up work but Tim Burton was not the man to direct such heavy material.  Burton is good for decorative pop culture stuff found in comic books ('Batman') or heavy indoor and artsy production design stuff like 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure' or 'Beetlejuice' but somehow he just couldn't get me excited enough to embrace this remake of a legendary motion picture.",

One would think that since he based it on a idea very well covered before that the script would be easy to make into something marvelous. But instead it was predictable and full of plotholes. I will not mention them here since a few of you might not have seen to movie, but trust me on this one.The actors taking the shapes of apes are excellent, and they do a good enough job. Mark Wahlberg is stiff and doesn't really feel like he is in a perilous situation, but that is mostly because of his lack of lines, he says very little, asks almost nothing it doesn't really fit in what a person would do in his situation. You don't really get to know any of the characters.So, pretty good effects, lousy script, a typical burton movie, but in this case, the script is so bad and the effects not good enough to make watching it worthwhile.",

Let's get that out of the way right now, so that we may focus on how uninteresting any of the story or characters were.  Mark Wahlberg coasts through this one, with no character to play, other than a very animalistic, primal human (ironic, no?) who only wants to get back home.  Helena Bonham-Carter and Tim Roth have some fun (and give fun performances) playing their parts, but any political commentary is lost as each scene is just an excuse to blow something up, smash set pieces, or set something on fire.As an action movie, it's so-so.

It's an action film, pure and simple. Whatever political comment Shaffner's film had is bleached out of the screenplay (by William Broyles, Jr. who penned `Cast Away', Lawrence Konner and Mark D. Rosenthal); about the only stance the film takes is on the humane treatment of animals and the topic isn't nearly provocative enough in this context. There's a large cast, including Mark Wahlberg (not yet enough of a presence to carry an action lead), Helena Bonham Carter (as stuffy as usual, even in full ape costume), Estella Warren, Paul Giamatti and, as the villain, Tim Roth. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves but their performances are definitely in a minor key. Burton himself seems to have a curious disinterest in the project and none of the passion that infuses `Sleepy Hollow', `Beetlejuice' and even the misbegotten `Mars Attacks!' is evident here.

The bonanza of great effects make for great entertainment but the lack of a visionary story make this a one-dimensional kid's movie which won't stick in the brain for adults. There is no \"discussion\" on the moral/philosphical place of man in the universe: in the original book/movie, our hero is clearly divided since he neither fits in with the future's primitive humans nor the apes. This version is just another uncompelling \"Us vs. Them,\" and the war-like gorillas sound and look like Klingons in \"Star Trek.\" Speaking of gorillas, whom did they evolve from since there were originally only chimps? Where do they live, since there are too many for that hilltown? Where did the modern-speaking humans come from if the caucasian astronauts all died? Why does the blonde babe keep ducking out of scenes - does she have a bladder like a thimble? And are we on earth in the far future or far past? Or another dimension? This last plot problem ruins the great visual ending (try as it might to be like the book's end). The soundtrack also doesn't credit it's inspiration to the better original. For those who absurdly claim we need remakes because kids won't watch the originals, it was we kids who loved the original enough to generate 4 sequels, a live-action and animated TV series, lunch boxes, etc. and inspire Tim Burton.",

Folks, maybe you haven't seen some of the other movies that came out this year, but compared to the likes of \"Mummy Returns\", \"JPIII\", \"Swordfish\" etc., Tim Burton's POTA is a modern-day \"Citizen Kane\".I understand people don't like to see their favorite movie remade, but that's no reason to diss this movie. Besides, it's not a remake, it's a re-imaging.The original movie was a social commentary. The new POTA is a sci-fi action summer movie, and I don't see anything wrong with that especially if it's done the way Tim Burton did it. Racial inequality and fear of nuclear annihilation don't plague the world as much as they did in 1968. The story line is basically same.The acting is top-notch as opposed to the original's melodramatic and sometimes over-the-top acting. Mark Wahlberg gives a subtle and understated performance. Paul Giamatti provides great comic relief. And can you say Academy Award Nominee for Tim Roth and Helena Bonham-Carter. There are a lot of complaints about bad dialog. I must have overheard it, because I don't remember any cheesy or nonsense lines.The ending was fascinating. In two years, no other movie, besides Memento, made me think about it as much. The makeup and cinematography are absolutely amazing, as is the kick-ass score. I see how someone could get frustrated with the ending, because it makes you make use of those damn brain cells.

While in films like Boogie Nights and The Yards he had good supporting players, in Planet of the Apes he just can't carry the role. On the other hand, Tim Roth is very moody in his role as Thade, the film's menace. Helena Bonham Carter is good as the female monkey with a heart, but the make-up is unconvincing. Most of the other performances are standard but nothing award-winning. The film's direction is surprisingly bland giving Burton's usual atmospheric style. There has been a lot of controversy about the ending. I for one liked it and although it was a big surprise, I thought it was very clever.

A huge risk that Tim Burton took, and seemingly, with bad consequences.I was born 6 years after Charlton Heston went bananas on the original. I have *never* seen it. Once it was on TV, and I lost interest after five minutes. Not because it was a bad film, mind you, but because it looked too dated for me to watch, and I was in that terrible phase known as \"adolescence\". It would have been uncool to watch a '68 movie. I will correct this mistake later, when I buy the original \"Apes\".Anyway, I came into the movie theater with only one image of the original movie forever burned in my mind: the epic Statue of Liberty climax. I purposely avoided all reviews of this film, so as not to spoil the fun. And I found myself deeply immersed in another Burton fantasy, where reality is as dark and grim as the lush landscapes that are always depicted in his worlds of madness. He is an expert in depicting outcasts (as in Batman, Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands), and although Mark Wahlberg wasn't as strong as Johnny Depp, Jack Skellington (or even Michael Keaton) as a main character, he was credible enough. Helena Bonham Carter is still incredibly seductive, even under tons of makeup and (gasp!) a beard. The rest of the characters are convincingly depicted, and the makeup excels.Again, not knowing the plot of the original, the only thing I disliked about this movie was that during the first half hour it dragged a bit. I guess that was due to the number of characters that were introduced. Afterwards, the movie turns quite philosophical (at least, IMHO). Was it directed at racism (which, from what I've seen, is still alive in the U.S.)? At animal cruelty? Was it a veiled message that we, as a thinking race, are doomed to remain evil and cruel with each other for all time? Or was Burton only trying to entertain us? (I doubt the last assumption). Whatever it is, this is one of those rare movies that open up a world of possibilities due to the use of metaphors. In a way, very similar to fairy tales, where the main character has to have enough resources to thrive and survive in a hostile environment...*SPOILER AHEAD* *SPOILER AHEAD* *SPOILER AHEAD* ...that is, unless you realize this is a mythic story and not a fairy tale, and that the ending has an amazing twist. One that, if sequels are avoided, could be one of the best endings in *ages*.Mr. Tim Burton, please, DON'T make a sequel, and you will have done a homage to the original series. The ending is just *perfect* as it is.I hope watching the original movie doesn't change my mind about this one.",

First the good - it is visually stunning, as you would expect from a Burton movie; there are a couple of good performances, particularly Helena Bonham Carter who is outstanding. Sadly that's it.Now let's get to the bad and the ugly. The story is so full of plot holes that you'll weep with anger. Didn't anyone bother to read the script? Its nonsense. Characters do things that are obviously absurd and have no internal logic. An example (warning: very minor spoiler), when they get to a river crossing guarded by part of the Ape army, Leo tells us that they can't go around because they don't have time - they have to ride through. But then they wait hours until the dead of night before doing that. The only reason they wait is to make the visuals of the \"ride through the camp\" scene more dramatic. This makes no sense. It is literally nonsense. And don't even get me started on the ending... its meaningless.Its not just one scene, almost every point in the movie is gibberish if you think about it for more than 2 seconds.Beyond that the characterizations are non-existent. Apart from Leo and a couple of the apes, no one has a character. Who on earth are the humans? What motivates them? Would we care about them if they all got thrown into a giant meat grinder? No we would not.What is most annoying is that this could have been a great movie. The visual execution is stunning. The apes look real and move as you would expect an evolved ape to. They must have spent so many hours and so much money on that aspect of the film. Why did they only spend 26 minutes and $2.80 on the script?Finally, however much of a cliche it has become and however cheesy the costumes where, the 1968 film at least tried to be about something and its famous ending was genuinely related to the point of the film and was truly shocking.

It is also usually compelling storytelling - not Pierre Boulle's PLANET but not the original film either.  Points for originality for sure. I like that the humans could speak - their lack of speech in the first film was never effectively explained.  Even though the film is fleet, there is a noticable lull after Neil and company have successfully fled ape city. Burton wisely gets right on to the film's conclusion and (surprise) ending post haste.  But while the story flies by, the character development is non-existant and the love story is divided between the female of TWO species.  To be fair, our leading man is not the most compelling actor - but Heston was no Olivier either.  The story has multiple holes - where did the horses come from anyway? There's no sign of any non-ape or human life except these equines but no clue is given as to why there are no other creatures about.  The cameos by Heston and Harrison are badly handled though the refs to first film are fun for fans.  The surprise ending manages to combine the shock of the original with the option for a sequel.Burton's film lacks the scope and epic feel of it's inspiration and it will doubtless join the LOST IN SPACE film on the rental shelves.  Now if someone were to make Boulle's vision - that would be something.",

Perhaps my expectations were lowered after the initial negative reaction by the press, but I was pleasantly surprised at the intelligence, professionalism, and self-awareness of this blockbuster. It was a re-imagining of the planet ruled by apes concept in the best sense of the word; it is taken in a direction completely different and fresh than the original movie. I was chhering through every minute of this film, because like all Tim Burton movies, everything came to together and worked marvelously: the characters were engaging and the story was interesting. The ending was, in my opinion, the icing on the cake. I knew there was going to be a shock ending when I went in, and actually sort of predicted halfway through when Charlton Heston's character started explaining the plot threads. It may not make complete sense, but works within the film's context and wraps it up in an appropriately cheesy way. But I think they should start thinking about a sequel. Leo Davidson's further adventures on OUR planet of the apes. They should show Thade as ruler of the world or president, that would be hilarious. It would again take the ruling apes concept in an entirely new direction. They should bring the entire cast from the remake back and have some other A-list director make it and Burton producing it. Also try and give a reasonably believable explanation of the final events in the story. I think they would make a very entertaining and interesting movie. You listening 20th Century Fox?",

            "content": "I have to say it. Tim Burton's retelling of Planet of the Apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys.OK, that's off my chest. No more monkey puns, I promise.Seriously, though, Planet of the Apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing, filled with thrills, action, adventure, wit and bits of funny (dare I say, monkey) business. I know, I know, I promised.And for those film buffs who are fond of the original, Burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie.Mark Wahlberg stars as Capt. Leo Davidson, a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future. He crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted, captured and sold into slavery.Despite being darker than the original, Burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious.Some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically Burton: An organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed. Then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter. The seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty: \"One thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager,\" he says. You don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement. Touches such as these are what stamps this movie with Burton's brand.Lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout: The first words spoken by an ape to Davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are: \"Take your stinking hand off of me, you damned, dirty human.\" Anyone familiar with the first version of the film will, of course, recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue.Another of Burton's in-jokes is to have Charlton Heston, star of the original, play the chimpanzee father of Tim Roth's Gen. Thade. The young chimp goes to visit his dying father. Both have one thing in common, a hatred of humans. With his dying breath, the elder spews out his vile: \"Damn them, damn them all to hell,\" he says before expiring. That is the famous line Heston's Taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible secret.The performances throughout are top-notch. Wahlberg plays Davidson not as some gung-ho hero, but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home. He is reluctant to lead the human rebellion; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet. This hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable.Roth is ferocious, cunning, cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity. He leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet. It is a masterful turn.Helena Bonham Carter is Ari, the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals. Hers is a smart, compassionate characterization.Michael Clarke Duncan is big and brutal as Attar the gorilla aid to Thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken.\nA fine comic outing is given by Paul Giamatti as Limbo, the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures. As the battle between apes and humans looms, the cowardly Limbo pleads, \"Can't we all just get along,\" echoing the words of Rodney King.Much of the success of Planet of the Apes goes to Burton's technical crew, especially production designer Rick Heinrichs and the legendary Rick Baker who created the ape makeup.Burton's musical collaborator, Danny Elfman, provides another fine score, though it is not as memorable as his work on Batman or Sleepy Hollow.The movie's only letdown comes at the very end where Burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original. He comes close, but falls short.Otherwise, Planet of the Apes is what a summer movie should be: An amusement park ride filled with lots of action, stunts and a few laughs. This is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype.",

Critics are just critics, and will never be able to enjoy a movie without picking it apart. This was a marvelous film in so many ways. The script is extremely well written and keeps you guessing. In the end you'll be dazzled and confused, but no less amazed! What made this film so enjoyable was the grand sense of humor and pacing. It was never boring and some of the apes were hilarious. The ending, which has been much talked about, is wonderfully twisted and different than usual. Wouldn't it have been boring if Wahlberg just came back to Earth with a happy ending? Knowing Tim Burton you know something weird had to happen. Wahlberg gave a great performance as the earnest astronaut. From the opening scenes I knew this film would be great. The credits sequence was extremely imaginative and beautifully done. Everything in the film was superbly done. Ape City was truly eye-popping. I couldn't tell if it was done by computer or models. I loved Charlton Heston's little cameo. He really explained the mechanics of the story in just one scene. And it's a fascinating story at that. I highly recommend this film. It's probably best if you haven't seen the original, since I haven't and I really enjoyed this one. So go see it and have an old-fashioned good time at the movies.

            "content": "The latest version of 'Planet of the Apes' is an interesting misfire. It has a lot of ideas, good and bad, and seems unable to distinguish between the two, and ends up emphasizing the bad ones more than the good. In a very broad sense, it follows the general idea of the 1968 film, that of a world where apes rule and mankind is considered inferior, and of a time-travelling astronaut who becomes stranded there. The apes behave quite differently in this film though. They are apparently meant to behave like real apes, aside from the fact that they are more intelligent and can speak. So they growl, screech, roar and leap all over the place when excited. An ape army leader, General Thade (Tim Roth), is particularly savage in his manner; the other ape characters seem generally less so. Mark Wahlberg plays the astronaut, Captain Leo Davidson, who is stranded on the planet. He has one of two reactions to any situation- annoyance or confusion. Or both. His one-note, furrow-browed performance doesn't allow the audience much emotional involvement in his plight. As the female ape who cares, Helena Bonham Carter's character Ari very much recalls Dr. Zira from the earlier movie. Here though her interest in Leo seems much more than a professional or humanitarian one; she obviously has the hots for him but don't worry, nothing along those lines ever happens. Carter gives far and away the most credible and nuanced performance, however her ape make-up is far too 'cute,' and provides a constant distraction. Perhaps the main thing missing from this 'Planet of the Apes' is a hero. Wahlberg is definitely no Charlton Heston and it's apparent the script never intended him to be. In fact, despite a few back-and-forth gags vis-a-vis human/ape behavior and stereotypes, it's hard to know exactly how this film wants us to feel about the planet's society and its treatment of humans. (Probably the funniest line in the movie has to do with getting rid of human 'pets' before they reach puberty- \"Believe me, you don't want a human teenager in your house!\") The huge battle between apes and humans at the end is pointless and unsatisfying, and the tacked-on epilogue is just downright stupid and reeks of desperation to find some kind of clever ending. Rod Serling would not be pleased.",

Someone needs to tell Hollywood, that when you revisit a classic story, bring something new to the story. Special effects alone is not enough. I believe that Hollywood thought that by just having more elaborate costumes and apes, they would have a better movie, wrong! The story was just paper thin and the script was one of the worst ever. The first hour of this film was just a bunch of campy jokes. I have never seen more uninspired performances. However, to be fair, the actors had nothing to work with. The story is just patched together. Few characters are developed or have any importance. Man, this was a bad film. However, people will consider it a smash hit, because of the box office totals. However, most of the money taken in by this film was in the first week, so the negative word of mouth had not gotten out yet. This film has dropped like a rock since week one.

            "review_title": "A reimagination of a cult classic?",
            "content": "Without a doubt, the 1968 Planet of the Apes was one of my favourite science fiction movies of the time.  Indeed, a whole generation grew up on the concept of \"going ape\" over the numerous sequels and the inevitable tv-spin off.  So when I knew that Planet of the Apes was going to re-done, I was jumping for joy - at last a real chance to put a big budget to an original concept penned by the author of the book which inspired the Planet of the Apes movies. CONTAINS SPOILERS But with the movie, came casualties - fortuently, Tim Burton, director of Batman (1989), bravely took on the mantle that other directors (i.e. James Cameron) would not take on - the poision chalice that was to \"revisit\" the planet of the apes.  Burton claims this version is a reimagination of the cult classic, but it is clear that Burton wanted to outdo the original in every way possible, and in some areas he certainly succeeds.The costumes, the make-ups, the sets, the direction and special effects is brilliant, and a much darker version of the original, but special effects and costumes do not make a good story.  And this is where Burton falls down.The 1968 version of the planet of the apes illustrated and concentrated on pressing issues of the day, namely civil rights, racisim, and to some extents, animal welfare and slavery.  The 2001 version, in contrast, doesn't answer or ask questions on any specific issue outside civil, the effects of time travel and animal rights.  In fact, it seems to taken more from the Amercian Civil War, rather than today's issues.The plot revolves around a space outpost near Saturn's rings - that use's highly trained and intelligent chimps to do missions that humans won't do - one chimp is sent through an electrical storm to a planet, and Mark Walberg goes to rescue the lost chimp - only to find himself on the planet of the apes. Without revealing too much of the plot - it transpires that Walberg blames himself (with good cause).Yet, with all its dark and well developed speical effects, Its clearly intended as a summer blockbuster movie, it could have been so much more - espically from director, Tim Burton.  I expected something wierd yet stragely compelling, yet we have a summer blockbuster movie that tries to get \"bums on seats\" without a good script and story that was compelling enough.We have the hero, Mark Walberg playing as wooden as I've ever seen him - in a constant state of concentration, with little emotion.  Fortuently we have the over-the-top bad guy Tim Roth as General Thade and the wonderful Helena-Botam-Carter to keep the story moving at a fast pace.  But sometimes the pace is too fast, there seems to be no time to look around, no time to actually dig at the concepts, the ideas, the questions that it was trying to raise to society, whereas the original stopped and took the time to create concepts and build on the ideas with the ability to ask the questions, and then answer them in a concise and logical way.Some may criticise it for being a trashy summer movie, and in some ways they are right.  This isn't one of Burton's best - and nowhere near the original 1968 version - but if you took it as a standalone movie without comparing it to any other Ape movie - perhaps I can agree that it is indeed a good, watchable film - but it lacked the vigor, the charm of the original - and the ending was confusing, yet logical.Thade had gone back to Earth and caused a revolution in the same way that Walberg had done on the Planet of the Apes - the whole story is very similar to the novel - but there is one problem, how did Thade know where Earth was? No-one told him where it was, nor did he know what it looked like.  In either case it was a clever ending, perhaps a bit too clever for its own good - because it made the audience confused.Of course the rumors behind the movie fuel the confusion.  Was it true that Burton had edited the film right to the last minute?  Were scenes cut that would have made the film more of a soul?  Did Burton steal the ending of a General Thade sitting in the Lincoln Memorial stolen from someone else? Were there really five different endings?  All these questions don't detract from the enjoyment of the movie - but it does make one ask where the soul of the film was and what it was trying to achieve.Throughout the movie there are many problems. For example, throughout the film I kept trying to figure out why, in the year 2029 did the American Space Force use Chimps, and not satellites or other robotic system to investigate the electrical storm?  The planet that Walberg lands on is certainly not Earth, as it has two moons - yet, how does Thade (indeed, the whole ape civilisation) move from the planet to Earth?  Why, when Walberg goes back in time, doesn't he try to stop himself or his ship from going into the storm?  And why, when Walberg goes to Earth does he go straight for Washington, instead of Cape Caveral?  Did NASA move its lauch facility to Washington DC?Despite the plots problems, the confusing ending (was Walberg really on Earth all that time or not?), and the general feeling that it had been rushed.  I did enjoy the film, and it did make me think about the issues that it wanted to raise, but I just didn't think about the issues or feel enjoyment of the film as much I enjoyed and thought about the original Planet of the Apes - perhaps I'm giving the original too much credit, and Burton not enough - perhaps I demanded and expected too much and cared too little to what Burton was trying to do, trying to say with the film. Nethertheless, the message was lost in amongst the special effects and little care and detail to attention of the main concept of the film.Overall: An average, yet an enjoyable movie. 7/10",

What I couldn't work out was the ending, I wont go into details for those who haven't seen it, but I do feel that because the 1968 classic had such a shocking and thought provoking ending, the writers of this version almost `felt obliged' to try and live up to that and as a result it doesn't really make any sense and tie in with the story you have just followed for the past 2 hours \u0096 or maybe it does and I just missed the point!, either way \u0096 FAR too confusing!

History has not been very kind to the 1968 classic which featured the likes of Roddy McDowall (Lassie, Flicka), the beautiful Kim Hunter (A Streetcar Named Desire) and Charlton Heston, who must have had a lot of explaining to do to his fundamentalist friends for appearing in the original evolution epic and this remake. (Then again, aside from a couple of sandal sagas, his whole career cries out for an explanation), but for a generation it remains one of the most shockingly effective films of its time.This time we get Helena Bonham Carter in the culmination of her costume drama career, looking for all the world like Michael Jackson in drag (as if that wouldn't be redundant), Paul Giamatti, delightful and yet somehow wasted as an aging orang-utan, Kris Kristofferson, as the good guy we can't wait to see snuffed, and, of course, Marky Mark, surprisingly effective in his biggest film to date sans the monumentally untalented George Clooney. (No, Boogie Nights wasn't THAT big.)First of all, the monkey suits were killer!  It was unsettling at first, and then just plain eerie, to see talking apes that looked real, instead of the laughable effect of the original.  Who else but Rick Baker could have worked such magic?  Along with Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, this talented trio simply could not fail.  Still, there are problems.Visually, the film is flawless, thanks to Burton.  But there are holes big enough to drive a truck through if you care to take pot shots.  On the other hand, you could just sit back and be amused for a couple of hours, in which case you could do much worse.  So here's the skinny.  Marky Mark chases a chimp into a space storm in an attempt to rescue him.  He goes through a worm hole and ends up on a planet ruled by apes.  The humans rally... oh heck, why bother.  It's the same film as in 1968.  Got it?  There are a couple of twists that I can't reveal without spoiling the film, but let's just say the screenwriter had to earn his fee somehow.  And the ending?  Well, remember what I said about the truck.This film has been on the drawing board for what seemed like an eternity, and I'm still wondering what happened to Schwarzenegger.  Instead we get Marky Mark?  Well I guess those monkey suits were expensive.  I suppose there could have been a little more humor, and it would have been nice to see the tension between Carter, Wahlberg and Estella Warren played up a bit, but then Warren proves why models don't always make good actors; actors have to act.The high points of this movie, I suppose, were Michael Clarke Duncan as Attar the gorilla and Tim Roth as the evil chimpanzee General Thade.  It can't be easy to act inside that get up, but they pull it off magnificently.What can I say?  This is one you just can't miss, if only for the historical comparison.

I always enjoyed his movies, but after continuously watching them for many years now (especially since they were released on DVD), I can finally spot their weakness.You see, some annoying feelings come to surface when you watch 'Batman' or 'Sleepy Hollow' for a tenth time. They are boring movies! Or to be fair, the are movies with long, boring scenes. Evidently Tim Burton seems to fear and respect every frame he shoots while editing and this behaviour creates very long dialog scenes, that work against the pacing of the movie.Long dialog scenes that don't provide exposition should be cut in a non-drama movie. Let's face it, Tim Burton has never worked with a 'Taxi Driver' script, so most of the long dialog scenes should be divided among action scenes.Also, the suspense doesn't change much in his movies. 'Sleepy Hollow' runs in the same way from start to finish, so does 'Batman'. I must say that his best work, is his comedies and maybe he should try to transfer the mood of those films to his other work too.'Planet of the Apes' is bad and I'm not talking about the ENDING, which is the best part of the movie. Only a moron would try to analyse what really happened there. Have you noticed that stupid people, always need to lower every situation to their own standards, in order to understand it? Of course this creates even more confusion (to them) and they won't get this ending no matter what, so let's proceed. By the way, true cinema is about expressing emotions and not opinions. If you need to state an opinion, the printed word is the perfect medium for it.The biggest mistake of the movie is this Burton element. 'Planet' needed aggressive editing, in order to become fun and not boring, which is what it is now. Specifically the dinner scene and the escape scene in the village. Burton treated this script like it was 'Godfather', so we watch the apes discuss over dinner about every day and social matters for ten minutes, like we care. They're talking apes! On with the story please! Obviously they wanted to balance the action with some drama scenes, but the writing is very bad. A lot of other scenes are boring too and should be deleted, since they destroy everything. Burton seems to have lost his humor in this movie too, since these long scenes could work if they were funny, but they are merely irritating.Unfortunately the script is quite weak, so even if that editing took place, it wouldn't make a masterpiece out of the story. Mark Wahlberg looks like a little kid in the whole movie, possibly because of Burton. He wanted him to become this anti Charlot Heston, an action hero who's in the movie only for the fun ride. It just doesn't work.On the positive side, Burton shows off his craftsmanship for one more time, providing us with some fairy tale images and an introduction in a space station, which is the most spectacular cinematic work since 'Superman'.'Planet of the Apes' shouldn't be made at all. How can you recreate perfection? What's next, a remake of 'Lawrence of Arabia'? Anyway, for once more Burton made an action movie that doesn't stand the test of repetitive viewings and this is because of his fear for aggressive editing.4/10",

I wasn't really very happy to find out Mark Wahlberg was starring in it, but I've been wrong before about how someone can hold up a role so I decided to give it a go.As others have said, Tim Roth does a good job, Helena Bonham Carter is pretty decent, and most of the others are basically blase. Marky Mark, however, was a disaster. He has absolutely ZERO on-screen presence, he can't act well enough to even convince me that he is a human being, much less a astronaut, and the movie suffered badly because of this. I didn't care about his lead character, I had no idea what was going on in his head at any time, he never showed fear, anger, happiness, or any of the myriad emotions that most real people have. It was truly awful. Charleton Heston may have overacted in the 1968 version of this movie, but at least you could associate the word \"act\" with his performance. And Charleton had the on-screen presence that was so lacking in this version.Others have mentioned some of the various plot problems, including the ending, so I won't go into them except to say they are there and they make a number of plot events implausible. I would also like to point out that, once again (just as in the original POTA), the presence of horses on this \"planet\" is yet another obvious plot problem.As a straightforward action film the movie is pretty decent. The ape makeup and the ape movement is pretty damn good.Overall, I was considerably disappointed in this version of \"Planet of the Apes\" It had no originality, they chose the wrong leading actor, and the plot had huge holes. If you want to experience \"Planet of the Apes\" rent the original...it's so much better that there isn't really any comparison (except for the title).

The original had a very '60s or hippy mindset about how humans destroyed the earth, and nature took over. That wouldn't go over now.  So, I asked myself, what could they do to the movie to make it more modern.  It seemed to me that they tried by making it be a metaphor for class wars, or political racism.  But that was soon abandoned.  Eventually it became the usual.  A watered-down post-apocalyptic-like road movie (or escape, whatever).\nI was too busy searching for some sign of intelligence to tell you how the acting was (it could have been good, it could have been horrible). Visually it was stunning if you have to resort to that.  And the score was wonderful (thanks Danny Elfman).  But for the rest of the movie, skip it.

And with police cars and everything, it kind of reminded me of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\"'s ending.  The Jefferson monument was a hark back to those cool cartoons where they would blow up Mt. Rushmore and it would turn into the villains face.

It didn't stink to high heaven, which is as much as I seem to hope for in a movie these days.  The story (of which I will reveal nothing - I don't want to spoil it for anyone) is very good, with lots of nifty twists.  The Pride of Dorchester MA, Mark Wahlberg (remembered in Boston as Mahky Mahk), is quite good as the protagonist human.  On the down side, Paul Giamatti's human slave trader of an orangutan provided an irritating dose of little needed comic relief, and Helena Bonham Carter is surprisingly shallow, not showing any presence from under all that ape makeup.  (The same cannot be said of Tim Roth, who exudes much menace as the scary monkey of every little kid's nightmares.)Overall, I'd have to say a very good story was given a formulaic action-movie treatment with some very irritating moments, but not enough to ruin the movie entirely.  It helped, of course, that I saw this at a matinee, so I only had to cough up $5.  Given that, I'd say I got my money's worth.Rating: six stars on my Manos scale.",

            "content": "First off, let me say that I found the original overrated.  Not bad, but not a 'classic'.  When I heard they were remaking it, with Cameron at the helm, I was extremely worried (I dislike everything the man's done in the 90's, with the exception of True Lies, which was fun).  When it turned out to be Tim Burton, I felt that maybe he could make this movie truly 'relevant', with sharp satire, and perhaps a little human development. Alas, it wasn't to be.  Understand that I think that Burton is a director who's style often overwhelms the substance of any film he's shooting (note, see Sleepy Hollow).  That said, he brings enormous creative energy to the film, and is to be respected for massing the talented crew he has.  I'm glad to hear the people mentioned Danny Elfman's score, his best.  It hooks you from beginning to end, and has the strength to become a contender at this year's oscars.  Thunderous, rousing, brilliant, the score is better written then the script for eliciting a dramatic response.  Special credit must be given to Rick Baker, the only Hollywood make-up artist whom I've heard of (he's acheived a celebrity status if you will).  His simian creations are remarkable, and allow the actors to act through their make-up.  Well, that would be more true if the actors had something to act.  The script makes no attempt to achieve any form of nuance or subtlety.  It eschews what could have been a satire, and asks us to accept fight scenes and stunt work.  Discussing the stunt work, it is phenomenal as well. Again, the technical achievements of this film are not to be ignored.  The film is fairly entertaining UNTIL.....  The climax.  What is supposed to be a pulse-pounding scene proves to be a series of cliches, and a horrible use of deux ex machina, and the ending is fairly silly and unnecessary.  As for the actors, many attempt to act, but many have nothing to do (the humans).  However, the performances by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are excellent.  No kidding, but I think Roth deserves an oscar nomination (as it stands now).  His scenery chewing performance as General Thade is energetic and outstanding.  Having said that, expect this to win a make-up oscar, and receive a nomination for best score, but it's not a film to rush out and see.",

            "review_title": "Tim Burton has always been overrated",
            "content": "It may be a bit late to weigh in on this film, but I feel compelled to if for no other reason than that Tim Burton has just arrogantly messed with another classic, Charlie and Chocolate Factory, and has once again screwed things up. Burton has no concept of plot or acting, his style is entirely visual, and he is dishonest as all get out when he wants to make a point. I'm sorry that Tim had problems with his parents, especially his father, but that does not justify his screwing with classic stories so that he can whine once again about how parents just don't understand you and might even abandon you.Having got that off my chest, I would like to summarize POTA as follows. The movie makes no sense and the reason it makes no sense is that the director has no vision, no sense of a story that he wants to tell. Even the highly touted ape makeup is a mistake, because the director has no idea whether the apes are supposed to be subhuman or better than human. As a consequence they behave in a manner that simply leaves the viewer confused.I am a biologist who has studied behavior in apes, so I might be more picky than most, but I defy any viewer to answer the following question. Why are all the female apes chimpanzees? I have watched the ape village scenes several times and to my view there is not a single female gorilla or orang utan in the entire place. Also these female chimps don't look like chimps, but like some sort of odd chimp/human hybrid, which might explain the attraction between Marky Mark and Helena BC, but otherwise feels just thrown in (This is what I mean by Burton throwing logic out the window to make his themes fit his preconceptions). For example why does the female chimp (Carter) have eyebrows, a trait missing from every primate but humans? Also why do chimps, which seem to make up the vast majority of the apes, walk upright except when they charge? This makes them very ineffective as warriors. They can't hold weapons, so why do they wear armor? The acting in this film is confusing and few characters seem realized, and once again I think Burton is to blame. In Burton films the only actors who are memorable are those willing to create their own characters and overact shamelessly, e.g. Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice, Nicholson's Joker, DeVito's Penguin, Walken's headless horseman. In this film this tradition is carried on by Tim Roth's Thade, a character so psychotic it seems amazing that anyone takes him seriously. The cast includes some good actors, but all are handicapped by bad direction. For example, Paul Giamatti an excellent character actor, tries hard to create a believable character in his whining sycophantic slave trading orang utan, but he is made up as a female rather than a male orang utan, which collapses the character completely.Other actors fare no better. Wahlberg, at best a charming male ing\u00e9nue, cannot act like a leader, so I was startled by the idea that all the humans would follow his lead when he seems to have no idea as to what he's doing throughout the entire film. The other humans seem to be merely tagging along looking confused. Michael Clarke Duncan, subtle and wonderful in the Green Mile, here plays sort of a King Kong who can talk. As a subtext, why are the Gorillas played by Afrcian American actors, and the chimps by white actors? This leads me to what I think is Burton's greatest weakness, his ability to direct actresses. The only actress who has ever turned in a memorable performance in a Burton film is Michelle Pfeiffer's sly, slinky Catwoman in Batman II. Otherwise excellent actresses have been left to flounder by Burton, e.g. Christina Ricci is Sleepy Hollow, Kim Basinger in Batman. Given this history, I find confusing all of the hostility and crass comments about Estella Warren's performance as Daena, the only human in the film with any personality. Estella Warren is a powerful presence, who in every film in which she appears works from the premise that she is, at the least, the equal of all the male characters and that she is smarter even than most of those. She tries to pull that off in POTA, but she is left to flounder, trying to work off the giant vacuum emitted by Marky Mark. Warren acts using her face to communicate subtle emotions and changes of mood, but that tactic backfires in this film, where subtlety is lost. She gets no perceivable reactions from Wahlberg, who seems lost in his own world, and she has almost no scenes with anyone else. As a result Warren has little to do but look distressed and confused. I think most of the negative comments directed at Warren's acting come from silly insecure young men who feel that a pretty woman should not also be strong and competent, and simply want to ogle her.To summarize, this film is probably the worst big budget film ever made, but don't blame the actors. As they say in Russia, fish begin to stink from the head. In this case the head is the director.",

Leo Davidson, but my hat goes off to General Thade himself, Tim Roth. He was *excellent* as the sadistic, human loathing primate villain. Michael Clark Duncan also was perfect support as Thade's brutish right hand man, Colonel Attar.Every one who was an ape did an excellent job at moving like actual primates. The score kept you with the flow of the movie, the choreography was marvelous, and the acting was good. The action sequences were very intense, and the chase between the humans and Thade's Army was very suspenseful. There was an outstanding surprise to the end of this movie, it was very unexpected. I recommend this movie to any one who wants an exciting, special effects adventure, but this movie also has a very surprise end, good acting, and a great plot.        Do not compare this to the original, because the only thing connects them is a title. Also, Charlton Heston made a pleasing cameo as Thade's father, and blurts out the most famous quote in sci-fi movie history!

There were certainly things in this film which made it worth seeing.Despite what is said, the visuals and effects were interesting.  There was enough story to at least hold the interest of most.Sadly, what it lacked are those elements which made the original PotA good. The original had weak effects to be sure and the plot even had its problems. Nonetheless the depth of the plot, the debate about the content of man, the thoughts and concepts that were classic, are all missing.  I would have hoped that in a \"re-imagining\" the philosophy and concepts would have CHANGED; but not that they would have been omitted.I still use illustrations from the original to elucidate points.  I didn't walk away with such a feeling from this movie.  The debate between superiority of human vs. ape has been reduced to scant allusion to racial tension.  There is enough illogic to not deserve itemization (the horses have already been discussed quite throughly).  Worst of all was the ending. My friend and I are quite familiar with sci-fi, fantasy, irony and great literature.  We \"get\" most every reference.  However, BOTH of us looked at each other and said \"huh\"?  While there may be some explanations for this they didn't even establish enough clues for some healthy hypothesizing.  It seemed just \"thrown in\" and out of context with the rest of the movie.To close out the critique I will just state that there is a positively tragic movement in Hollywood to \"dumb down\" every creation.  It's like Hollywood has the touch of mental mediocrity.  You'd think for scores of millions of dollars they could somehow come up with a story and content worth the millions of dollars of effects.  Give us something that can stimulate our minds, not just our senses.  I fear this \"re-imagining\" fell prey to this phenomenon.That being said, I return full circle to the fact that this movie enough going for it to have been enjoyable were it to stand on its own (and taking into account the current brain-dead state of today's Hollywood scripts). There were a couple homages to the original movie which gave us a laugh or two.  As I said, the effects and even visual composition were worth seeing. If you wish to see a movie to go \"ooooh\" and \"aaahhhh\" over the effects as opposed to the \"invisible effect\" approach (where you are engrossed in the story, not aware of the visuals being \"effects\"), then you will enjoy this.I would recommend watching this.  Just enjoy it for what it is and don't expect a level of content comparable to the original.  At the very least, this movie is FAR beyond the level of any \"Apes\" SEQUELS, which had thoroughly useless plots without the concession of good effects.",

He gives us foreshadowing, atmosphere, and a sense of reality.He did none of those with this movie.I wanted to like this film; I really did.  In fact, most of the movie was enjoyable.  I found that the apes moved realistically, or at least as one would expect, Tim Roth was a good villain - if more than a bit flat - and that the religious element was delicate but not underdeveloped.However, at about thirty-forty minutes from the end of the film, things fell apart.Characters show up for no reason; we are spoon-fed that which the viewer can already deduce; romance is conjured out of nowhere.  Tim Burton could have made this a satire, but instead he made it an action movie that pales in comparison with even a Steven Seagal vehicle.There is no atmosphere, soul, or logic to the film.  If you liked Burton's other movies, by all means do not see this one.And wow, the ending.  I overheard someone mention Rod Serling's name on the way out.  I can tell you, if I had known who said that, I would have looked at him and told him that Twilight Zone endings were foreshadowed, consistent, and above all else, MADE SENSE.  The movie doesn't even play properly within the logic it sets up for itself.I went into this with higher expectations than I should have.  If you see it, don't make the same mistake I did.",

            "content": "(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!) God in Heaven, where does one begin? I became an APES freak around 1973 and collected the toys, memorabilia, and all. I even made a fan magazine on PLANET OF THE APES. This franchise was lost in the dust for a few decades and I prayed it would return one day. Well, it FINALLY has - and I'm not so sure it's for the better.Yes, the kids will love this film, and yes, the toys and Ape Popularity will soar once again. But Lord, what an AWFUL motion picture - heartbreaking, really, after suuuccch a long wait. When I heard that Tim Burton and Rick Baker were involved I had some hopes. As I saw magazine articles, trailers, and makeup shots I said \"yeah, this may actually work!\" But then I saw the finished product...and my worst fears were confirmed, my few hopes were shot down, and once again I knew that there is no escaping the wrath of today's lousy movies.As the last 25 years or so passed before my eyes during the movie, I got disgusted, angered, and bored. Now, it's too easy to charge me with being too biased toward the 1968 original; I fully accepted some changes. Too bad every one was for the WORST. Well, enough preliminary stuff; let's get on to the movie, shall we? ---It's treated as a silly, dumb, stupid, lame joke. It's like watching Looney Tunes on acid or something. Tim Burton reportedly had much fun with this film, even laughing after yelling \"Cut!\" after each shot - and it shows. Burton has NO respect for this subject and thinks the APES are funny monkeys to be snickered at. And tossing in some lame variations of classic lines from the 1968 version only hinders, and seem forced. Though the unfunny and aching silliness is what peeves me the most, there's more:Where's the script? What little story there is is full of convoluted and illogical situations. The so-called \"story\" merely zips in and out of perfunctory APES scenarios: A convenient hunt scene as soon as the astronaut lands, and an obligatory escape attempt, for example. The characters are totally uninteresting. ALL of the humans, that's the first thing. Michael Clark Duncan looks good, but offers nothing. Marky Mark is by-the-numbers and not much of an actor. People are speaking highly of Helena Bonham Carter as the girl chimp, but her character just squeals a lot and is afraid of her own shadow. Her Animal Activist potential is hinted at but dropped quickly. When she falls for Marky, it's absurd. I mean, she loves animals but does she want to sleep with them?? When she kisses the astronaut at the end of the movie, who cares, it's another loan from the original, except that at least there had been more involvement and caring between Taylor and Zira. THEY seemed to spend weeks and weeks getting to know and understand each other; this time, Carter and Mark seem to have only been introduced an hour or two beforehand. And her makeup (as with the other females) is VERY POOR. John Chambers runs circles around Rick Baker there, with his original Zira makeup from the first version.Yes, by the way, the other makeup is very good. Particularly Tim Roth's evil-looking Thade. Pity that Roth's idea of portraying a villain here though is to snarl, grunt, hiss, and swing around the room. I was looking forward to Roth's performance most of all, but he blew it.I don't much care for the beastial savagery and more \"primitive\" apes of this new feature, either. To me, the Apes were more like spoiled Monkeys, and far too irrational and animalistic to run the planet. And how does this make them so superior to the humans, anyway? These talkative homo sapiens look capable enough to plan their own revolt.The character of Limbo was an annoying and unfunny Jar Jar Binks-type, and we needed him out of there ASAP. What a stooge. Assasinate him, please.\nCharlton Heston's cameo could have been decent, had it not been destroyed by his classic \"Damn Them All To Hell!\" line that came off as desperate and embarrassing. It could have worked in a skit from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, but in what should be an intense and intelligent sci-fi film.And the ending? What can you say? It is closer to the book, but comes off as confusing in its execution. It looks Stupid, obligatory, and conveniently sets up for a (gulp) sequel. Man, what a dumb excuse for a movie!!!! Whether there ever was another version or not, this is one limp knee-slapper. Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk!Damn You to Hell, Tim Burton!!",

The extended walking in the desert scenes were just silly.  And for all these people are hanging onto, it is still just a B-movie. Tim Burtons version, which is exactly that, is tim burtons version.  It is pretty silly to compare it because the whole entire movie was reworked. But people forget the whole entire original book was reworked to have some commentary on racism and nuclear war in the original movie.  But back to the point.  I went in this movie expecting burton to deviate, even hoping. That is exactly what happened, burton reworked everything.  Thank GOD.  (no offense, but the original is a pretensious, seriously flawed, sixties, B Sci Fi movie, that has alot of inconsistancies to it, but it is probably the funniest movies I know of, because of all those reasons) Let me put it this way, this is a film that burton did for fincial reasons, mainly to fund his pet projects(Ed Wood the most notable). I was not expecting greatness, i was not expecting this to be sleepy hollow or ed wood.  I was expecting this to be a b-movie.  The acting was bad, but who cares, all acting in action movies is bad, the exception being batman, where jack nickolson brought it to a whole new level.  That and i did not think burton wanted good acting, or he would have cast his regulars.  Tim burton saw this movie as an opportunity to indulge in the b-movie genre, and make a bundle(which he will).  It was not supposed to be high art, just a fun sci-fi movie, and it would be foolish to expect anything else.Visually the movie is not so trademarky burton, but his touch is there. Yeah some of the battle scenes are silly, and in fact there are alot of inconsistancies.  But who cares.  The movie moved along very well, though a bit to fast at times.  The movie alone is worth seeing for the charlton heston apperance, which is possibly, and probably intentionally on burtons part, the funniest scene in the movie.   So go see it, but do not expect a masterpiece, or a loyal remake of the original(which never was a masterpiece).",

However, it is an entertaining film which is not one of Burton's finest, but is decent blockbuster fare.The plot clicks along at a cracking rate, so it is never dull, although a bit more time dwelling on the central character and the world of the film would not have gone amiss and would have injected a bit more interest into the film. Burton cannot make up for this lack of development, but he does provide the film with his excellent breed of design which does make this, at times, an interesting visual spectacle.The characters are also fairly thinly sketched, although there are some good lines in this film, particularly those that reference the original. However, some of the performances, most of which are done through extraordinary make-up, are very good. Tim Roth chews the scenery and most of his prosthetics as he delights in the part of the villain, Thade. Helena Bonham Carter is pretty good, and Mark Wahlberg is fine, although this performance gave no hint of what he would achieve later in his career.However, the wayward climax and somewhat bewildering conclusion let the film's solid base slip and this reviewer was left satisfied, but felt that this could have been so much more. This is a bit of a blip by Burton's standards, but, as blockbusters go, this is pretty good entertainment.3 stars out of 5",

The original two Apes films kept the human numbers to less than 20 to my recollection.I thought I'd never say this--The role of Captain Leo Davidson SHOULD HAVE WENT TO JOHNNY DEPP! He's got more versatility; will at least try to stretch his acting (Although for my taste he's being more and more horribly miscast in Timmy films). He was excellent in \"Astronaunt's Wife\"--Pretty Boy Wooden on Kazoo Wahlberg? Oh please! Or how about this casting Michael Keaton if not Depp??? Timmy B don't know how to cast a male lead to save his life! In terms of female leads he does better with HB-C but her in this???? IMO she should have been skipped over for casting in this flick at any & all levels. Elegant &/or down the down to every woman, whatever the character type or past & present, is her forte. As much as I hate her squat screen time role in \"Charlie & the Chocolate Factory\", it wasn't a SCI-FI Film! Get Veronica Cartwright, Robin Curtis, Terry Ferrell any experienced sci-fi actress who could rise above the level of unbelievable.The reasons I believe Timmy B had Chalty Heston doing his little bit here are 2 fold: 1) thought it would wow fans of the 1st movie ergo they'll come in droves trying to find what scene he's in; & 2) promised he'd pad Heston's bankroll. In case of reason #1, next time he wants to draw in fans of a media icon to a cinema adaptions, especially in the area of sci-fi, talk to Michael Bay regarding his casting of a main robot character 2007 movie adaption, for crying out loud!Oh wait a sec, just remembered--\"The Astronaunt's Wife\" wasn't directed by Timmy.",

            "content": "Tim Burton has proven to be a director with vision.  Many of his previous movies broke new ground artistically, like Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Ed Wood.  They were wildly imaginative, visually intriguing and entertaining.  That is why I was so excited to learn that Burton was directing Planet of the Apes.  I expected him to take the classic Apes from the 60's and give it his own Burtonesque twist.  I expected ingenuity and to be immersed into a weird futuristic ape world.  What I got was a modern-day Hollywood formula movie.  It is as if all the creativity and intrigue of the original had been beaten out of the film.You know the story.  An astronaut crash-lands onto a strange planet ruled by primates.  Humans are on the planet too, but the humans are considered `animals' and are treated as slave labor.  The biggest problem with Planet of the Apes (2001) is that it is simply not captivating.  There is no discernable plot, except that the astronaut wants to get back to his mother ship, and the apes want to make him their slave (or kill him.)  And while other `slice of life' films may not need a plot to succeed, sci-fi epics do. There is nothing compelling here to move the action and characters (and us) forward.  The result is . . . boredom.  Burton's job at a minimum with this film was to entertain us.  He fell far short.Mark Wahlberg plays astronaut Captain Leo Davidson in a performance that is largely inconsequential.  Helena Bonham Carter is Ari, a female ape (and unspoken love interest) who cares about the plight of the humans. Carter's performance is measured and effective.  Tim Roth portrays Thade, the leader of the ape army.  Roth is a fine actor whose performance here is at times captivating, and at other times one-dimensional.  The actors who play the humans, Kris Kristofferson and Estella Warren, are almost as unimportant as Wahlberg.  I liked the original movie better when the humans just grunted. Also, Charleston Heston even shows up in disguise to waste away a scene with us.To be fair, the makeup and special effects in Planet of the Apes are well done.  The costumes and sets are all good, if not too dark (but the art direction is disappointing when compared with Burton's previous works).  The music, by Danny Elfman, is great, if not distracting.The film's final scene, which I will not give away, has been deemed by some as clever or cool.  I think not.  Imagine if you will, what closing visual would be as evocative as the Statue of Liberty scene in the original movie? I guarantee that if you allow your mind to wander, you will guess it. That's not innovation, that's more of the same from Hollywood.  What happened Tim?",

The makeup effects are brilliant.  The story is interesting and involving.  But overall, the movie seems a little undercooked.That is a weird feeling to have in a Tim Burtin movie.  His movies are filled with gorgeous and unusual visuals, unusual characters, and flat-out different ideas.  But this \"re-imagining\" of Planet of the Apes does not seem like a Burtin movie.  It does not have crazy visuals, interesting characters, or anything unusual.  The movie is dry as it can be.  It's filled with crap dialog.  The actors look like apes, but when they speak it sounds like they have a cold (due to the large amount of makeup, but it could have been fixed with dubbing or something).I think that the movie had a large amount of potential, but it was not left in the oven for long enough.  Fox really rushed this movie and it shows. Not in the special effects, but in the story.Not all of the dialog is bad.  There are some nice punches here and there. But the over all script seems rushed.The characters flat out suck.  I'm sorry, but they do.  Especially the astronaut Leo played by Mark Wahlberg.  His character never seems shocked or amazed at this planet full of apes.  There is a moment of adjustment, but he gets used to it too quickly.  If some one dropped me on a planet full of apes, I would freak out and I think most other people would too.  Honostly, his character is rather boring and not interesting.  The only good characters are Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) the ape that has a soft side for humans, Limbo (Paul Giamatti) an ape slave trader, and possibly Attar (Michael Clark Duncan) an ape soldier.  But everyone else just seems, well, boring.One real gripe I have is with Tim Roth who plays the ape general Thade.  He does a good job, but he breaths real heavily and it gets annoying.  He tries to act like a total \"Evil monster\" but it would have been better had they just made him into a more emotional guy.  It's fine that they made him into a fearless psychopath, but it would have made the beginning moments (where Thade talks about his love for Ari) more believable.The best part of the movie is the fabulous, Twilight Zone ending that I would never dream of giving away.Over all, the movie seems lackluster and, well, boring.  It's not a bad movie, but I think had they had more time to work on it, it could have been truly great.  I liked the first movie a great deal, but I really wasn't looking forward to this too much.  I guess I sort of sensed it would be this way.  It is worth seeing, but it still lacks a narrative force that makes me want to see it again.  It's sad that they didn't take more time with this, because it had GREAT potential.  Oh well, it's still better than most of the crap that's out.  Except AI.  AI is still the best movie of the year, in my opinion.  Don't bring the kids.6/10",

            "content": "About 5 minutes in after the opening titles I knew this was going to be a criminal miscarriage of what could have been. Character exposition in the opening sequence was axed in order to bustle the hero (or lack of one) into the so-called action as soon as possible. What results is a woefully underdeveloped series of events thrusting us along on an adventure that is laughable and miserably cheap. Tim Burton's influences lay in many obscure and cheesy drive-in sci/fi movies and TV shows of the past (which he actually tries to pay homage to rather than satirize) and it's not surprising that this film plays like Lost in Space meets One Million Years BC meets Claude Rains' version of The Lost World meets Planet of the Apes. If Burton felt that people would be excited at the prospect of seeing his own self-indulgent vision of the Book and Heston's classic, full of gawdy touches typical of his style, he was badly mistaken. His realization of Batman was far more successful.When I first saw the commercials for this movie I was immediately taken. Images of marching Ape armies and the atmospheric visuals inspired hopes of a science Fiction action epic like no other. Spartacus conquers the Apes as it were. Sadly it was all window dressing and the truly best parts of this movie are ALL in the commercial spots. What we are subjected to is an unspeakably badly written visual feast which belies a very limited budget lurking just below the surface. The only reason to see this abomination is for the costumes and make-up design, as well as the production design (aside from the space station and space suits which look to have been stolen from the 2001 prop vault).The original planet of the apes is not one of my top ten favorite films but it is an honest and intelligent piece of science fiction. Though a bit of a talk fest, it does bring up some very thought provoking issues (thanks to the great Rod Serling) and ends on one of the most powerful and stunning climaxes in movie history. It's a film deserving of its classic status and rated a better remake than what Richard Zanuck and Tim Burton have foisted on us here. In fact, Zanuck should be fined and his producer's license suspended as he was also in involved in making the original.Any and all intellectual content is missing leaving us with good actors buried under mounds of make-up. Except for Wahlberg, who should have just been buried. This guy is the most vacant action hero since Keanu Reeves in Speed. Aside from disobeying commands in order to rescue his chimp, his motivations are unwritten, leaving him to loaf from one scene to the next muttering little more than \"hey\" or \"what\" or \"whatever\", while glancing more than periodically at his Tandy hand-held. The guy has the intelligence and personality of a soapsud. An actor with a grasp of dead-pan humor might have made this character zing. Wahlberg just sits there, looking constipated as another IMDb reviewer mentioned.As far as the other cast members are concerned, what is the deal with Kris Kristoffersen. He has two lines then gets run through with a spear. Estella Warren is atrocious as the obligatory female human. She's no Raquel Welch in the looks department and is an even worse actress. Helena Bonham-Carter is wasted, as is Tim Roth as Thade and Michael Clark Duncan as his Right-Hand Gorilla. One wonders why they hired big-name actors to be unrecognizable under all that latex when they could have hired medium priced actors and saved some money on the budget. Marquee power I guess. As good as he is, Michael Clark Duncan just sounds like the guy who played Worf in Star Trek.As far as Charlton Heston's uncredited cameo as Thade's father, spouting familiar lines he used to condemn the Apes in the original, though here in reversed context: maybe in another script, with a better director for the material, it would have been sly and humorous. Not here. The same goes for other memorable lines quoted from the original.Much has been debated about the ending, which is about the only pure Burtonian stamp on the movie. It has no relevance other than to set-up a sequel (would anyone care to see it?). It pays homage to Serling and is a twist on the original's shattering ending, but really it comes off more of a tribute to Marty's nightmare sequence in Back to the Future Part II than anything else.What we're left with here, in the wake of other deficient hack jobs such as U-571, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, is a clear message that a great deal of Hollywood no longer cares about providing their audience with a well written and performed production once their marketing machine has lured us into the theatres. If people keep falling for it it's going to end up sealing the end of quality entertainment for good.Here's hoping that The Lord of the Rings doesn't turn out to be a mishandled treatment of Tolkien with GREAT commercials.",

I found it much more entertaining than the hideous Mummy Returns, and the boring, uninteresting Final Fantasy.Like most 'block buster' movies these days this flick is tops in the C.G.I department but woefully lacking in the plot department. However...BEST STUFF:The apes. Their costumes and makeup were excellently rendered. Their mannerisms were convincingly ape-like (e.g. the tree climbing, the loping gait, fear of water), and they were well-performed by their actors. (Thade, Ari and that elderly Orangutan slave trader come to mind)The different species of apes living together in the ape city. Some of the best ape make up I've seen had to be that huge Orangutan with the enormous cheek pouches and jowls. I liked the idea of chimps, gorillas and Orangutans living together in one big community. The set designs were very pretty.  There's lots and lots of picturesque visuals to look at.NOT SO GREAT STUFF:The human hero. Marky Mark may do better in Funky Bunch music videos (!!) and underpants commercials but he was completely uninteresting here. Spends most of his time running around but hardly looks like he is in any danger. Boring. Thankfully the apes get more screen time than M.M.\nThe Humans. 99% of the humans in this movie were merely extras in cave man clothes given very little to do. There's supposed to be a romance between M.M and Blonde Cave Girl (B.C.G) but nothing happened (maybe I missed something). Her character seemed to have been added simply to make B.C.G look prettier than the ape woman!The story. Oh dear. I liked this movie for the apes, but the humans and been-done-before plot spoiled it! The numerous holes in the plot must be deliberately ignored in order to enjoy this movie. Why not just forget the humans and have the whole flick about the apes? THE ENDING. It's yet another (SIGH) Hollywood'ised End Act! It's meant to be a shock ending, but surprise, surprise: IT SUCKED!! But it does pave the way for POTA part II!",

It made no sense. Until then it was an entertaining film.  Visually amazing, the make up superb and Carter and Roth gave excellent performances. The story just never sparkled, however.  This may be connected to the fact that Walberg doesn't have much screen presence.  Comparing to Heston for a second (not just to compare to the original, but also to compare to a great leading actor), he commanded the screen, made you care what was happening and drew you into the film.  Marky Mark may know how to model underwear, but a great actor he aint.  There is something about him that made me just not care.At the end of the day, unless you've something new to say on the subject, someway to improve it beyond dated makeup, remakes are just pointless.",

Even if (Especially if) you are a fan of the original starring the NRA's Heston, you will hate this movie. All the good actors are dressed like monkeys, so good luck taking them seriously.

The original version had more dialogue in which acting ability was so important.  But the old version also moved along at a rapid pace.  This version played more like an action version but was also very good.  Tim Burton for the first time seems to draw the audience in to the movie unlike his previous films which seemed more rock video.  Burton is sure to make many more films and has greatly improved from Sleepy Hollow. \nI saw this film twice and with the second viewing certain details become more understandable.  It is interesting to see how the apes seemed to have imitated human culture.  Burton has the apes doing all the things humans do even saying grace.  But the ape's have no deeper understanding of anything. If you see the film you will understand. I believe Burton has the apes more as a creation from humans and not an evolved species.  The first film has the apes emerge out of a human created disaster of nuclear war.  This film treats the creation of apes in a unique way.I have heard more long debates about this film than any other film of the Summer.  As far as all the criticism of the ending, it seemed much more clear the second time.  SPOILER:  I think it was more of a beginning than an ending.  And if you look on the plaque you will see the name Thade.  Perhaps in the next one we will see a battle by humans to retake a new technologically advanced ape world.  SPOILER: Whatever, it may be that the ending may be another example of apes having imitated the human world by finding books.  Bring on Apes 2 especially with pretty pouty Bonham in it.

Most of his films have some eerie, dark atmosphere and quirkiness that's irresistable to most viewers.Something that this film doesn't have.The only impressive aspect of this remake are the elaborate set designs and convincing make-up (watch out for Michael Jackson's cameo as Ari).At first, the film impressed me. It looked cool, the score was good. Then I noticed a pattern in the film.Dialogue scene to running, to more running, back to dialogue, more running, rinse, wash and repeat.Mark Wahlberg is a good actor but he's quite laughable here. Wait until you see his speech about rising up against the apes. This one suffers from the age-old cliche of the band of people too afraid to fight back for the freedom with no choice otherwise. Well, unless they want to die and be put in slavery (at least that would take off the running time a bit).The female character (insert model's name here) is simply used for the sex scene, but there isn't one. The big budget is used for the cool battles that couldn't be done on a small budget. But there is no big cool, entertaining battle. It goes on and on. Should I talk about the ending? If you enjoyed the film you'll say \"Wow! What a smart, intelligent ending! Now, if I just knew what it means...\" and weeks later you're still puzzling over it until you realize Tim Burton has wasted even more of your time thinking it actually makes sense.

            "content": "*SPOILERS  *SPOILERS*  *SPOILERS*The original is already a classic and here the makers got the chance to introduce the story to a younger generation taking advantage of the technical advantages of today while using one of the original director of today's Hollywood, Tim Burton, whose unique style is something that can give the edge the film needed. However the result is less than you expected from a technical or story and characters development point of view.As usual there are a list of good and bad things and I'll start with the good ones:Make up - Almost perfect. The actors look like apes and you would not guess that there are real actors under the masks(I won't be surprise if the make-up will win an Oscar). That saying there are some reservation. While the man apes are perfect the female apes are less good. They look like actors and not like real apes. The decision to let the apes walk and jump like apes do is used to a great effect and is the big advantage of the film.The dark tone of the story is been reflected in the dark cinemtography. Even when there is light it is not a strong one but it is moody and dark.Music- As usual the music from Danny Elfman is effective and serve the film.Tim Roth as General Thade is excellent and his performance convey the menace and the hunger for power that exist in his character.That all I can say that was good in the movie. The list of bad things will be longer:Mark Wahlberg as Capt. Leo Davidson is weak. He doesn't carry the film on his shoulders and moreover he is not as strong as Tim Roth's Thade. How can anyone see him as a messiah is beyond my understanding.In the original film the main female character, Dr. Zira(Kim Hunter), was a scientist. She fought for the humans to have equal rights because she think they are intelligent but she could not prove it because all the humans in that film couldn't speak. The arrival of Col. Taylor(Charlton Heston) gave her the tool to prove her theory because he could speak. Beside that she was a strong and believable character. Here the main female character, Ari(Helena Bonham Carter,) is been portrayed as \"human lovers\". There is no reason why shy thinks like that or what made her change her mind in such an hostile environment towards humans. It doesn't help that her performance is so weak and her contribution to the film is less than zero. In general the female apes are less convinced than the men apes.Towards the end of the film,the chimpanzee that was sent in the beginning of the film and that we thought has already died, re-appear,out of nowhere. This development in the story is very contrive and served only as mean to end the battle between the apes and the human. How the chimpanzee has survive the magnetic storm. Your guess is as good as mine. Another development that strike me as contrive is the decision of General Thade's aide to simply turn to the other side just because he doesn't believe The General anymore. Why has this happened? Through the whole film that aide is a loyal servant. He has no reason to doubt The General so what happened now? Was it enough for him to hear Cat.Davidson's words in order to change his heart? In short no logic in both events.The ending doesn't help making the film coherent. The only explanation i can think of is that the storm was not only a jump through time but also a jump through dimension. Otherwise the whole film stand on very weak basis and the ending make the whole film illogical.I like Tim Burton. I have seen every film his has done(not all perffect) and I would continue to see his films. However something is missing from this film. He is in his best when he direct projects that he initiate or are close to his heart. His best films were the ones that have an outsider as a hero that Burton, as an outsider himself, can identify with. I didn't have the feeling that he was fully committed to this project, probably because he was hired to direct this film and didn't initiated it.At the end I was very disappointed. Something that looked good and promise to taste good turned out to be not as good as it should and could have been. Just like an half baked cake. It looks good from the outside but it taste bad because someone forgot to put some of the ingredients that would have make the best in the world.",

You know what you're getting, but not sure of how it's going to be told, or what surprises lie along the way.This is \"B movie\" fun at its finest.  Of course, you're dealing with a film about talking monkeys, so if you're going into this film expecting something overtly serious, you're not going to find it.  It's a very surreal film, both in its ideas and in watching the human-like apes, swing, beat their chests, ride horses, and carry on conversations.  It's fascinating and a little scary at the same time.  Burton's quirky sense of humor is definitely apparent in the ape cities.  The make-up in this film is great, especially the gorilla soldiers.  The actor cameos are fun to spot (Watch for Heston - Burton does a good job in paying homage to the original series), and the twist in meaning of the original film's dialogue is definitely worth a laugh or two.The story was an interesting take on the original series.  At times it was silly (and seems aware of this), but not necessarily in an unpleasant way. The biggest problem that I had with the story was in the resolution (I thought a lot of the conflict issues were too neatly and conveniently tied up).    Burton also did a nice job providing a new spin on the classic film's infamous \"Statue of Liberty\" scene.  There definitely seems to be plans in the works for a sequel by the way it ended.I think this film will get some criticism for what it is, but you know, this isn't the type of film that is going to teach you something about yourself, nor will it provide the solution to all the world's problems by the time the end credits roll.  I had fun with this.  It was wild, it was campy, the acting performances were good for this type of film, and the special effects were entertaining.  I enjoyed this film for what it set out to do, and I'm glad it's not simply a rehash of the original film.Burton has still been unable to let me down, and still remains one of my favorite directors.  I'll definitely add this to my \"Burton DVD\" collection.",

This movie could have been so much more but its only real contribution is to advance ape make-up technology.  It's not a movie I'm anxious to see again; very few films made these days seem to have that quality.All the various flaws in the film have been pointed out already, but there is one thing I'd like to address and that's the question of female chimpanzees being the sexually dominant one.  First off, why introduce this \"fact\" if it's not going to be explored?  Second, it's not correct.  There is an offshoot of the chimpanzee, the bonobo, (which tends to walk upright as often as not) where the female is more dominant, but in the main species (the one which scoots around on all fours), the male chimp rules the roost and I don't think this film was cognizant of bonobos or much of anything else, for that matter.",

I'm not too familiar with the original \"Apes\" movies, so I can't compare, but this movie does have a surprise ending similar to the original's, minus the surprise.I noticed the movie was written by William Broyle's Jr., as well a two other guys.  I got worried after that considering he wrote the horrible \"Castaway\".  I can't really give him credit for making this movie bearable, though.  Burton and his crew pretty much deserves the credit for that. This movie's plot is riddled with cliches from a General who was outcasted getting revenge only to die to an old Ape guy dying RIGHT AFTER telling Thade (Roth) what WE need to know.  It's as if the writers were afraid their slightly unique version was too unique and was becoming unrecognizable.SPOILER WARNING:I thought some of the ideas in the movie were intriguing and scary.  Not so much the idea that apes COULD become the leaders of a planet due to time travel and evolution from experimental monkeys, but that they DID.  I felt the whole play on equality was too preachy and phony, however.  Planet of the Apes is far from being the best movie of the summer - that title still belongs to The Mummy Returns - but it's a decent movie, although it lacked any humor whatsoever.",

However,since this film only used racism a slavery as a plot device theending simply seemed to say 'boo' rather than to make one thinkor reflect.This is not to say that I disliked Tim Burton's version in any way,but simply to point out that it does not have the same resonanceas the original... worth seeing, but make sure you give the 1968one a read as well.",

            "content": "Many emotions struck me while watching one of the summer's most anticipated films \u0091Planet of the Apes'. Yet, the emotion that struck me the most was that of ingenuity. Director Tim Burton proves himself as an ingenious filmmaker and he proves it twofold in this exciting, inventive and thrilling film. The sets are spectacular, costumes are terrific and Danny Elfman's musical score captures the essence of the film as he does with all his musical compositions for Burton's films. The producers of the film have stressed that this is not a remake, but more so a \u0091revisiting' of the original. Anyone who compares this film to the original is gravely mistaken due to the mere fact that the 2001 version has been dichotomized by one of the \u0091soon to be' legendary alternative filmmakers - Tim Burton. This film widely separates itself from the original as seen from its' first frame and takes off on a whole new different direction. The film opens with a great credit intro. sequence displaying Danny Elfman's fierce musical score which sets the film's tone not as an unrealistic fantasy, but as a rousing sci-fi/adventure. The opening scene depicts Wahlberg's ill-fated space station attempt at conducting test runs with the ape species. After a mishap forces him off the ship, Wahlberg's character Leo Davidson finds himself crash landing on a distant planet ruled by apes.  This is where the fun begins\u0085 Director Tim Burton puts a classic spin in this film invoking the notion of role reversal. In this planet, humans are the pets, the slaves, in essence humans on that planet are all the things we as humans on this planet earth shape and torture our inferiors to be. A great scene is one of the very first that immediately displays the intelligence of these iron fist creatures conversing around the dinner table about the threat of the human species. Enter this year's ultimate movie villain \u0096 General Thade. The incredibly underestimated and unrecognizable Tim Roth plays this overachieving ape villain who is hell-bent on the total annihilation of all humans with fierce audacity and destruction. Upon the dissection of this film as a cinematic lesson, one will discover many \u0091plot holes' - (Did Leo Davidson and Ari, his rebellious ape escort have a love affair?) Many more plot holes -  (Did Leo Davidson and Estella Warren's human rebel Daena also have an affair?). Mysterious deaths not explained - (Why exactly did one character so unexpectedly sacrifice himself for the sake of others and the rest of pack continue on as if nothing happened?) These mind-benders as well as others will occupy the intelligent filmgoer's mind for quite some time after the film.Yet, these questions can all be put to rest because Burton does not set out to win awards with this film (Except for Best Make-Up come Oscar time for Rick Baker). This film is merely a means of the best of the \u0091popcorn blockbusters' this summer. As well, we see Burton's maturity as a Director in relation to the grandeur of a film. Let's face it \u0096 the revisiting of the classic apes' films is a huge undertaking. And for Tim Burton to create and present a richly satisfying, fun film is quite the achievement. Anyone who expects a brash film course should not watch this film. This film wants the audience to have fun and to dwell into a world never seen before in this uniqueness. Therefore in this sense, the film scores some big points in terms of imagination and vision.  The film makes it a point of paying \u0091homage' to the originals yet distancing it enough so it is not afraid to make fun of itself. Furthermore, despite its surreal qualities, fantastic set pieces and incredibly true to life ape creatures brought to life by a wonderful cast, the film's major drawback is that it seems too dark and animalistic for its' own good. We are all aware that Burton's visionary uniqueness is brought forward with dark sets and spooky visions. Yet, it seems as if Burton intentionally wants us to know this is his creation even when we are entangled within the film, resulting in the darkness and primal aesthetic being overused. But in an odd way this is what adds to the genius and excellence of it all. Resulting in this film easily regarded as one of Burton's best films.Giancarlo's Rating: ***",

Planet of the Apes strikes me the same way.  __  I'm white and do not presume to speak for blacks but I cannot see how this movie, with only one token black human surrounded by otherwise entirely white humanity, can avoid coming off as comparing blacks to simians.  Yes, I realize that this flick is presenting a lame, elementary-school-level case for liberalism.  I do not however see that as negating the fact that, while the film repeatedly instructs us that slavery is bad and that intolerance is bad, the humans are basically purely white, which means that the other set of characters (the apes) must represent blacks.  __  A weak claim is made that humans enslaved apes and now, after turnabout, apes have enslaved humans.  The problem with that is that humans do not use apes as slaves.  Hmm, who did whites used to enslave if not apes?  Blacks.  So then, if this society represents a reversal of our own, who must the apes represent?  Blacks.  __  Other fantasy films successfully make the desired point by either having characters of different colors or races on both sides, thus pointing out that intolerance is not inherently caused by racial difference, or by having characters with cultural differences which in no way resemble actual ethnic or racial groups.  I am in no way saying that the apes in this film resemble actual blacks but I am saying that some of the characteristics (besides their ability to ignore the laws of physics) they exhibit are exactly how bigots used to make fun of blacks.  __  Am I the only one here who was alive before the civil rights movement and thus what I'm talking about is totally foreign to the rest of your experiences?

            "content": "Tim Burton is one of Hollywood's darkest, most imaginative filmmakers, so one must wonder what went wrong with his latest venture, a reworking of the 1968 sci-fi classic, Planet of the Apes.  This is Tim Burton-lite, and as easily distinguishable as his prior films are, it's disheartening to see that he clearly gave in to Hollywood blockbuster mentality, as Planet bears no sign of his signature dark style.Planet of  The Apes is loosely based on its predecessor.  Mark Whalberg (here a cardboard cut-out action hero) stars as an astronaut who gets sucked into a time warp (?) and finds himself crash landing on a planet and captured by talking apes who have created a society where humans are their servants.  He finds a friend in female ape Helen Bonham Carter. The rest of the movie follows our hero Whalberg as he attempts to escape from his captors, in particular a nasty General played by an unrecognizable Tim Roth.The story is hardly noteworthy.  It's merely a clothesline on which to hang a few charged action sequences, grandiose sets, and the human actors eluding their captors.  What made the classic so striking was its scenes of the apes treating the humans as livestock.  Here, director Tim Burton has instead chosen to eschew characters and rely on the quality of the first film to garner any sort of sympathy for his characters.  The only likeable characters are, again, Helen Bonham Carter as an ape who sympathizes with and wants to help the humans, and Paul Giamatti, as a wise-cracking ape who by the end becomes very grating with his one-liners.The only true innovation in this updated version is the makeup; it's light years ahead of the 1968 version, and the actors disappear behind it, as well as the militarized costumes.  The apes look more ferocious, but this is a very poor substitute for an actual story.  Even the action sequences are dumbed down, with bullets and spears flying, there is no blood onscreen whatsoever.  Was it the studios who persisted in Burton to not show blood? Sleepy Hollow was a gorefest, but I imagine since this is a huge studio summer blockbuster, all controversial images and language were censored in order to have a more family oriented (money-making) movie.With all its flaws, Planet of the Apes is made watchable thanks to the amazing makeup and the performances from Roth and Bonham-Carter.  Perhaps Tim Burton will push the envelope with his next film, as here his influence seems nonexistent, except for the dark ending bound to leave audiences looking for a total mindless summer film confused.6 out of 10",

Tim Burton once again delivers a movie that oozes with style, class and sophistication, with a world so detailed and believable it's almost mind-blowing.  Not being familiar with the original movie/tv series myself, I didn't quite know what to expect.  I knew from the few articles I had read that Mark Wahlberg plays a pilot who crash lands on a planet ruled by apes, and in an interesting twist, finds himself as the \"alien\".  The story is a great concept and really brings up some interesting issues to think about.  This is one of the things I appreciated about it.  It is one big role-reversal but in two different ways.  Firstly we're no longer the master species in control, we're the animals without the souls to be used and abused. Secondly, instead of being discriminated against because we might be black, white or purple, we're now discriminated against because we're simply human. It says a lot about how we as humans treat others, whether it be animals or people...  I really liked this movie.  The actors were great, especially Tim Roth as Thade.  I've never encountered such a menacing, intimidating character as Roth's Thade on screen before.  Helena Bonham Carter's Ari was curious, naive and likeable and Mark Wahlberg didn't disappoint.  In general, all the ape actors did a fantastic job and combined with the stunningly detailed make-up, pulled it all off in a very convincing fashion.Danny Elfman is the man responsible for the film's score and I remember thinking during the credits, \"Hmm, that name is familiar...\"  I will definitely remember his name from now on.  The score is excellent, and at times spine-chilling, particularly during the opening credits.I'm an every-movie person and I really couldn't find much to fault Planet of the Apes on.  My only gripe is that like so many movies these days, it leaves you feeling just a little unsatisfied somehow..  Maybe it's how film-making has changed these days, or the new techniques they use, I really can't put my finger on it.  But with this film it's only a minor thing.  See it.

            "content": "WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS (though hopefully you'll read them and then not decide to see the movie and thus save yourself seven hard earned bucks...)This movie was garbage in practically every regard. The dialouge was terrible, the plot didn't make sense, the acting was mediocre at best, the action scenes were lame, the hyped \"social messages\" were blunt and shallow, and the big surprise ending was astonishingly dumb and impossible. Given how many screenplays Hollywood must get, its pretty incredible that they made this one into a summer blockbuster. There are a couple bright spots in this movie: Many of the ape actors do fine jobs, especially Helena Bonham Carter who turns in by far the film's best performance, and Estella Warren looks absolutely gorgeous wandering around in her skimpy outfits. Beyond that, the movie is worthless in every way. First of all, the plot makes no sense at all. A couple examples: 1. The name of the ape's secret city is Calia, which we learn comes from a sign reading \"Caution Live Animals\" which is covered by dust except for the first couple letters of each word, except that presumably the city was named thousands of years ago when the apes left it BEFORE any of the dust accumulated. 2. When the humans are about to be totally overrun by the ape army, Mark Wahlberg comes up with the idea of using the still intact fuel in his spaceship that crashed thousands of years ago (huh?) to blow up the apes. \"Cool\" we think, except that all it seems to do is knock over about 40 apes out of the few thousand in the army, and they just get back up again. So then the humans attack and the battle seems to be pretty fair. Huh? If they could put up a fight in the first place, why were they coming up with this dumb scheme that didn't even do anything? 3. Okay, I know Estella Warren is gorgeous, but seriously, neither her character nor any other human character in the movie except Mark Wahlberg had any significance to the plot. I think she had literally about 5 lines and was ignored throughout most of the film. Her father's only purpose was getting killed by a big ape early on, after he said somewhere around 2 lines, and that little kid (her brother?) was also completely insignificant except towards the end when he somehow tips over his horse, except that didn't really matter at all to the plot either. 4. The ending (BIG SPOILER AHEAD) was just dumb. Dumb dumb dumb. Okay, so here he is in PRESENT DAY earth except it's all apes again. First of all, this is predictable, but it still doesn't make sense. We're supposed to believe (I think) that Thade somehow managed to go back in time to earth and change the course of history, but somehow it turned out exactly the same way, down to the archetecture of the Washington monument, as it was when humans were the dominant species. What? what??? Whatever, it's dumb as wood anyway. Also, the rest of the movie was just lame. For one thing, the big hyped action scenes were ridiculously lame. Basically, a human would punch an ape, who'd turn around and punch the human and send him sailing about 25 feet into the air at which point he'd die, unless he happened to be named Mark Wahlberg, in which case he'd be perfectly fine. huh? Also, we were set up for this big climatic fight between the two ape generals, which predictably happned, but it was remarkably tame too. They pretty much just jumped at each other and beat each others chests for around 15 seconds before one the them died. Also, the whole social message thing had been done much better before and seemed unconvincing when done here. You get the impression that the actors in ape makeup are having trouble keeping a straight face while delivering these overly deep and significant but at the same time really really dumb lines... 1/10",

The make-up effects were GREAT as were the other special effects.  As for the story, I didn't it was bad.  The dialogue could have been better, but what do you really want from Burton? As for the acting, so Wahlberg needs some acting lessons?  Tim Roth was very good, as was Michael Clarke Duncan.  And even though she had all that make-up on, Helena Bonham Carter was STILL sexy as hell. \nAlthough not exactly up to the original classic, this version is a fun movie.

And, knowing that it is in Burton's habits to put spectacular and beautiful yet dark and mysterious images on film, I expected a \"Planet of The Apes\" with the same story than the original, but with a different perspective in the images.  But I was somehow disappointed to see that, sure the images were nice, though not as amazing as \"Edward Scissorhands\"' or \"Batman\"'s, but the script seemed to have forgotten.  The film lasts two hours, but you don't see them pass away, because you feel like nothing happens in the film, but everything is happening at the same time.  The movie could be separated in like three chapters; The beginning, the core and the ending.  That's it, no surprises, nothing special, except the images and Tim Roth's acting.  This film wasted lots of potential interesting performances *Spoilers warning*(Kris Kristofferson doesn't even play a role, he only runs and die, and Helena Bonham Carter has a very hollow and empty role as an ape who has more feelings, and her feelings are so hard to see because of the limited facial expression due to the make up).  Plus, they put Estella Warren wearing some kind of leaves made bikini, isn't that superficial and commercial?  This is the first Tim Burton film that deceives me, and I hope it's the last one. This is a very good example of a movie which has special and make up effects as a structure.  many people won't realize it, because they'll be fascinated by the images, but this blind attitude is exactly what the makers expected. Planet of The Apes is more a (commercial) vision of The Planet of The Apes by Tim Burton.  It is not so identic to the original, I couldn't say it's a remake.  The ending is good though, but is still pretty predictable.  But really, you can't really get inside of the movie, because it is not attaching enough, all you can do is look at the images...I give it 4/10.",

It occurs to me that this film wouldn't exist without the Charlton Heston version and its sequels. Imagine if Franklin Schaffner had never adapted Pierre Boule's novel. Do you suppose that now someone would still come along and say, hey, that would make a good movie? Actually let me re-phrase that: would that make a movie ANYONE would be interested in seeing? Not likely. So having seen Tim Burton's newly 're-imagined' \"Planet of the Apes,\" am I glad there was an original whos coat-tails it could ride? Well, it's not terrible. At times it's downright interesting. Ultimately, though, it's just unnecessary. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it as long as it's around. Like any Burton film, this one is about escape. It transports you to another place and time. The sets, the makeup, the effects all work hard to create this temporary reality. It's convincing but, visually, I was hoping for something more like \"Sleepy Hollow.\" I was never amazed by anything in \"Apes\" but was stunned by some of the things Burton and his crew accomplished on such previous films as \"Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Batman.\" \"Apes\" seemed like fertile ground for the same visual opportunities, but Burton doesn't make good. At best, he's made the kind of cheesy sci-fi he poked fun at in \"Mars Attacks.\" The irony! This didn't look or feel like a Tim Burton film at all. Where is the weird coolness that creeps into every single shot? Think of \"Batman,\" how it more than overcame that horrid script with Palance and Nicholson, along with Burton's twisted vision of Gotham City. And where did the humor go? Burton picks NOW to get serious? THIS film? I mean, if this was the best he was going to do with \"Planet of the Apes,\" he should have just stuck his name on it as producer and let some up-and-comer direct (actually, that will happen with the inevitable sequel, er, sequels). Not even Tim Burton can save us from Summer 2001, a film lover's nightmare.\nGrade: C-",

            "content": "What took so long to re-make this 68 sci-fi classic? I had been expecting it since the early 90's! From reading the reviews, however, I get the feeling that it was probably only me who made that prediction. Why did I predict or even insisted that there would be a re-make of Planet Of The Apes?  Well, for one thing, I believed that the advanced cinema techniques could add so much flavour to the original screenplay, which was superbly revolutionary (please read my review for the original Planet Of The Apes 68' to see why I consider the original screenplay to be \"revolutionary\"). I have always thought that the original Planet Of The Apes was full of imaginative thoughts but it lacked juicy action scenes that could have made it even more fun to watch (however even this drawback didn't stop it from becoming a classic sci-fi, probably the best of its genre). The other reason why I expected a re-make was because I wanted to see my most favourite sci-fi saga being re-imagined, as director Tim Burton put it. My Vote: 7/10Things I liked about the movie: In contrast to other people, I liked the screenplay. In fact, I thought that it was brilliant. It was probably the best screenplay that could have been written for this movie without the \"it-was-earth-all-along\" concept that shocks the audience in the 68' version. I was as much amused by the twists in the end, as I was amused when I watched the original 68' version. Even the last 4-5 minutes were such a great enjoyment. I honestly think the screenplay works. But as much as it works, screenplay was not the best thing about the movie. I personally think that there are mainly two things about this movie that left me in complete amazement, 1) Tim Roth's performance and 2) The original score of the movie, both of which well deserve Oscar Nomination. Tim Roth was the only REAL APE in the movie; the rest were just humans under ape costumes. Tim Roth was the only one who really gave his character an identity. He was not just an ape; he was an ape with a personality. The rest of the cast couldn't even manage to act or even look like apes, except for their costumes, of course. The original score was totally mind-blowing. It is a musical expression of what's going on in the movie. Marvellous achievement!Things I didn't like about the movie: In contrast what other people think, I thought that the apes were too human. They were humans under ape costumes. Most of them didn't even try to act or move like an ape (except for Tim Roth). Obviously, they thought that wearing an ape costume was enough. I could puke at the dinner scene when the elderly ape character was speaking: he was just TOO HUMAN. And again, in contrast what other people think, I wasn't satisfied with the make up. Well, for one thing, the cast put too much trust in their make-ups; they didn't make the slightest effort to give themselves an ape-like personality (a couple of scenes showing them hanging upside down from the ceilings or trees don't redeem that - if they are ape enough to do that then how come they are so much human when talking?). Secondly, the make up in the original version was as good as it could get; it was revolutionary in its time. That's why, there was nothing revolutionary about the make ups in this one. Briefly, it was not better than the make ups in the original 68' version. Lastly, I saw a couple of flaws in the make up. For one thing, the one ape character -the one who sells humans as gifts- hadn't had his eyelids painted; every time he closed his eyes, his eyelids would look white (am I the only one who saw that?). Some of the actors' upper teeth had ape-like appearance, whereas their lower level teeth were obviously human-like. What about the hair of Ari (Helena Bonham Carter)? It looked like she had hair done in a beauty salon; it was too human. And her make up was terribly cheap, as if she was a little girl who didn't know how to put a make up. Maybe, Tim Burton wanted to give story a different respective with these ideas on purpose. But honestly, I don't think they work. My last criticism is the inappropriate sense of humour, which has become the disease of Hollywood in recent years. Directors must be very careful about the timing and the nature of the humour otherwise they spoil the whole movie. There are some silly jokes that work perfectly fine in the genre of comedy (Rush Hour, American Pie, Jim Carrey / Eddie Murphy kind of comedies and the like). But when you use jokes out of these movies in a movie that has a totally different personality, it spoils it. Within that respect, I have found the scene where the elderly ape character is taking his fake teeth out and putting into a jar absolutely inappropriate. Other then these flaws, the movie was a perfect re-make of an old sci-fi classic.

Director Tim Burton wasted no expense or effort to make this a visual feast. Too bad he didn't put the same effort into creating a terrific story, especially since there was so much potential to work with. The 1968 original is considered a Sci-Fi classic, not just because of the story, but also the issues it dealt with. It used a society where apes are the top species to comment on and satirize our own society. There are moments of this in \"Apes 2001\", but mostly it's another big budget action film, only with actors in monkey costumes. As proof of this, the lead character, played by Mark Wahlberg (aka Marky Mark) is just another hotshot fighter jock, meaning there's no problem he thinks he can't solve by simply blasting the bad guy to bits. Which is a shame, since it would be much more interesting to see him outwit his enemies, thus showing who really was the superior species. Also, it doesn't help that the female lead, played by Helena Bonham Carter, doesn't even remotely look like a real chimp. I guess Burton & Co. couldn't resist making her look sexy, complete with a fashionable hairstyle. So, ultimately what you have is lots of good looks, but not much in the way of brains. I'm looking forward to viewing the 1968 original, just to see how this film falls short by comparison. 5/10",

Sad to say, his movies show it.  He's consistently come up with interesting outsider characters but at least the story revolved around them.  Here, there are several out-of-place characters around whom no story is told.On top of that, like in Burton's other movies he substitutes here a weak ending for a hard-hitting one that could have paid off all that gone into the movie.  We get a miasma of red herrings and actions that drag on for no reason because neither Burton nor the writers had the neither the maturity nor the nerve to end their movie with any one thing.  Murdered characters whose discovery leads to no further development.  The fight with Thade ends not with a dramatic kill-or-be-killed but with him holing up undercover - but then we never see the consequences of his cowardice.  One gorilla changes his alliegiance after the battle but we're never given a foreshadowing of this.  The apes survive a rocket engine blast but we're never given an earlier clue that they can.  What we're shown as a space station turns out to be a space ship as well but we don't see that until we see the wreckage on the Planet of the Apes, nor are we given a clue as to how it got there - did it come through the same vortex as our hero?Then they had to end their movie with an post-ironic, self-referential, wise-acre college-student twist that said absolutely nothing about all that had gone before.  Rod Serling these guys are not.If this wins any awards it should be the 2001 Golden Rasberry.  It certainly won't wins Oscars for writing or direction.

The part wasn't written terribly interesting (but think Sean Connery, John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart - a talented actor can *make* a part interesting).  Doing a lot of standing around and staring, occasionally broken up by some moving around and staring, won't breathe life into a part.And when he did do something or speak, I found his character unsympathetic and centerless.Now, I didn't think much about the original while watching, because I think such comparisons are unfair and usually irrelevant.

Fortunately the current _Planet of the Apes_ is more a reinterpretation of the material than than a remake of the movie and on that note it succeeds.However, the results are disappointing to put it mildly. There are enough plot holes to drive a Mac truck through. Often I found myself looking at my watch to see how much longer the movie would be lasting and felt my intelligence being assaulted. Some effects,  especially several jumps the apes make, would be more at home in _The Matrix_ than here. The occasional resused/reinterpreted line from the original movie are delivered poorly and come across as a weak attempt to pay homage to the original. While the story line itself was OK, plot holes aside, the script writing was lacking and the delivery of the lines by the actors more so. Interestingly enough, the best acting job is turned in by Charleton Heston who make a brief cameo appearance. Overall the production value was good, however, the apes village would be more at home in a fantasy movie than a sci-fi flick and as for the the much heralded make-up, I found it lacking, save for the gorillas. Of course one has to mention the ultimate ending of the movie which reeks of being tacked on and proves that sometimes movie makers just add too much footage for no good reason.

The original film was nature vs man, evolution alongside devolution, and an overall downward spiral towards mankind's oblivion (or pretty much the next worst thing, anyway, since people aren't totally extinct by the time the main character crash lands on either eponymous planet).The best things in the 2001 remake are the handful of pop references made first in the original movie, the references to modern (some 21st Century) attitudes (\"I'm having a bad hair day,\" says one female chimp in Burton's version), and the overall upgraded feel and tone of the movie now that more than thirty-three years have elapsed in the world of cinema.Its a given to say that special-effects are a boon to this new, improved version.  Yet, I miss hearing all that (somewhat) great dialog heard in POTA 1968.Everyone I know who's seen the Burton version has mentioned something about its ending, and the questions it poses.

Other than a few lame visual gags that were played as an attempt at humor (i.e. apes smoking hash like humans in the Middle east), the set up of POTA was impressive, a little scary and, for a sci-fi fantasy movie, \"believeable.\"But the logic holes kept building and compouding, so that in the second half of the movie, when even bigger holes appear, the thread is lost and the movie practically shouts, \"Hey! This is a summer movie! Don't think too hard!\"I don't want to give away spoilers, so I'll avoid several thoughts about the ending. I will simply say that for the end to have occurred as it did requires multiple inconsistent assumptions about that kind of travel travel.Anyhow, one of my larger problems with POTA was the fact that the humans speak English, and in fact they speak the same language as the apes. Yet the apes still treat humans as animals. Now, I don't know about you, but if apes (or any other animal) on our earth started speaking English, I think my first reaction would be to INCREASE my respect and treatment of them, not LOWER it. The fact that apes treat humans appallingly, even though they KNOW they are as intelligent, is silly.This negates most of any kind of message about humans today treating other species badly. Hey, if my dog talked, I would feed him better food and give him his own room. I wouldn't do what these apes do.But then, the movie handles this inconsistently. In one scene, Thade seems shocked that one human look at him. Well, why wouldn't he? The humans can talk and walk and obviously are intelligent. Why wouldn't one look at the ape leader? It's not like they are the mute, cowed humans from the original POTA movie.Speaking of, Tim Roth does an OUTSTANDING job bringing Thade to life. He not only walks and moves as an ape, he moves with a sense of menace. Great job.The other apes, well, they are kind of ape-like. But unlike many reviewers, I didn't think they moved all that realistically. They looked like humans trying to move like apes.And there are lots and lots of convenient coicidences, like in one scene a spaceship showing up at just the right time to play a key role in an ongoing struggle. And a ship thousands of years old that has not only a power source (OK, I'll buy that), but devices that still work (like the wires and other more sensitive components would have lasted that long?).Still, I gave POTA a 7 because, huge holes aside, I just enjoyed it.

Subsequent withdraws are at the cost of the movies believability.  Continual withdraws, as this movie does, have us thinking the writers are idiots and the movie ridiculous.   In the case of Plant of the Apes, this couldn't be any more the case.Rating:  1 out of 10.",

Instead it tries to be an incredibly entertaining summer movie, while still being intelligent and retaining Burton's gorgeous visual style. And with that in mind, it fully accomplishes its goals. First of all, the soundtrack, made by long-time Burton collaborator Danny Elfman is up to the composer's high standards. The brutal percussion-based sounds of his score fit the movie perfectly. The story is very satisfying and the ending is excellent. Touches of clever humor add to the script. But, of course, what steals the show is Burton's gift for creating memorable images and his army of apes, led by General Thade, a memorable character played to perfection by Tim Roth. For this movie, Burton often leaves his trademark dark and blue colors, but the movie still has his wonderful touch. As for the apes, they are very impressive. The cast is good, without having very hard jobs to do, but as I said earlier, Roth shines. So, this may not be Tim Burton's best movie, but it is the perfect summer entertainment, offered to you by one of history's greatest directors.85%",

These are some of the elements which made viewing this excruciating:1) The set: it looked like a cross between the Wizard of Oz's flying monkeys, the Ewok Adventure and Willow.  I know we're dealing with Tim Burton here, but I just couldn't take it seriously.  And, it always looked like a SET.2)  The cast:  Mark Wahlberg, whom I normally like, just seemed too flat and not commanding enough of a character to lead any insurrection.  Estella Warren, who plays the 2001 equivalent to the original film's Nova, is so bad it's comic.  Check out the first scene in which she's introduced side by side with the Kris Kristofferson character.  The look on her face is so vacuous, you wonder how she's supposedly survived this long on the run. And speaking of Kris Kristofferson: why is he in this movie at all?  His character is completely wasted.3) Danny Elfman's swollen, distracting score:  I felt like I was watching Batman all over again.4) The character development:  The human characters are not developed at all.  We're supposed to buy that there's chemistry between the Mark Wahlberg character and Daena (Estella)?  One doesn't even really know the human characters' names by the end of the film.  I had to look them up on IMDB. I didn't care about any of the characters, and hoped they were all killed by the time the movie ended.5) The tacked-on, twist ending:  Send this ending back for a rewrite! Let's make some sense here, people.In addition to the points listed above, the dialogue was corny.  There were also numerous plots holes and distractions.  One of the distractions was how Daena got lip gloss and managed to shave her armpits while living such a primitive lifestyle.  It's also a wonder that the enslaved and nomadic humans spoke English so well.Helena Bonham-Carter does what she can with the terrible script.  The make-up effects were mixed.  The look of the female primates was not to be believed.  I assume this was done for Burton's lame satiric elements in the film.  The make-up effect on Tim Roth's Thade was more believable.  Tim Roth's scenes fare better than others, although he goes way over the top at points.Don't waste your time with this movie.  Do yourself a favor and rent the original 1968 classic instead.",

This movie was doomed from the start because the surprise twist ending in the 1968 version could never be redone.

Now, if he went back in time, how did Tade become a hero being that he didn't even exist until the future? This makes no sense at all and I think is a major flaw. The original ending is much better. I did like the little monkey showing up in his pod, that made me smile although it was totally predictable. I also did enjoy the references to the original movie with the ape saying to him \"Take your filthy hands off of me you damn, dirty human\" and then later on when Charlton Heston, in his cameo apparance, repeats his famous line from the end of the original movie \"Damn it all to hell\" or something to that effect, I don't remember the exact line now.

Rick Baker's makeup is a marvel, and more than makes up for his King Kong debacle of 25 years ago -- even though they still can't seem to create an ape mask that doesn't make the actors lisp. The action sequences are fast-paced and brutal, and the actors do such a marvelous job ... er ... apeing the moves of primates you're forgiven if you think Burton tossed a silverback or two into the melee just to liven things up.Mark Wahlberg is a disappointment as Leo, coming off as a one-dimensional jerk. The only times he shows any real humanity is when he interacts with a favorite (real) chimp, though he's certainly capable in the action sequences.Helena Botham Carter as the cute, human-loving Ari is the best thing in the movie, presenting a very well-rounded character when she isn't making lovey dovey eyes at Leo (best not to think about it too much). Estella Warren as a sexy slavegirl gets to show off the best lips in Hollywood, engage in an aborted catfight with Ari, wear very little, and go off in a huff of jealousy when Leo seems to want to spend more time with Ari. I get the strong feeling her best moments were left on the cutting room floor. It's always good to see David Warner and Kris Kristofferson, though their time on screen is brief.Tim Roth is fun and scary to watch as the villain, Gen. Thade, while Michael Clarke Duncan makes a menacing figure as Thade's right hand ape.Look fast for Linda Harrison -- the original slave girl in the original movie. Rick Baker himself also appears as an ape. And Burton's longtime love Lisa Marie makes her obligatory appearance, with a funny bit as a snotty, horny ape.The biggest laugh in the file comes from an otherwise dramatic cameo by original film star Charlton Heston. I won't spoil the reasons why it's funny -- only clue: it's not just in the dialogue.Nor will I spoil the ending. I was confused by it at first until I realized... it was CLASSIC Rod Serling. Once I realized Burton was paying homage to the Twilight Zone -- and let's not forget Serling co-wrote the original film -- everything fell into place.My only advice to Burton is to let sleeping apes lie and not attempt to reimagine the other films in the original Apes series. This is a good one-off, but best to move on to the next idea.",

            "content": "Tim Burton's \"Planet of the Apes\" is not a remake of the original version of the film, but rather a \"re-imagining\" or different take of that original material.  Wise move.  The original \"Apes\" is a film that still holds its own as an all-time sci-fi classic; pretty much any attempt to remake it faithfully would wind up like Gus Van Sant's remake of Hitchcock's \"Psycho\". . . a pale imitation of greatness.  By \"reimagining\" the original film, Burton gives himself the opportunity to start with the established mythology of the \"Apes\" series, as well as the ability to travel in a new direction with that mythology.  The end result?  The new \"Planet of the Apes\" is nothing Earth-shattering (pardon the pun) -- in ten or twenty years, it won't be looked at with the same reverence or respect as the original \"Apes\" -- but it's still good, and brings enough new ideas to the table to make a reasonably entertaining film.The story, which ranges in spots from good to barely mediocre, possesses some serious gaps of logic and suffers from an awkward opening.  The first fifteen minutes of the film makes little sense, and lurches along aimlessly for awhile until it stumbles into the heart of its story.  (Examples of some nonsense: Couldn't chimp-piloted ships simply be controlled by computers? Would highly experimental exploration pods be able to launch from a space station just by one rogue pilot punching in a two-second launch sequence?) The opening of the film admittedly does make more sense by the end of the film, but it's still not very good.  It appears as though the writers thought of a solid middle and ending for their version of \"Planet of the Apes\" . . . but had no idea how to get the story past the opening credits to that middle and ending.  The weak beginning seems like their best attempt to get the story moving to those points.  As for the rest of the story, it contains a lot of good, even original elements, but some points are glossed over in a rather hurried fashion -- there's little effort made to explore some plot threads, and some of the explanations as to how and why things happen in the film are either weak or come completely out of left field. The story's excellent  . . . for a second draft.  I've read that Twentieth Century Fox rushed this new version of \"Planet of the Apes\" into production. Too bad.  The story and script could've been excellent -- and more important, solid throughout  -- with some more work.Despite the uneven story, though, director Tim Burton does a nice job, given the script he has to work with.  If nothing else, Burton has a knack for giving films an eccentric look, and his version of \"Planet of the Apes\" benefits greatly from his eccentric touch.  He evokes a lot of the weird imagery of the original films (the weird scarecrows, the desolate landscapes) without ever blatantly stealing from them.  He also does a great job when it comes to focusing on the smaller, quieter moments in the movie -- for example, there's a macabre scene where a child ape puts her pet human in its cage for the night that manages to be disturbing and funny at the same time.  Burton, though, doesn't appear to have a clear idea of the overall tone of the movie.  In \"Planet of the Apes\", he goes for a blend of action, comedy, and seriousness . . . but the blend doesn't always work. Some of the humor seems out of place, and the action often seems stilted, as if Burton didn't know what to do with the apes apart from having them leap around menacingly.  The film is one of Burton's better efforts, but much like the script, the direction contains a few distinct weak spots.\nAs for the actors . . . again, it's a mixed bag.  The apes comprise the stronger half of the cast, which makes sense, since the apes are the weirder of the two groups - and Tim Burton specializes in weird.  In regards to the human characters, Burton would've been better off making the humans in his version of \"Planet of the Apes\" more like the humans in the original film - mute.  Apart from the protagonist Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), none of them add anything of import to the film anyway. The highlights of the individual actors come from mostly from the main characters.  Tim Roth nails the part of villainous General Thade perfectly - he's one of the best sci-fi screen villains to appear on screen in quite awhile. Wahlberg plays Captain Leo Davidson in a manner similar to Heston in the original film; he's a man who's not terribly interested in contemplating how he arrived at a planet ruled by intelligent apes . . . he just knows he wants to leave.  Fast. He's a pragmatic hero, one who reluctantly tries to help others in distress, but doesn't want to die in the process.  Also worth mentioning is Paul Giamatti, who provides some much-needed comic relief as the peculiar orangutan slaver Limbo.  On the other side of the acting coin, the biggest disappointment came from Helena Bonham Carter as Ari.  Given the poor quality of her character in the screenplay, she does what she can for her character, but all she really does for the whole film is to go around being nice to humans.  Period.  Some reasons as to WHY Ari feels so passionately about helping humans would've been nice.Tim Burton's `Planet of the Apes' is an action movie that manages to take some of the influences of the original `Apes' films, and then creates something eccentric and new.  Does it always work?  No, although in general, the good outweighs the bad.  Is it better than the original?  Absolutely not.  In a summer filled with blockbuster duds, though, there's something to be said for a film that provides some thrills and some fun, and the new `Planet of Apes' does exactly that.  Overall, it's an enjoyable film; it's just not a spectacular one.  Grade: B",

            "content": "(A spoiler or two) First off I haven't seen the original so I can't compare this psuedo remake to the '68 \"cult classic.\" But even so, I must say that Tim Burton's \"Planet of the Apes\" is a mess of great effects, especially makeup, shoddy story-telling and with two exceptions badly written characters. The story consists of Mark Wahlberg as an Air Force pilot named Leo, in the near future, on a space station where he ends up getting time warped to an alternate universe where apes rule humans. Of course Leo gets caught but not to worry, thanks to an sympathetic ape (Helena Bonham Carter), he and several humans, along with Carter and another ape, escape and try to find a way to a place where Leo thinks his ship is waiting for him (he has a device, that he got from his crashed pod, that is leading them along the way to wherever the place might be). But of course apes find them and a huge battle ensues. That's pretty much it for the plot, now to the characters. Carter does a good job as the human loving ape Ari, but Wahlberg is a bore as the film's hero Leo, Estella Warren (\"Driven\") isn't very good either but Michael Clarke Duncan is okay as a Gorilla general though his brain pattern seems to be, \"growl, yell, beat someone up, yell again...\" and so on. The standout in the movie has to be Tim Roth's character General Thade, the film's main villain. Thade is the most animated and fascinating of all of the characters and Roth gives the role plenty of emotional power, which basically blows away anyone else on screen with him. I'd actually be interested to see a spinoff movie centering on the Thade character is explained more in depth. Most of the characters are a bore and some are killed off so fast we (the audience) never know who the are.  Lastly, the makeup effects are very well done. The actors actually look like apes or gorillas or whatever. Again, Roth does the most with his character and the makeup fits the Thade character very well. Overall it's not a good movie, the choppy story and mostly bad characters take away what little good stuff the film had to begin with. To finish up, Roth is good but the rest of the flick is bad. Oh and the ending (which doesn't make a lot of sense, compared to the rest of the film) is silly and leaves this one wide open for a sequel, oh goody (note the heavy sarcasm here). I give it *1/2 out of 4 stars.",

            "content": "Where should I start? The hype for this movie came out months before its release and generated a lot of interest, including mine. Mind you I've never really seen the original movie, at least not all of it. But from the promos and interviews, this was Tim Burton's version of the movie, which was basically a bit more up-to-date, realistic, and cutting edge. But I couldn't help but wonder what or who would allow the ending they chose to be shown. Let me warn you that there may be spoilers in this review.The basic premise to this movie revolves around a scientist (Mark Wahlberg) getting stranded on a planet years into the future. The situation arises because of a strange anomaly they encounter in space and at the time, humans were using chimps as test pilots to send into unknown or high-risk situations. Their test pilot was sent in to examine the anomaly (which was to do nothing more than to do a fly-by) and suddenly vanished. Wahlberg's character, being the softhearted scientist, against wishes flew in to rescue the test pilot and himself disappears only to reappear hundreds of years into the future to crash land on a strange planet. He discovers very quickly that humans are not the dominant species on this planet but apes are and he is quickly rounded up to be a slave. His only driving goal from that moment on is to escape and somehow get back to his crewmates.\nTo be honest, the storyline isn't very strong, nor is it overly intelligent. The audience is given a very basic premise and is told to go along with it. However, if it weren't for the ending, I think a lot of people wouldn't have minded. There are little things throughout the movie that make you wonder how it's possible that something could happen. One of the major ones is that in the future on this strange planet, apes have evolved into intelligent speech cable creatures. But they allegedly came from the science station that Wahlberg's character came from as a result of them coming to search for him and crash landing on this planet. However, the science station was using chimps as their test pilots so where did all these apes come from?? As well, there are humans on this planet, which the movie at one point indicates that the entire crew of the science station was killed by the chimps when they turned on them. Where did all these humans come from\u0085and the horses?? Yes there are horses! It seems for the sake of making this movie they made a lot of assumptions and conveniences but the audience is not that dumb. They will pick it out and they will remember when the sequel comes out. There's no doubt about the sequel. The ending was left in such a way that a sequel would be created. Was there anything I liked about this movie? Well they did remain accurate on ape movements and that element created a sense of fear and menace that the apes in the original movie didn't quite have. The make-up and special effects were pretty good but then Tim Burton has always been good at those areas. Overall I wasn't overly impressed. The movie was acceptable up until the ending and after what I saw for an ending, it kind of ruined everything prior to that. It sounds like I'm being harsh but if you don't believe me, go ahead and see this movie. Just don't write back to me complaining about it because I warned you. On a scale of 1 \u0096 10, I give it a 5. I thought it could have been much better. Not enough time spent on developing a reasonable and logical plot line.",

Luckily for him, the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap-dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles.And alas, the always dependable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause.

It's just a good, exciting science fiction adventure film, and on that level, it succeeds quite well with only a few small stumbles.Tim Burton remains the only director I can name who has never made a film I don't like.  You might call me biased, but I do go into every new Burton film afraid that this will be the one.  Fortunately, I'm still waiting.So why is this not a remake?  Well, there are no characters from the original story (either the novel OR the film), and the situation is significantly altered.  While still being the story of an astronaut who lands in a strange new ape-dominated world, very little else is the same. Only a few lines of dialogue intended to evoke the 1968 film remind us.What's good?  First, of course, is Rick Baker's absolutely astounding makeup.  The original appliances still stand up quite well, so this was a nightmare assignment for any makeup artist.  Baker is one of the very few who could handle it, and handle it he does.  There has never been such amazingly detailed, expressive work in the history of film; the actors are able to come right through the latex and hair.  Too much praise cannot be heaped upon his work.  Then there's the patented Tim Burton visual approach; this is easily his best-looking film since \"Edward Scissorhands\", and really helps to lend the proceedings an otherworldly appearance.  The acting from the performers in the roles of apes is uniformly excellent, particularly Tim Roth in one of the most frightening villain roles I've seen in years.  He truly gives the impression of being dangerously unpredictable; a genuinely great movie psycho.  Mention must also be made of Danny Elfman's score, his most dynamic and interesting in years.  It recalls Goldsmith's work just enough to remind us of what we're watching, while also moving into new territory.What doesn't work?  Well, the humans.  They talk, but have nothing of consequence to say.  Why is Estella Warren so much cleaner than everyone else, and where did she get that lipstick?  And if she's intended to be a love interest for Wahlberg, shouldn't they have a conversation or two?  And sadly, we're given only the barest peek at the ape society before our heroes escape and return to the wilderness.  I really would like to have seen more of their culture.Now, the ending has already become much-debated and argued over across the Internet and elsewhere.  First off, I like the ending.  While it may not have quite the punch of the original's, I think it's a good twist for those going in expecting a twist (and weren't we all?).  Without revealing too much, let's just say that the screenwriters have obviously read the novel.In conclusion, this is an entertaining and exciting sci-fi adventure.  It won't open up your mind much, and it may not be among Burton's best works, but it's a lot of fun, and has a great deal to admire.  7 out of 10.",

            "content": "I have been a Tim Burton admirer long before most others have (*I* first discovered him through one of his very first animated shorts, \"Vincent\", shown on The Disney Channel in 1984!). I've enjoyed a lot of his work--especially \"Edward Scissorhands\", which I feel is his best--and also have been bored silly by a bit of some of his other stuff (\"Mars Attacks!\"). I got a kick out of \"Ed Wood\", enjoyed \"Beetlejuice\" and was delighted by \"Sleepy Hollow\" and \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" since they both seemed to be a return to his more traditional style.This film is by no means a match for the original 1968 masterpiece, but that doesn't mean it's not interesting or fun to watch. In fact, it's more interesting than I expected it to be. Sure, it's just treading water, but what redeemed it in my eyes and earned more respect in me for the script's concept than I otherwise would have had is the ingenious and wildly misunderstood ending.I'm not a huge POA fan, but that doesn't mean I don't admire it. While the original films were simply too dark, cynical and terrifying for me as a child, I admired them very much for their great intentions--that is, to use a sci-fi story as a metaphor for prejudice, intolerance and class problems (basically reminding us all that treating others as less than ourselves lowers us to the level of wild animals instead of beings with the ability and intelligence to treat each other with love, dignity and respect).My main complaint here is \"Marky Mark\". Lousy actor. He reminds me of Madonna skimping her way through such flicks as \"Body of Evidence\" and \"Shanghai Surprise\". He simply can't communicate emotion. Charlton Heston was wonderful as Taylor, a man who begins his dark tale as a cynical jerk who gets a taste of his own I-can't-stand-people-and-think-they're-no-good medicine and comes to realize that his attitude was the same one that led to the nightmarish situation he now faces. In this new version, Leo Davidson is simply bland and almost gives the impression that he's gotten himself as stoned out of his mind as possible just to avoid dealing with his dilemma. This makes it hard for the audience to identify with him, but even so the story's idea is so strong with its ending being so effectively jarring (even when trapped in a cornball script) that it can be frightening in its own right.Which brings me to the twist ending. Before I explain it, I just want to mention something: after reading all the comments both on here and made by paid critics, I am genuinely amazed as a writer how little people pay attention to the finer details of scripts! I guess the modern attention span of folks is so limited that such important details sprinkled throughout the story are lost unnoticed these days (a good example: Roger Ebert's comment that \"all the apes' varieties don't make sense considering the film's logic\"--YES, THEY DO! Look carefully in the beginning of the film and you will SEE WHY!).Tim Burton and his writers created the ending *VERY CAREFULLY*, and it is NOT--I repeat, *N*O*T*--just \"tacked on\"! All you need to do is pay attention, use logic and imagination to realize the gaps, and you will see that it is NOT really just some cheap setup for a sequel. In fact, going by the film's logic there isn't really any NEED for one, as the film stands on its own in its entirety!As if in outraged retaliation to the public's criticizing the finale, the videotape and DVD versions of this film contain a featurette re-showing various scenes and saying, \"Watch carefully for clues that lead to the explanation of the surprise ending!\" It further goes on to say that, just in case you are still too dense to get it, more information is further available on the movie's official webpage.\n***WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!***After seeing this film, I was easily able to guess what must have happened. I was delighted to find the info I've mentioned above on the internet later on and discover my theory to be correct!What basically happened in a nutshell was this: Thade was bloodthirsty for revenge (remember, he was never killed in the movie) and learned all about space travel through the information contained in the Oberon, salvaged and repaired Leo's ship, then attempted to pursue him through space and time. When Thade reached earth after following him through the temporal storm, he had arrived before Leo did. In vengeance, Thade set out to disrupt Leo's world the way that Leo had disrupted Thade's own. He led a rebellion of the apes and disrupted it into what we saw at the end of the movie before Leo's arrival.It would appear that Burton wanted a portion of his film to be the same way that such new films as \"The Blair Witch Project\" are... meaning, films that must also be experienced over the internet and through various other provided sources alongside the movie in order to completely understand them! In other words, asking the audience to use their intelligence instead of spoonfeeding all the information to them! Very ingenious. And different, too!That said, I for one am very impressed.",

But I nearly did once, and after watching a few minutes, I left. I couldn't do that with this one, because I came with my brother, his teacher, the teacher's son, and the son's friend, and couldn't go anywhere else. [sob] Just kidding there.I have got to start coming into movies with NO expectations. When I want an okay film, it sucks; when I think it'll be bad, it is; and whenever I think it'll be good, it's okay, and that isn't good enough. Here, I thought it would be bad. Tim Burton's remake (I'm not calling it a reimagining, it doesn't deserve such a title) was such a bad film, that whereas I thought in the theater, it was closer to the \"okay\" line, now I think it was closer to the evil of Tomb Raider. (Maybe it exceeded that.) Quite a turnabout!I'm an 11 year old (and am awfully smart for my age), and I had to do homework for a week-and if you knew me, you would know that I wouldn't consider it without a bribe-to see this. I barely got by, and after leaving, I said to myself, \"I did a week of homework for THAT?!\" It's that bad.The only redeeming part was the ending. And even that sucked. (Spoilers ahead, just as you would expect from me.) I mean, the first part was stupid-the apes caused the humans to mutate like that? (It was subtler, but that's the general point.) The final scenes where he gets back to Earth were cool-replacing the Abraham Lincoln statue with an ape-but it leaves a plot hole bigger than my lust for death after the film. If Earth's humans get turned into apes like that, how the f*** did Leo stay human? (I'll leave out the words next in my mind, because the IMDb would reject this thing.) Plus, how does the theater audience stay human? (Just kidding, but still...)This is the type of film that makes people consider suicide. Name a worse film that I haven't seen, and I'll consider seeing-and destroying-the film. No? FiguresRating: -2537396746584475673/6 (Lately, that thing hasn't been working.)",

It was safe in that genre to make political statements that would be blasted in other genres.The original Planet of the Apes series adequately addressed the issues of the time.  What would be the purpose of reiterating it in 2001?I actually liked the plot.  It was an interesting take or twist of the original.  There was some tongue and cheek dialogue as well.  The ending was the kind the either you liked or thought was really corny.  I liked the ending though, even if it did catch me off guard.I really liked the movie and would buy the video when it becomes available.

Especially when you find out that the apes learned english from Americans. I mean, if that's how they learned it, how can Helena B. Carter speak with british accent all way through?It appears that the actors must've chosen this script because it was a remake of a classic film-history film. And because of the directors name. Tim Roth is wasting his talent. Why won't anybody give him a charater as a major bad guy in a human-film? If he hadn't been hiden behind a stupid mask I'm sure he would've stole the picture from a (once again) poor performing Mark Walberg.If you like lots of action and nothing ells, I'll give this one 9 out of 10.In my own book it gets 3, from the fact of Charlton Heston being in a cameo!",

            "content": "I was not going to comment on this piece of stylistic dreck. Then I saw reviews from some folks who claimed that the movie was actually quite clever and people who disliked it were clearly not paying attention to the details. So, I carefully rethought the major plot points (there are few, so this was easy), and have a few spoiler type comments. Perhaps those who have not seen the movie yet can bone up on these thoughts and then see if I am still missing something.1) The monkeys in the beginning are genetically engineered to be smart, so that is why they were able to become dominant on the planet....OK, so one little chimpanzee crash lands on a planet with no monkeys. A whole bunch of years later, this chimp has not only acted like a plant seed and sired lots of other monkeys (of different species, no less) without sex or other monkeys to mate with. That IS intelligent. But wait, there WAS something about the 'crashed' mother ship that the hero finds on the planet...maybe our hero mated with those, but no, they are dead by the time he arrives. So maybe the apes on the planet came from the monkeys on the mother ship instead. This is lots better! It could explain how they turned into gibbons, gorillas, orangutans, and every kind of ape EXCEPT chimps, and this in a very few years. I guess that they were genetically engineered to evolve in amazing ways too. I could go on and debunk every argument I have seen for any part of this making sense, but I don't have all day. The plot in this regard is pure nonsense, and that is pretty much it.2) Humans had developed genetically engineered monkeys on Earth, and these clearly had also taken over, so the hero returns to Earth and finds out that they have become dominant there too. Well, I seem to have missed how this would change Abraham Lincoln into a monkey. Perhaps the symbology was just too extreme and the Old Abe thing a bit overboard. OK, then how did the Earth ape culture know the name of the general on that other planet to celebrate him? It was pretty clear that the hero's mother ship was not near Earth, but maybe the time warp ALSO send him back to Earth as well. Or not. The coincidences really need to pile up for this to even begin to be plausible. And since the film makers did not contrive the plot development to demonstrate any such path of reasoning, I don't think THEY actually had thought it through either. They just came up with a stupid and unsupported twist for the end of the movie. If you really need for the movie to make sense in order to enjoy it, then go ahead and rationalize meanings to your heart's content.3) By the way, it was pretty realistic that a huge and obviously orbital-space-only mother ship was able to land on a planet at all, much less intact. Enough so that the apes and humans on board could survive to populate another planet. Enough so that the engine(s) still work after so many years. Right.4) It was pretty clever for the film makers to suddenly let a tiny shuttle craft become capable of interstellar travel. Even WITH time warps, etc.The upshot is, this movie has no real level of excitement, no plot worth mentioning, no character development, no internal logic, unreliable presentation of core 'facts' to the audience, and precious little entertainment value. The money makeup was pretty decent though.",

This year has proven to be a wasteland of one bad movie after another, and Apes 2001 will most likely be looked at as a contributor to this wasteland, at least by me.The original and subsequent versions had social commentary that mirrored the current events of those times, such as the Watts riots and the Vietnam War. Apes 2001 was just a lame attempt to make a blockbuster movie by trying to capture lightning in a bottle a second time with name recognition, cliches, and special effects.  I started looking at my watch well before the halfway mark of the movie.The movie insults the intelligence of the moviegoer by having the apes give that annoying, piercing, headache-inducing shriek everytime they get excited, mad, happy, etc.  I suppose that director Tim Burton wanted to drive the point home that they are in fact apes in case we couldn't figure that out from the title of the movie and that they call themselves \"apes\" a lot.  It felt more like being at a zoo than a movie theater.Let's not forget the touch of absurdity too.  Apes teases a love triangle between Capt. Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), a native human woman, and Ari the bleeding heart ape.  Yes, you read it correctly.  Thank goodness it was only a PG-13 movie.Nothing noteworthy about the acting.  Wahlberg struts around as the hero, which is par for the course.  Tim Roth as Gen. Thade came across as more of an annoyance than as ruthless.  Kris Kristofferson contributes little, other than to continue his own streak of being offed in a movie before it's over. Of all the actors here, I felt bad for Michael Clarke Duncan.  After his breakthrough performance in The Green Mile, he was typecasted as a dimwitted giant ape in most other later movies.  I never expected for him to be literally typecasted as that to boot, but Apes 2001 does just that by feeding him the limited role as the stooge/friend of Gen. Thade.The ending - which by the way many will see coming a mile away - leaves the door open for a sequel, and if Apes 2001's undeserving blockbuster numbers hold up, sadly that's what we will get.Stay far, far away from this movie, even if you're a diehard fan of all the original Apes movies, have all the episodes of the TV series and cartoon on tape, have back hair, and crave bananas constantly.  Rent the original and just leave it at that. (1/10)",

I enjoyed the first Planet of the Apes and I was very happy to see this one had a completely original plot.  This gave the movie a new flavor. \nThe story, for the most part, was well presented and it made sense as well. However, there were a few areas which it was a little weak and where there were errors Wahlberg's character of a military officer with a science background, would not have made.  Wahlberg was good and helped the film along.  Tim Roth was also good and gave the film a sinister side.  Michael Clarke Duncan gave an explosive performance which in my opinion gave brought a lot if character to the film really helps make the film.Overall, good and worth your while (8 out of 10).",

            "content": "I'm old enough to have seen and enjoyed, when it was first released in 1968, the original film directed by Franklin J Schaffner, with its now legendary ending as astronaut Taylor (played by Charlton Heston) finally realises where he is and screams `Damn them all to hell!' Also I'm an admirer of director Tim Burton's innovative work in such movies as `Batman', so I looked forward to Burton's effort at `re-imagining' Pierre Boulle's imaginative novel. Sadly the result is nothing to go ape about.As one would expect with Burton, the work has a distinctive and impressive look, even if it is frequently as much Gothic as gorilla. The location shooting in Hawaii and Arizona and the prosthetics of five-times-Oscar-winner Rick Baker give the film strength. The problem \u0096 as so often in today's Hollywood \u0096 is the script which seems to have been produced by sitting a bunch of chimps in front of some keyboards. Much of the dialogue is risible and the thoughtfulness and sharpness of Schaffner's work is missing.\nMark Wahlberg, in the role of the lost spaceman Leo Davidson, is adequate, but he does not have the presence or the anger that made Heston's performance so powerful. In fact, Heston makes a cameo appearance in this re-make and manages to reprise his 1960s closing line. Many of the other stars, who include Tim Roth (`Reservoir Dogs') and Michael Clarke Duncan (`The Green Mile'), can only be recognised by their voices.In the original, Taylor was fleeing Earth because war and famine had caused him to become totally disillusioned with mankind. In the reprise, Davidson is desperate to return to the Earth he knows, even though he is on a planet where he finishes up with a God-like status among both men and apes and he can choose between the bee-sting lips of Estella Warren and the simian charms of Helena Bonham-Carter. Anyone that silly deserves what he finds in a brave, but essentially futile, attempt to provide a variation on the 1968 ending.",

Instead what audiences receivedwas a pathetic, unengaging,poorly executed load of overblown B.S Tim Burton seemed to very removed from his usual hands-on approach that made his best work so imaginative. The make-up is pretty well done, but unappealing and the actors sure had their work cut out for them, trying to reinvent the genius of former characterizations made by Kim Hunter, Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans.--but all was for naught with such a lame-ass script, lead character and senseless \"action\".I will say that H Bonham Carter did do a respectful job at her character, and gave a noble performance. But she was conducting it aboard a sinking ship.Weeks after this 2001 version opened (to 120 MILLION dollars worth of box-office!) the tragedy of 9/11 occurred, and it was quickly forgotten-where it has remained at the very bottom of Tim Burton's resume.And judging from most every other comment on this board, the bottom of the barrell-period!It never should have been made-plain and simple",

Others have described many of those points so ill not go into them here, but for me, what ruined the remake was the crash landing.In the remake, the main character, astronaut Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) crash lands on an unknown planet into a jungle!\nCompare this to the original where astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and his crew crash land into a bleak desert, its awe and desolation so well portrayed that it firmly set the tone for the movie going forward, add to that the brilliant sound effects during the various desert scenes, and the tone stayed with you until the very last scene of this cinematic masterpiece!In the remake, the jungle landing instantly deflated expectations, and drowned the tone in the swampy shallow waters of the cramped confines of the dense jungle foliage. While the tone was artfully and carefully developed in the original, where the astronauts spent some days traversing this vast eerie desert, cleverly building up expectation and and a certain level of suspense, the remake assumed the audience has no attention span, and immediately sends astronaut Leo to the ape city just a short walk away from his crash site.From there, one scene runs to another, as the plot and setting is further dumbed down.\nOne final note: The Forbidden zone in the remake is hiding what is more or less a single object, but in the original, the Forbidden Zone conceals an entire ancient civilization. The original far outdoes the remake in scope, vision and refinement. The remake, while it made good effort in ape makeup, cannot hold a candle to the original motion picture, which far excels the remake in practically every category.",

I of course cannot explain why without giving it away, but trust me, it was a major let-down to have a well made film end with that nonsense.

In the year 2029, astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) travels through a storm in space and is separated from his comrades. He lands on a remote planet, where humans are slaves and the apes are rulers. He is captured but attempts to escape and tries to revolt against the apes. You might think that a new version of \"Planet of the Apes\" from 1968 would be a bad idea. But since the story in the new one is rather different than in the original, it becomes a whole new film. Burton\u00b4s version comes up with many interesting ideas. He develops the racial issues more than the first one did, and questions the real differences between the humans and the apes.\nThe acting is first class all the way, Mark Wahlberg is perfect in the leading role, but the real stars here are those who play apes. Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth are all excellent, especially the latter. Roth is terrific as the evil General Thade, a character whom in the wrong hands could have been a bit silly. But Roth makes him a great villain, and he actually steals the show. I would love to see this British actor in more big budget productions in the future. The acting through the very realistic ape costumes is definitely something worth seeing.Overall, I liked the new \"Planet of the Apes\" better than the first one, and I still liked that one a lot. But the new one has better actors, cooler effects and a clever and entertaining script. It\u00b4s not perfect, the movie becomes a bit sentimental and cheesy towards the end, when Wahlberg tries to motivate the humans to fight. And why does it always have to be a kid who wants to be a hero in these big summer movies? I first thought that it was only in the \"Jurassic Park\"-trilogy that this was common, but \"Planet of the Apes\" was no exception.  This is still the most exciting adventure I\u00b4ve seen this year, and it\u00b4s nice to see a summer movie with both brains and muscles. And I liked the ending, even if I didn\u00b4t understand much of it at first.

Basically the stories involve a spaceman who lands on a planet where the barbaric humans are controlled by intelligent apes. This version is a good film, entertaining and with a surprising ending, but it lacks the punch and depth of the first edition.Tim Burton is my favourite director. 'Bettlejuice', 'Edward Scissorhands', the first two Batman films, 'Sleepy Hollow' - all excellent: macabre, gothic and filled with black humour. 'Apes' also looks great - the sets are spectacular and the makeup is amazing: the apes truly look real. What the film lacks is some of Burton's darker, slightly disturbing touches. It plays too much like a straight action/sci-fi flick, whereas the original was a powerful allegory for racism and animal rights as well as great entertainment.One of the reasons why the latter film doesn't match up to the original's power is because all the human characters talk. In the original the human's mysterious silence added to the theme of 'men as beasts'. Here that impact is gone, but they might as well not have bothered - the humans still have nothing interesting to say. It's the apes that have all the good lines and characterisation.Also, the ending of the original 'Apes' is one of the greatest in movie history, resonating with meaning, whereas this version's finale feels like a tacked-on surprise designed to set up sequels.The other main reason why the orginal is superior is that Mark Wahlberg lacks Charlton Heston's macho charisma in the role of the heroic spaceman. Heston was cynical, angry, confused. Wahlberg is bland.Nevertheless 'Planet of the Apes' is is a good movie, a cut above the average Hollywood science fiction film. However if I was given a choice of renting the original or the new version in a few years, I know which one I'd chose.6 1/2/10",

There was some great makeup and a few decent dialogue scenes. But as soon as Wahlberg and company escaped, it was all downhill. Once the battle scene came I was rolling my eyes and laughing. The action was pretty boring compared to some of Burton's better films. The last 20 minutes just drag on and on. And what was the deal with Tim Roth's performance? He spent the whole time growling and trying to act scary. To me it came off as a bad impression of Mr. Furious from Mystery Men. There were some genuinely entertaining moments, I'll give it that. Charlton Heston's cameo being the high point. But I spent most of the movie waiting for it to end. I found the original Planet Of The Apes to be an intelligent movie. It had great themes on the relationship and treatment between Humans and Animals. And while Tim Burton does play on those themes in the early parts of this film, it loses all sight of it in exchange for a load of action sequences.I'm sure that there is an audience for Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes.

He doesn't care, and any effort to care seems half hearted at best. The writing is terrible, wasteful and at times just stolen and ba****dized. If we aren't supposed to compare this movie to the original, then why did they steal superb lines from the original and force them into this one? Early in the movie, on the spacestation, one of the scientists tells Wahlbergs character that the female apes are the aggressive ones. I thought at that point there would be a female general on the planet of the apes. Was there? No. Did that line ever come into play? No. So why have it in the movie? It didn't further the plot, it wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, it provided nothing at all. Is this nit picking? Perhaps, but it just goes to show how unattached the people making this movie(and films in general) are to the point of cinema. Shakespeare never wasted a word, and here these people are, using millions of dollars to produce a story and they can't even get a quality script written. All this movie is a chase scene, but the end of the battle scene is ridiculous, the only way the writers could save their hero, and the apparent peace that arises between man and ape is forced because no real discussion of the topic occurs. The ending makes no sense, only cents- it is the launching pad for a sequel to try to explain what the hell happened. I'll only touch on the awful directing (hey Burton- why does everything important have to happen when it is dark) and the complete lack of attention to detail (Estella Warren's character was supposed to be the love interest- but the female ape and wahlberg had more chemistry, ape costumes looked just like ape costumes.) Did anyone else notice that at the bottom of the lake in which Marky Marks spaceship crashed was brighter than the dark jungle in which he crashed? Do the fish in that pond have lightbulbs? This movie was the pits- and if fits right in with the rest of the garbage I've seen this year.",

It is the first that did not disappoint...in fact it actually exceeded my expectations.  Let's get something straight, right off the bat, I did not go to the theater expecting to be enlightened. I went to be entertained and Planet of the Apes is extremely entertaining. The costumes and makeup are first rate. Rick Baker should, deservedly so, garner another Oscar for his work. The apes are REAL...more real than the dinosaurs in the disappointing Jurassic Park 3. The actors were great. Tim Roth is menacingly elegant as General Thade. Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary Tagawa are excellent in the student/sensei roles. Helena Bonham Carter...ah well, is it me or does she actually look and perform better as an ape?  Paul Giamatti almost steals the movie as the human slave trader, Limbo. The human actors were...well...human.  The movie isn't called Planet of The Humans is it?I'm a fan of the first Planet Of The Apes. This film is as good in some parts and much, much better in others. Go see the movie, sit back and enjoy.",

            "content": "First of all, Planet of the Apes 2001 is not the same as the Original Planet of the Apes. They are very different and both should be judged on their own merits and lack thereof. But I will attempt to compare them anyway. :) The beginnings are pretty similar with Mark Walberg's character, Leo Davidson, is an astronaut who lands on Earth out of time. When he gets there, apes are now the dominant species on the planet. The apes in this movie are a far cry from the ones in the original. They move more like apes and behave like apes. They sniff each other and make ape noises. One bedroom scene between and orangutan man and a chimpanzee woman that is just wild! The humans are used as slaves and they hide the fact they can speak from the ape masters. The acting in this move is well done. Performances by Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth stand out. Duncan plays a gorilla general and is very convincing and Tim Roth plays the evil General Thade very well. Roth uses the ape's mannerisms to seem more evil. Helena Bonham Carter plays an ape who sympathizes with humans and is equal to today's animal activists. She is even infatuated with the young human stud hero. One performance that stand out more than the rest is Paul Giamatti as Limbo. Limbo is a slave trader who is the funniest thing in the movie. He doesn't care about anything but making money and saving his own ass. His one liners are the main source of humor in the movie.      The movie's action sequences are top notch and incorporated ape strength and agility into the battle sequences very well. Apes are a lot stronger than humans. When an ape hit's a human it is very evident. You see people flying through the air when an ape hits them. Humans are also handled like rag dolls by apes. In the original POTA the apes were stiff and just as strong as humans. The story moves along fast and soon you have some apes and humans working together to solve the problems and defeat the evil General Thade. All the action leads up to a massive ape army fighting a massive human army. The battle sequence is done well. Then we come to the ending. I should say the endings because it seems Tim Burton didn't really know how to end it. At the end of the original POTA we she the hero finding The Statue of Liberty destroyed in a nuclear war. In the current POTA the ending is a lot different and it is clearly an opening to a sequel. The first ending is when the trained money lands his space pod in the middle of the battle and the apes stop fighting and start worshiping him as CMOS or Semos their founder and their God. The apes see the monkey be friendly with the human and they realize that humans aren't so bad. Sure it's a cheesy ending. Then everything works to the point where Thade is broken and the hero leaves the CMOS monkey and jumps into the space pod to get back home. The movie could have ended fine just there. With the Michael Clarke Duncan character taking command and giving humans equality. However the young Leo gets into the space pod, goes back through the time distortion and winds up in space not far from Earth. He then tries to land but things go wrong and he winds up crashing in Washington DC on the mall right in front of the Lincoln Monument.  Then he goes inside to find that it isn't the Lincoln Monument but the General Thade Monument and as he leaves the police and people surround him and they are all apes. The credits come up. This ending is the cheesiest attempt to push a sequel I have ever seen.        I am sure there will be a sequel because POTA had the biggest non holiday opening in history at about 70 million dollars. Now here are my speculations as to what the premise for the sequel will be.\n1. General Thade managed to take control again and killed off most of the humans to make it an all ape dominated society. Then our hero escapes and travels back in time to correct history.2. Apes and humans have both progressed and they are at war an threaten to blow up the earth. Our hero then has to go back in time to correct history.    I don't know what it will be but there will be a sequel. The first POTA had a few sequels after it too. I guess this one will follow in it's footsteps",

            "content": "I saw the film on preview night over in the UK. Had missed much of the hype, though with it being Tim Burton, I looked forward to it. I cannot say that i was hugely disapointed, and certainly I cannot agree with much of the over-reaction of many of the reviews - it is neither wholly awful, nor is it wholly wonderful.\nHowever, leaving the cinema, i had an rather strange feeling that I, or maybe the film/Burton had missed the point of it somewhere along the line. (I suspect it may have been the former rather than the latter,.. but i`m not so sure...) The film looked sumptious, of course. The make up, and sets have to be seen at the cinema to fully appreciate the workmanship and realism with which it is presented etc. This was ofcourse enjoyable, as indeed you would expect in return for its budget. And yet, I was still left wondering what was the point of making it - to improve it or the idea, to make a straight forward  blockbusting action film - i suspect not. I had a sense that Tim Burton had a strong mental picture of what he wanted, but was unable to reproduce it on film, and in trying to capture it, lost it completely.\nTim Burton seems to have great warmth for the original film - there are many references to the original film (some i missed, some i got), but he does not seem to have felt an equal warmth for his own film. Much of what i have been so impressed with his previous films (with the exception of Mars Attack )- the gothic, dark and eccentric caricuturations( if there is such a word !) of, I suspect his own childhood, (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and to some extent Sleepy Hollow) and the warmth in which presents them is oddly lacking here. Only in moments do you glimpse this, and sadly for the main part of the film you are unable to distinguish the films director from that of any other director- and this is a shame, he can and has done better. He calls this film an re-imagining of the original film rather than a re-make - I am hopeful that his imagination is more fertile, and i suspect that we may see a return to his more original storytelling soon.The acting is also worth noting. Much of the this is mainstream with the majority of the cast resorting to walking around bow legged (and with ill fitting underwear no doubt) to suggest a ape like gait. Mark Wahlberg doesnt seem completely at ease with leading a film yet - either that or he isnt quite the finished article. Helen Bonham Carter plays her part well, but it is Tim Roth who steals the show, with a very powerful and eye catching performance - though, it seems to me, he stole his performance ( or copied, or was inspired ) from Michael Ironside who, bar the make-up, snarls and grunts his way round every part i have seen him do in exactly the same way - I thought it was him for large parts of the film !Dont be completely put off by this review, as this is, of course only my opinion - dont wait till it comes round on video - give it a chance and with luck you will enjoy it 6/10",

            "content": "The original Planet of the Apes has been around for over 30 years so It's not that big of a suprise that the fans of it didn't like this version. They left their comic book stores and went to the theater expecting a shot by shot remake of the original. Well -- suprise! -- This wasn't a remake. Tim Burton's Apes was a different story all together with a similar --more sensible-- plot.   This one, in my opinion, was better. It contained connections to not only the first few movies in the series but to the novel as well [examples being with the GREAT suprise ending or the 'fun for the whole family' monkey named Pericles - who sadly died in the book]. Also, The Special Make Up Effects to this 2001 version --when analyzed-- blew the original out of the water. Rick Baker's work to this is his best since 'an American Werewolf in London'. When you combine all of that with Danny Elfman's pounding score and Tim Burton's smooth direction you get something that hasn't been conceived since Warner Brothers' BATMAN was released.   Oh, and In regards to a few news group critics' spiteful reviews, Tim Burton's visual style is very much evident in this million dollar 'Blockbuster' movie. If you'll think back to the cold white/black contrasting space station segments or the jungle / desert shot lay-ups then you'll realize that a sort of Hitchcock reminiscent style of frame composition is present. That's pure Tim Burton. The colors and set designs are prime examples.   In my opinion, Don't you compare this one to the original, it's a great movie on it's own. It explains more than the original did --or the book-- and makes more sense, like how the apes speak English. Tim Burton hasn't done something of this calibre since his 1989 comic book film renderings. So in summation, for all of you whiny little 1960's Apes Fanatics, just think about the references this one made to the original, Think about how much better the old one could have been and think mostly about why the movie made so much money - if it was so bad? Tim Burton's a genius artist and this film was his pallet.",

Another explanation is that the astronaut is travelling through space-time.

Well, the ending(I'm addicted to talk about endings of movies), is quite unexpected.  And it quite supports the explanation of the astronaut travelling through space-time.

After a supremely evocative score by Danny Elfman, an introduction that grabs the audience, masterful atmospheric cinematography and a presentation of the premise that maintains our interest, the movie goes downhill. Essentially, the second part of the movie is little more than a cat and mouse story and does not match the expectations set up in the first part The movie has some great make-up effects, and the special effects in which the apes jump or throw others up in the air are very entertaining to watch. It seems that Tim Burton has a `signature' special effect in each of his movies: In `Sleepy Hollow' it was the decapitations, and in `Batman', the flying sequences over Gotham City. I heard many voice comments that they were disappointed by the movie. I believe that's partly because of a mismatch between its main body and the ending: up to the ending, the movie treats the subject matter as a science fiction story with only a touch of social commentary, whereas the ending is very much in the spirit of Pierre Boulle's biting social satire.  If the two elements had been better integrated, the ending might not have seemed as abrupt. The movie does deserve credit in that it did not attempt to replicate the well-known ending of the original story, but find its own twist. Nevertheless, as a social fable it is weaker than the original. I still recommend this movie because, despite the drop in the second half, it is entertaining and the cinematography and special effects are well worth watching.",

Marky Mark, er, Mark Wahlberg (excuse me) all muddied up running around a Tim Burton set and B. that they were even remaking this accidental classic, which easily near the top of America's Cheesiest Films Of All Times list (right below Blackula, Killer Tomatoes and Jon Waters' purposely cheesy farces of course).For those too young to remember, Planet of the Apes first appeared in 1968. It was a sensation with audiences and panned by critics. The costumes were state-of-the-art for the times and the sets were as other worldly as they could portray in a sixties Star Trek quazi-realism way.Those who enjoyed the first version(s) even passed up the concession stand goodies for fear of losing that comfy close-up seat. The suspense of what the apes would look with all the modern gizmos the FX folks have at their disposal nowadays was almost unbearable. Like with The Grinch's recent successful transformation into 21st century-gadget- hoopla- infused- bing- bam box-office magic, TPOA does not disappoint on that level.As for the the rest of the film? Well, the plot is as deep as Green Eggs and Ham and the \"human\" cast is about as exciting as an instructional video on an anal polyp removal from the lower bowel of a brown field mouse, yet still, mad-director Tim Burton left just enough camp to keep it, surprisingly, enjoyable.The story goes...Astronaut; Leo Davidson (Mark \"softly spoken\" Wahlberg) is aboard a space station USS Oberon, training primates to play Astronaut. One starry night he is told to send one of these Chimps out to research a menacing energy field approaching fast on their starboard side.\nThe \"canary in the coal mine\" never returns...So, Leo, bored with is mundane duties anyhow, jumps into a delta pod to rescue the fellow, and, surprise, gets transported through time to a place ruled by...He crash lands safely in an eerie swamp. But, before he can shake his banana dry, he is over run by a group of fear-for-their-lives types ricocheting through the forest being pursued by dressed, orating, violent apes. Leo is trapped, along with these ratty anorexic -Mad Max looking- extras each with a perpetual glaze over their faces like deer locked on headlights (or Nick Cage in an emotional scene), and sent to market. The market is run by Limbo (brilliant Paul Giamatti) a sleazy Orang creep.Leo and a boopsie faced tribe gal, Deana (Estella \" be careful of bimbo typecasting  dear\" Warren), meet in one of Limbo's human slave holding cells. She's smitten, but he's focused on his personal inner dialog, his sequel, \"Exit El Quicko from the Planet Of The Apes.\"They end up working together and gather a few others including, human rights activist girly ape Ari (Helena Bonham Carter). They all escape the city and head to \"rendezvous\" with Leo's space colleagues who have been sending out a signal to him via his space age transmitter he rescued from his sunken space pod. The humans hope Leo is their savior fallen from the sky to save them from the mini-Kongs that suppress them. Leo hopes his friends are waiting for him, just over the mountain range\u0085The fleeing party faces some pretty mean mother-apers en route to Shangri-La! One ape in particular, General Thad, (Tim Roth) hates humans in a Hitler- southern plantation owner-circa 1800 way. He wants the filthy creatures (humans) completely annihilated and is schmoozing with the ape senate to get his wish. Leo is just what the nefarious Thad ordered when praying to their almighty Semos for a sign the humans must all go. With Leo's frightening display of intelligence and back bone, the senate will be scared bananaless into giving Thad the Marshal Law decree he so desires.\nWill Leo and his new tribal friends make it to the space command center before Thad's wicked army finds and crushes them? Is Leo the god they have waited for all these years? Could the last fight scene be tackier?Don't worry, I'm not ruining anything here for you...It's so telegraphed G.W. Bush would know the ending half way through. Okay, maybe right before the credits at least.The story is a tad blas\u00e9. You may find yourself adrift about the screen, looking for something to busy your brain when Mark and crew aren't battling the Apes. Which brings up a kind of humorous point of observation, Wahlberg's \"Leo\" has like three sentences of dialog in a scene, then smacko, he's immediately in primal combat again; like an odd ballet of film you watch and keep a mental metronome swaying in your head\u00851-2-3 fight, 1-2-3 fight.TPOA is really all about the visual treats; like watching intense thespian Tim Roth bounce about like an extra at Ringling Bros. & Barnum Bailey Circus of the Cruel in his cute little money, er, ape suit. Tim Roth's \"Thad\" was super creepy. Hate oozes from his furry little pores to the point were you feared he may really have gone rabid. Even with all the schtufamagal Roth had burying his features, the feeling and depth from the actor beneath came through. Or Helena Bonham Carter, all made up in ten pounds of latex, a far cry from the West End beauty she is, for sure. Still a lady, even as an ape.Then there's MM Wahlberg. His picture is in Compton's Encyclopedia under \"example of the Male Homo Sapiens \" -In my version anyway\u0085 The man's body is, simply, dare I say, perfect. He's a double cream serving of Pistachio Ice cream with a hidden layer of marshmallow fluff. Scrumptious. Leo was a dull character so MM's signature \"whisper\" delivery worked. I think i need a Boogie Nights fix...TPOA has quite a few exciting moments. Enough to recommend it. Those nostalgic for the original take heart- there's still only one Cornelious (Roddy McDowall) and this is not a replacement, it's just another look at a pretty wild concept , modernized for the new generation to enjoy.\nAn aside: Danny Elfman, Timmie's favorite music man, is back incahoots producing the film's score. As always, Elfman delivers a catchy, flowing gently ominous orchestration of notes.Snack recommendation: Banana nut pound cake and Pistachio ice cream.",

            "content": "It all sounded so good, a \"reimagining\" of Planet of the Apes. Richard Zanuck returned to helm production and Tim Burton was brought on board to direct. We were so optimistic. The original was a landmark film, could they do it justice? The sequels were so juvenile and simplistic surely they had learned, alas it was not to be. This movie is a train wreck. Poorly concieved, poorly written, poorly acted, preposterous in logic and impossible to follow it defies our hopes and dreams. Even without comparison to the original it fails miserably. But we can't view it without remembering. The fundamental mistake I think is that this is more than just a story about Apes. Its about one mans odyssey, his journey through time and space searching for .... well shall we say the perfect world, only to arrive in a nightmare. The remake conveys none of that. Its a chase movie aimed at the 12 to 18 yearolds who dominate the market. All the critics gush about the wonderfull makeup and effects, really? They are all in denial. They assume that because of the technical advances in the last 30 years it must be better. Well its not. The gorillas are pretty good, but we are forced to watch closeups of Helen Bonham Carter who looks ... well looks like she has a mask on. The sets look like ...sets and the Ape village in the original is 10 times more realistic than the graphic in this version. The ending? it defies any and all explanations. I remember after watching the 68 version staggering out of the dark theater with the rest of my stunned human companions, well I staggered out of the theatre again......in disbelief.",

On the note I must say that I have seen better, Helen's character could of, would of is consist of just her make-up, I could see so much more to that character.

            "content": "Tim Burton does a great job on the new Planet of the Apes. He manages to make a film that will not offend the traditionalists who enjoyed the original (like me), while at the same time creating something new that audiences of today will appreciate.First and foremost, this movie looks great. Even if all other components of the movie were weak (and some are), I would still be partial to this picture. The costumes, makeup, and sets are rich and extremely authentic-appearing, and really bring to life the apes and their culture. In a movie about a different culture, this is important. (There is by no means a comprehensive vision of a simian society, but enough is touched on to give us a good taste.) Without giving away the finer details, the plot is equal to the original, and the same interesting philosophical qualities of the 1968 version are here, with the social commentary on animal treatment, tensions in communities over diversity, the place of religion within the state, etc. There is enough action to make things interesting on a primal level (the initial capture scene is much more intense in the new Apes, the apes themselves being much more intimidating), and some personal relationships also add an element to the story.Even though many of the actors are covered in convincing makeup (with the possible exception of Carter, who looks a little too cosmetic), their personalities come through, and you can buy the idea of a speaking simian. Roth is especially good--his character plays a constant game of testosterone repression that he doesn't win often. His rage is palpable. Mark Wahlberg does a much better job as protaganist than Charleton Heston could ever have done. Overall, a good job by the cast.It's still not a perfect movie, not by a long shot. The comic relief, as with all action/serious(?) movies, gets a little distracting (although, by comic relief standards, Giamatti does a pretty good job). The humans seem a little too articulate to be so \"primitive\", and the entire explanation as to how/when/where Wahlberg's character gets where he is is never really reasonably explained. The final scenes of the movie are downright confusing, maybe close to ridiculous (if they mean what I think they're supposed to mean), and the film would have been better had it stopped five minutes sooner.I give the movie a 7.",

            "content": "NOTE: Not only does the following omit spoilers for the current APES, but also does not have any for the '68 version.Sometimes a situation is best served by calling forth a well reasoned logical argument that drives home the strength of its position by precise language and clever word play. The summer film season is not such an occasion. Popcorn movies are best enjoyed with brain in the \"disengaged\" position, attitude on \"laid-back\" and the butt as frequently as possible on the edge of the seat. While an argument can be made that PEARL HARBOR is an event that demands a certain level of seriousness and respect from its filmmakers (which, for the record, it did not receive) when your title is PLANET OF THE APES such decorum is out of place. The last of this summer's big popcorn films has arrived and with it the last word on just what a season it has been. Following the above dictum it can be summed up rather succinctly. To put it colloquially, this summer sucks a**.Forget what beefs purists will have with remake of such a science-fantasy icon as APES, this is a movie whose failure can be judged on its own meager merits. While every film's strengths and weaknesses starts with the script, the decision of whom to get behind the camera to helm it will only add to them. If you want to hire an A-list director who is going to bring a very unique look and visual style to the project, Tim Burton is a in a very select circle that includes PEARL's Michael Bay, FIGHT CLUB's David Fincher and MOULIN ROUGE's Baz Luhrmann. BEETLEJUICE, BATMAN and SLEEPY HOLLOW are films whose very look are worth the price of admission (though in the latter two's case I would suggest matinee prices). That's the plus.The negative is that especially for Burton, Bay and Luhrmann, they are not directors who can bring anything to the project narratively. Is it hard to imagine them as the students that could not shut up in their art and design classes, but doodling away during the story and character labs? Any wonder that Bay and Fincher were star video and commercial directors before getting into features?Ironically, there is not really anything in the visuals of APES that will strike anyone as awe-inspiring or even memorable. The production design, which is arguably half of the basis of BATMAN's success, is never any more or less inventive than what can be found on TV's Farscape. To be fair, there is only so much that can be done to show an other-worldly yet primitive culture and this probably had a lot to do with the decision to establish Mark Wahlberg's Leo character in his time before starting the primate ruled heart of the movie. Yet, very little is done with the ways in which the ape culture would key off of their different physiology.While the cast is game and never indulge in the kind of winking performances many others do (considering the make-up this would be hard to pull off to begin with), very few manage to bring anything extra to what are your basic \"big movie\" stock characters albeit in heavy masks. Tim Roth simply mashes his teeth, never showing the insight needed to make chief ape baddie Thade truly dangerous. The lone exception is Helena Bonham Carter, whose portrayal of Ari almost rises above the unexceptional script. Almost.Without joining the ranks of such spoil-sports as Matt Drudge, who surely must include in his pastimes running around to tell little children who Santa Claus is, some mention of the attempt to duplicate the ending to the original should be made (in difference to those who might be tempted to rent the 1968 APES, that ending will also be left unmentioned). Timmy Burton and Marky Mark's version is clever and novel and a good twist - and makes no sense whatsoever. The original ending was a surprise in the way that the best surprise endings are - they make you rethink the entire film armed with the new information. PRESUMED INNOCENT, THE SIXTH SENSE, FIGHT CLUB and now MOMENTO have you retracing the entire film to see if it all fits with the new. While the Chuck Heston version doesn't really change the fundamental storyline, it does give the viewer something to ponder and debate after the curtain falls. This new one, call it APES REDUX is nothing more than witless stunt that seems to be trying to... er...ape the signature element of Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone - the twist at the end. But the first time around producer Dick Zanuck was lucky enough to actually have Serling co-writing the script. The ending the gaggle of writers on REDUX give us thirty years later is as mindless and cynical an attempt to be clever and spark \"debate\" as the ending of BASIC INSTINCT. And fails just as completely. The only explanation that could possibly cover it satisfactorily, with an unintended nod to Serling, is that it happens in another dimension.The witless ending is an apt metaphor for the entire summer of '01, lots of anticipation only to be rewarded with disappointment. The only bright spot, and it is very bright indeed, is that next summer looks to be the first since 1999 to deliver the type of films we expect between May and August. Ironically, many are return trips to the successes of that summer and others: STAR WARS - EPISODE II, TERMINATOR 3, MEN IN BLACK 2. There's also some big original choices, with SPIDERMAN and Spielberg directing Tom Cruise in MINORITY REPORT; plus the next installments of both The Lord of the Rings trilogy and THE MATRIX RELOADED coming for Christmas. These last two summers of pretty mediocre fare beg the question did the studios completely loose the ability to make the one type of movie they used to roll out like Buicks? It's going to be long year waiting to see if they still know how to deliver the goods or just monkey around.",

The main problem people seem to have with this film is that it has a sense of humour about itself. at a time when so many films are ruined by taking themselves to seriously, this film probably should have taken itself  seriously but a sense of smirking fun prevails throughout. Burton's unique visual style is perhaps not as dominant as in some of his films but it's still clearly there. The film is riddled with plot holes and nonsense which are clearly going to drive the petty logic obsessed viewing public crazy, in short if something about this film annoyed you, (most of these complaints are just to stupid to list) chances are you missed the point.

So I did have some hope that, despite the mixed reviews, I might come down on the positive side.Early on, I sort of liked it.  I liked the way the apes acted more like apes in their movement and mannerisms, but soon I felt that it was becoming unnecessary comic relief - sort of like bad old movies poking fun at racial stereotypes.  And yes, Wahlberg is a failure in the lead role.  He seems curiously detached and his performance just sucks energy out of the movie.But Estella Warren is the tip-off here.  We have a supermodel in a skimpy outfit who serves no purpose in the film other than someone/thing to look at.  Why is she here?  I am convinced more than ever that this element, as well as others, ended up there as a result of market research and studio demands as opposed to anything resembling \"artistic vision\" by the director.From there, I can only think that we are starting to witness the downfall of Burton.  Much as Coppola went from \"The Conversation\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" to \"Jack\" (not that I mean to say that Burton's aspirations were ever the equal of the messages that Coppola conveyed in his best work).

Rosenthal put together a movie with too high-brow of a plot for you to understand.  I'm one of the first people to nit pick away at movies for defying the laws of physics and continuity but most of the complaints I've read in the reviews have no basis whatsoever.  You simply didn't understand what you were watching.Now that that's said; Wahlberg's acting skills needed a lot of polishing before trying a role like this.  Granted, we all know he's no Charlton Heston, but come on... he's worse in this movie than most and that's saying something.  Beyond that - and having the lead role that poorly cast does, I'll admit, have a huge impact on the overall movie - it's hard to fault this picture.

Isn't it scary that this shows that they seemed to have taken everything into account except the script?I followed this \u0091reworking' up the point where the Space introduction ended and we ended up on \u0091The Planet of the Apes' and it was about here I realised how poor the film was.As a basic example; in the original, at least it had the sense to say that the reason society had evolved  the way it had was because the humans were at the Stone Age level where they hadn't even developed the capacity of speech. As a result the apes had evolved faster than them and were able to dominate them. This reworking didn't even bother to do that. I don't think I'm being too pedantic by saying, if the humans could speak why were they still wandering around like caveman? It seems such a fundamental flaw to the plot, I felt it rather insulting to my intelligence.Then again, so many things seem to suggest that the script was written by a bunch of precocious High School students. As someone else has pointed out in these reviews; it's full of quotes from the original  - including the famous `Damn them all to Hell!' \u0096 which have absolutely no relevance to the current movie. You can almost see the writers of this thing sniggering behind their hands saying `I know, wouldn't it be cool if we put this line in!'\nThe DVD shows they spent months on getting the make-up right, the movements of the apes right, etc. etc\u0085we even had a very boring documentary about how much effort Danny Elfman put into writing this score, but who was looking at the story?

At least what had come before had mostly made sense (allowing for some real puzzles, like why was a research ship obviously not built to land carrying horses?). In the original POTA, the ending not only managed to answer all the questions the rest the film posed while remaining completely consistent to the rest of the story, it was surprising because it wasn't an answer you expected. With this one the ending is unnecessary, as the story loop is already complete; totally inconsistent with the plot; and surprising only because it is so completely illogical. For me, the ending knocked a 'six' (mindless fun) down to a 'four' (just mindless).

            "content": "What a confused and pointless piece of junk.  OK, so the costumes were well-done.  And Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth do adequate jobs representing the oversilly, stereotyped liberal ape-fascist ape dualism. But this rushed, ridiculously overviolent mess looks like it was churned out in about one month a/la last year's sci-fi classics \"Mission to Mars\" and \"Red Planet.\"  And, here's my question to the makers of this flick:  Why is every \"ape\" in Planet of the Apes 2001 stereotyped in the most offensive colonial worldview way?  Examples:  The violent, military apes are all like African \"savages.\"  The sly, merchant ape is like a Jewish Shylock from Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.  The wise, senator ape is like a royal European Anglo (above the dominant military savage apes).  The metaphysical/religious apes in the street are like turn-of-the-century W.D. Griffith stereotyped morphine-smoking Chinese-Americans with fu-manchu beards and long straight hair.  And, in an annoying modern twist, the adolescent apes are like miniature Fred Dursts, backwards hats and all anti-\"adult\" attitude.  Oh, and let's not forget the human stereotypes: Mark \"I always play the same part\" Wahlberg as macho space \"captain,\" Estella Warren as the full-lipped Barbie Doll sex object, and faceless adolescent boy playing the \"I want to prove I am a man by fighting in a war\" part so steretypically.  Hey, if this is the way the book was written, fine.  But you know what?  I don't think anyone should consider this type of overly simplistic stereotyped character manipulation as \"entertainment\" anymore. Hollywood, William Broyles Jr., and Tim Burton:  Have you no clue that these stereotypes are an ugly waste of everyone's time?  But, I know, this is just \"entertainment.\"  As long as it's \"entertainment\", that's OK.  What else? This movie has absolutely no plot or character development whatsoever.  It is like a series of quick scene ideas spliced together very haphazardly. There is little chance to get to know or empathize with anyone in the film. Most of the human characters are so character-less that their actions seem unbelievable.  And what of the setting?  Very, very strange.  Yes, it's got that dark, Burton touch, but it almost doesn't make sense in this film. There's something too small, almost stagelike about the setting of this film that goes against the expansiveness of its theme.  This is supposed to be about someone traveling millions of miles from earth and it feels like they've gone about twenty feet.  And there's no real sense of an \"ape world\" on this planet; it's like they all live in a little box (and there's only like one hundred of them there).  And what was with that scene when the humans were escaping and they kept running through all of the apes' houses? It was like something out of The Three Stooges or Abbot and Costello. Finally, in relationship to this last \"funny\" scene, there's the inconsistency in the approach to this film.  Is it supposed to be campy or is it supposed to be serious?  It just doesn't know.  You could have heard a pin drop in the theater (which was quite full) when I saw this and the apes muttered \"funny\" lines such as, \"Get your damn dirty hands off me you stinking human\" and \"Can't we all just get along?\"  Uh, what?  I'm sorry, Tim Roth, but I simply don't get this film.  I think it stinks in every way possible.",

Helena Bonham Carter did her best, as did the rest of the cast, although the usually likeable Mark Wahlberg was horribly miscast. And the pouty busty blonde babe really got on my nerves - what conceivable purpose did her character serve? She never once closed her mouth, and she looks like an inflatable sex doll. Was she cast only to draw teenage boys into the audience? Too many plot holes to count - looked as though a lot of explanatory scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. And gee whiz, do you think they'll make a sequel? Next time, I hope they spend some of their millions on one of those little luxuries known as a decent script.",

I never thought that the original needed remaking, nor that it could be bettered (the twist ending, along with the Usual Suspects, is one of the best I have EVER seen), but nevertheless, I thought that, if anyone, Burton could put his own fresh, dark spin on the idea. However, the whole thing gave an impression of a Burton being constricted by studio bosses hungry to chock up another Summer hit by throwing in everything including the kitchen sink- check out the extras-filled DVD if ya don't believe me.  Nice idea, wrong director. Burton is unparalleled for his alternative-style movies like the classic Edward Scissorhands. Here it felt like he was on a leash, his creativity tragically stunted.The make-up effects weren't much of an improvement on those of 1968, which only serves to highlight the superiority of the original. The acting, well, apart from those who were struggling under their ape-suits(Roth,Bonham-Carter,Clarke-Duncan), was poor- I agree with another reviewer who said that Wahlberg wasn't yet strong enough to carry off an action lead, and as for Estella Warren, well, I think we all know that she was only there to provide some Raquel Welch-style eye candy. The music,from the always dependable Elfman,was superb. The ending: lets face it, it was always going to be compared to the original's which, if not impossible, would be pretty damned hard to better. The ending to Burton's felt silly and tacked on,and smacked of  an overall air of \"please, be shocked!\" whereas it actually only left punters scratching their heads and looking for refunds.If you're curious, wait until the video rental price drops down. If not a Burton or sci-fi fan steer well clear.",

            "content": "SPOILERS,SPOILERS,SPOILERS*************\nFirst off let me say that this movie, in my opinion, is a major disappointment. The problem lies, I believe, in the so-called re-imagining of the original movie. The premise that Tim Burton put forth to the public was that this was not a re-make, not the same story, but rather a different take on the classic Heston movie. While that may have been a wonderful idea in theory the actuality of it does not hold water. This movie never knows what it wants to be. Unlike \"Sleepy Hollow\" or \"Beetlejuice\" or \"Batman\" (just a few of Burtons good films) this one never seems to have any sense of itself. It seemingly starts as a social commetary on the way apes are treated in todays HUMAN society, the main focus of the original movie. Then it quickly truns into an action movie, seemingly only to justify its summer release, then muddles back into its social satire for the majority of the film, then clmaxes with a mix of both. If you wanted a social satire, a commentary on human treatment of animals in the world, you are left disappointed with this film. If you were looking for an action film, sensing that the first film did such a wonderful job of making any types of social commentaries, then you were sorely disappointed as well. The film leaves all a little empty and while I do recommend it to others it could have of been so much more.Now, for the SPOILERS******* part of the review, I have been talking to a lot of people about the ending of his movie and it seems to me that there is a lot of debate about what actually happened. It took me a while to figure it all out and I think I have come up with the possible answer. Let us look at it like this. Leo goes to look for his monkey, entering the vortex an being shot some hundreds of years into the future, from the 2029 he had originally come from. The Oberon, his ship, goes looking for him and gets caught up in the same vortex. Now since he finds the Oberon and the monkeys from the ship are the original monkeys, it is safe to assme they were thrown thousands of years into the past. So here it is, when Leo finally leaves to go back to his home world of earth we learn that he had in fact LANDED on earth and going back in the past did not change the wreck of Oberon. That means that instead of Humans evolving it had infact been the apes that evolved and Earth was an ape planet, not a human planet. History followed itself, but only with apes as at the helm, not humans. The future that Leo finds himself in is a future created by apes, maybe following the original movie but only the apes this time waged war on themselves and destroyed their world. And General Thade was not the same General Thade but another of the Thade decendents from Seamus that was held on high by the apes. I believe that is it, even though there are some problems with my hypothesis as well, but it only seems to be the only real explanation.",

            "content": "What can I say, yet another disappointment, though not as acute as many of the other movies this summer. This is a watchable movie and as far as the big movies of the summer, it is the best of the bunch. However, it is still very much a movie that misses its mark. The main problem is the fact that this movie does not have a lot of action in it. It is a movie that is primed for action, a movie that from the beginning of it promises action, and never ever delivers. All of the make-up, all of the ape like movements are all layed to waste as the movie tries, I believe, to be too much of a social satire as opposed to a good old action flick. The acting is good, and all of the \"ape\" actors are superb as they look, act, and even move like apes. Roth is wonderful as the evil villian of the movie, Duncan is perfect as the ever imposing general who carries out all of Roths biddings, and Carter is brilliant as the human rights activist who helps the Humans as much as she can. Walhberg is good, but not great, yet he is never really able to explode in the role. Yes, I understand that an ape, no matter what size, is stronger than a human but hey, this is a movie. Lets have at least one scene where Mark kicks the sh*t out of one of the apes. You never get the sense that Walhberg is truly anything more than the others besides the will to challenge the apes, but it seems everyone joins in that effort all too easily. He isn't stronger, or seemingly smarter than the rest, who seem surprisingly intelligent for a beaten and battered species who are constantly denegraded. Despite that Walhberg does do a good job of putting his part over. As I said, the main problem is the lack of action. Burton missed the boat on this one, and while it is serviceable and with what is out there now I would recommend it to most people, it could have been so much better. I love Burtons movies and he has rarely dissapointed me, but I do believe he should have gone another way with this film, or at least picked a way to go. See this movie, it is worth it for the make-up and the acting, but if you want to see a truly wonderful movie rent the original.That movie knew what it wanted to be and never strayed. This one is just a little too confused about its direction. Oh, by the way, the twist ending is pretty cool, and will I believe spark a debate amoung those you go with.",

(Which are sure to be tied up by the obviously sequel that the end sets up)Mark Walberg's tries to find his monkey and lands on a planet where Monkeys are superior and humans are the lesser primate. The make-up is astounding, and Mark proves to be a pretty good no-brain action star. Tim Roths is a pretty good monkey-gone-bad, but as I said before, this movies too silly to be taken seriously and his intense performance is kind of lost.After it's revealed how the monkeys got the way they were, (and why their english was so good) the plot just get's silly and builds up too a fairly laughable ending. The blond girl, Estelle, isn't bad as far as models-turned-actresses go, but her character serves no purpose other than to give 14 year old boys something to look at. Plus, even with more makeup than the cast of Cats used for 20 years, the best apes-actor is still the real thing, Mark's chimp Pericles, who gives a better performance than half his human-cousins.It's not a bad movie, it's a style-over-substance movie, but hell, so's most everything else that's at the theater.

In fact, in terms of plot, character development, social commentary and even flat-out action, this remake not only doesn't hold a candle to the original, it isn't even on the same planet.  Having seen the original \"Planet of the Apes\" recently for the first time in many moons, I was impressed from start-to-finish, but especially impressed by the first five minutes in the spaceship, where Charlton Heston sets up everything that follows with a wonderful speech (into a recorder) about the passage of time on the ship as opposed to Earth and how he hopes it has resulted in a better world and society.  We all know what happens after he crash lands and finally finds the answer to all that has happened to him.  Here, we have Mark Wahlberg, a fine young actor who frankly can't hold a candle to Heston, and a completely meaningless fifteen minute opening in a spaceship that sets up absolutely nothing but cheap shocks and silly explanations some ninety minutes later.Without rehashing the inane plot, I'll just say what I liked about this movie as opposed to what I didn't like:  Helena Bonham Carter's Ari character and absolutely nothing else.  It wasn't funny, it wasn't suspenseful, it wasn't shocking, it wasn't exciting, it wasn't thought-provoking.  It was absolute monkeyshines, in other words.  Even terrific actors like Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth couldn't elevate it for me.  None of the new characters could even hold a candle to the original's Cornelius, Zira and Taylor, and even Estella Warren's human \"love interest\" (who is totally ignored by Wahlberg's character throughout the film) compares unfavorably to Linda Harrison's Nova, which is pathetic considering she was the weakest link in the 1968 cast.  And what was with that totally unfunny slave trader character?  I felt the same way about him as I did Jar Jar Binks.  Put him out of our misery and do it fast!  Also, the film is grungy, dark and depressingly shot, easily one of the ugliest summer films I have ever seen.In short, I think I've made the point that I didn't like this movie.  And I won't even get into the totally bogus, unnecessary and implausible (to say nothing of dopey, incoherant and impossible considering everything else that has happened before it in the story) surprise ending, which appears to have been tacked on and serves as a surprise for no other reason than to supply a cheap shock that only the absolutely gullible will swallow.  Everyone else will feel cheated.  As a matter of fact, that is who this film is for: gullible fools who will swallow anything Hollywood spits out of its computer and be grateful for it.  For everyone else, you have been warned.  (1 out of possible 10)",

I also learned that somehow, apes just learned to talk on their own, a lot like evolving, but maintained their hunched appearance and brutish looks.  You couldn't call the original series science fiction, because it wasn't really based on science.  In fact, in order to really enjoy any of the original films, you had to forgive a lot of fuzzy logic.This new \"revisioning\" of the original film makes a whole lot more sense of how apes learned to talk and walk upright and possess all those \"human\" qualities without having any overt explanation scene.  It just makes sense on its own if you really think about it.  You don't have to though.Anyway, Mark Wahlberg proves again that he was never supposed to be a hip hop star and acts his way very effectively through this pretty darned intelligent film.  First off, leave it to Tim Burton to make comedic yet emotionally trying jabs at bestiality.  If you see the film, you'll see what I mean.  Secondly, we see how operatic life in politics can be, and still be fun.Tim Roth leads a tremendous supporting cast of action movie veterans.  Of course, you won't recognize any of them through the amazing make-up.  The action is amazing, and artfull while the story moves at a locomotive pace.\nHonestly, this movie never stops.  And we all expected a big twist ending, better than the original, but instead, we get a twist ending with such a huge sequel come-on that I almost vomitted.  The ending manages to work, come out of left field, and tickle you pink, all at once.  I was either elated or nauseous, I can't decide.  Overall, a really good film.  Better than the original, possibly.  The 68 classic had no limitations as to how high morally it could reach.  So this new revisioning decides to change gears.

Incapable of organized rebellion.  Thus it made more sense to have a strange space man come down and be seen as truly 'different' from the others.In this new version the humans, as we see them, don't seem particularly stupid, just overpowered.  For Markie Mark's character to be singled out as somehow 'different' doesn't make any sense whatsoever, because the other humans speak, reason, communicate, and organize without any difficulty.A shame, then, that this version lost the whole idea of the space man leading a race of humanoids who appeared normal yet were somewhat strange and incapable.  The only disadvantage humans seemed to have in this movie was some lack of muscle strength - and only barely.2) The portrayal of 'stranger in a strange land' is always very compelling. The audience puts themselves in the stranger's shoes and thinks, how would I react?  What would I do?  Would I stand up and say \"hey, I'm not a normal human like these others, can I talk to someone in charge here?\"  Would we lie in wait to suss out the situation before 'taking sides'?  Would we ask questions of our fellow captives?  There are any number of things we would do or contemplate.However this movie just charges through that whole stage of the story and explores none of these possibilities.  The moment he (literally) hits the ground, Markie Mark assumes the role of 'one of the hunted humans' and never makes any attempt whatsoever to say, \"hey, wait a second, can someone explain what's happening here?  because I have an interesting story to tell. Hey apes, i may be smarter than you assume.\"Lost opportunities, both.Plus the movie expropriates so many 'catch phrases' of American race relations dialogue as to be nauseating (\"Can't we all just get along?\" \"Separate but equal\" etc. etc.)  Talk about bonking us over the head.And the ending is as preposterous as everyone says.Pretty costumes.",

If you went in expecting only one logical time-line then you've messed up already - there is in this film at least three different dimensions or realties as you will find out by reading on!I thought about it for a while and now I appreciate the genius of it all. The world they are on is certainly not Earth but there are two moons... this is 400 years into the future. He skips through two time/dimensional wormholes and ends up in the same solar system - on Saturn! That is right Saturn. Two moons, the glowing rings around the planet etc. In this alternate dimension Horses are obviously native to the planet. Now the Oberon obviously flew through the storm and has ended up in the same dimension only thousands of years earlier. The genetically engineered apes rapidly evolve and conquer the humans. Over many hundreds of years the humans become nomads and education falls apart. Whilst the genetically engineered apes who are bred to learn and develop become the socially dominant group. Semos forbids the Apes from Calima and wallah you have your set-up!Then we come to the end. Obviously Leo skips once through the time/dimensional wormhole. So one can assume we are now in an alternate reality again. Of course it is similar to our own and General Thade is there. This is a where the creators are laughing at us... in alternate realities things are generally the same with just slight twists. You know in the Simpsons when Homer goes back in time and when he travels back Ned Flanders rules the world? This twist in this film is that the Apes have evolved even further than on the previous planet in the other dimension into technological beings very similar to humans - perhaps in this alternate universe there is a film called \"Planet of the Humans\". Do you see what I am getting at. I don't think we need to ask how Thade got to Earth, or what about time lines because the filmmakers did not even ask those questions. They created different possibilities for how time and reality could evolve and used the electric disturbance in space to transport our hero between them all!And so there you have it. A neat sci-fi ending that amuses the suits into thinking they can generate a sequel. My hope is if they do that they do their best to tie up the lose ends and treat the story with intelligence. This would be neat if they thought hard about explaining the new dimension.I would prefer whatever the sequal maybe to treat the entire movie as the explanation and not just resolve it in the first 5 minutes - that would be neat and interesting with room for a classic ending...Now that I have that out of the way I hope you all appreciate it a little more!!!",

In this regards \"Planet of the Apes\" 2001 is no different, however once again Tim Burton reminds us how wide the imagination can spread.If your like me and are generally unsatisfied with the tripe peddled to the masses in modern day supermarket cinemas then you'll understand my pleasure when a Tim Burton movie comes out. He does things just that extra bit different to most film makers that sets his films apart and makes them a refreshing experience. The first feeling I had when leaving the cinema was \"I need to see that again\". Partly because of an unusual problem with the ending, and partly because Burton's \"Apes\" was an absolute riot.I want to get the plot issues out of the way first; the film is not different in plot to the original in 1968. He arrives, he is captured, he escapes, and there is conflict about the origins of Apes and then a twist ending. No surprises here. This version of the story holds together really well. That is up until the conflict sequences towards the end. Sometimes I wonder if they change writers in these films but the person who thought hard about the script suddenly stopped thinking about it and the movie seemed to suddenly lower a level or two. I am not saying it was poor, no not at all but not up to the same standard as the rest of the film up until that point. Although one must remember this is a film about Apes, and what Apes they are!These walking talking Apes are absolutely fantastic. Unlike the original they all look very different to each other and they actually act like Apes. If you have ever been to the Zoo and Watched the monkeys play you'll know what I mean. Tim Roth was absolutely outstanding and totally convincing as the evil Ape, I was completely in awe of how convincing his character and monkey suit was. Not only was the make-up outstanding but they also must of studied how Apes behave because they had the personalities and behaviour habits down to a fine art! Watching Them hang from the sealing, leap from tree to tree and go berserk was an absolute riot and I enjoyed every minute of it!The humans and the hero on the other hand are a slightly different story! They are obviously not the focus of the film so there are no strong performances, certainly they do not get much screen time. As for Mark Whalberg as Leo he is probably the first true to life hero. There is absolutely nothing special about his character and in the end he does nothing special either except give hope to the humans on this upside down world. He is not an over the top action hero, he is more of a \"nineties man\" with no special traits except his inability to accept Ape control. But we all would object I believe. This is what I liked about Leo, he was ordinary and even when he was trying to motivate the humans at the end no one fell into the trap of an over the top inspirational speech. he sounded like you or I would making it up on the spot. Tim Burton once again gives us a different spin on an old icon.Finally we come to the very end and probably the main point of confusion for everyone. No matter what your theory is I think we all need the script writers to come forth and \"please explain!\". I did like the ending but originally it did confuse me and there are so many conflicting facts in the story that prevent most logical conclusions that my mind was going to explode. All the same I implore you not to let this be a deterrent as the film in totality is a marvellous experience.I don't want to give this movie a rating because it is again definitely one of those films, which you will either love or hate. These kinds of films generally cause discussions of great length and analysis and no one will ever agree particularly on a theory for the end of this one. However I certainly loved the film and believe it was worth the price of the admission. The best thing to do is go and see it for yourself, making up your own mind is the most satisfying thing about it all.",

            "content": "There are two kinds of remakes: one, where people, for whatever reason, think, they should redo a film in the same way it's already been done before. Vertigo and Vanilla Sky come to mind. Then there's the idea of taking a premise of a movie and see what you would make of it. Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes falls into that latter category. As such, I will not compare it to the earlier movies. Sadly, it manages to under-deliver all of its own. It's the last half hour that ruins it for me. Until that point, I was entertained. The apes all look individual and very good. Although they go over the top in demonstrating the hideous conditions in which humans are kept, around 80% of films about social injustice go even further (Mad Max, anyone?). The action was fine, and, considering the genre, made a sufficient amount of sense. Apart from that, Tim Burton is one of my favourite directors, so it couldn't be all that bad, could it? Well, let's see.\nSpoilers ahead. Then, of course, they had to go for the happy-ending-that-isn't. How Attar was so easily convinced of Thade's treason, I'll never know. Just because a monkey - sorry, prophet - landed at the right moment, in the right spot? Speaking of which, what a prodigious coincidence! Give me a break.What really did it for me was the \"shock-ending\". Wasn't the guy going BACK in time? Does the Apeworld run on Anti-time (as seen in Star Trek TNG, All Good Things...)? Yes, we knew it could not end well. But we hoped it would at least make some degree of sense. Is that too much to ask?",

Good costumes, good sets etc, and worth seeing for these things. However (!). The plot has load of holes in it. 1. Marky can't land a space craft to save his life. Both times he totals it in a crash landing. Then the chimp shows him how its done, in a perfect landing, in the middle of a confused battlefield. 2. The space station just happens to crash land a couple of days ride from Markys crash site. 3. When he leaves the planet, three moons are visible suggesting to me he wasn't on earth. 4. All the apes speak English with american accents - fair enough the space station was manned by Americans - but how many generations had passed up to when our hero makes his appearance. Human english has changed alot in the last thousand years. 5. Ok, so the space storm spits out objects at random intervals in time. The space chimp sure chose his moment anyway. A hairy 'Deux Ex Machina' (sorry if I spelt that wrong!) 6. Oooch! People seem to fly about the place, flung by angry apes then just get up again, particularily Mr Whalberg. A gorilla can rip a mans arm off easily.Ok, I'll stop there. I just had the feeling Burton thought, this is Sci-fi, they will buy anything, so I can do whatever I want to push the plot along. I like Mark Whalberg - but he didn't come out very well in this film. The young boy falling under his horse was soooo predictible - we all groaned. Charlton repeating the last lines from the origional was a nice touch though. The other human characters may as well not been there, for all the difference they made. Unlike the book, or even the origional film, this was pretty brainless. Still, It had its moments and clever touches, I thought, and although we only had glimpses of the ape society (which is what the book focuses on), and the film focused on 'hero-on-the-run' action, I would still recommend it, if only for Tim Roth - the antithesis of a PG Tips Chimp.",

DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED!!!!Anyway, when Leo is flying back through the storm and sees earth, THAT is when the movie should've faded to black and rolled the credits.  Thade is still alive, and there could be a sequel that begins with what this movie actually ended with.However, this movie ends with a twist that makes no sense.  Somehow, we have a statue of Thade in place of the Lincoln Memorial Statue in Washington D.C., and a planet Earth dominated by Apes.  It looks like a great ending, but it doesn't add up.  We're not given an ounce of evidence that what happened in this ending could've happened at all.  It's like, in Back to the Future Part II, how can we NOT see the Doc toss the sports almanac into the trash, NOT see old Biff steal the book, and NOT see old Biff steal the time machine, and yet still have the same plot?  It doesn't work unless those three elements are there.  Even seeing old Biff just steal the almanac is good enough.  But without any elements to explain how in the heck Biff could've changed the present, it would've been poor writing. \nIt's the same with this ending with Planet of the Apes.  It's an ending that should've been seen only at the beginning of a sequel, or if there were elements in the movie's plot to explain how in the world Thade could've done what he did. This ending really hurt the movie.  Everything was fine up until we see the statue and the Apes wearing police uniforms, handling guns and driving cars. I can accept that this could've somehow happened.  But without a sequel, one has to make up numerous stretches to make it work.\nSorry Burton, but you never sacrifice substance for style.",

Burton's Planet of the Apes has great things (set design, matte' paintings, special effects and makeup) in it, but the story and pacing are disappointing.  The mood is too claustrophobic.  There are no interesting characters (Markey Mark the underwear model can't fill Heston's loin cloth). Cliche's are abundant.  Tim Roth's character is a little too evil and over the top.  The humans talk and have nothing to say. It would have been preferable to keep them mute like the original.  Maybe my point of view has been warped by the excellent 1968 version.  Burton's work ended up being one big jumbled mess.  I even took a short nap in the middle.

Truly, this so-called summer blockbuster insults moviegoers with its trite storyline, excessive and inappropriate violence, monochromatic acting, inaccurate, contradictory and illogical sequences, implausibility, lackluster performances, and poor direction.  To call this a remake of the original 1968 version is tantamount to pouring ketchup on a gourmet meal.  The makers of the original POTA and the author of the original book must be gnashing their teeth in absolute outrage.  What is wrong with this puppy?  Let me present a few examples:\u00b7 In the beginning sequences, what four-star general would ever tolerate such insubordinate language from a mere captain?  Or for that matter, what general would speak so contemptuously to his star crewmember?\u00b7 What rational human being and ostensibly highly trained military officer would flagrantly disobey his general and subject himself to such an absurd physical risk to reclaim his monkey?\u00b7 If the apes used the humans as a valuable resource such as servants, why would they treat them so abusively defies all reason.  To use humans to pull the cages of other humans is a waste of valuable resources, when they could have just as easily used horses that would have accomplished the task far more efficiently.\u00b7 The original POTA had various elements of their society that were sensitive and intelligent.  Why make them all appear to be such a raving band of lunatics, particularly their leader?\u00b7 Does this Mark Wahlberg have any emotion at all?  Clearly, he could have emailed his performance in rather than waste our time and money to watch him go through his ridiculous antics.\u00b7 When in the initial scenes the humans are escaping from their cages, does it make sense for them to dash through bedroom after bedroom rather than simply flee the premises?  Clearly, the scenes are a poorly contrived vehicle to bring some humor into this dismal display of MTV chaos that no doubt stimulates the average junior high school student to gape in wonder and awe.\u00b7 Why in the world would the leader of this unruly zoo seek to destroy all the humans?  There are no electronical or other mechanical assets to assist them in their daily living.  It seems they would simply be destroying their own major assets.\u00b7 If the original ancestors of the apes were these chimpanzees contained in the spaceship's cages, where did the gorillas and the orangutans come from?\u00b7 If as Mark Wahlberg states in the spaceship that the nuclear power of the ship lasts for thousands of years, why is it that it is only good for one thrust to knock out the ape's attack?  If that was indeed a blast from the ship's engines, it would surely have fried all the chimps to a crisp, not merely knock them out so they could regain consciousness all at once to resume the attack.\u00b7 This story has been used so many times and in so many forms that it defies all descriptions of triteness and predictability.  I cannot imagine any writer worth his salt turning out such dribble unless severely brain-damaged, high on drugs or alcohol, or simply senile.  I further question the inaction of the director Tim Burton when presented with such nonsense.  Does he believe all audiences are retarded?  Perhaps so.\nIn any event, I've spent far too much of my valuable time with this poor excuse for entertainment.  If Hollywood continues to turn out such poor excuses for amusement, we are doomed as the world leader in the entertainment industry",

The story evolves around a space mission that goes wrong when a space pilot is transported into the future to a place where human beings are ruled by the apes.  The dilemma for the pilot is simple in that he wants to get back to his original era but to do so he must put his faith in those he knows little about, not least a female ape who has rebelled against the brutal treatment of humans. Wahlberg's performance is a little stilted for my money and the typical gung-ho swashbuckling American hero comes through in trumps but he cares little for the land he leaves behind.  The scenery is superb and the way the apes move and react and indeed look is amazing.  There are a number of sub plots, but the most interesting one evolves around the whole scenario of totalitarian ape rule.  Helena Bonham Carter's performance is excellent and I felt a sense of real urgency about her personal quest.  The film all boils down to the stand off near the end whereby some of the militaristic apes learn the truth about their existence in that they were once controlled by humans.  All in all a good movie that was enjoyable, but could have focused more on the inter-race relations and a little less on the selfish quest of Wahlberg's character to just get the hell out of there!",

The make up was incredible, especially when you take into consideration the massive cast who all needed to be made into apes. i was also impressed with the way the actors who were portraying the ape characters moved and acted like the real animals. also, i was able to put mark wahlberg's over-all annoying behavior when he's off camera  aside, and really enjoy him in this movie. the only thing i didn't really buy was the relationship between mark wahlberg and estela warren, who plays a very hot slave woman, human of course. towards the end of the movie you get the feeling that there is supposed to be a deep meaningful relationship between them, that simply wasn't built up enough. the only other low point was when mark wahlberg kisses the ape woman who has been helping them. this was supposed to be a very sensitive part of the movie, but the audience on hand that day responded with a resounding \"EEEEWWWWWWW!!!\" One of my friends even yelled, \"GO FOR THE BLONDE!\"(Warren) No one laughed at his joke but everyone felt the same way. the best part of this movie was the ending, which i would never give away. but i will say it meets, and nearly outdoes, the original ending. with all of the big summer dissapointments i've seen in the last few months, Planet of the Apes was easily worth the money, do yourself a favor and see it.9/10 stars or if you go by the four star rating: 3 1/2 out of 4",

            "content": "***This review contains spoilers.***  You have been warned.I gave this film a 2 out of 10 which means it wasn't *entirely* bad: some of the make-up was reasonable and the music didn't make me ill.  That's it for the film's redeeming features.As for the awful bits, where do I start?  Let's see:(1) An ultra-politically correct message hangs round this film like a 52,000 ton battleship.  We're supposed to bring away the message 'Let's all live together in a nice, warm, and fuzzy multicultural society in which each individual has his own special little contribution to make, etc, etc'.  If I wanted to hear such a message, I would read the PC rubbish the UK government puts out.  If the apes and humans have to all 'sing from the same hymn sheet', who will determine what the music and words of that hymn are?  Who dictates what is in and what is out in this 'multicultural blending'? Living in so-called harmony is *NOT* some 'intuitive, natural' thing -- someone is going to lead, lots of someones are going to follow and that is just the way things are -- and any film that ignores this is just pushing another insipid 'feel-good' fairy story.(2) I object to the insults to men.  Both the woman scientist who is in charge of the genetically-modified apes on the ship and Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), the woman-ape 'human rights' activist, make comments about men either being insensitive or making women miserable.  It's a sure bet that no such comments would have been allowed if they were to have been made about women.  When is Hollywood going to give up its love affair with feminism? When is it going to see that films that contain such insulting material drive men and women -- and I am a woman -- away?(3) The plot, such as it was is a mish-mash.  This film could have gone the straight-forward science fiction route, or gone down the path of satire, but instead, it is neither one nor the other.  All that happens is that the pilot, Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), goes from one pointless bit of so-called action to another.  The plot is also riddled with illogic. Certainly I don't expect films to be completely logical or even mostly so, but I do expect them to have at least a passing acquaintance with logic. How in the blue blazes did horses get on the planet?  If the apes are so non-technological, how did they get the armour they wear and how do they manage to build houses and other things?  How did the apes even manage to dominate the planet if they are terrified of water?(4) The ending is idiotic.  Yes, I know there are x number of possible explanations for Davidson going back in time to Earth to find an 'Ape' Lincoln statue and a world populated by apes, but so what?  Certainly I don't want a film to tell me everything -- I want to read between the lines -- but I want some lines, just a few, between which to read.  It is clear this 'surprise' ending was just tacked on for the shock effect.    It didn't even shock me, though, it just bored me.(5) The acting was boring, boring, boring.  Does anyone ever bother to portray a character these days, instead of a few traits labelled 'hero' and 'villain'?  The human characters, including Davidson, haven't even the depth and presence of onion skin paper.  The apes are just plain silly, and that includes General Thade (Tim Roth).  So what if the make-up makes the men look like apes of some sort?  It takes acting to make a man into an ape, and acting was clearly beyond anyone in this film.(6) The atmosphere was as bland as low-quality white bread (the type sold so that the masses can always afford something that at least looks bread-like). Part of this is down to the sets, which were surprisingly uninteresting and even minimalist for such a big budget film.  Funny thing is that in the low-budget European films of the sixties and early seventies, the sets, although clearly crude, managed to convey a wonderful sense of time and place.  It is clear that today's sets are just bad money thrown after a lack of imagination.(7) The 'action' sequences were boring.  What I wouldn't give to see a film with the flair for violence that the Spaghetti Westerns had.  If there's a fight, I want to see some blood, some guts, some death and pain.  The fight sequence at the end looked as if the humans and apes were just slugging it out in a Saturday night pub fight, and a nice, mannerly fight at that. Grown chimpanzees are said to be strong enough to rip a human's arm out of its socket.  That would have made a good scene.  And why in the world did Davidson wait until after the apes started recovering from the effects of the explosion to tell the humans to go out kill them?  The whole point of stunning your enemy is so that you can slit his throat while he is helpless. Doesn't anyone know anything about fighting dirty these days?This list isn't comprehensive: I almost certainly have left out other reprehensible bits.  I can't be bothered, however, to make a complete list. Let's face it, this film is a waste of time and money.",

First of all the film moves so quickly and is edited so smoothly that the force of the ruling apes pulses through each frame. Thade, the fierce leader played by Tim Roth, intimidates the viewer and flies through the air to viciously end any who oppose him. I found myself recoiling everytime he took flight to horrify and kill a human. His is a villain I was truly afraid of, which is a first in a long while. The visual style of this film is uncanny, the colors and the tones of each scene and setting a complete feast for the eye. I could spend my life looking at this film and never tire of it. The sets and costumes are absolutely stunning and gorgeous - alot of it looks like it was designed by costume designer Eiko Ishioka (Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) and The Cell). Lisa Marie as Nova was hysterical. Miss Helena Bonham Carter is very pleasing to watch as always, and surprisingly Estella Warren, the blonde beauty, has very, very few lines and a very small part. An unnamed child who tags along has more lines than her. The film's pace is so brisk I thought by the first twenty minutes they were almost halfway through the movie, but then more and more happened and began to unfold. Some of the best discussions about religion, politics and slavery can be found in this film, making such a bold and correct statement about how though species may differ, their ideas that allow them to live due to belief in a higher power are all the same, on this planet or elsewhere. Religion is an invention of higher intelligence, though that's not to say that religion itself is intelligent - in fact it's rather illogical and nonsensical for a \"higher\" species such as ourselves. We consider our species so much \"better\" and \"perfect\" that we assume that if there is, in fact, a God, it made us in its likeness. If you think about it, we have never even entertained the notion that the higher power may in fact be something of a different species, if any at all. No, THAT'S absurd. (Roll of eyes). The action sequences were powerful and well directed, but that goes without saying, seeing as this IS a Tim Burton movie. I rather enjoyed that it wasn't Sleepy Hollow 2. Although that film is genius and Tim Burton's trademark, I'm glad he stretched his creative muscles and ventured into a different territory of filmmaking, at least in its style. Although his films carry a very similar theme - someone lost in a world of absurdity with very few but existing traces of sympathizers and saviors. Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes stands as its own film, and not a remake. It's powerful, philisophical, moving and fierce. It will leave its mark. In me it already has.",

            "content": "Short on substance and long on flashy peripheralia (ie, costumes, art direction, FX) -- which is my typical lament of the past ten years of film history. Mind you, it's NOT A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME, but Marky Mark, er Mark Wahlberg, can't carry the film. Estella Warren needs a few more pounds of collagen in her lips, and Kris Kristofferson's role was a throwaway. On the plus side, the humorous Paul Giamatti got a lotta laughs, and Tim Roth was thoroughly despicable and frightening.Some of Marky's weakness is due to the script changes... the humans can talk. Ok, so then what makes Wahlberg so special to the apes? They don't even comment on his spacesuit. Talking humans is a serious stray from the crux of the Swiftian novel by Pierre Boulle, with its Gulliver's Travels -like reversal of species. Meanwhile the second half of the flick degenerates into a long chase and so-called-epic-sized battle, neither handled well. While the film surpasses the original in costumes and FX, it owes everything to its 1968 precedent. ie, the introduction and exposition of the apes moves much quicker because of our familiarity of the original.\nThe apes themselves are superior to the original in make-up and movement and cultural detail. The ape city is more impressive. But while the specifics of the FX are more impressive than the first, they are nevertheless over-the-top. Even the Foley artists-- every step, every wrinkle of fabric, every thump of the chest is horribly amplified (maybe it was just the damn multiplex whose volume levels were through the roof). In regards to the FX-ridden films of recent years, I was reminded of Laurence Olivier's remark about make-up (which doesn't apply to this film's make-up; it does apply to FX and film-making in general): exagerrate only one detail of a character (the long nose of Richard III, for ex.), otherwise the whole face becomes a meaningless mass of putty -- the performance becomes marred, not enhanced. The same rule applies to FX. Director Burton and most of our FX-crazy film-makers would do well to quit poring over every little technical doo-dad and spend more time on dialogue and plot.Oh, and I can't stand physics-defying FX ... apes that leap 20 feet in the air... apes that aren't vaporized by a horrendous rocket blast but are merely stunned for a few seconds... apes that punch a man so hard he flies 15 feet off the ground (when such a force would decapitate him)... men who survive being knocked 15 feet off the ground and arise to get knocked 15 feet off the ground a second, third, and fourth time (this isn't the mark of the character's heroism; it's the mark of a director's sadism. If he's not sadistic, then he's immaturely fixated on the visuals of slinging a body through space.) The opening segment provides a more plausible explanation, if you demand some kind of logical time-anomaly reason which the first version lacked. But then the time paradox in the closing really falls flat. It seems tacked on for the sake of an obligatory Time-Paradox twist.  And for the obligatory sequel.",

            "review_title": "Damn Dirty Remakes!",
            "content": "Damn dirty remakes!Ooops. Don't call it a remake. Director Tim Burton (Sleepy Hollow) prefers words such as \"reenergizing,\" \"reimagining,\" or \"reinventing.\" He even went so far as to request of Fox Studios that the name of the movie be changed to The Visitor. That request was vetoed, as well as the hot monkey love scene between ape and human that was in the original \"reinventing\" of the 1968 sci-fi classic (which was written by Rod Serling, based upon a much-lauded novel by Pierre Boulle). In this version, Mark Wahlberg (A Perfect Storm) plays the Charlton Heston role, sans loincloth (nope, not what you're hoping for ladies -- Marky-Mark insisted on being fully clothed from head to toe here). He's Leo Davidson, an astronaut who crash-lands on the mysterious, dangerous planet inhabited and ruled with an iron paw by intelligent apes. Helena Bonham-Carter (Fight Club) plays Ari, the \"human rights activist\" type chimp who risks her life to help the astronaut, and buxom blonde Estella Warren (Driven) completes the strange, almost love triangle. Tim Roth (Lucky Numbers), who excels in playing the villain, goes bananas here with furry malice as the militant human-hater, Thade. I'm reluctant to use the word disappointment here (I'm sure Burton could help me come up with a more imaginative one), and I wouldn't were this not a Tim Burton Film. I hold him to a higher standard than I do most other directors, and I was expecting to see his quirky stamp all over this movie. Unfortunately, it wasn't there. The landscapes and overall look of the film are relatively Burtonesque (thanks to his Sleepy Hollow production designer, Rick Heinrichs and the excellent cinematographer Philippe Rousselot, who is a first-timer to the Burton camp). But the feel of the movie, the heart of it, was not what I have come to expect from Burton. Had this version of Planet of the Apes come out by any other director, I would have judged it less harshly. The ape makeup, aside from the too-glamorous females, is expertly done by Rick Baker, who is no stranger to the celluloid simian. He did the makeup effects for Gorillas in the Mist and Mighty Joe Young. I predict he'll be at least nominated for an Academy Award for his work on Planet of the Apes. The atmosphere of this film is darkly fantastic -- from the makeup, to Danny Elfman's score, to Heinrichs' sets -- it's just too bad the atmosphere does nothing more than shroud a pretty standard story and stock characters. There was some cheesy dialog and tired stunts (for example, a young boy who insists on fighting against the ape army is pinned beneath his horse -- for no apparent reason -- as the enemy closes in upon him. Don't even bother wondering how horses evolved on the planet from the original stock of apes and humans.). Don't get me wrong: Planet of the Apes is definitely a worthy popcorn flick, and will surely be one of this summer's biggest blockbusters. The money is all up there on the screen (Burton wriggles out of saying just how much by stating it cost \"More than X-Men, less than Titanic\"). There's great action and super-exciting chases and battle scenes, and the actors are fine despite the fact their characters are pretty one-dimensional (the most fully-realized character is Bonham-Carter's, though her Cosmo-ape looks threw me off a bit). Perhaps the most engaging roles are the cameos: Lisa Marie is the sexy chimp trophy-wife of an orangutan senator, and Charlton Heston makes a memorable appearance saying the word \"damn\" as only he can, and holding a gun. Overall, I recommend Planet of the Apes for fun. Just don't expect anything more than a remake (sorry, Tim).",

            "content": "This is a movie weighted with the planet-sized immensity of the original series of Ape films, which I grew up on. All part of an education in a time, the '70s, where men could be reflected in evolved apes, their penchant for cruelty and misunderstanding, horror and revolt, subjugation, was still poignant. In Tim Burton's film, there's no deeper meaning to the situation, not many today under the age of thirty and living in America have any true idea of the danger of being human, of being the superior creature on the planet, whose drive for self-destruction might just give birth to a new world order, run by man's genetic ancestor, the ape.Tim Burton doesn't concern himself with reflecting the human race. He just sets out, along with Tim Roth and Helena Carter, to show just how awesome an intelligent, weapons-using, armored gorilla is. Also, there's an entire Ape psychology to go along with the advancements, the 'human' qualities. Apes explode in frenzies of blurred animal movment when startled, they smell at one another to perceive lies or fear, they use touch as a constant reminder of their closeness, just as they did when they didn't use tongues or swords as weapons.So for your money, you get a bunch of stiff, annoying 'humans', all of whom speak perfect English (a plotless point, since in the original film humans were animals, speechless--here, despite being subjugated for thousands of years, humans talk but don't say anything at all, no different than they do today, when the fact is these humans living as squalid jungle rats  should have devolved over time to about idiot level, about the same as your average high schooler, say) and its obvious that Burton could give a hoot about any of the human characters outside the hero Davison, an astronaut who falls from the sky and becomes a messiah. All the rest of the humans squeak protest and get crushed by Apes. And good riddance, because it's the Apes that the movie is about. How cool is it to be able to jump twelve feet in the air, use your feet as hands, and be stronger than three or four big strong men, with the fighting ferocity of a primal beast? That's why Burton made this flick.Tim Roth also gives probably his best performance, as zealous military commander Thade trying to hide the truth of the Ape Planet's origin. Helena Carter's Ari simply is the sexiest woman with facial hair and chimp hands you will ever see. And there is the fantastic ending.For me, the ending 'shock' works like I wouldn't have thought it would. Fact is, the story behind the ending, the implications, the actual love and appreciation shown for Rod Serling's 1968 script, is what makes it work. And sequels can be made, just like in the 70s, because it is the APES' story, just like it always was. If I'd seen this movie when I was a kid, I'd be loping on all fours like a charging gorilla or jumping out of trees and off furniture for weeks, all while emulating Thade's savage up-from-under glare. What Burton does is make me remember how great I thought Cornelius and Dr. Zeus was when I was an ankle-biter. Apes ruled then, and they rule now.",

The actors in this debacle were one dimensional, at best, with the most believable character being that of Pericles.  There was little if any development of the characters and there was no  hint of the messages found in the original.The worst part of all of this is that the altered ending of the movie opens up the opportunity for a sequel.

            "content": "Tim Burton turned out to be the right man for the job of remaking a cult classic. Casting Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth as the lead chimps allowed for Oscar-caliber performances, though I doubt the Academy will award a sci-fi remake (lol). Moreover, Tim Roth is sort of reminiscent of Roddy McDowell while Mark Wahlberg is the same of Charlton Heston (who appears as Thade's father, a cameo in the tradition of casting the original players of a franchise). Moreover, Paul Giamatti's orang utan character Limbo, a slave-trader, plays well to the crowd as an excellent source of comic relief.The origin of the apes and the movie's exposition gel well, despite the downpour of negativity from the so-called critics. Hints to the origin pop up in the exposition with such examples as the female scientist announcing a role that the pivotal chimp character, Pericles, is to undertake (I'll keep that role hush-hush).As for the setting, die-hard cult fans of the original films will not be disappointed. While the film is being marketed as happening on another planet rather than a post-apocalyptic Earth, there is a scene in the movie that plays to the original. In other words, Burton didn't mess much with his adaptation, only changing minor details as he had done with \"Batman\" in 1989.Finally, for those cynics who like to pass science-fiction off as superficial, this movie offers up a taste of abolition, reversing the roles of \"dominant\" and \"submissive,\" much like what was done in the film \"White Man's Burden,\" starring John Travolta as a white inferior to a rich Harry Bellafonti. It even shows how children are affected by slavery, in ways such as Limbo giving a human child to Thade's little daughter because she wanted a pet.",

These comments, however, are not directed at the movie, but at the posters who complain about illogical and inconsistent events in the movie.  Some of these are valid such as the engine of the USAF ship being operational years after it crashed. Sure nuclear powered engines can last for hundreds of thousands of years, however, everything else around it would have decayed (circuitry, wires, etc).  It's a minor problem, however.  The other \"problems\" can be explained I believe though. SPOILERS AKERT(1) I'll begin with the \"origin of the apes\" point first.  Clearly, the apes (chimps, orangs, gibbons, gorillas) on the planet Leo crashed landed on were not descended from Leo's chimp.  They were descended from the apes which were on the USAF ship.  After the crash of the USAF ship, the apes (being genetically engineered to be smarter than normal) ran amok and took over. \n(2) The second point is about the time gap between the sending of the mayday message by Leo in the future and its reception in the past by his crew.  Now for those of you who were not paying attention, there is a point in the movie where the USAF ship receives a message emanating from the time warp. It was sent by the captain of the ship, only he appears much, much older. Clearly, it was sent from the future.  It's a time warp folks!!!!(3) The third and final point has to do with the conclusion.  I have to admit, it was a bit contrived, but like the previous 2 points, I think I can come up with an explanation. The only one I can come up with is that Thade somehow regained control on the ape planet and used perhaps Leo's crashed pod or salvaged pods from the USAF ship, went through the time warp back into Earth's past and conquered the Earthlings.  Yeah, I know -- it's a stretch.  I can't wait for its elucidation in the sequel, and you know that was a classic sequel setup.",

Ari falling for Leo.  Daena falling for Leo.  Leo falling for....well....I dunno.  Leo trying to get away.  Leo realizing he has to help his fellow humans.  The humans believing Leo and realizing they can fight the apes.  The apes in the beginning are bickering over whether or not to kill off humans, while Thade and his armies are trying to kill the humans.  Attar in the end, of course, suddenly changes his mind.  Also, there's this underlying story of how the apes got there.  Oh yeah, and somewhere in the beginning, there must have been something going on with Thade and Ari.  I've left out some other aspects of this flick, but you get the point.  The plot had too much going on for a two-hour movie.  When there are too many things going on, i.e. too many aspects, there's not enough time to develop the these individual aspects, and that's when things start getting cheesy.  Daena lovingly placing her hand on Leo's face after saying virtually nothing to him throughout the movie is one such example.----SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT, DO NOT READ ON UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!--- Leo kissing Ari after the battle is yet another such example of cheesiness that occurred from lack of development.  Just think, entire movies have been spent developing the formation of love between two people (When Harry Met Sally), yet we are somehow expected to appreciate it when it abruptly happens in Planet of the Apes?  It was much, much more cheesy when Daena kissed Leo.This movie was sloppy.  Worse than Pearl Harbor, worse than a lot of movies I've seen.

            "content": "I'll state right off that this is a prime example of the burning backlash that resonated after this film's release: The Oscar for Best Makeup went to A Beautiful Mind. Apes wasn't even nominated!!! A SPECIAL Oscar was created for the original!!!And that's a problem. The costuming and, especially makeup, in the 2001 Apes is absolutely marvelous. But people nowadays just seem to despise the film, and Burton himself for having directed it. But this is not deserved, although I'll express my problems with it.The story in a nutshell resembles the original: A lone astronaut crashes on a planet ruled by talking apes, and must survive their prejudice against him. But whereas the original had a deeply philisophical plot and dialogue to provoke thought, the 2001 remake is little more than a glamorized chase scene, running too long.I believe Mark Whalberg is a fine actor, evidenced in films like Boogie Nights and the Yards. But here as main character Leo Davidson, he has little to do besides look awed and run away. Literally. There are some lines here and there suggesting what could have been deeper thoughts, but for the most part it's just plot city: React to the apes, run from them, find shelter, rally to defeat said apes. And the worst part is that the rest of the human characters are a mixed bag of nobodies, equivalent to what I call the \"Shirts\" of Star Trek lore. You know them, they're the extras who get killed defending the heroes whose names we actually know. Giving the humans the ability to speak does nothing more than hand them the chance to rebel more vocally. There's no explanation for why they can speak, and it doesn't really matter that they can. And worse, the fact that the apes are used to human speech takes away from one of the most powerful moments and subsequent scenes of the superior original, which of course is where Chuck Heston speaks for the first time.That does remind me of the fact that although there are a few too many silly puns (as with the original as well, to be fair), the opportunity to reference the original is met successfully too. Heston's famous line is mirrored by an ape this time, as is his famous last line from the first film. In fact Heston himself appears in a role built in irony: Not only does he play an ape this time around, but he also condemns the evil capacity of a gun, which must have made some of his NRA pals a little miffed.Aside from some fun moments like that, the movie's redeemable aspect is, of course, the apes themselves. Using the aforementioned excellent makeup, the actors in ape costume can now emote with the best of them. They snarl, sneer, smile, and speak mostly clearly. No more muffled sounds coming from the almost duck bill appliances that the 60's actors had to work with. The apes MOVE like apes too, loping about, running on all fours, using their feet to hold things. If the movie focused more on them and far, far less on the throwaway humans, the movie would have been much more enjoyable.\nWhat I did like, or rather love about the film, was Tim Roth. I saw the film in the theater multiple times, directly due to Roth's portrayal of the cruel main ape, General Thade. This character absolutely lit up the screen when he was on, delivering lines with the cruel ferocity and impatience of a madman just brimming over with contempt. He has passionate, naziesque hatred of the human race, and makes it no secret that he longs to exterminate them in any way possible. Roth chews the scenery and loves every minute of it, and it surely makes for the most entertaining part of the film. He swaggers, swings, and essentially becomes the most believable portrayal of a primate that I've ever seen. My favorite scene in the film is when he grabs Whalberg's leg from under him, tripping him onto the floor with a crash without even looking at the human. He then jerks Whalberg up and bends him over his lap, to pry open his mouth and look inside to see if a soul exists. Satisfied that he sees nothing, he pitches Whalberg back onto the floor without looking, as one would do to a piece of wadded paper being tossed aside. It's good, energetic stuff, and gives the film a very dark edge that the original didn't quite have.I've established that the film consisted mainly of scenes with Whalberg and other humans running, escaping, and otherwise walking away from the ape city and any other real interest. Now for the ending..I won't spoil it, but I must say this. The original film had one of the best shock twist ending in history, and was a very tough act to follow. This time around, there are two main twists, none very adequately explained or built up to, and at the end the viewer isn't left with awe but rather a shrug, as he ostensibly thinks \"some of that was cool, but the ending was pretty lame and / or confusing.\" And since Tim Burton said he'd rather jump out of a window than direct another Apes movie, we'll probably never have a follow up.\nThat's sad, considering that this movie WAS entertaining, but not really done right. The apes were very interesting, but at the sake of the expendable human characters. I left feeling as though the raw power and fierceness of the apes was represented, but not enough. And if the movie focused more on them, as I'd said, it would've been more entertaining. But I admit there would've been less story and conflict as well, so what can you do? Now if only General Thade was in it way more....Ahh, yeah.In closing, I found it a fun but disposable film. The original is still better and a way more engaging, thought-provoking film. The 2001 remake is kind of a more short-attention span flash-fest, with some fun stuff here and there but not much more to sustain your interest after a couple viewings. The makeup, costumes and scenery were great, and Tim Roth's General Thade was a blast. But past that, not too much to sustain interest. But I do maintain that it wasn't the horrifying, joke-and-cringe inducing wreck of flames that pop culture might be saying it is. Decide for yourself, but whatever you do don't blame Burton entirely. The man's done some great work, and he honestly tried. Besides, he didn't write the much-rewritten finished script.",

I thought I would dislike it intensely, because that is how I feel about just about everything else that Tim Burton does (Beetlegeuse, Frankenweinie, Legend of Sleepy Hollow). However, it really wasn't that bad. That said, here is what I found lacking:The plot. Pretty ho-hum. Man gets lost, man tries to get found.The hero. Mark Wahlberg just doesn't cut it for me. He is fine as a supporting character, say, as a crewmember. But he doesn't carry this film. I never really cared about him as a person, and he never really did anything that could be called virtuous or admirable (except for the predictable scene where he saves the teenager as the apes attack). His character is shallow and wooden.The make-up & costumes. Sometimes great, as in the gorilla generals and Gen. Thade. The female ape make-up was silly, and the pants suit that Helena Bonham Carter wore through the entire movie made her look like Carol Channing. Estella Warren looked like she had just robbed her costume from Raquel Welch on the set of One Million Years B.C. (although at least Raquel's role had some substance to it). The stunts. More of that silly flying around stuff that seemed to get popular after Hidden Crouching Tiger or whatever it was called came out. Since when do gorillas fly through the air?The ending. My 13-year-old daughter predicted it. And it doesn't even make sense.The sets. Stolen from the Ewok Adventure, apparently.What did I like? The pacing.

They're a great deal more bestial, athletic and...well, ape-like than their 1968 counterparts.  Charlton Heston was threatened by the apes because they had guns.  Mark Wahlberg is threatened by the apes because they are, as one might rightly expect, much more than a physical match for a human.  I did miss the caste system that ruled the simian society in the original, but that probably has more to do with the script overall being much less allegorical than Rod Serling's 1968 screenplay.Mark Wahlberg is an appealing enough hero, though there's not really much of a character to play.  Tim Roth is, as always, a terrific villain and probably the most convincing of any of the apes.",

            "content": "First off let me just say that because of the endless negative reviews I have been reading for the last couple of weeks I went to see tim Burton's \"Planet Of The Apes\" with my expectations lowered. So I was naturally very pleased to have my expectations surpassed by this film. I will say this right off the bat, POTA 2001 is inferior to the original, but who really expected it to be better than that one? Anyway, the film gets off to a great start and continues that way for about the first hour. First we get the basic story setup and the introduction of our hero (a perpetually indifferent Mark Wahlberg) but it doesn't take long for the primates (the real stars of the show) to show up and the action to get going. I can't go any further without mentioning Rick Baker's ape makeup-it's absolutely stunning, as are the actors behind the prosthetics. Tim Roth sneers and growls as Thade, the general with a serious chip on his shoulder. I would actually tense up when this guy would walk onto the screen-I think he reminded me of my dad who, like Thade, was always on edge with his temper. To balance that out is the always lovely and charming Helena Bonham Carter as a \"human rights activist\" (snicker) ape who takes a fancy to Wahlberg's Leo. She is all at once elegant, charming, sympathetic and, inspite of her being a primate, totally sexy! I know the gorgeous Estella Warren makes her film debut here (notice i didn't say \"acting debut\"-she only says about 5 lines!), but when the 2 were on screen together I would always follow Helena Bonham Carter. Yes I was attracted to an ape. For that Carter deserves an Academy Award. Period. Also on board among others are Michael Clark Duncan as a rather intimidating gorilla and the always reliable Paul Giamatti as a slave trader. Anyway, I am rambling-let me get down to the meat of the review. Other merits of the film include fantastic set design and cinematograpy as well as Danny Elfman's thrilling score. And does it deliver the goods with the action? You bet! So here's where the film falls short: TOO MANY HOLE in the script! Glaring holes in both the story and character development make it hard for the viewer to get involved, and I felt like I was in the dark a few times. It seems that certain backstories would be established but never followed up on. Most perplexing is the ending. Sure enough it was a hell of a good ringer (don't worry I am not giving it away), but WHAT HAPPENED!? I consider myself a literate and introspective person (I followed \"Memento\" just fine thank you very much) but this ending just left me confused. Every possible answer I come up with is contradictory to the rest of the film, so I don't know. If anybody thinks they have it figured out, please email meI am welcome to any ideas!! Anyway, I think I have said enough-it's fun to look at and listen to, just don't think to hard because you won;t find anything there. Grade: a weak B or a very solid B-",

Tim Burton's ambitious attempt to remake a dubious classic is certainly not the worst offender of the summer, but it may be the one that wastes the most potential.  In trying to avoid the pitfalls of most remakes, Burton and his scripters have tortured logic to contravene the \"surprise\" ending of the original to the point that their story makes little dramatic or logical sense.  With decent make-up (the lady apes are a little silly-looking), cool sets, and impressive stunt-actor acrobatics, the movie has great visual appeal, but the story veers between an allegory of man's inhumanity to man-like beings and an epic action film without ever managing to be entertaining.  See coincidence stretched once again to the breaking point, lame one-liners that no one laughs at, meaningless characters who serve no dramatic or thematic purpose, all in the service of a story with no real point.  Have to applaud the hilarious scene where perennial NRA pimp Charlton Heston as a dying father ape reveals that the secret family treasure is a hand-gun, and some of the ape cultural touches (loved the way they mounted horses) are really neat, but generally this movie left me feeling like I had wasted over two hours of my life and several points of my IQ.

            "content": "When Pierre Boulle wrote the original book \"The Monkey Planet\", he was mostly known for the classic story \"Bridge Over The River Kwai\".When it was made into a movie in 1968, Charlton Heston ingrained this movie permanently in our minds.  He was also a driving force in the creation of the original, having read the original book and helping to bring it to the attention of the money men in Hollywood and carrying it from original concept to final completion.In fact, the original movie is such a classic, it spawned 4 sequals and 2 TV series (1 live action and one animated).  It's influence was so wide, that when \"Welcome Back Kotter\" premiered on TV, the character Arnold Horshack carried a POTA lunchbox wherever he went.This new version in many ways is both closer to the original book, and also deviates much more.The effects and makeup in this version are spectacular.  Much as the original revolutionized makeup for decades to come, this one will also show it's influence for a long time.  Rather then use computer graphics to create the apes, the use of makeup and appliances is spectacular.Tim Burton did a fantastic job on this movie.  And of course, what is a Tim Burton movie without Danny Elfman doing the musical score.  Combined, they have made a movie that is sure to be a classic for years to come.One of the biggest differences is that the classes of ape are not as seperated as they were in the original.In the original, Chimps all wore green and were scientists.  Gorillas wore black and were military, and Orangutangs wore orange and were clergy/politicians.  In this they are more diverse, and there even seems to be hints of cross-species breeding.  This makes for a much more diverse history, and more potential for both conflict and support.Also, the humans in this version are able to talk, but they strive to hide that fact from the apes.  And as the humans are more human then in the original, the apes are more ape like.  They frequently jump around and climb on things, write with their feet, touch and groom each other, and in general are more like evolved apes should be.The cast is excellent, with both Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa playing excellent roles.  Michael Clarke Duncan is one of the best new actors in the business today, and this role is as far as possible from The Green Mile.Tim Burton added several subtle and not so subtle pokes and images from both the original and contemporary society into the movie.  From Charlton uttering his classic \"Damn them all to hell\" again, to an Orangutang saying the Rodney King line \"Can't we all just get along\", to having another orangutang rub himself with flower petals while upside down, very reminiscant to \"American Beauty\".Of course, the most memorable part of the original movie is the ending. The image of Charlton Heston looking at the wreckage of the Statue Of Liberty is forever burned into our minds.  In much the same way, this ending will also be burned into our minds.  And in many ways, the ending this time is much closer to the original ending as written by Pierre Boulle.I am curious to how they will do a sequal to this movie.  In today's market, everything from American Pie to Wayne's World have sequals.  And this is really the first time that a movie spawned a series of sequals (the 007 movies do not count, since they do not sequal in any order, and were based on a series of books).  So it will be interesting to see if this movie spawns a similar series of sequals.If you loved the original movie, you have to see this one.In addition to Charlton Heston, look for a cameo by Linda Harrison, the actress that played Nova in the original movies.",

I somewhat liked that stuff, but I didn't expect I'd still like the idea now that I'm grown up. But now I finally understand where the storyteller was coming from. He just turned the real world around and made monkeys treat human beings the way human beings treat monkeys. When I was a child I didn't see it like that. I just took it as a story about a planet of apes, but not really like a story somewhat criticizing the way monkeys are treated by us. Pretty cool. And as far as I remember I like the Burton-version more than the old version.",

            "content": "This movie serves its purpose, assuming you go in with the attitude that it's the Apes against the humans.  Tim Burton's imagination makes the new Planet of the Apes a wonder to watch and look at.  As with every Tim Burton film, there are certain things that aren't necessary...I could have taken or left the ending.  But there is plenty to like about this film, more likeable than not.  The only major flaw with the film was casting Mark Wahlberg...and thank the almighty, that he doesn't have enough screen presence for us to even pay attention to what he's saying.  I found myself sort of skipping over Wahlberg's part and paying more attention to the real stars of the movie...those damned dirty apes.  Rick Baker will win an Oscar for his makeup...(you've done your job if the actors are unrecognizable).  General Thade is a villain we can all love to hate and Tim Roth should be proud of the job he did in bringing this character to life.  I was convinced of his genuine evil.  Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Clarke Duncan were almost equally as convincing and I hope to see all 3 of them back in the next movie.Tim Burton has gained my respect.  He surprised me with Sleepy Hollow and has me back on his good list with Planet of the Apes.  His storytelling abilities have improved and he's toned down the \"unbelievable silliness\" factor (IE Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, Any of the Pee Wee movies). Instead of going nuts with how bizarre the characters can be, he redirects his talents into making you FEAR the Apes...as in Sleepy Hollow, you FEAR the Headless Horseman.  So much that you're fascinated with how evil these villains are.There's no need to talk about the genius of Danny Elfman's musical talents. He's been doing it for years and if anyone knows how to make even an average movie come to life, it is Elfman.Kudos to Burton....a well done film, minus Marky Mark.  He'll get it right next time.",

This is an average film--not to good, not too bad--but I would suggest waiting for it to come out on video. The acting of the apes was good, as well as most of the human characters.

Not even the costumes, the very great art direction, the excellent makeup and Danny Elfman's good piece of clear score, can save it.The only possibility of salvation for this movie is wait for that ape to come back and once again rule the government.Robinson Almanzar.",

Fortunately the special effects are perfect... so what you end up with is a lump of coal wrapped in pretty wrapping paper.A waste of potential!",

No.  I went in with a fresh perspective, letting the movie stand on its own.  What a mistake that was.One \u0091plot' point that bothered me was all the people wanting to see the man who defies the apes, since they defy the apes every day by congregating in roving bands of scavengers evading capture.  Also, there is a difference between giving the ending a hanging twist, the sort that requires you to think, and incomprehensible one.  Oh, and the two swiped lines from the original (\"Get your stinking hands off me...\" and \"Damn them...\") had the feeling of being forced into the script.  They just did not flow.Warren is a horrible actress.  Wahlberg was fairly stiff.  Bonham-Carter was a caricature.  Roth was the stereotypical mister-mean-man.  The script was just plain weak and the craft of storytelling was nonexistent.So, I thought I would read the book.  Let's see, the beginning was nothing like the book, the ending had little in common with the book, the middle wasn't really that much like the book.  However, there were talking apes... So, yeah, it was similar in that respect.I am glad I only rented this.  Well, not really.",

I must, however, agree with some of the other reviewers here in that I did not understand the ending!About the ending (MAJOR SPOILER TO FOLLOW): At first I was thinking that something Davidson did somehow changed the past, and hence he returned to Earth to find the apes in charge. But on reflection, Thade's face & name replacing Lincoln's has its own meaning -- not just the apes in charge, but Thade in particular. When and how did Thade come to Earth? Or was the other planet really Earth, too, just in the distant future? I am still confused about this. I would welcome hearing anyone's theories (my e-mail address is shown above). All in all, I think this was a great movie, and very undeserving of all the criticism I'm reading here.

It was a huge relief to discover that Burton's *Apes* -- easily the most entertaining film so far this summer -- is perhaps his most visually and dramatically gripping film ever.  This is despite Mark Wahlberg's woodenly resolute performance, which displays about as much screen charisma as an orangutan's hairbrush.  The apes, however, in their far more pliant makeup, steal the show. Paul Giamatti absolutely steals the film as the conniving human-trader \"Limbo,\" and Tim Roth's General Thade is robustly animalistic.  The apes' habit of leaping in the air in displays of anger owes something to Jane Goodall and something to Hong Kong action flicks -- but wherever it comes from, it adds an extra zest to the simian world. While it doesn't reach the darkly sublime heights of Batman or Edward Scissorhands, *Apes* is Burton's best in some time, and easily steals the show from the series of  stumbling (and expensive) zombies the studios have vomited forth so far this summer.",

First there was Tomb Raider, which was full of dumb cliches.  Then there was A.I, which had too much hype behind it and was too long to keep your interest.  After all the disappointments it's a real relief that the studios can still come up with a good movie. \tTim Burton brings us another blockbuster hit.  This is Burton's best work since Sleepy Hollow.  Burton uses his unique techniques to bring the apes alive for the film.  His artistic expertise that Burton displayed in the making of Planet of the Apes has probably made him one of the most well known directors today.  The mere talent that Burton brings to a film makes him one of the most unique directors of our time. \tMark Wahlberg is wonderful in this film.  He plays Leo Davidson, a United States captain who crash lands on the planet and discovers that the apes rule the planet.  This is a step up for Wahlberg from 1994's Renaissance Man, where he plays Private Tommy Lee Haywood.  This is probably Wahlberg's best film since Boogie Nights. \tTim Roth plays the evil General Thade, general to the ape army.  He despises the human race.  Charlton Heston makes a small cameo appearance as General Thade's Father, the only ape with a gun.  Overall I gave Planet of the Apes a 6.  If you liked this I would suggest renting Sleepy Hollow, Batman, and Edward Scissorhands.",

The first half, the effects, costuming, score, and some of the characters were all very good. The story was interesting and somewhat original and suspenseful up until the midpoint of the film. However, in the second half the film degenerated into a rather derivative, uninspired, Hollywood-ized, feel-good ending. It appears as if THE MATRIX (and XENA) has set a new standard for fight scenes (i.e., unbelievable aerial moves, violence that results in nary a scratch, etc.), which is getting rather tiresome. I'm also disappointed in the obligatory mass-combat scene (granted it is necessary in some films: GLADIATOR, THE PATRIOT, etc., but not in EVERY film). POTA also continues my dislike of children in most science-fiction films. The main human child character in this film was uninteresting and your typical film child character (rebellious and obnoxious) and he gave a stereotypical non-suspense scene during the climatic battle. I was also disappointed at the lack of atmosphere that one would expect from a Tim Burton film.SPOILER: Normally I can figure out any sort of time-loop, paradox thingy that a story has. However, the \"surprise-ending\" in this version of POTA does not seem possible at all, at least not as a consequence of Leo's actions.Because this is a remake, it begs to be compared to the original POTA. Because Burton's version is not set on Earth, it lacks the emotional punch that the 1968 version did and still does. One thing I appreciated was Burton's inclusion of two classic lines from the original version, but with a nice twist.",

            "content": "Perhaps there's no such thing as a bad Tim Burton film, but Planet of the Apes comes perilously close. Visually the make-up is generally impressive \u0096 the overall effect of seeing so many simian humanoids at once is quite overpowering, even if most of the set-design is pretty unimaginative.\nTim Roth's performance as a sort of Richard III ape is perhaps the most memorable \u0096 his strangulated restless manner is reminiscent of the mortally wounded Mr Orange in Reservoir Dogs (although he wasn't a monkey). Bonham Carter is also impressive in a decisive departure from her flowery Merchant Ivory image. Only the make-up lets her down \u0096 her visage seems to have been tampered with in an ultimately futile attempt to make her look her like an attractive ape. This fails. On the other hand, Estella Warren's Daena is far too much like a supermodel to look like a convincing native girl.So why does Planet of the Apes fail? Here are some ideas.1) Why do the humans on the planet speak? In the original film and the novella there was a direct human-apes reversal situation \u0096 the humans could not speak or communicate anymore effectively than monkeys can on Earth. That was why the arrival of Heston's character stirred the waters. Here the humans are clearly ruled over by the apes, but given their supposed \u0091mastery of technology' which the apes lack, there seems no real reason why the apes should be so dominant. Burton seems to be striving for a civil rights parallel. Roth's ape even misquotes the reactionary Senator Barry Goldwater at one point. But this paradox still makes little sense.2) Too much of the dialogue is banal or just stupid. There are a number of signs the film is rushed.3) The \u0091comedy' orang-utan is annoying. 4) Wahlberg is no action hero. He got away with it playing a porn actor but not here. 5) The ending seems to be an attempt to echo that of the novella. Yet that made sense. This one doesn't. It is not clever, just inexplicable. I HEREBY DEFY ANYONE ON THESE PAGES TO EXPLAIN THE ENDING SATISFACTORILY! It's impossible - it's nonsensical.Overall, not a disaster, but highly disappointing.",

I loved the first Planet of the Ape, though i have yet to see the entier series, I was wondering how they were going to pull this off.  I was very suprised.  The angel that they took was better than i expected.  They didn't go for a \"Remake\" of the original, but took some elements of the first one, and gave a Buton-esq spin on things.  WARNING< SPOLIERS:  The direction of not making the planet Earth was much better.  Knowing that nothing could live up to the orginal, they basicly said \"Screw it\" and gave a whole new origin to the Apes.  Mark Walburge's charecter is very belivable. Unlike Chuck Heston's charecter, Walburge's Leo excepts that apes are in control.  He could care less.  All he wants to do is get out, get this monkey, and go home.  The ape in the movie are also presented more human like than that of the original one.  They are more reminisant of people in the mid to late 1800's as where people were into slavery, those who flet it was wrong, began making their voices heard.  Same as with the Apes.  They felt that Humans where inferior, and thus should be slaves, but then there where those who felt that humans should be free and equal.  Tim Burton was an excelent choice for director.  Though Planet of the Apes was an odd movie for him to make (unlike the genius Sleepy Hollow, which he was born to make)  Burton really makes what he has to work with, work.  The dark theme of the  movie is not the usuall \"Gothic\" dark that Burton has in most of his movies (Edward Sisccor hands, Batman 1 and 2, Bettle juice, Sleepy Hollow)  he gives a dark theme that is some what moody and evil.  My only small problem is that they used the great Chuck Heston on liners, only the Apes said them.  But it was Chuck Heston himself that redeliverd his great \"Damn them, Damn them all to hell\" line, but as an APE!!  I recomend it highly.",

            "content": "PLANET OF THE APES: BThe plot of \"Planet of the Apes\" doesn't take much thought. Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) crash lands on a distant planet run by ape people. They're scary, aggresive, and they hate humans. They inprision humans and make them slaves. But, Leo is the macho, egotistical type (a must for these kinds of movies). He breaks out along with the beauty Daena (Estalla Warren) with the help of ape Ari (Helena Bonham Carter). General Thade (Tim Roth, one scary looking dude) quickly finds out about this and doesn't take to it lightly. He gathers his whole army so they go searching for the humans. Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) is humble assitant who is second in command.\nFor about 45 minutes of the movie it wasn't looking so good, because of the character of Leo and his clich\u00e9. The characters were kind of a problem. They were old and tired. Ari posses the most heart, though. Also, a love triangle emerges between Ari, Leo, and Daena.. Th film seems scared, though, to take on the subject of \"inner-species\" dating. It doesn't, until about the last 30 minutes, give us anything we've already seen before. Except great make-up. But the thing about it is, it's a lot of fun. I picked up the problems I listed above, but really didn't care. Tim Burton, personally, is my favorite director. He has yet to make a bad film. He has a certain style that is dark and ominous, Here, it is muddled and doesn't show up until about the last 30 minutes. You can sense it's there but it doesn't show up  until then.\n\"Planet\" has one of the greatest endings of the year, which is the high point of the movie. It's also got some other neat twists in it along the way. So, despite it's many problem, \"Planet\" is an enjoyable, often funny, often scary, summer movie.Note: Pay attention to Danny Elfman's tremendous score. He had done most of Burton's films and each score is terrific. I don't feel he gets enough recognition, so I thought I'd mention it.",

Burton really didn't nee that ending to make it good.  it was great by itself. USAF space station Oberon is doing experments on geniticly altered monkeys in space.  One day a chimpanzee named Periclese  gose to investigate an elctric magnetic storm and disaperes.

The group is being hunted by the comander of the ape army, Thade (Tim Roth).  They reach the sacred ruins of CALIMA, and have a hugh battle with the ape army. The film had incredible scenery and make-up.  I loved \"Ape City\" (probubly so did everyone else), and all the scenes were the veiwer gets a look at ape civilization.  The action sequences are also outstanding with a whole lot of apes flying through the air.  I also liked that the actors actualy moved and looked liked apes.  Mark Wahlberg's preformance could have been better, but was berible.  The stand-out preformances are realy Tim Roth and Helana Bonham Carter.  Both did exelently in their roles.  Roth is no where. It's all Thade.  This is undoutibly one of Burton's most imaginitive films, but not his best.  I give Planet of the Apes 8/10.",

            "content": "I first became a fan of the \"Planet of the Apes\" saga when I was 12 years old. HBO was showing the original film and I came in on the scene in which Charlton Heston's Taylor was being interrogated in the apes' court. I was hooked from that moment on. I bought all five original films and watched all of them countless times and re-bought them when Fox put out the THX-Widescreen tapeset for the 30th anniversary. What did Apes do for me? Well, to begin with, it made me examine my religion. The end result? I determined I wasn't Christian. It also made me want to be a film director even more. THIS WAS WHAT SCI-FI COULD DO. Even the weakest entry of all, \"Battle for the Planet of the Apes,\" was above standard sci-fi entertainment.So here I am, 22 years old, exploring religion, life, and directing my first ambitious independent film, which is even titled as a small homage to the fourth \"Apes\" film, \"Conquest of Area 52\" (there will be an IMDB entry on it next year sometime). \"Planet of the Apes\" is among my biggest reasons for wanting to make films and it's impacted the way I think as well.I've read the wonderful Pierre Boulle novel (and own the first printing, which I um, borrowed from my high school library) and I will be buying the \"Apes\" TV series on DVD. And of course, I saw Tim Burton's \"reimagining\" of \"Planet\" on opening day.From the beginning, I'm already biased. The original Apes saga was my Bible. To paraphrase, \"Everything I Needed to Know I Learned From Apes.\" Heh-heh. Tim Burton... love the guy. He made \"Ed Wood,\" one of my top ten favorite films. His unique visions and styles have always intrigued me. Admittedly however, Burton normally did not have strong points in plot or character development. His \"Batman\" films were a mixed bag, not showing enough of the psychology of what it meant to be Batman, but they were so visually entrancing that I am still able to watch them on their own merits. In fact, both \"Batman\" and \"Batman Returns\" get an 8.5/10 from me. \"Mars Attacks\" is a joy to watch on the right day, and the same goes with \"Edward Scissorhands\" and \"Beetlejuice.\" By the time he directed \"Sleepy Hollow,\" I felt that Burton had evolved so much as a visual storyteller that he really could not be judged for weak plot or character. That's the way he wants to be as an artist, so let it be.But...This time, he's done \"Planet of the Apes.\" If it were anything else, like say a remake of \"2001\", I could still watch it and not crucify it. No, this new version is not anything worth crucifying. \"Apes 2001\", shall we call it, has the all the Burton standards- plot and character on the back burner, awesome visuals at the forefront. What sets Burton aside from say, the biggest hack of all time Michael \"Pearl Harbor\" Bay, is that while his character drama may not be the most engaging, it's not exactly boring or annoying. It's just SIMPLE. This version plays out like the 1968 version except cut down to the core: an astronaut crashlands on a strange planet, he gets caught, is imprisoned at Ape City, gets away with the help of a lovable chimp, goes into the Forbidden Area, finds out the origin of the apes, and leaves the apes to go home. That last part is the only thing really different in the overall structure, except this time, the film does not end there, and we get an ending which both pays its respects to Boulle's original novel and Franklin Schaffner's original film.There are several references this version makes to the original series. With the Apes army we get a nod to \"Beneath.\" With the love story, er, triangle, there's a similar feel to Zira and Cornelius' plight in \"Escape.\" The look of the astronaut costumes is very similar to those in the first two. And the origin of the apes rings in similar tone to the fourth film, \"Conquest.\"Did I like it? I've only seen it twice, so its a bit hard to say that without going, \"except for this... and that... and this... and that...\" What I liked: the cinematography, the sets (which are never all that real-looking but invoke memories of illustrated children's books, which is a Burton constant), the movement and makeup of the apes (maybe the two most noteworthy things done here), the cameos by Chuck Heston and Linda Harrison (Nova from Apes I & II). I also liked the love triangle between Ari, Leo, and the blonde; this was very humorous. Wahlberg didn't add much depth to a written character already lacking depth, but he certainly had the right expressions for his character. I wouldn't be particularly overjoyed by my stay on the Planet of the Apes either. Helena Bonham-Carter is always good in whatever she does, and her character in this was endearing enough to accept her makeup, which differs greatly from the others. Paul Giamatti's Limbo may be the best character of all, providing the most comic relief. Tim Roth as Thade is brilliant, as are the rest of the key players. I didn't appreciate that the social commentaries were sometimes rather clumsily slapped on; indeed a lot of the time they seemed like desperate attempts by Burton to put SOMETHING in there saying ANYTHING when the script had little to give him (Burton arrived on the project fairly late and had little time to shape the film).Overall, this 2001 version of \"Planet\" is far better than it should have been, given the success it had to live up to. It doesn't hold a candle to the original, and I certainly never expected it to. I'm glad Fox put a commercial artist in charge of it, rather than a commercial hack such as the afore-mentioned Michael Bay or Tony Scott. It may have been more intriguing had Oliver Stone worked on it (Stone was attached several years back).Tim Burton did the near-impossible for me: I didn't want to kill him after watching this. And for an Apes fanatic such as myself, that is saying a heck of a lot. Let's all hope that when Fox greenlights the sequel, they don't hand it over to Joel Schumacher. I'd take Ed Wood's Planet of the Apes over his anyday.I do have one quibble I think is more than worthy of consideration to even a non-Apes fan not familiar with the original series:We know where the Apes come from in \"Apes 2001.\" But why the heck would that space station have HORSES on it?! Sorry, I'm not gonna take the old lame scientific explanation about how life on other planets must be similar. I may be a Darwin enthusiast, but come on. That's stretching it.",

            "content": "*SPOILIERS*I think this movie was re-edited shortly before it's release. I say this because there are two things I've noticed: One, the line in the trailer \"Bring me the space man!\" is omitted. Two, there is not one, but two big plot twists in the film. The first one is cool and works well, the other is HORRIBLE. Burton, if this was your fault, you are an idiot. If it was Fox's fault, all you studio execs are idiots.The similarities between the original and the Burton films are few. There's the forbidden zone, there's a quick cameo of Dr. Zeus (ever so briefly, you have to be looking for him in the background). There's a bigger cameo of Charlton Heston as General Thade's father, also saying the like \"Damn them! Damn them all to hell!\" which brought on cheers in the crowd. There's also the first line between Marky Mark and an ape: \"Get your hand off me you damn dirty human!\" which wasn't received so well.The main plot twist was a good adaptation of the original, and perhaps a bit more realstic. However the second one brought on \"boo's\" from the crowd. People were really p***ed off at it. I won't give it away here, but let's just say that the other 99.9% of the film BARELY makes up for how bad this ending is.Tim Roth as Thade was INCREDIBLE. He stole the show. He was evil incarnate, and I'd watch the movie again just for him (and then I'll walk out of the theater right before the crappy ending).9/10, would have been a 10 but minus 1 for the ending.",

            "content": "The `reimagined' version of this story pays due homage to the 1968 classic (at the time of its release the biggest sci-fi film yet made) while retaining Burton's unique flavor and comic book atmosphere.  But comparing this to the original is like comparing Li'l Debbie snacks to Hostess-a little more style but a lot less tasty saturated fat.  Wahlberg stars as Air Force cadet Leo Davidson, stranded on a strange planet after flying recklessly into a cosmic anomaly (I believe the proper sci-fi CYA term is `a rift in the space-time continuum').  After Davidson finds the planet ruled by simians who keep humans as slaves he escapes from their clutches, finds a few sympathetic monkeys, and sets off across the country to find his ship and get back home.  The group runs into a little trouble finding any crewmates, but what they do find is the truth behind the planet's origins in a finale not nearly as fun or coherent as the original film's surprise ending.Putting plot issues aside for a moment, what you'll like about the film are the ape actors.  Tim Roth hams it up wonderfully as the ruthless ape leader Thade, even if his performance leans a little too heavily on the snarl and glare department.  Helena Bonham Carter is bewitching as Ari, an upper-class liberal ape who even manages to flirt convincingly with Davidson on their journey together. Paul Giamatti is actually funny as the orangutan slave-trader Limbo, rather than the usual obnoxious comic relief fare.  And Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa are excellent as Attar and Krull, two old war comrades who have now found themselves on opposite sides of the battlefield.  Unfortunately, the human counterparts in the film are much less impressive.  Kris Kristofferson steps in and out, stopping briefly to perhaps pick up his paycheck.  Estella Warren may as well not be there at all as her role seems to be defined as merely a pretty face among monkeys. But the most disappointing role by far is Wahlberg's, who in the past has been at least charming, but remains wooden throughout this feature.  For someone billed as the hero it's a bit off-putting that his entire focus remains on getting back to earth-in the end he spends about two minutes being noble before blundering off into the weakest `shock ending' I've seen in a film since Fight Club.But even with feeble lead performances and plot holes bigger than a baboons hot red ass we still get a few kicks out of the story.  Burton also isn't afraid to pull a couple of one-liners coupled with a Charlton Heston cameo that will set fans of the original laughing out loud in the theater.  And while POTA 2001 is not going to impress any die-hard fans of the first version, this might not be a problem-chances are, many of the young audiences watching today (sadly) never got around to seeing the forerunner for comparison.",

The performances by those wearing it is phenomenal.  Tim Roth may be one of the most engaging FX aided villains ever as General Thade.  The story isn't too complicated, nor is it nonexistant as we have come to expect from this summer's crop.  It lacks the predictability that makes so many FX laden movies fall on their face.  This is a movie that will be mixed with critics, mixed with fans of the original (this strays a lot from the classic's elements), extremely popular with young audiences, and worth everyone's dollar at the box office.

Thus, it is worth to be seen even by die-hard fans of the original movies.Mark Wahlberg can never match the quality of Charlton Heston, and was probably not a good choice, but the Apes are even more realistic and differentiated than in the old movies, as far as their characters are concerned.

Another great addition was casting Mark Wahlberg as the leading character Leo Davidson and Helena Bonham Carter as the ape, Ari who assists him to escape the ape village along with her bodyguard.

Put simply, it's because Hollywood has run out of ideas. Why waste effort trying to create something new when it can simply rehash superb older movies and create garbage.For all you people out there who've never seen the original I urge you to. It's a wonderful and powerful film with a truly exciting and surprising ending, which if you don't know will come as a startling shock.I saw this 2001 abomination when it first opened I was hoping that perhaps Burton might be able to do something with it - sadly, Burton did. He took a fantastic film and turned it into a turkey, filling it with tedium, nonsense, overblown effects and Walhberg. It's so obviously a film made by committee - 'we can't have the humans silent! We need a sexy, strong female freedom fighter, we need massive war! We need sexy female apes! And we need to out-shock the original film's ending with an ending so shocking, the audience will leave their seats shocked by the shocking revelation of it all!' Boy, was I shocked.There's so much wrong with this film I'm not going to even try.Don't waste your time with this, don't waste your money.It was shown on TV recently and I thought I'd give it another go and work out when it goes off the rails. Actually it's not difficult to spot. It's happens just after the main credits have finished rolling.I'm surprised the entire film isn't just listed in the goof list.Goof - the entire film.Avoid and save a precious couple of hours of your life. Because when you're lying on your death bed wishing you had a few more hours of life left, you're gonna wish you hadn't wasted them with this trash. I know I am.",

            "content": "Tim Burton is obviously a B-Movie fanatic.  I bet he has Roger Corman's entire collection.  Why else would he make a good film about a terrible filmmaker (Ed Wood)?  Why else would he make his own B-movie contribution (Mars Attacks), and why else would he remake the most famous B-movie EVER? \nWell I will say one thing; Burton is true to the genre.  What we have with Planet of the Apes is a somewhat diverting, overbudgeted, ridiculously scripted and acted movie.  However the worst part of this movie is not anything inside the movie.  It was the promotion.  This movie looked like a serious sci-fi attempt to succeed where the old version ridiculously (and entertaingly) failed.  But Tim Burton is unfortunately too true to the original.  Sure the make-up and special effects were cool, but there was nothing truly spectacular.  There were no moments where the audience was left in awe.  The battle sequences were huge disappointments and there was no real conflict set up anywhere.  It seemed that the screenwriters tried too hard not to let the movie drag and subsequently there was no tension or catharsis at the end.  The enormous cast is given criminally little to do.  Especially Tim Roth.  Yes the same Tim Roth that a few years ago created the deliciously evil Archibald Cunningham in Rob Roy is wasted.  His character Thane does nothing but snarl, growl, and bare his teeth.  There are attempts to make him human, but the script keeps the character so flat that the audience doesn't hate him, they just think he is annoying.  Luckily Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Paul Giamatti are all given a little more to do, but none of them are really compelling.  As for Whalburg, I can't find a thing to say about him, which means he did his job, but he didn't necessarily shine.  So the characters are flat, there is no dramatic tension and no catharsis, save at the very end when you find yourself laughing hysterically at how incredibly bad this movie is.  And then you realize that Burton is laughing too.  He meant the movie to be bad.  his tongue is planted firmly in his cheek.  And then you think maybe just maybe it's not so bad at all.\nBut while this movie succeds in being good by being bad, it falls way short of greatness.  You may be entertained, but I guarantee you will be disappointed.  5/10",

After all wasn't this the man who had brought us Edward Scissorhands, Sleep Hollow and BeetleJuice.But after seeing the film all I can say is stick to gothic horror Tim. It doesn't engage at any a level, its not exciting, not at all interesting, predictable and worst of all the shock ending makes no real sense. It does look 'authentic' and the make-up was first class with Tim Roth and Helen Bonham Carter doing their best to kick some life in a hack script.

Similarly the comedy seems wedged in, rather than forming an integral part of the story, as it does in the likes of Mars Attacks or Ed Wood.It is really only the performance of Tim Roth that redeems this picture. He has never really had a reputation for being a physical actor but here he shows himself to be up with the Oldmans and the Nicholsons.

Now since I am only a thirteen year old boy I have not seen the original but the person I saw this with says that they are incredibly different and it is hard to compare this and the 1968 version. When I heard a few years ago that they are making a remake for Planet of the Apes  i didn't think that it was going to be very good and I already knew it would be very hard to make with just the apes and at the end there is over a couple hundred apes. They had put in an extrordinary amount just when they had put the names up at the beginning. Although it is a good movie it is also confusing at the end.

In short, I wonder why this movie has been made at all. There was an older -better- one already. Why had this one been added? Of course, special effects are better now, but that is no reason for a new version. The makers did not use the challenge to give the movie the tension and suspense it really needs. They did add some -misplaced- humor, which really almost makes the film a kind of cartoon.Where is the time when SF films were full of suspense? \"Alien\" is an example, although that one has a bit too much of suspense. But was Tim Burton not able to make something better of it? In that case he should restrict himself to animated movies, like \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", which was brilliant.",

Mark Walhberg was not the cause of this movie to stink, nor was it the acting in general.  I liked the acting and the special effects.  However, the story and script should never had made it past the producers.  In fact, I am surprised the ink in the pen wanted to write it out.  This whole story does nothing but tarnish the original movies good name.  I literally, as soon as I left the cinema went and rented the original Planet of the Apes to wash the bad taste this one left in my mouth.Let's compare the new movie to the old;Actors: Charlton Heston & Mark WalhbergWhile Hestons brand of acting may not appeal to all, it IS brilliant acting. Mark Walhberg is an up and coming star, this is true, but for him to rise to the level that Heston sits upon, Mark is going to have to start looking for some seriously good scripts and take some more acting lessons, maybe even from Heston himself.  ADVANTAGE: OriginalSupporting Ape Cast Old & Supporting Ape Cast NewApes are Apes but there are aspects from both the new and old films that I liked.  The Original movie had Dr.Zira and Dr.Cornelius and who could forget Dr.Zaius, who were all pretty great characters which added a lot of character interaction and development for Hestons character(Taylor). While the new movie has Ari? An Ape with a serious case of the hots for Walhbergs character(Leo).  ADVANTAGE: OriginalSupporting Human Cast Old & Supporting Human Cast NewBased on the fact that the original only had Linda Harrison as Nova, I have to give the advantage for this class to the new movie.  ADVANTAGE: New MovieSpecial Effects:While the old has some fantastic sites where they shot the film, we do have to give the new movie the advantage in the special effects department. The only thing I really did not like where the Gorillas that were leaping distances of 30 or so feet.  Advantage: New MovieStory:Well this is the big kahuna.  The old movie had an amazing script.  The new movie was geared too much towards quick action where the old movie was a lot of character development with enough action to keep it interesting.  After watching the new movie there were definite aspects that I really would have liked to see in the old movie.  Such as the fact that the Apes were using primitive weaponry.  Makes sense.  Also they lived in the trees, again.. makes sense.   I was very dissappointed when the humans in the new movie opened their mouths and could speak perfect english.  WOW, it's actually very  difficult to see, at least in my point of view, how the apes could regard humans, that can speak just as eloquent english as they.. AS SAVAGES. Or question whether or not they have souls??  Hello?!?!  I thought the whole reason they were \"savages\" was because they could not be taught, were stupid and were almost neanderthalic in behavior.  What I saw in the new movie was an excuse to have at least a few more characters for Walhberg to talk to since they did not have the character interacton with the Apes. I liked the idea or Thade.. but he was just a tad bit too insane for my liking, then again, maybe there just wasn't enough character developement for me to like him.  Overall.. ADVANTAGE: Original\nIn short, this movie is a waste of time, don't see it, don't rent it, don't buy it.  I give it 4 thumbs down",

Here goes: (One thing you have to know first, when Mark goes through this storm in space, he thinks he is taken to another planet, when he is really taken to another time on his). If you remember, when he was crash-landing on the \"other planet\" (Earth), his digital calendar was moving the years ahead very quickly.  He was going into the future.  The space-station he came from was pulled in too but not at the same time as him.  The space-station got pulled into a time 1,000's of years before him.  That space-station was carrying many genetically enhanced chimps.  When that station landed (crashed), the apes got out, killed the humans and populated the planet.  Since, Mark was sent to a time ahead of that, the apes had already evolved (genetically enhanced).  So, they evolved.  Remember, this is Earth.  Remember that at the end when Mark locks the General in that room he doesn't kill him.  So, after Mark leaves to go back to what he thinks is his planet, but is really another time, the General escapes and still has his armies so he exterminates the humans.  Mark goes through the time portal and really instead of going to what he thinks is Earth, he goes ahead in time even farther, to where the apes have evolved into a society like ours.  The statue (Abraham Lincoln) is of the General because he saved the planet for the apes (by exterminating the humans).",

Much to my dismay, those days are long gone.\"The Mummy Returns\" was an exercise in overkill.  \"Pearl Harbor\" was a tedious bore.  \"Tomb Raider\" and \"Swordfish\" were both so thoroughly awful they don't even merit discussion.  Spielberg's \"A.I.\" was a pretentious mish-mash of vague concepts.  And you know things are bad when the usually reliable Disney delivers an uninspired dud like \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire.\" Only slightly better were \"The Score\" (buoyed by its actors) and \"Jurassic Park III,\" whose makers were wise enough to give us only 90 minutes of a rapidly tiring novelty.Which brings us to this disgrace.  While I am not a huge fan of the original, I am sure this version is sure to enrage those who are.  The writers of \"Planet of the Apes\" have substituted a series of lame jokes and puns for an actual plot, while subjecting us to a bunch of bland, one-dimensional characters and familiar action sequences.  The incessant screeching and growling of the apes stands as the most annoying redundancy in a film since the depth charges of \"U-571.\"  Only the superb make-up by Rick Baker et al. make this film worthy of a one-time viewing.Finally, some thoughts on the director, Tim Burton.  For the life of me I cannot figure out why so many people adore his work.  Yes, I love \"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,\" and the original \"Batman,\" while no masterpiece, is one of the best comic book movies to date.  But his track record of late is atrocious:  \"Sleepy Hollow\" was awful, and until I saw \"Mars Attacks!\" I never thought I'd see Jack Nicholson give a truly bad performance in a film. I will give \"Beetlejuice\" full marks for comedic value and originality, but \"Edward Scissorhands\" is a cheesy sentimentalist abomination.I find it interesting that \"Ed Wood,\" far and away Burton's best film, is the one least remembered or mentioned by his legions of acolytes.  The talent of which he is capable shines through that film, but it appears he has sacrificed it for the allure of big-budget bombast like \"Planet of the Apes.\"  Chalk Mr. Burton up as another casualty of Hollywood's war on artistic filmmaking.",

Very very bad.I went in expecting a good movie that would live up to the name of the franchise, despite the presence of Burton in the director's chair.I cannot believe a story resembling an early draft and not much more than a comedy sketch in someone else's production would have received final approval and the go-ahead by an entire studio.When it's available on video (DVD), watch this along with the original 1968 Apes.  If you care for nothing more than MTV special effects, maybe you'll come away with a distaste for the original.  But if you value any type of consistency and plausible story, in an implausible world, then the newest Apes movie will leave you wanting a lot more.  Not even Helena Bonham Carter nor Tim Roth, both whom put forth excellent performances, could save this picture.  Paul Giamatti was brilliant - his performance might have been a little too comedic over-all, but again, that was a problem with the writing. His performance was stellar.  Mark Wahlberg has chosen far better roles in the past.Ah, Burton signs his name on another ruined production.  He certainly has earned his over-rated respect directing this type of swiss-cheesed fluff. The picture does nothing to advance the state of cinematography or story telling.  It adds an easily forgettable movie to the Apes line-up.  If nothing else, at least a sequel, with someone else handling direction, doesn't stand much chance of being any worse.POTA-2001 earns a solid (1) rating.  Wahlberg offers a one liner which would sum this picture.  I'm only paraphrasing... \"you shouldn't send apes to do a man's job\" - and that there points to one of the biggest holes in the entire story.  No spoilers though.  Watch it for your own opinion, but do yourselves the favor of going in expecting very little.",

Burton usually provides nice twisted stories and wonderful sceneries. But not this time. There is none of crazy of Mars Attacks, and too little of the moodiness of Batman. None of the skilful storytelling of Sleepy Hollow. The apes are wonderful and quite believable, except for their wild jumps. The ape city is fabulous. But the rest is rather bland. And the story sucks big time! It is too predictable, too simple, just done without feeling. If anyone is surprised at the end, I am amazed.The acting is quite OK, Helene Bonham Carter does a wonderful job as an ape. The crazy ape Thade is a lovely psychotic. But the hero is wooden, and the babe unnecessary. The movie had me twisting in my seat wishing certain scenes would end quickly. The logic at the end, when here can choose between staying and being everybody's hero and have at least one human and one ape girl to enjoy himself with, but instead goes off into space and into a storm is just mad. If I were the guy, I would stay and not risk the storm again; never know where it would put me.The one redeeming quality is the few massed scenes were the ape legions leave their city and the attack at the big battle at the end.

How did the clock in the mini-spacecraft know what year it is? You see the year quickly moving forward - on what signal or date is this based?A. I dunno. But it turned out to be innacurate anyway, as Davidson was actually in the past.\nQ. In the original movie, the humans could not talk. This made it believable that the apes would treat humans like animals, because in our own world, animals do not talk. One of the biggest problems in this remake is that the humans CAN talk. This makes the idea that they would be treated like animals ridiculous. You can bet that if apes could speak English in our world, we probably wouldn't keep them in zoos, animal rights notwithstanding.A. Remember when Americans kept black people as slaves? I beleive they could talk, but it made no difference to their 'masters'.Q. How is that when Capt. Davidson (Wahlberg) lands on the planet, he enters it in the future, but when the main ship crashed on the same planet going after him, it was thousands of years in the PAST? Wouldn't the time be the same for both - after all, they are going through the same space-time distortion?A. The distortion was unstable, so it spat anyone that entered it out at many different points in time. Hence Davidson, the Monkey, and the main ship all entering at different times.\nQ. It's never clearly explained how the chimps mutated to become apes, and intelligent, English speaking apes at that.A. In the film it is mentioned that they were genetically engineered apes. After arriving on the Planet and killing the humans on the ship, thy evolved into English speaking apes.\nQ. How did the apes get from their planet to Earth and replace all the humans? A. The apes never left their planet. There planet was in fact Earth. Davidson landed on Earth in the PAST, therefore affecting the future. Since he didn't kill General Thade, we are meant to assume that after Davidson left to return home, Thade escaped from his captivity, got the apes to join him again and dispatched all the humans. So when Wahlberg returned to Earth in the FUTURE, it was populated by apes.\nAnyway, that's how i understood the movie.",

Those of us who have seen the original and know that it was an intellectually effective movie, should generally be disappointed with this sad re-make.

In fact, take the monkeys of today and put them in the Charleton Heston film 34 years ago and you'd really have something.  I don't want to spoil the film for anyone so I won't, but what is the deal with the end?  Those of you who have seen it know what I'm talking about.  This is a perfect example of poor story telling, from completely undeveloped characters who suddenly play a somewhat surprisingly important role in the protagonists actions, to scenes which have even the most intelligent of critics at a loss (in reference to the end).I gave this movie 6 out of 10 because as I said, the monkeys are cool.  I love Tim Roth and they obviously spent a great deal of time teaching the actors to act as apes.  However, this is never enough to make up for a bad story (those apes evolved awfully fast).

            "content": "\"Planet Of The Apes\" clearly has the \"Tim Burton\" seal on it, but unfortunately shows both imaginative and argumental development voids, which I blame not to bad directing, but to an irregular script, revised and changed thousands of times, due in part to the late entrance of Mr. Burton in the project. However, here I'm going to focus on the most positive points, rather than the negative ones.The Seal I talked before is present as in any of Burton's films. I mainly refer to the conception of the eccentric, delirious, out-of-this-world characters and to the Gothic-romantic, fantastic art direction this films radiates (I don't have to mention previous examples, but Batman, Nightmare and Edward are and will remain in our minds). Danny Elfman gives again the best of himself with a dynamic, at times majestic score where percussion leads.The apes are incredible, they work, they really rock in the show. Not only for Rick Baker's make-up masterpiece (which deserves not the nomination but the Academy Award NOW!), which gives them live and expression unlike 1968's sort of dummies, but because they are credible... and light years far more credible (and even more human) than the film's humans, except for Mr. Whalberg. The script said they had to talk this time.Can anybody tell me if they liked them? If they found their importance to their dialogues? And why Stella Warren hasn't been issued with the \"manikin\" label, as Jake Lloyd was in \"Episode 1\"? The native roles show no interest and slow the rhythm of the movie.Now, returning to the apes, I have to talk about the real showman:Tim Roth as Thade. Exceptional. Histrionic. Aggressive. Cool. Evil portrayed as an ape. As the Ape General, he gets so very deep into the role that you end up thinking Roth, after all his extense and peculiar filmography, has finally turned crazy and really believes he's a monkey free in the stage. He is of the very few actors, along with Gary Oldman, Edward Norton and De Niro, which I consider as chameleons:ready to face any kind of role, however obscure, violent or psychologically strong they are.About the rest, I'm definitely getting in love with Helena Bonham Carter (another example of the ape's astonishing expressivity),and Mark Whalberg is fine as always. I liked his role, in comparison with Heston's in 1968, because he is a pure survivor who wants to go home with his friends and family (he just doesn't fit in that planet), while Charlton arrived there by accident and became a revolutionary hero. .To finish with, about the ending: perfect. I love it. And I love it because 1) It is different, it's of the few which make the viewer's imagination work, so anyone can figure out an explanation to the ending the way they want, 2) Its philosophy, the paradox it represents, which I'm not going to tell, and 3)It is extremely \"Burtonesque\".\"Planet Of The Apes\" reflects again the style of an excellent director, but shows his vulnerability in works he doesn't personally project (remember the initial idea came from James Cameron), in which a studio, and not himself, determines most of the finished work. However, an entertaining film, recommended to any sci-fi lover. And an advice: read the original book by Pierre Boulle for another view of the story... Vote --- 8/10",

Mark Wahlberg's acting, monosyllabic and wooden. Helena Bonham-Carter's acting, a little better than her usual low average. In my native England this movie carries a 12 rating (i.e. suitable for viewers of age 12 and over), which slightly over-estimates the level of intellectual maturity required. A complete absence of plot and character, but a superabundance of noise and violence. Much jumping and gratuitous aggression from the apes, considerable banality from the humans (especially Wahlberg). Given the considerable resources available to Burton we are entitled to something considerably less moronic than this flimsy, catchpenny movie, which cynically exploits brand loyalty and the reputations of director and cast.

It definitely was not what I thought it would be. and what it could have been if not for some painfully obvious flaws. And despite the `re-imaging' it is still inferior to the original 60's version. Simply, it doesn't offer much more than what I've already seen in the trailer.\nOne thing is true: the movie did have some amazing special effects and the makeup. Both of these crews did a phenomenal job. The make-up effects were simply extraordinary, and of course, far better than in the original. But again, with the budget they had, the high expectations from the public and the special effects and make-up wizardry we've already seen in the movies, we already expected it to be great. I have only one complaint: the artists tried to make the female apes too feminine and human-like. Simply put, the make up for the female apes wasn't as convincing as the make up for the males, but no big deal.When I first saw the trailer, I was astounded. However, one thing bothered me ever since then, and it was the human characters-more particularly, their appearance. They were all. too pretty. Handsome. Beautiful. This had always set off an alarm in my head, especially if I have high expectations for a movie, like I had for the Apes. Such smooth and pretty faces are all right in such small TV shows like The Relic Hunter or Xena: Warrior Princess. But in a huge sci-fi motion picture like Apes, I expect some reasonable detail and realism. And as the movie progressed, I found that the apes were more believable than the humans and that's not necessarily a good thing, since I know I should be rooting for the humans, but I just didn't feel any sympathy towards them. The characters seemed shallow, and the only real feelings and emotions that I encountered in the movie, were those of the apes.Imagine: you find yourself in a word that has been turned upside-down, and suddenly you're a slave to the apes. You eat whatever they give you. You sleep whenever you're not needed. You work hard. You wear the same clothes everyday, and you haven't bathed in a very long time, or haven't had the chance to practice any kind of hygiene for that matter. And to add to the list, you're beaten and kept in an atrocious environment. Then, you happen to stumble upon a mirror. how would you think you'd look like? Well, if you happen to be a male, I can almost guarantee that you wouldn't walk around clean-shaven, with a nice, smooth and bright complexion. And if you're a female, your hair won't be nice and curly (even if the curls are natural, they wouldn't look too good), and you would have light traces of lipstick or any kind of makeup. And here's where Tim Burton really disappointed me, because I've always thought of him as a director who pays attention to detail. However, the slaves almost shine for goodness-sake! The only reasonably believable character was Kris Kristofferson's character, but unfortunately, he's not in the movie long.The human clothes are torn, dirty and so on. But notice the `beauty' in this movie: Daena, played by Estella Warren (I'm not really sure if this character was necessary. I rather think not). Yes, her clothes are dirty and ragged, but conveniently crafted as well. It's as though, these slaves had their own fashion designer that was forced to work with dirty scraps of material, but still managed to create a nice little dress with a cut to show cleavage and nicely narrowed in the waist to accentuate her great body, and cut nice and high to show her great legs. Like I said before, that's all great for a little TV show like Xena or Relic Hunter, but here of course, I expected higher quality filmmaking.Mark Wahlberg was good, but he wasn't great. I didn't think he projected his emotions well, because I didn't feel his pain, or shock. To think that Wahlberg's character encounters not just talking apes, but loud, human-size, scary-looking talking apes. If that's not enough to defecate in your own pants, I don't know what is. But Wahlberg's character gets over this realization unusually quickly.The movie was worth seeing just for the apes. Not only were the makeup and costumes terrific, but also the actors underneath it all. Two apes in particular stick in mind: Thade (played by Tim Roth) and Limbo (played by Paul Giamatti) used effectively as a comic relief. Both roles were very convincing and the makeup on these particular apes was incredible. But Thade, the evil General, impressed me the most. I thought it was a great character, superb makeup and phenomenal acting by Tim Roth.\nAnd finally comes the ending. Understandably, there is nothing the writers of this movie, or Tim Burton could have done to overwhelm the ending of the 1968 version-that movie delivered a punch in the gut like few movies have. It was possibly one of the greatest, most powerful endings of all time. But what they have done in this version is simply ridicules. This movie would not have been so bad if not for the last few minutes of the film (which feel incredibly rushed) and a pathetic attempt shock the audience in some new way. I think they failed miserably and I found the ending laughable rather than shocking.Overall, the movie wasn't bad but it was very disappointing. The visuals were great, and so were the apes, but everything else seems to need a lot of work. Too bad-it really could have been something great.",

No one seems to be saying \"Look at me! Look at me!\" (with the exception of Charlton Heston). Helena Bonham Carter and especially Tim Roth give standout performances.Unfortunately, most of the effort that went into making the film is wasted: very little seems to happen and there isn't much suspense. The humans escape from confinement too easily and then have a pretty clear path to their final destination. The explanation for the evolution of a planet of apes is a good one, both surprising and plausible. But then this explanation is quickly followed by a brutal yet lame battle sequence.

As for Ape-raham Lincoln, I hope this isn't the poetic contrivance necessitating Planet of Apes 2 (again).Not all is bleak here... Paul Giamatti is terrific as Limbo, this movie's answer to Oliver Reed's Proximo in Gladiator. I kept wishing the rest of the writing could have had the edge and wit given his character.  But alas, it was not to be.  Tim Roth (Thade) looks and moves the part of the merciless general, but his best dialogue is a cacophony of grunts and screeches. Helena Bonham Carter's beauty cannot be concealed, and she does what she can with the drivel penned for her character, Ari, kind of the Eleanor Roosevelt of Apeville.True, the technical cinematic business of making monkeys out of men has improved since the 1968 original, but there's no comparison with Franklin Schaffner and Rod Serling's collaboration behind the typewriter and the camera.3 out of 10.",

I won't get into the details because, like i said, they are murky at best. This is a two hour effects powerhouse except that when you look under the hood for the engine you realize what's running the show is a bunch of monkeys.  THe movie fell short in too many areas for me and the cool monkey outfits and such could not overcome this.  There were more plot holes than in a slice of Swiss cheese and each and every hole was a dark, endless one. Spinning you deeper into a vast array of nonsense and excuses to get Marki Mark to his next ordeal with the monkeys.  I would only recommend this movie to those who love completely mindless action movies and for big fans of Marky Mark walking around breathing heavy and doing nothing much else.   Other than that i would not recommend this to my worst enemy.  It was a formulaic mess and a shameless attempt at using a classic story that has become part of our culture to make money and make the hollywood big-wigs smile a little wider and their wallets a little fatter. \nKudos to them because as i've read now that the movie grossed 70 million over the weekend.  They made the perfect, mindless fodder that thousands of kids go screaming to the theaters to watch. They'll think the apes are cool and Marky Mark is cool and in the end that's all that matters.  In the end Tim Burton, whom i once cherished as a director, will be regarded as a master mind.  Why?  Perhaps you should look under the hood and ask him yourself as he tosses your oil filter out and makes a bigger mess.  \"Hey Tim!  Why not a 're-imagining' of 2001 next!\"",

The end of the film was confusing since he returns back in time to earth, but finds that it was being run by apes. Also, the script deviated from the original one. Aside from the rather slow, confusing plot, the make-up for the apes was outstanding. The scenery was bare, twisted, dark and sinister. The actors who played the apes walked bent or ran on all fours.

The general consensus is that General Thade found the ship in the swamp and found a way to travel back in time to change the future and make apes rule the earth.  That's fine.  But, here's what I didn't like...  Why was the new 'modern day' Ape Earth EXACTLY like our current modern day earth?  Even if Thade could go back in time and cause some sort of uprising, that doesn't explain why the DC skyline looked exactly the same, down to the bridges, etc..  Why did their police cars look exactly like ours, their sirens sound the same, their clothing look the same, etc., etc.?  Their civilization would have to have some major differences.  It would have been much better if Leo would have landed in a more rural area, and then, perhaps, came across Mount Rushmore with Thade's face on it, or something.  That would have been much more plausible, don't you think?  But to have him land in a densely populated city left too much to be explained.  An ape city that looks exactly like one of our cities just doesn't make sense.Maybe Thade was able to get his hands on those transmissions from different time periods on Earth that they eluded to at the beginning of the movie, which is how he knew to have his memorial look exactly like Lincoln's memorial.  Even if he could have done that, he still wouldn't have lived long enough to make sure 'modern day' Ape Earth would turn out to be exactly like the Earth that Leo was used to.  Oh, well... if there is a sequel, I hope it will be better.  And, while I'm griping... maybe next time we can have some character development???  Is that too much to ask?  I didn't feel even remotely attached to any of the characters.  Leo's emotions were demonstrated by his constant squinting (since when was this considered acting?  All of today's young actors do this), Daena stood on rocks profiling and brooding, Thade had tantrums,  Kris Kristofferson scrunched his face (wait a minute... he does that in all of his films!), Ari slobbered over Leo, etc., etc.  I don't call that character development.  I guess that IS too much to ask these days (another culprit is \"Pearl Harbor\".  Where was the character development there?).

I was expecting to see a movie with political statements about humans and apes co-habiting a planet and the struggle to gain equality as an analogy to animal rights and civil rights struggles in the modern world.  Why I ever expected anything more than what this movie really is, is because I had faith in Tim Burton to remake and give new birth to an older conception.  I feel that the audience was robbed.  Tim Burton has made nothing but a summer blockbuster. Just about everything about this movie was down right horrible.  Why a brilliant actress like Bonham Carter would have signed on to a film like this is inscrutable.  There were points in this movie where it had potential. Perhaps a longer look at the lifestyles of the evolved apes in the city, or even an examination of the scattered human villagers and their daily lives would have proved worthwhile.  This would have given Burton more leverage to work in some of his normally fascinating set designs.  However most of the scenery looks like a 30x30 set of plastic plants.  The make-up of the apes was impressive, but this does not make up for the lack of story-line, development, dialogue or plain ol logic.  Any promising political ideal introduced is later destroyed by unexplained actions of apes or humans. The characters are 2 dimensional. they are clich\u00e9 characteristics of any action movie villain, hero, damsel, and comrade. Although it seems like the actors put in quite an effort with nothing to work with. This movie could have easily been made by the likes of John Mcteirnan or James Cameron. Maybe I have given Tim Burton too much credit, or anticipated way too much out of his capabilities.  Really when you consider it Burton has made very few satisfying films.  Much with the help of Johnny Depp, Ed Wood, Edward Scissorshands,  even Nightmare Before Christmas.  With all of these notable films audiences  have gotten many more disappointments, Mars Attacks, Batman Returns, and now Planet Of The Apes.  Maybe Burton's next effort will heal these open wounds.

I see it as a new interpretation of an already established success.This new version falls short of the original, which lended itself to explanation through some sequels.  Although the ending does leave enough mystery to maybe give birth to a sequel, it is not as straight forward as the original.  Where in the original when we see it we get the idea right away, the ending of POTA 2001, most of us are saying \"What was that?\"I still liked seeing it though.  General Thade is as sinister as sinister could be.  \"Ape can not kill ape\" was definitely not in effect in this movie, where he cold-bloodedly deep-sixes two of his lieutenants in the swamp where they reveal the site of Whalberg's spacecraft crashing.And Charlton Heston's cameo appearance is intriguing as well.  A bigwig of the NRA (in real life) in a movie decrying the evils of the humans and their development of firearms.  I realize this is just a role that Heston is playing, but the irony is glaring to all of us that know Heston's position in the NRA.  Make no mistake, I took this with a grain of salt.The film overall is worth seeing, but taking it within the concept of the original POTA is not the way to see it.  Hopefully this will regenerate an interest to the younger generation to see the original POTA series.

It's about adequate for TV, but only just barely. However, I've seen TV shows better than this movie. So that should say something.

Why not Tim Burton neither ? couldn't simply adopt this book on screen word-by-word ? Why they were trying to change the story radically ? The story in the book is much more entertaining, surprising and significantly deeper in people-ape relations than in 68' and 01' films taken together ! Those who read the book will understand me well - the ending at the book is really shocking ! Of course, that half-destroyed Statue of Liberty at the ending of 68' film is very symbolic , but. I'll prefer not to say about 01' film ending sequence - it is in real Hollywood's style - heh, where can possibly crush your spaceboat - in the field, wood, river or ocean ?  No !!! It will land right before the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. !  WHY ? Simply because this is an american film !So, if you like GREAT science-fiction plots, good acting, directing, music and special effects, then you will like this film. I'm just sorry for that  book's story - filmmakers did a big mistake, when decided to rewrite it.My rating : 8 out of 10. But the 68' film is better anyway.",

He brought a type of originality to film making that was very enjoyable. But in recent years, he's been slipping. And in Planet of the Apes, he seems to have slipped even more. More than ever, his style and creativity are gone. Even in his poorer films, anyone watching could see clearly that it was a Burton film. But after seeing Planet of the Apes, I was tempted to check the credits to make absolutely sure that he had anything to do with the making of this movie. It was terrible. And anyone who has enjoyed this movie has done so for the worst of reasons, namely the visuals, i.e. the ape make-up. These same people defend this new movie by saying that it was not supposed to be a true remake of the original, but I say, so what? If you're going to do a movie that's already been done, at least make an attempt to do something better than the original. Maybe the first movie didn't have supreme special effects, but it is a classic because it was a well written and well directed movie, which this new movie is not. Visuals aren't enough to make a great movie. If all I cared about was realistic looking apes, I'd go to a zoo. ~Christopher",

So much has been learned about the real power wielded by female apes that you'd think the writers could have done better than make the females just mating machines.  Even Helena Bonham Carter's character is barely one iota removed from passive female status.And my nominee for most superfluous character of the year is the teenage human boy on the horse.

Tim Burton truly knows how to put his movies together, in this case hiring amazing actors for their roles, from Tim Roth whose eyes just scream Evil, to Micheal Clark Duncan, who let's face it, already looks somewhat like a Gorilla.  It's the makeup by Rick Baker though, that really makes this movie what it is, Gone are the rubber masks from the classic sixties and seventies films. This is truly state of the art mask techniques, with ape faces that movie with the human faces, from frowns, to smiles. The one part of this movie that I DON'T think was any good, was the ending!!

In addition, choreography of primate movements is entirely believable, a foreign yet familiar fusion of primal simian movement and human barbarism. \nWhere the film begins to show its warts is its inability to follow up on the plot premises it establishes.  Various mentions and trappings of mysticism, which serve the film well, disappear under the relentless pacing. Wahlberg's prophecied astronaut is not significantly charismatic enough nor spiritually aware enough to be the centerpiece of a film that wants badly to do more than simply be another big, dumb action movie but seldom achieves more than those humble lows.And in the end, an error in editing, direction, writing, or all of the above brings a film to lows that I was perfectly will to accept, warts and all.

I like the adrenaline-pumping plot.  The dabbling of humor in it also helps. It dips just enough into the animal-human relations(and relations within the same species) to prevent distorting the plot.

            "content": "CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!! First, I just wanted to say that I haven't yet had the opportunity to see the 1968 version and I'm not one of those people who prefer remakes over originals just because \"the effects are better\".Anyway.. what can I say about this movie? I'll start on the positive side of things. It was very entertaining and seemed to actually have a bit of intelligence behind it, a rare (but welcome) combination in modern Hollywood. The makeup and special effects were absolutely stunning. The apes looked and moved like apes, yet effectively had the human characteristic of being able to distinguish the characters through face recognition. It made a great combination. This great imagery was backed up by impressive looking sets. Watching the two connect together, it was hard to believe these were human actors in ape costumes acting on a studio set, you get the full impression of a real world. The cast were good enough, Mark was convincing as a lost and puzzled human, the rest of the humans were appropriately primitive-like, Carter portrayed the human-sympathising Ari well and.. well Tim Roth as Thade.. he stole the show every time he appeared, his portrayl of the character echoed frustration and anger and his voice was more than appropriate. The film also had a well suited soundtrack, provided by music magic man, Danny Elfman. The direction throughout this movie was also very strong and of the usual Burton quality.Anyway, onto the bad stuff. There were countless plot problems and issues that weren't explained either fully enough or not at all. The apes rode horses.. however, where these horses came from was unexplained. Mark kisses that blonde woman at the end (whose character is so insignificant, her name isn't even worth remembering) even though he only said about three words to her throughout the whole film, I have no idea.. was there supposed to be some sort of love triangle thing going on with Mark, Ari and the blonde? The part near the end with the chimp arriving in his pod was so coincidental that it just seemed completely unbelievable. The apes were scared of water, for some bizarre reason they couldn't swim, even though they are physically superior to humans. The apes are unable to cross water because they can't swim, so why can't they build a boat? I'm sure there were other plot issues too, but those are the only ones that I can remember. Now onto my comment on the ending, which, if you've seen the film is probably the part you've been waiting for. I warn you, if you haven't seen the movie, then do yourself a favour, don't read the paragraph below, it will completely spoil the almost remote chance that the ending will shock you in a positive manner.Three words: what, the, hell? I've questioned myself over and over about how this ending could make any possible sense whatsoever. As Mark's pod landed and he walked up to the Lincoln statue I thought to myself \"Hehe.. it would be funny if we find out that Mark's world is now inhabited by apes.. but then again.. the writers aren't that stupid.. are they?\". I actually felt quite gutted the moment where we saw the statue's face, because the rest of the story (despite the plot problems mentioned) actually made sense. I've since heard lot's of interesting theories, but they've all had some sort of reason for not being correct. The most popular theory was that Thade repairs Leo's space pod and goes back through time to Earth and edits the world. First of all, Leo's pod is underwater and apparently the apes can't swim, so it is unaccessible to Thade. Also, even if Thade could get the pod, the apes don't have the technology to repair it. The pod was only big enough to fit Thade in, how could just one ape make such a difference? Finally, if apes did inhabit Earth instead of humans.. what would be the chance of the apes building a city exactly the same as Washington DC with a Thade memorial looking exactly the same as the Lincoln memorial? Pretty damn slim to say the least.Anyway, final verdict: entertaining, but too many plot problems and an appalling ending. If the movie ended the second that Mark's pod takes off at the end, my overall opinion would have been better, let's just hope a sequel will come our way and remedy all our frustrations about that ending. Rating: 6/10.",

The only way this movie & ending makes any sense is if the planet was earth all alone...Leo is not aware that he traveled in time...AND if he traveled at the end, NOT back to his own time, but into the future again (or as my husband insists into another dimension which would not work because the anomaly was a time warp not a dimensional warp or none of it would have taken place.) Anyway, if you go back in time and make sure that you and all the other humans don't exist, you would then never be born and therefore couldn't go back in time to change anything. If he were on earth the whole time the future aspect works better -- so the readings on the space module were shown rewinding in time in error. Why do that? There is not the remotest chance that someone could go through a time warp and find the exact time he left and get back to his home era and place (hitting it exactly would be like throwing a dart from earth at the stars hoping to hit a specific one.) I can only assume that somehow Thrase got loose, crazier than ever, and finished the task of killing off all the humans. Sorry for any misspelllings.Also why would Washington DC still exist and be the same as it was only with apes instead of humans? How would they even know to put Thrace there except they tore down Lincoln and erected their own statue in his place. The similarities could not have been random. The only other possible explanation of the ending is that there really were no people at all and this astronaut is dreaming the whole thing. I hate that premise...it's a cop out.Also, where was his chimp friend in the module those few days? Past, present, future? Could he have altered the course of evolution somehow? Evolution, as far as we know, takes more than 2000 years anyway...billions of years to develop language and speech, too. So DUH.The movie was fabulous as far as costumes, acting, cinematography but the plot was terrible and awfully unsatisfying ending especially is you were expecting something like the awesome surprise ending at the end of the original Planet of the Apes which was an explanation not something that created total bafflement and left you wondering what the H***?Also, will the message about being humane to humans and apes, why didn't they list the names of the real chimpanzees in the movie on the cast and credits?

Planet of the Apes will always be just campy enough to evoke less than serious empathy for the protagonist plunged into such a freakish society.  In the 2001 version, makeup, special effects, and marvelous acting on the part of the ape actors is the reason to participate.  Tim Roth is captivating.  He is no longer human when the lights go down in the theater.  Helena Bonham Carter is equally intriguing though a bit overzealous in her ape portrayal.  Mark Wahlberg does a nice job but could have used some meaty script material to engage the audience more.  What was the purpose of the human love interest? She ought to have been cut completely.  I see no reason for her in this plot.  Tim Burton's planet is eerie and real enough to let your mind ponder the potential of an ape world.  But then the apes speak and their dialogue is predictable, goofy, and finally disappointing.  With such great talent on board, a great script should not have been too hard to find.  The action was written with plenty of thought and maturity, but when it comes to verbal communication, let's just say a real ape could have written better.",

            "content": "I'll cut right to the chase: This movie was really stupid.  No, worse than stupid, so far beyond stupid I can't even use real words to describe how stupid it was.  It was Uberstupid.The story is no secret.  Even if you've never seen the ultra-cheesed-out original you know that an astronaut lands on a planet inhabited by a bunch of smart monkeys, and doesn't like being pushed around.  As a kid I remember reading the \"Apes\" comic books with the little 45's in the back, and those left an indelible mark on my brain: images of aggressive monkeys dressed in hip 60s-style war togas; atomic bomb-worshipping men; general world destruction.  And of course I remember the evil Dr. Zaius.The new \"re-imagined\" \"Planet of the Apes\" left mental scars as well -- not scary or thought-provoking scars -- just plain old scars, like when you fall off a jungle gym or something.  We begin our uberstupid-ness on a space station somewhere near Saturn, where some scientists/astronauts/people-in-white-clothing are training monkeys for solo space flights.  Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) likes the primates enough but he wants a shot at flying for himself.  When an electromagnetic (aka \"time-travel\") storm comes too close to the station, Leo decides to rescue a monkey that's already been lost in the static.  He (of course) encounters some bright lights and big booms, and ends up crashing on a nearby planet.As soon as he arrives, Leo realizes that things are a little off. He, along with hundreds of other humans, are kept in cages by walking and talking apes who want to trade them or kill them or brand them, or all three.  But Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), the daughter of the Apes' political leader (and who bears an eery resemblance to post-surgical Michael Jackson), doesn't think humans should be abused and caged. Leo convinces her to purchase him from slave-trader Limbo (the hilarious Paul Giamatti) as a house-servant.  Ari also buys Daena (Estelle Warren), the fiesty daughter of Kris Kristofferson who has a thing for Leo and dresses like Raquel Welch in \"One Million Years B.C.\"\nLeo and Daena end up working as caterers at Ari's father's dinner party.  Guests include a snooty orangutan, a vicious gorilla named Colonel Attar (Michael Clark Duncan), and General Thade (Tim Roth), a Danny Devito-like chimpanzee who compensates for his short stature by growling at everything and jumping around a lot.  When Thade's not wheezing like an asthmatic Jack Palance, he's trying to win over Ari, who's not really impressed with his Alpha-Male routine.  She'd rather mate with the heroic yet sensitive spaceman, who returns Ari's longing glances and finds beauty in her ability to write with her feet. But Leo also yearns for Daena for some reason.  An odd interspecies love triangle ensues.Anyway, impatient Leo is anxious to get back to his ship, so he easily escapes from the ape city, taking Daena, Ari, Ari's gorilla bodyguard, and a few other stragglers with him.  They travel over jungle and desert on their way to Calima, an ancient ruin that holds the secrets to the Apes' origins (gee, what could they be?).  When we discover why the place is called \"Calima\" I have to wonder how stupid these apes really are.Thade and his army march to Calima to have it out with that pesky astronaut once and for all, and then some other stuff happens that will either confuse you or disappoint you.  Or both.  Characters seen only briefly until now suddenly take presidence, only to disappear again.The ending is just as random.The monkey actors are generally decent, but are held back from being great by mumbling incoherently beneath rubber masks and waddling around like, well, like monkeys.  The humans ain't that great either. Everyone is this movie just needed to shut up.  Every time someone opened their mouth I rolled my eyes and prayed it wasn't yet another line taken from the original movie thrown into a new and supposedly funny context.I don't know why this ended up being so bad.  Tim Burton is a fabulous director who's brought marvelous vision to the screen before he wasted his time with this disjointed and sloppily-directed project. The \"Planet of the Apes\" story is a microcosm of racism and classism and how opposable thumbs are the coolest by far, that sort of thing. The new movie is a microcosm of stupidity.  It's like that really obnoxious friend we all have that's hyperactive, vain, loud, and a lot less funny than s/he thinks.  The comic book had all but one human lobotomized or mute, leaving that one desperate guy with no other choice but to escape and find his ship again.  The apes were also a lot more scientific and a lot less animalistic, which in itself is quite frightening. But aside from the screeching and howling and Thade's ultra-hip armor, the apes in the new version aren't even all that scary.  There's nothing left to Burton's story but broad strokes of one-dimensional characters who just happen to be in the same place at the same time.  Just when it seems there will be the slightest bit of depth to anything, it vanishes like Charlton Heston's cameo.Grades for \"Planet of the Apes\":action: C plot: D acting: C- special effects: B- overall: D+/C-",

Even worse than Titanic.Plot: Any simpler could not have been possible.  Witholding the interest of the viewer becomes a practical impossibility. Character development:  zilch.  The only character I remotely cared about was Pericles.  ALL other characters were left blank - and oh so boring.Cinematography: Everything occurred in darkness or in confusing shots of mass battles between humans and simians.And was it necessary to hit us over the head continuously, with a VERY heavy hand, with the  fact that \"!!!Hey!!!  These are APES and they act like HUMANS!!!!\" Seems like Burton just couldn't get over it...As for the ending...  What the h?!?  It was nonsensical, non logical, and yet SO predictable.For the record: I fought sleepiness throughout the first half and I had to leave the theater and go for a little walk to wake myself up.  When I returned, about 10 minutes later, I asked my wife \"Did I miss anything?\" Her answer: \"Nope.\"It really saddens me to write such a bad review - I was looking forward to this movie so much!  As it turns out, Burton sank all his budget into costumes and makeup, leaving us with a tasteless-as-cardboard summer slam-fest/FX flick with no redeeming value.Stay away from this one and rent the first three of the original series instead!PS: Zira would have howled with laughter at the sight of the female apes in this one.

Certainly not because Tim Burton has made an un-professional or amateurish movie, but because I cherish Schaffner's film more for sentimental reasons and not least for having a more adventurous feel and a narrative flow (and drive) that is missing here.A circumstance I hardly understand myself as Tim Burton's film is choke-full of great images, noise, action and commotion in general.",

If you liked his earlier material, you ought to love this one.  All of his usual trademarks are here; wild visuals, freaky settings, great music (courtesy of a slightly-more-restrained-than-usual Danny Elfman), and a sense of atmosphere that borrows from Art Deco, old vampire movies, and a few spectacularly bad acid trips.  Of course, his OTHER trademarks are here, too:  Minimal (or No) attention to telling a coherent story, one-dimensional characterizations (usually excepting the main character), and undeveloped themes.  If you think about it, he hasn't really told a solid story with a beginning, middle, and end since \"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\" back in 1985!  If you're a Burton fan (like me), you've overlooked these weaknesses in his earlier gems like \"Edward Scissorhands,\" \"Batman,\" and \"Beetlejuice.\"  And I predict that you'll do so again when you see his newest creation.However, if you're not willing to play ball Burton's way, you'll probably hate this with a passion.  SPOILERS FOLLOW!There are more holes in the plot than there are in every other movie you've ever seen combined. (How did Davidson travel from Saturn to Earth so quickly at the end?  And in a tiny ship that's apparently built for traveling short distances?  And can't possibly have been designed to survive atmospheric entry?  Why did everyone who went through the Magnetic field end up in vastly different time periods, while the Planet was always in the same place in its orbit?  Doesn't it move?  Or does the field move with it?  And where did the horses come from?  Maybe they were on the ship too?  As part of another set of ill-defined experiments?).  But these plot problems didn't bother me any more than the origin of the ice blocks that Edward Scissorhands kept in his castle, or the way that Vicky Vale's camera magically appeared every time she needed it.  As I said, you can either overlook Burton's lack of attention to the plot, or not.Character developments and motivations are all over the place.  Much of the dialogue is cringe-inducing.  The only actors who give memorable performances are in the ape costumes (Tim Roth, Helena Bonham-Carter, Michael Clarke-Duncan, and Paul Giamatti in particular); the human characters seemed to be a distant afterthought, almost as if Burton wanted to make a movie with an all-ape cast, then decided much later that it couldn't work.  Mark Wahlberg, brilliant in \"Boogie Nights\" and \"Three Kings,\" seems out of his element here.  He doesn't exactly do a bad job, he just seems unclear on what his character is supposed to be doing.  The script doesn't even give him a single moment of surprise when he first sees talking apes and the cities they've built.And you'll either love the ending or hate it.  I thought it was great, even if it didn't make much sense.",

I can forgive a few inconsistencies, but eventually they add up, and I'm left with the feeling that the makers just didn't care. I did feel that the movement of the apes was done very well, the slightly sideways walk, and the many gestures, sniffs and twitches were excellent.In the acting front, Tim Roth was excellently psycopathic... but ALL the time. There was no break even when talking to his father which gave the character a very 2-Dimensional, overly aggressive feeling. The romantic feelings of Helena Bonham-Carter towards our dashing hero was puzzling... surely monkeys find us as sexually attractive as we find them?Estella Warrens part was almost painful, her short dress and revealing top, coupled with very few lines made her simply a female to ogle.

The script and story had a few continuity problems (probably  due to editing) yet the film is a great update of the first two movies. I think the original series warts and all is the best. I liked this film and primarily the \" camp by the water sequence\" for the lighting and art direction. The film features an all star costumed cast. In the opening on the space station the name on whalbergs suit reads briefly \"wahlberg\". PLANET OF THE APES main problem was it's \"too quick\" resolution of the conflict and not enough exploration of the FORBIDDEN ZONE. A good film and well told also imaginative on the visuals and TOLKIEN novel visual flair. This is perhaps TIM BURTONS best film. Of note is the genre classic line \"okay guys we only got one shot at this\". The apes were too realistic I am a fan of the original chambers designs...yet these were utterly life like. Of note is the surprise ending in keeping with the 1973-74 animated series and an origianl draft by serling. One more note...the forbidden zone sequences look like some of the story boards for the DEHN scripted sequel. (fascinating)",

            "content": "While retaining some of the source novel's and original picture's themes, Tim Burton's version of Planet of the Apes is a very different movie. The subtext, however, remains largely intact. Religious, social and political themes abound, as a distorted funhouse mirror is held up to our own culture.There are plenty of good performances, notably by actors portraying apes--Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and David Warner. Helena Bonham Carter manages to be oddly appealing and even winsome through the chimp makeup.While my initial reaction was highly favorable, I'm not sure this new film will posit the longevity of the first one. It breaks no new ground to become a classic.It does feature more simian-like behavior. The apes exhibit physical characteristics of their respective species as they move about and react emotionally. The makeup is extraordinary. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should polish up another Oscar award for the brilliant Rick Baker.The movie also seems to be missing a few scenes of motivation or development. I know it was supposed to have been re-edited at the last minute. It would be interesting to view some of the deleted scenes. Here is to hoping for a wealth of bonus material on the DVD.Viewing the 1968 film is not necessary but beneficial to pick up all the intentional references, both in dialogue and situation. Some of them are rather humorous.",

            "content": "This movie is not bad if you don't compare it to the original.  Do not see this movie if you enjoy good acting and a great story.  But if you have the mind of a 12-year-old boy, you'll probably enjoy yourself.  The movie was not as stylized as other Tim Burton movies.  And I use the word movie as opposed to film.Most of the characters in this movie are two dimensional cardboard cut outs. There is not one character who we get to know with any depth.  This is a major flaw of the movie.  Because the audience really doesn't care about what happens to anyone of them.  I suppose that some people would believe that the audience's loyalty it is built in - since the audience is human and we would naturally root for our own kind.However, in the original we get to know Cornelius and Zira and therefore cared about what happened to them, even though they are chimpanzees.It both helps and hurts to have seen the original.  It helps, because you a familiar with the background, you don't need to have things explained to you.  However, it hurts because you will inevitably compare the two works - the 2001 version failing in almost ever respect to a comparison of the first.Watching the two will only make a person realize how little acting and directing talent there is out there today.  Some might say, the past is not better, it was just different.  That would be ridiculous. No objective observer,  looking at the acting talent in the first one, (Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, James Whitmore, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans), could argue that today's version, with its cast, is actually a better movie.  Even the mute Linda Harrison character Nova, said more with her eyes and facial expressions, than the updated Daena (Estella Warren) with all her lines of dialog.  Charlton Heston's death bed scene (as Gen. Thade's father) is about the only real piece of dramatic acting in the whole movie (2001).  Although, to his credit, Paul Giamatti's Limbo character does provide some nice comic relief throughout the 2001 version.In the original, we had political, social and cultural commentary.  Today's version has very little.   When it does attempt to offer some, it is so brief and mealy-mouthed in its delivery that it only serves to weaken the picture.That's the real weakness of this movie.  It doesn't know whether it wants to be gritty and dark or light and campy.  All to often, it falls into the latter category, hurting its otherwise fine production values.  (Quite unlike some other Tim Burton movies). It rates 5 out of 10 stars.",

The script? Sit in a room for five minutes with a couple of friends. Think of a few everyday human situations. Now think of the same situation with an ape in it. Write down what you think would happen, (try and be funny about it) - Once you've written a few pages you'll no doubt no have your own version of the Planet of the Apes script sitting right in front of you. Basically a bunch of quickly thought up ape jokes and a story that had characters with shifting, mis-placed, heavy-handed or non-existent motivation.Some examples of why I didn't like this film? SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT PLOT AND ENDING MENTIONED - Who really cared when the boy fell off his horse in the battle if he lived or died? His arrogance got him there, his inept horse riding got him stuck. Why was he even in the film? - There seemed to be a thinly veiled attempt at satire and role reversal on animal rights. But when the humans get a chance what do they do? Bash ape heads in as the apes did to them. What's the story point - The strong survive? Violence with superior numbers is the answer? A mixed message especially when the sympathetic 'hippy' ape is seen helping the humans fight. - The humans out number the apes 4 to 1 we are told early in the film. In the battle we see humans and apes fighting fairly equally. Whose going to win? Hmmmm...So what was the point of this bit again? - Bonham-Carters sympathetic ape comes across as a bleeding heart hippy. Not very likeable. And not very smart. If only she'd played a more political role against the main bad guy Thede instead of straight out verbal confrontation and an embarrassing attempt at seduction later in the film.\n - It was like a comedy, that wasn't funny. The humour involved taking a human situation, replacing them with an ape, and making them a joke about them using their feet instead of hands (this particular joke was used twice in the film!) - The writers never stopped to question why apes, evolving without human influence, would be playing Basketball in T-shirts? - Sci-Fi films need to create a believable world, no matter how fantastic the setting, in which to tell the story. Way too often I would think 'If they can do this then why don't they do this...' and my mind would wander off. Too many inconsistencies. - The sets looked like sets. - Burton's usual visual eye was not apparent until the battle. - The ending is just stupid. Where did all the helicopters and the fire truck come from. If I'd have laughed at the jokes this would have been the punch line. But I didn't laugh at the jokes and this was an insult. Apes in police hats on motorcycles... I'm hoping it was supposed to be a joke. I just didn't find it funny. END OF SPOILERSFrom the director of 'Mars Attacks' not 'Batman'.

It's great! My second favorite aspect of this film is Tim Roth's wild portrayal of Thade; he delivers quite an inventive homage to great SF villains, all the way back to Ming the Merciless! There are some scenes in which his character is so malevolent that it's spine-tingling.As for the ending (NO SPOILER) - I think it's all intended in fun, with a nod and a wink, not to mention unleashing a spectacular pun upon humanity!

As Hollywood is always on the look out for a safe film based on an old movie/TV show that was much loved (when are they gunna remake Land Of The Giants?) and that is guaranteed to be a hit, it's a wonder it took this long to do a POTA re-make. Bearing in mind the sort of churlish, mind numbing, spirit crushing gruel that Hollywood has become so good at delivering the citizens of the world, POTA (2001) was not all bad.SPOILER AHEAD In a plot sense, there were holes all over the place.1. The Oberon only seemed to have humans and chimps - so where the devil did all the gorillas and orang-otans come from?2. In the year 2029, can it really be easier to train a Chimp to control a pod than automate it some how? I betcha HAL could've controlled it remotely, and that's using late 20th Century technology.3. Why did Attar turn on Thade at the end? He said Thade lied to him, but about what? Also, we are expected to belive that Attar will gruesomely kill his old master, and then suddenly start sprouting Gandhi like dogma about apes and humans living together in harmony. I THINK NOT. General Urko would not have dropped his bundle like this.4. Where did the gorillas develop this fear of water from - current day gorillas are prepared to wade through water.The ending is like something out of a 50's masterpiece. However, a 50's masterpiece would leave the ending alone. I'll be surprised if we don't see a new Planet Of The Apes franchise developing. The sequel will explain how the apes took over earth.

            "content": "I have to admit that this \"re-imagining\" of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment. Specially when taken into consideration that this is a Tim Burton film. He is defenetly one of the most original and, might I say, cool directors Hollywood has produced.I am personally a great fan of his work, but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick, The Planet of the Apes. I really enjoyed the original film. When it first came out people expected just another cheezie 70's science fiction film, but a very surprise anding totally proved that theory wrong. It had indeed a clear cut message. An obvious anti-war message. Fear of the cold war, where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the film-makers. Those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic. Although, the new film, the \"re-making\" or whatever, leaves us with nothing. No message, no ideals behind it. It is just another money-minded summer blockbuster.Visually Tim Burton does not let you down. The dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrific.Obviously that is not enough to keep people intrested in a film. There has to be an exciting plot or storyline. In this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out. The script is very lame and it is full of gaps. It looks like this film had been written in a big hurry. The explanation for why the apes where there, and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the script-writers ignorance.It raised a lot of questions, which had no reasonable answers to.For example; Why did the apes speak English?, why were there other ape-species than chimps on the planet (given that there were only chimps in the space ship that crash-landed on the planet) Where the hell did all of those humans come from? How were a few chimps able to evolve into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years. (I mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man!)And finally, the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb. It was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an  end, then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending. The ending also raises a lot of questions, which I KNOW, don\u00b4t have intelligent answears. Did Theid learn to work the space ship?, which was power-less, and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand?, and, what did he do, breed with all the women? And lets say that that would happen, I higly doubt that history would stay the same, like Washington would be built exactly like it is today! (I mean wouln't there be a huge banana instead of the memorial?)Well, just to say something posative about  the film. Some of the cast was great. Helen Bonham Carter's character was interesting and well-acted, as for Tim Roth as Theid. He was very good, a little exaturated at some points of the film. Michael Clark Duncan  was also fine. I was not happy with Marc Whalberg. He is not much of an actor, and plays here a very macho colour-less character. Very unbielevable and is nothing compared to Hestons character in the original. And the main female character had no reason or place in the film. She was just casted for the looks. Hardly said a word throughout the entire film.Well, I think that in the future when people think about the Planet of the apes, they will think about the original one. The latest will soon be forgotten.",

However, a word of caution \u0096 they are two very different movies.  The original, with its world-weary Heston, moralising anti-nuke plot and the gee-shucks-can't-we-all-just-get-along narrative, plays out like one of the better episodes of Star Trek.  Tim Burton's take on the simian planet is a million miles away (literally) from the Franklin J. Schaffner version, and so we have the action and the hokey chimptalk, but none of the social relevance.  This, quite frankly, damns the film, damns it all to hell and makes it yet another summer blockbuster of running about and shooting at nasty things.However, considered out of the context of the whole Apes saga, this is a damn fine no-brainer popcorn-flick with plenty of action, plot twists, rugged heroes and monkey madness.  Helena Bonham Carter makes a decent chimp, Tim Roth makes a decent psycho-baddie and Mark Wahlberg makes a decent, well, underwear model.  There is enough to keep your average film junkie happy and the movie does not outstay its welcome.\nHollow, but entertaining nonetheless, Planet of the Apes (2001) is not a bad film and is only disappointing when compared with a) the original b) Tim Burton's back catalogue.  It's also a damn sight better than the four sequels and the TV spin-offs.  Come to think of it, The Simpson's Planet of the Apes Musical may not be such a bad idea after all...",

When you see a movie the last thing I hate thinking is how silly, why did the hero do that. Example, After he escapes the ape city then he gets his survival kit from his ship rather than when he crashed. The Holes - If they descended from the original space station and the only animals they had on board were chimpanzees. Where did the horses, gorilla's, orangutans & parrots come from? The worm hole? It was so convenient. I can imagine the scriptwriter, William Broyles saying to himself, \"gee I have painted myself into a corner here, I'll just use the worm hole, nobody knows how they work\".  And worse of all he did a couple of times. Very weak writing, with no understanding of plausible continuity.Finally I could see why they were training chimps to fly the Pods (That incidentally can reach speeds 6 times that of light.

That's just to name a few.  And Burton's \"Planet of the Apes\" is no different.  Deserts, jungles, extravagant makeup and costumes are all stunning in this film.Mark Wahlberg plays the role made famous by Charlton Heston (who has a short cameo that is terrific fun to see).  He is an astronaut who gets more or less stranded on a strange planet where the apes rule and humans are slaves. Wahlberg leads the people to rebellion, rather reluctantly.Unlike the original \"Apes,\" Burton seems content to throw in more action scenes than dialogue to tell the story.  There is very little social commentary really and the main story seems centered on how Helena Bonham Carter, as a loving ape who cares for the humans, helps Wahlberg in his attempts to save the other people from the evil Thade (a terrific Tim Roth). General Thade doesn't want the humans to rise up, because he'll lose his power as a ruler.But this is nothing new, however entertaining.  While the original pushed a few envelopes by raising social issues, some of them relevant today, and providing real characters, this \"Apes\" is mostly for show.  I liked the movie on its own terms, however.  It's enjoyable, looks great and has a twist ending that shows the trademark Burton imagination that we've come to expect.  In short, expect a few sequels.My Rating:  * * * (out of four)",

This turned out to be a loose remake of the 1968 original. It was nice to see Charlton Heston (uncredited) as the iconic Dr. Zaius. Mark Wahlberg did a fine job, as did Helena Bonham Carter. Paul Giamatti's character felt like comic relief to me, slightly out of place, but not unwelcome. It was well made, the acting was good and it kept me interested throughout the movie, but no spectacular 'whoa!' moments. I consider this a fine movie and I would watch it again but I wouldn't purposefully go out of my way to find it. All-in-all, a nice movie for a Saturday afternoon.",

Mark W's character is developed as fairly short-sighted, selfish, and egotistical, and it's his faults the ultimately doom the people/Earth/etc.Some might say that it was Mark W's lack of depth (in that Tom Cruise fashion) rather than true acting that gives the character his two dimensional feel (which works), but I think the actor and director sculpted the character in this fashion with intent.While I don't care much for the other actors (including Heston's cameo, which was foolish, and the model who very Arnold/Terminator like had about 14 words), they didn't entirely detract from one's enjoyment of the film.",

I saw this movie on opening night and when the credits ran, a few of the patrons applauded.  Nothing new for opening night, but when people began to boo and hurl leftover popcorn at those who were clapping...that was new and more entertaining than the movie.Burton made many blunders with this one, oh it had such potential.  Estella Warren's only function in the movie was to be a trophy wife, I think she had all of 2 1/2 lines to deliver.  Marky Mark Wallberg was less than stellar and his character is one that you will root for the crazed apes to kill. Only Tim Roth and Michael Clarke Duncan made this movie worth watching. While Roth's character (General Slade) leaps around like a frog, he is a good villain and Duncan's character (Attar) is enjoyable to watch.Overall, you would be better served to watch \"The Mummy\" all over again, as you will get the same thrills, better acting, and, can you believe it, a better story line.",

Then I read the early reviews coming out of the States and almost didn't go to see it because of the criticism, but I decided to go to make up my own mind.I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised, it was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting. There are a few things that let the plot down and stretch credibility, but then you have to expect that with science fiction movies. Why would they be using monkeys to pilot probes, when even now they have automated ones? Why does the Chimp's pod turn up at that exact minute when it has been missing for thousands of years?? You just have to suspend your dis-belief and go along with the story. If you can do that then you will probably enjoy it. Let's face it, the original doesn't stand up to any degree of scientific analysis either, so why analyse this one?There has been a lot of talk about the endding, to me it made perfect sense, I don't see what all the whining is about. It is obvious that he has gone foward into the future of the same planet, he never went back to Earth. Thade has obviously made a comeback and has lead the apes in a reconquest of the planet, and they have now developed technology (perhaps with the help of the data banks on the ship, now that they know they are there). Simple as that. Why are people getting confused and thinking he went back to earth?? That really would make no sense at all!The only strange thing about the ending, is why oh why didn't he stay with Estella Warren! She wanted him, and he left!! Now that really does stretch credibility!Another interesting thing is that there appear to be several species of apes (Gorillas, Chimps and Orang-Utangs as far as I can tell), and yet they all get along fine and live under the banner 'Ape'. Surely to a Chimp a Gorilla would be as alien as a human! After all humans are a species of ape as well! It seems that this movie is displaying the old human arrogance that there are humans in one catagory, and the whole animal kingdom in the other and that we are the superior. I think it far more likely that each species would hate all the others, just as we see in nature. But that would make the movie far to complicated!",

            "content": "Tim Burton once again unleashes his unique cinematic vision upon the world. PotA is never less than visually spectacular however the plot is underdeveloped and the script weak. It is unfair to compare this film to the 1968 version (but I will), as Burton himself states this as a 'reimagining' rather than a remake - neither film 100% true to it's source material. However it is interesting to compare this film to its predecessor in terms of technological advances and budget. This film suffers, like so many of todays 'blockbusters', from too much finance, too much wizardry and mis-spent funds. Quite apparently almost entirely studio shot the film is lush, the space scenes well realised and the planet rich and green. Studio bound filming, though, also makes the film look small - Ape City seems to contain only five or six houses. Compared to the less technical 1968 film which was stark and devoid of enhancing effects, menacing and desolate and decaying due to majority location shooting.The acting is acceptible given the script, and the majority of ape-make up is very good. Some of is is truly dire, and unconvincing. Helena Bonham Carter's 'Ari' looks like a woman in ape makeup, yet Tim Roth's 'Thade' is very well executed - however neither look or performance are as menacing as PotA '68. Danny Elfman's music, although good, also fails to create tension or mood.HBC has fun with 'Ari' and her obsessiveness and jealousness over Mark Wahlbergs 'Leo Davidson' is funny and sweet. Wahlberg has approx. 5 lines of dialogue, but he could be reading the phone directory for all I care -  he's just wonderful to look at.Semi Spoiler ------------\nThe End. Impossible to recreate the horror of the '68 film, Burton has dispensed with any revelatory thrills and the ending throws up more questions than answers. Obviously gearing up for a sequel one is left with a hollow felling. Just where did Leo go and how long did it take him to get there? Where did he end up and how much further into the future had he been propelled?I found it hard to rationalise but still found the film enjoyable, well paced and visually stunning.\n7/10",

This one wasn't, so the frightening and suspenseful scenes become rather humorous. The plot is very simplistic, but that doesn't keep it from having many holes. The dialogue is either non-existent, pointless, or trying to sound cool and technical when it's not. Poor Estella Warren had about five lines in the whole movie. There are some points in the movie where they try to play some sub-plot drama points, but they do not play them up enough for us to understand their conclusions. The entire film lacks drama altogether. And the ending, namely, from when the fighting showdown starts until the credits, ruined what little the rest of the movie had to offer.Bright points would be the costumes. Not even the action sequences were bright. But costumes were very good. And the human-trading monkey provided some much-needed laughter.My advise is to please not waste your money and time.",

            "content": "Let me start by saying that this remake isn't the original.  It isn't a cold war commentary which has deep and philosophical things to say about man's innate desire to destroy himself.  It doesn't have silly looking ape masks or NRA president Charlton Heston kneeling before the Statue of Liberty yelling \"they blew it up!!!\"  It couldn't have these things because for what it's trying to be in this time, none of the aforementioned details would have meaning.Let's face it folks, 1968 and 2001 by their very nature demand that two entirely different films be made (even if they both happen to be called Planet of the Apes).  As an intelligent, all be it wacky filmmaker, Tim Burton knew when he made the new film for the masses of 2001 that it would be viewed as little more than a mindless summer blockbuster, backed by all the advertising that the Hollywood machine can muster for one of its potential goldmines.  He knew that it wouldn't be considered \"art\" as the first has become since 1968, and he knew that Americans, by and large, don't want to see art at multiplexes during the summer (witness the demise of A.I.)This all considered, it's incredible to me that there is a preponderance of negative reviews for this film on the IMDB.  \"It has no plot.\"  \"It has no good characters.\"  \"It isn't the original.\"  Of course it has a plot! (And don't say the ending made no sense because if you think about it for more than a minute, g-d forbid, it just may)  Of course it has good characters! Who do you think acted below all that (incredible) ape makeup!  BUT, as I have said already, I admit that it isn't the original.Tim Burton should be given a great deal of credit for putting this film together.  He did as good a job as can be done today for a film like this, given our society's need to be perpetually entertained.  The new Planet of the Apes has echos of its predecessor... not too many nor too few.  It is a remake, but it is its own film.  It is neither a masterpiece nor a disaster. If you've seen the original, think of these things when you enter the theater and you'll probably be happy when you leave.  If you haven't seen the original, first of all see it... second of all, see the remake.  It's a worthy update bringing 1968 up to 2001's speed.",

Today, or rather yesterday at this point at 1pm nine friends came over and we watched all 5 original Planet of the Apes movies.  Those movies were complete crap but still entertaining (if not only for the extreme taunting they invoked). As bad as all those movies were this new one is worse. It is quite the repulsive movie and not anything I would pay to see...again.***I plan to go through this whole CRAP movie and explain everything wrong and bad about it...as such there is likely to be many a spoiler contained here in***POSITIVES:1) Great make-up! That's all I gotNEGATIVES:1) The first thing I noticed was that in the year 2029 we are super advanced...we have laser guns and nuclear powered spaceships and super-smart genetically engineered apes.2) The ape society is nearly identical to that of the Romans.  They have a senate and military rule and slavery... and I'm sure there's some kind of crazy combat arena where one referred to, as \"the Spaniard\" will defeat the emperor in combat.3) General Thade is the primary villain. And he is the most annoying and most absolutely evil thing in the world. He is constantly breathing exceptionally loud all the time, even when he sits down to dinner he is loudly breathing. And then there is his complete bloodlust as he kills anyone he can even when it doesn't help him to do so.  For instance he is shown that marki mark (our brave hero) has crash-landed in the forest and he kills the two that told him about it because...I don't know why it doesn't make sense.4) The apes refuse to go into the water at any cost. The movie explains they can't swim, but that doesn't make sense either. Even if apes can't swim (which I assume is the case otherwise there is no reason why they would put it in the movie) I believe that if they were super intelligent apes then they would be quite capable of overcoming such a basic fear of water and would be able to learn through common sense. Unless monkeys are made of lead or something, which they may be, I'm not sure.5) The second bad ape, Attar is his name, is a religious little ape. Religion and blind faith were key components of the original and were actually a nice little commentary on humanity (despite the overall poor quality of the movie), however it plays little to no role in this newer version.  By the end of the movie Attar, who was shown to be quite devout to his beliefs, has renounced his beliefs and with great willingness accepted it.  Which is hardly realistic. If some monkey came down from space and told everyone or anyone that there religion was wrong it would hardly be just accepted.  So that's another wasted point of the movie...in fact at one point the movie specifically points out that the general populace of the apes is not religious at all.6) At one point in the movie a lot of people descend on the spot that marki mark and the funky bunch are at. They go to an area within the forbidden zone and as far as we know nobody has been there since the apes first left the desert it is located in and yet they find it with ease...not just a couple people but a whole horde of people and they all seem to reach this destination no more than a couple minutes or so after marki mark reaches the place. It is peculiar at best and ludicrous as a fact.7) Not one character is developed in any manner in any way what so ever. The closest they come to developing a character is creating some kind of weird monkey-human love triangle, but that was just weird not really even developing the characters.8) The ending battle scene is overall your typical action movie battle scene, except the titanic clashes between the great warriors/leaders of each side are meek at best.  There are two such battles. One is between that Attar guy and another gorilla. The two gorillas simply take turns pinning the other one on the ground and beating on the opponent's chest till he is dead. This battle isn't even fair as Attar has armor and the other does not so clearly the one with armor will not easily die when simply having his armor hit with fists.  Another battle is between marki mark and general Thade. General Thade simply beats the crap out of marki mark...its not even close to a battle its just marki mark getting beaten up. Oh wait that's not true, at one point marki mark gets a gun and starts trying to shoot the ludicrously fast monkey.9) Oh yah I completely forgot about the fact that the monkeys could jump roughly 30 feet in any direction they wished and with complete ease.  They were also frightfully strong, they merely throw humans around as they pleased and that was it. Also in the climactic battle Thade handles most enemies by tossing them away. Yes, he was quite strong and threw them a good ten twenty feet but that will hardly kill a man. I'd be willing to bet that most of the people thrown to the side got up dusted them off and continued the fight.10) There's a lot more that doesn't make sense but I'm tired and this movie is depressing me...(tear) so I shall end with one more11) As for the ending of the movie (which I could only begin to explain how bad it was) I have but two words...

Out the window goes the science-fiction intrigue of theoriginal, in comes a surprise ending... and by \"surprise,\" I, ofcourse, mean \"confusing.\" Burton has essentially done nothingmore than dumb down the classic and make it look better. Whichhe certainly does - the settings, costumes, and make-up work is,as always, spectacular. Like \"Batman\" and \"Sleepy Hollow,\" Burtoncan flawlessly create a world more sinister and eerily realistic thanany original could imagine.

The misty swamps and torch-litforested ape-towns are brilliantly created. The acting is not aproblem, Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are good in theirroles, while Mark Wahlburg is given nothing more to do than flexhis muscles and run around.

            "content": "Redoing a well-known, landmark movie is always, one would imagine, a challenge. Where the original depended so heavily on a surprise ending for its overall impact, the task is heightened to daunting. One would say, perhaps, even impossible.Tim Burton -- whose directing credits include films such as Batman, Beetlejuice and Nightmare Before Christmas -- was always going to produce the goods when it came to dark sets, evil villians and eye-popping special effects. So while he doesn't disappoint there, that alone is not enough.The major problem with this film is the atrocious plot, which is so unlike the original this film can hardly be termed a remake. The screenwriters have changed just about all the important plot elements, characters and events. This perhaps was a necessity, and possibly the only way to approach this task, but it is at the same time unfortunate. Everything in the film seems like an \"alternative\", an idea that may have been dropped in favour of the real thing the first time around.The film suffers from a profound lack of character development, and a 'flatness' of emotion which alienates the audience. Where a Jurassic Park or Star Wars Episode I focus on the special effects to the detriment of character and plot, this film takes this error to its extreme. We are, it seems, to marvel at the special effects so much as be entirely satisfied without any other elements. So much time onscreen is dedicated to celebrating the visuals of the world that Burton has created that we have no opportunity to understand it on any other level. One feels that large chunks of this film were cut and that a Director's Cut is inevitable. Perhaps that will provide the meat that this so desperately needs.To be fair to Burton, he worked with the screenplay he was given, and it is in this that most of the problem lies. The performances are generally good -- although Wahlberg is terrible as the hero -- and Tim Roth is excellent. Perhaps like Batman, Roth is this film's Nicholson, and makes the film worthwhile on his own.And then there's that ending. While I won't describe it for fear of robbing you of the small thrill that it provides, I will say that it is the most tangential and irrelevant ending imaginable. It literally appears to belong to a different film altogether, and is really a trite and blithe attempt to stun the audience the way the first film did. It is remarkable that any experienced director or writer could believe that simply tacking on a disconnected idea at the end of a film could provide any shock whatsoever. The result is a \"Huh?\" where there should be a \"Wow!\".Overall, Planet of the Apes fails in so many ways that remove the special effects and fine actors and a major flop would emerge. The film will no doubt be broadly watched and enjoyed for it's visual elements, but does seem to offer this lesson to all screenwriters and studios out there: if you can't think of how to possibly remake a film, and you're wracking your brains and have to think really, really hard, then please, just don't.",

(i wouldn't argue too much if you said they blew it when pod appeared).  they should have played the religious / creation angle up more, then had attar revolt against thade when he attacked the chimp (who the apes thought was the returned Creator). instead attar has some sudden revelation that 'everything he had been told was a lie\" (where did that come from?).and the ending-ending would have been better if the time dials in the pod would have been spinning (or flashing random years) and not going back in time (as someone else already pointed out).  or have davidson go back in time to the ship before it crashed and fix everything (back to the future-ish).otherwise,a good but not great movie left us with a bad taste because of an incomprehensible finish.",

I will say this: the performances were good, there was nothing especially WRONG with the directing, and the effects and makeup were everything that you would expect, but in many respects, this drivel reminds me of another ill-conceived sci-fi project.  You could probably guess what that is by the title of my comment.Battlefield Earth has been panned non-stop by critics all over the world, but is this really much better?  Come on...This film's ending is the most incoherent copout I've seen in years.  The script is completely unoriginal, the action sequences are muddled and unexciting, and the attempts at comedy are cringe-worthy.  Both are big budget mistakes.  The only difference is that this one was successful (and ok...maybe not quite so laughable).  The fact that this film has at this point grossed around $US350 million internationally is a huge indictment on the intelligence of your average human being.  If you haven't seen it yet, don't.  If you want some decent sci-fi entertainment, see Jurassic Park 3.  It may not be the epitome of originality, but at least it delivers what it says it will.Tim Burton was, until this film, a symbol of originality, style, and great black humour, but this could just as easily have been directed by Michael Bay (except he'd probably find some way to sneak in a dogfight between the apes and humans in F-15s so there'd be more explosions).To Mark Wahlberg, pick better projects.To John Travolta, you're finally almost off the hook.",

First of all, what was up with all those apes smoking bongs? that was really messed up! it was so random and unnecessary! i thought it was hilarious, though!  Not to mention Ape-raham Lincoln at the end! That was a priceless (and some would say tasteless) mockery of a beloved American president. plus, i never knew apes could jump through the air like the warriors in ;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon< and who ever heard of a man kissing an ape-human?! That was just wrong; very. very wrong.\nAnyways, This movie does have many holes in it's plot, and the acting at times is very sub-par, but the basic story and the surprise ending at the end are at the least thought-provoking. Yes, the first one has a great ending, but i am very glad that this one took an entirely different route with it's overall plot (although the basic \"planet ruled by apes\" premise is still there).  reading the previous reviews, it is obvious that those who didn't like the movie obviously didn't fully understand the surprise ending. You see, Thade, the ape-villian, never died at the end. he just sat around in the spaceship after helplessly shooting his flare gun, and after mark wahlberg went off, he somehow found a way to work one of the spaceships. Just like how that one ape said, \"Thade will stop at nothing to get you.\" So, thade flew up into space, inadvertently went into the space time warp area, and flew way back in time.  There, he became Ape-raham Lincoln and emancipated (yes, kinda cheesy) his fellow apes from the shackles of...well, you get the point.  Then he dies and becomes a hero representing freedom and liberty to all ape-kind.  Kinda interesting to think about.  It's so bizarre and strange that it made for a genuine surprise in this movie-goer, even despite the fact that i was expecting some sort of twist.that still doesn't justify apes getting faded on bong hits, though.",

            "content": "Those of you who watched this version of that 1960s sci-fi classic about intelligent simians on a mysterious planet having dominion over mankind in the distant future were probably in for a little surprise (assuming you've seen the original).I would have to say that this latest film incarnation by Tim Burton is not at all a remake, but rather a retelling of the apes story from a perspective of pure fanfare and entertainment.  Yes, there were several references throughout the movie on the morality of treating fellow humans, apes or any walking-and-talking being alike with respect and contempt.  But there is a difference between this year's version and the original classic starring Charlton Heston.In 1968, the original `Planet of the Apes' revolutionized the sci-fi genre through its shocking image of mankind's future on the Planet Earth.  Of how an inferior species such as the apes could grow in power and intelligence to rule over humans, largely because mankind itself had used weapons of mass destruction on each other, therefore contributing to a series of events leading to ape domination.  Because the 1960s were such a turbulent time both politically and socially for the American people, the youth could especially empathize with the film's antiwar message.  I'm sure no baby boomer will ever forget the gut-wrenching conclusion of Heston pounding his fists on the beach sands and damning all of humanity to hell after feasting his eyes upon a half-buried Statue of Liberty.  Such scenes reflected the frightening times of the Cold War and Vietnam War, both looming as a shadow over the U.S. and other countries during that decade, and the whole movie itself directly reflected the mood of the times.Burton's version is quite a departure since it focuses on simple adventure entertainment and stunning visuals rather than any symbolic metaphor on the dangers of a worldwide engagement in nuclear war, or for that matter, any epidemic.  Instead of Planet Earth being the venue, Burton seems to have taken us to another world in another galaxy, therefore giving us a fresh take on the apes story.  At least this time around, the human slaves have the ability to talk.  I will never forget such scenes as Mark Wahlberg's pet chimpanzee landing in his space capsule from the sky during the climax of the ape-human battle.  These and other highlights made `Planet of the Apes' the escapist formula it deserves to be.  There are many inside dialogue references to the original `Apes' film, but I suggest you go see that version first in order to catch them all here.The movie is also blessed with a bunch of gifted performers.  Mark Wahlberg is OK as the chief protagonist.  But Tim Roth practically steals every scene he is in as the villainous ape general Thade.  With his experience as a stage actor, Roth magnificently portrays an enemy who is thoroughly corrupt and demonic with no hint of remorse.  Helena Bonham Carter provides an example of simian benevolence through her open-minded chimpanzee character. And Michael Clarke Duncan, being the huge man that he is, is at times terrifying as a gorilla commander.  Oh, and yes, keep an eye out for cameo appearances by Heston and Linda Harrison, stars from the original `Apes' movie.One common element between the two versions of `Planet of the Apes' is that both have a shocking finale, but for those who have not seen either, I will go as far as that!  For sheer pleasure, I rate this 8/10.",

I was expecting the worst (especially since I  had originally heard that Arnie was to star) but I was pleasantly surprised. Remaking such an icon is a big ask at the best of times, and Burton does his best, bringing  his typical dark edge to the film, but he apparently had to battle the studio every inch of the way, and the interference shows in the lack of overall cohesion.That being said, the film has many great aspects. Danny Elfman, as always, excels with his score, and the opening title music is superb (turn it up LOUD!); this is no mean feat since the POTA1 score by the great Jerry Goldsmith is one of THE great film scores.If for no other reason, this film is worth seeing for Tim Roth's bravura performance. He steals the picture as the ape general, Thade, imbuing the character (and the excellent makeup) with a performance of such mailicious psycopathy that he'd have undoubtedly been nominated for an Oscar it he had been playing a character in a gangster film.Mark Wahlberg is a likeable screen presence and getting better, though hardly a 'great' actor, but with talent like Roth and Bonham Carter alongside him, even in the ape makeup they tend to dominate. He's a somewhat stolid performer and as noted elsewhere, he pretty much plays the angry-intense thing most of the time, but that's basically all he has to do here, and the real stars are the apes anyway.Design, makeup and SFX are great, much lusher and more detailed than the rather spartan California look of the original. Some people were obviously very disappointed by the ending, and there's no way even Burton could have topped the original in that respect. There's a lot of humour too, and some very funny references to the original (Chuck Heston's uncredited cameo is great).No, it's not the greatest sci-fi film ever made, and no, it's obviously not even the film Tim Burton wanted to make, but in spite of all the fiddling and the disappointing aspects, it's still a diverting and often entertaining watch.

Examples of true re-makes include Sabrina and Psycho.  POTA (2001) is not a re-make, because Mark Wahlberg's character was Leo Davidson, not Col. George Taylor.

People who argue about it straying from the original movie don't seem to realize the 'original' movie is also a remake--of the book. And the original movie does not stick very close to the book, which is OK because neither the book nor the film are anything terribly stellar. Well, I don't really feel the same level of craft went into this film as Burton put into Sleepy Hollow, which might sound strange since Planet of the Apes has some of the most incredible visual effects your gonna see in a movie this year. The problem is, those effects didn't necessarily create the same level of immersiveness that Burton achieved with sleepy hollow. Some people moved like apes, others tried to move like apes, some people didn't try. Some costumes were extremely elaborate, some people just look like they had ape-muzzles fastened on to them. Visually it was a bit inconsistent, but very pleasing, so no complaints there. Of course, most of the problems come from the execution of the plot. I really had no idea how much of a non-actor Mark Wahlberg was until I saw this. His performance here reminded more of Kurt Russell's in Big Trouble in Little China. Who knows, maybe that's the point, but you really wonder why everyone started following him around since he just seems like a big jerk (I'm starting to think that is the joke of the film.) Some of the little homage lines to the Heston film were done in such an obvious fashion I'm afraid they will seem terrible upon multiple viewings. Well, the film is a full two hours long, and for all of that, it feels rushed, and a bit uncompelling, but we're also talking about a talking ape movie, so what do you want? As to development of the human characters, did anyone really care? Nova is hardly developed in the original (even though she can't talk), and I found myself wishing they were mute in this one as well. If everyone must reference back to the Heston film, then lets at least recall how uninterested the writers were in the humans then. Nothing has changed now, and I didn't find that a problem. If anything, I'd have liked to see a somewhat deeper ape culture--which is it stands seems less developed than in the Heston film. Yeah, the weird love triangle worked for me, I liked the somewhat abortive rivalry between atar and the other gorilla hanging out with Ari (sorry, can't recall his name), and a lot of other things were done really well here despite the over-all rushed feel. What I was most surprised to find though was that they kept the end of the book intact, and depending on how you read into the film, they actually kept the themes of the book intact--which suggests that apes rise to power simply because humans are too apathetic to keep them from doing so (not because of nukes or anything like that.) I imagine the new ending may throw some people, but this is the -original- ending, and I'm glad to see it back. Plus, getting to see apes dressed up as cops was pretty rewarding. Overall I thought this film was a blast, not art by any means, but in retrospect, none of the monkey films are art. They all have deep logical flaws (can someone please explain to me how evolution can result in chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans all evolving into bipedal talking versions of exactly the same creatures simultaneously!!??) and are filled with bad acting, or Heston's particular take on bad acting, so in this sense, Burton's version comes out on top not necessarily for being the better film but for being the most entertaining (anyone remember how dull the original one was?), the least pretentious and over-all having the most monkey-laughs of all the other ape films combined. I can only hope they consider a sequel--perhaps something in the order of 'escape from the planet of the apes.'",

            "content": "My summary above doesn't refer to the recent explosion of re-makes and sequals, etc, but to the recent trend in Hollywood, which can probably be traced back to movies like Jurrassic Park and Independence Day.  I'm not going to go on about the make-up or the behaviour of the apes in this film or the visual style - all these sorts of things, as with the aforementioned movies, are highly comendable.  What concerns me is the lack of narrative, character, or emotion these films have.  While it is worthwhile to exploit new technologies and groundbreaking visuals, film is (or at least should be) a visual way TO TELL A STORY.  Let me repeat that.  TO TELL A STORY. Imagine reading the \"Book of the movie\" after seeing this film, and see if the story, without all the wham-bang action and spectacular scenery, has any effect.James Cameron spent enourmous effort researching the visual style of the early last century, and both the rise and fall of the Titanic.  Although the story he included was cheesey, high-flying campy romantic fluff, somehow it worked and made (some) sense, and was intertwined with the visuals.  In Apes, all we see are the visuals.  It could have been a silent film for all the dialogue was worth.More specifically, could someone please tell me what the extra human characters were there for - I mean aside from sex appeal (Chanel-5 girl), political correctness (black guy) and who knows what (spoiled brat kid with no name)?And maybe someone who thinks that ending was brilliant could tell me why? Surprise endings only work if they make sense.  Marky could have landed in the Saraha desert and been arrested by camel-riding Santa Clauses and it would have about as much sense.As far as I'm concerned, the original movies (yes, all of them) had focus, good, well defined characters, and more plausabile, interesting, science-fiction content.  And really, the make-up of the new one is better, but is it really leaps and bounds (no pun intended) forward of the job they did in 1968?  I think not.  For those who will contend that the original series' sequals were nothing more than commercially driven,  money-makers capatalizing on the success of the original - well, here we go again, eh?Despite being an avid Tim Burton and Apes fan, I can easily say this is the worst Burton film, and the worst Apes film.As far as the screenwriters are concerned, I only have this to say: \"Damn you!  Damn you all to hell!\"",

Now I don't know if this is what Burton had intended, but here's MY take on things. (Again, if you haven't seen it yet, STOP READING!)The astronauts at the beginning are investigating this anomaly in space and decide to send the first monkey into it for a closer look. Wahlberg goes after the chimp into the time warp, and also disappears. Obviously, the whole crew follows them in an attempted rescue. But then, towards the middle, the crew turns out to have arrived on the planet BEFORE Wahlberg. Leo arrives after they do (some 3000 years later), and the chimp arrives after Leo. This is the exact REVERSE order they went into the time warp. (Still, this does not explain the horses, so I guess that does go as a goof!)Later, when Thade is trapped in the spaceship and is not killed off, I saw EXACTLY what Burton was going to do! I thought he was going to show us that in the second movie, but he teased us with it in THIS movie: Thade somehow escapes the ship, gets his band of Apes together, comes back to the ship, and escapes in it with his apes to Earth, probably in a period post American Civil War (after Lincoln). They fight the world, take it over, deface the Lincoln memorial, and put General Thade's face on it. Many years later, Mark arrives back on Earth, and finds that Apes rule! Again, note that Leo leaves the planet before Thade, but arrives on Earth AFTER Thade, the exact same thing that happened before. This is the only logical and obvious explanation of what happened. Anything else would make for a bad sequel. (Hope I haven't given away the sequel :))",

            "content": "The Planet of the Apes movies have been going on for ages. Between 1968 and 1981 no fewer than six were made, as well as two television adaptations. Just when you thought enough was enough, or much more than enough, here it comes again: Planet of the Apes (2001).What has changed? Well, a few changes in the plot keep this from being a word-for-word copy of the movie we've all seen years ago on a Saturday afternoon when absolutely nothing else was on television. The people can talk this time, and yet, other than three or four lines per person, they refrain. You'd think these subjugated humans would be full of questions for the space-man, but no, they trudge along in silence throughout most of the movie as little more than scenery. Toward the end, one little boy gets tired of being an extra in a loincloth, and protests. \"I want to be in this movie, too!\" But our hero does not want to share the spotlight. There is one human who doesn't trudge; she prances. While the rest of humanity, dominated by simians, looks as though they've been trying merely to survive, she seems to have thrived and grown to be a supermodel. Actually, she is the face behind Chanel no. 5. Unfortunately, she had no perfume to offer our lead actor (ha, actor. That would imply acting, which is being far too generous), so she stands around as the \"pretty young maiden in the loincloth\" part of the scenery.Our speaking roles are divided up between pretty much three characters. Our space-man and \"hero,\" who actually caused much more trouble than he fixed, Leo Davidson, is played by Mark Wahlberg. He galavants about and spits out his line in a very John Wayne fashion: with as little emotion as possible. We never see him do much except walk along to his destination, dragging some others along the way. Our ape that sympathizes with the humans is Ari, played by Helena Bonham Carter. Watch this one closely if you see this movie. She is one of the two people you'll see acting. The other is Tim Roth, the man who plays our villian, General Thade. He plays a very angry ape.The special effects are good, but what about those plot holes? All of a sudden at the end, people are kissing, but where did that romance come from? It's as if Burton were thumbing through the script, and all of a sudden said, \"hey, we have no romance in this film at all! Quick, somebody film these folks kissing. Nevermind if it doesn't fit in with the story at all.\" And while the apes all started out as chimps, they grow into apes that resemble chimps, orangutans, and gorillas, just like in the first movie. But while the difference of species amongst the apes made sence in the 60's version of this movie, it does not in this movie, because of the changes they've made. I can't get any more specific without major spoilers, so email me if you want the specific reason for this. Oh, and the biggest plot hole of all. Our little band is traveling, on foot for a long while, and then on horseback. All of a sudden, a thousand people show up. Why? \"Word has spread.\" What?? How?? The pony express? Cell phones, what? No, no, no. We simply didn't have time for details, and we need an army. So, word has spread, we don't know how, but here's the army. Ok.And finally, the ending, which will go down in history as one of the worst endings of any movie, ever. This rivals the endings to \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" and \"Pink Flamingos.\" If you hadn't already been groaning at many of the scenes in the middle of the movie, you'll groan at the last. I groaned, and if I had been holding popcorn, I might have thrown it at the screen.",

However, it was alsoan extremely safe film, and I would have expected more chancesto be taken from a filmmaker such as Tim Burton.  There werequite a few plot holes that I was willing to forgive for the sake ofmoving the film along.  But when the ending comes and it is not somuch shocking (me and a friend each predicted it) as completelymind boggling.  Even in a world such as this, the question thatbegs to be asked: How is that ending even possible?  Throughoutthe whole movie, through all the bland human characters and theinteresting but tried and predictable ape characters, I was able tosuspend my disbelief; then the ending comes and the disbelief isunsuspended.  The ending simply is not possible. What makes a movie memorable is always a strong ending, onethat gets talked about (read: The Sixth Sense).  Just because thisending will be talked about do not make the mistake of assumingthat it is a memorable ending.  The original ending in the 1968'Apes' was in there for shock value and I never did like it but atleast it could be explained!  Anyway, go see the movie foryourselves if you must, and if there are any physicists or scientistsout there who feel they can adequately explain the plausibility ofthat ending please feel free to tell me.  This film is just the latestbig budget disappointment in a summer saturated with moviesthat do not live up to the hype.  My advice, save your money on thisfilm and go see a worthwhile film like Made, The Princess and theWarrior, Sexy Beast or even Kiss of the Dragon, which makes nopretenses about the kind of movie it is (not to mention that you getto watch a teaser for Black Hawk Down before the movie!).",

Marky brashly rushes in after his little buddy, and soon finds himself stranded on the aforementioned Planet. This world is run by apes, which are amazingly well portrayed (by both make-up and acting) as powerful and intelligent, but still very simian. Mr. Mark is captured, leads an escape, starts a war, and some other stuff. Plot is not that important here.  Neither are any of the humans in the movie. The apes are obviously the stars. In the original film, the personal conflict between Charlton Heston's human astronaut and the ape rulers was the central factor in the story.  In this movie, Charlton Heston plays an ape, and I think that is a big clue as to the focus.  Mark Wahlberg plays the astronaut as rather dim and singleminded.  He's just a military flyboy who wants to get back home, where things are normal.  More interesting are Ari, an ape played by Helena Bonham Carter, Paul Giamatti's sleazy Limbo the orangutan thingy, and Tim Roth as the frightening, zealously anti-human General Thade.  They have much more complex personalities, and while they might not drive the story as effectively as the ploddingly courageous spaceman, they give it all the depth it can muster. Of course, all of this brainy stuff is mostly beside the point.  What make it so enjoyable are the visuals and action.  The big action; armies of monkeys fighting, Thade throwing an insane, violent hissy fit, and Michael Clarke Duncan beating his chest and kicking some monkey butt .  The little action; monkey behaviorisms adopted by the actors behind the make-up.  The way they walk, screech, and groom each other is one welcome difference from the original, where the apes acted like... well, humans with monkey-masks. And the monkey-masks are much improved, as well.  The apes (of all kinds this time, including those weird big necked thingies and orangutans) are very convincing, and incredibly cool, as are the locations, from the ape city to the rocky wasteland. I liked the way some of the lines from the original were borrowed, in a cleverly turned-around fashion.  I liked Charlton Heston's cameo (even if I almost giggled at his anti-gun statement).  Whatever anyone says, I liked the silly `big surprise', which didn't surprise anyone, but was fun anyway. Heck, the movie even had the Chinese Foooood lady, from Dude! Where's My Car?.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  It may not be Burton's best, but I'd see it again.Rating:  8/10 (nothing to fling poop at)The Score:  Ah, the main reason I was eager to see this movie.  Danny Elfman does it again!  A mix of his old-style weirdness and his more recent leanings toward the mainstream, the score is driven by distinctive percussion and big, blasting monkey music.  While it isn't quite Batman, or even Sleepy Hollow, it fits the movie perfectly, underscoring the action and adding to the feeling of primitive power, evolved and unleashed.  If you buy the score, be warned:  the last track is a pointless remix by some dude named Paul Oakenfold.   I pressed stop after 15 seconds.",

This film starts off fast and keeps moving. Burton's dark avant-garde  style of film making does not interfere with this flick. And yet his style is all over. This film has witty dialogue, GREAT special effects, and great ape performances from all. The \"monkeys\" in this version are so much more menacing here that I just may have nightmares. Mark Whalberg's debut into super-stardom is also noteworthy. His mile a minute, never stop attitudes is refreshing and brings his character to life.\nI won't go into the story but I will say I didn't think Burton could offer an ending as creative and shocking as the original... but guess what? HE DID IT.... twists and monkeys abound! Go ape and go see it....",

Helena Bonham Carter as Ari looks very lovely, ironic, and sometimes shy. I liked Mark Wahlberg as Leo Davidson less than previous characters, but his eagerness to get away from the planet and what proceeded to his escaping makes him unforgettable. Also I liked that there were no \"four-letter\" words in the picture. Danny Elfman created unusual electronic-orchestral-percussion score. My rating is 9/10.",

The first entire hour, is filled with mindnumbing violence, and a total lack of good dialogue. What i wanted to see, logic put into its place, as mark wahlberg explains his story to the apes and enlightens them, however they still reject him and thus the war breaks out. For anyone who is a fan of the first, there is no doubt that it was far superior. Old Guns and Moses was much better in the title role, as opposed to our renegade hero who doesn't have much to talk about, in the movie all in all, the movie sorely needed much better dialogue, and a stronger plot integration, as opposed to a movie of pure violence, simply throwing apes in the title roles. the idea of this movie was action not plot, however, action always takes the back seat to a good plot, never vice-versa, explain first, then fight despite my disliking of the movie, i hafta admit, the last quarter of the movie was alright, and i was fond of the ending, and the last plot twist i give the movie a **1/2 out of ***** and i hope that the sequel will be better,though it probably won't be",

I sit down wanting to be entertained and for about two hours my imagination should flow. With Planet of the Apes this is what I saw. 1) A beginning credit sequence? On a summer movie? 'Take it easy,' I said, 'you're just anxious for it to begin'. 2)After the credit sequence concludes we see a space station. A title appears stating that it's 2029, a mere 28 years from now. I squirm, the future date should have been left to my imagination 2)On the space station we see Mark Wahlberg interacting with his comrades. Nameless, numberless comrades. It dawns on me that Wahlberg maybe the only major lead. 'Oh no, he's good but he's not that good.' 3)After a monkey is shot out into the unknown in a space probe, Wahlberg, who was against this idea, straps himself in a pod of his own and states, \"Don't send a monkey to do a man's job.\" My heart sinks. 4)Wahlberg crashes into a very fake looking sound stage jungle set. I'm instantly taken out of the movie. 5)But then I perk up when the apes appear. They jump through the air and leap through the trees with wreckless abandon just like I hope monkeys do. I like this. 6)Upon his capture Wahlberg grabs onto an apes legs. The ape responds with a knowing wink, \"Get your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!\" I'm out of the movie again. 7)The apes and their captives arrive to another claustrophobic sound stage which they warmly know as their city. 8)Darn near every shot is a close up further inducing my claustrophobia. My best defense is to fall asleep. 9)I wake up sometime later. It turns out that the apes are afraid of water so to get away from them Wahlberg suggest to his merry crew to cross the river. Ari, the friendly she-ape is afraid. Wahlberg says, 'Don't be afraid you silly nit, we'll be on horses and horses are good swimmers.' She submits and they proceed to cross the five feet deep river. Question: When the apes see the horses safely swimming to the other side why don't they follow? 10)We discover along with the main characters that Wahlberg's space station passed through the same time warp he did but crash landed 3,000 years before and that, presumedly, the smart little monkeys aboard went crazy and killed all the humans. And then I take it they evolved into the warlike big apes we now see. In only 3,000 years of evolution??? 11)As for the trick ending that everyone has now heard about. Can someone please tell me because I fell asleep again. I'd like to state for the record that I loved Starship Troopers.",

His wonderfully facetious dark and light humor dominate and charm audiences. None of these qualities were present in Planet of the Apes.

I don't want to ridicule other reviewers, but to suggest that the apes would not enslave humans, or consider them savages because THEY CAN SPEAK ENGLISH and display intelligence is unbelievable baffling.  The very point of the whole D*** movie is to point out how unfair and bigoted people (or apes) can be.  Of course it's illogical, that is the point !!!  Has no one heard of the basically continuous human history of enslavement of our fellows ????  Funnily enough there was ample evidence of intelligence and language there, even English, and yet slavery went on!  All this real life enslavement with one hell of a lot less motivation (greed basically) than is provided the apes in this movie.  Please if you are going to go on and on about plot holes at least stick to safer ground. \nDo the other plot holes really detract from the movie, decided for yourself.

Every frame is packed with so much detail and so much action you won't want to blink. What Burton paints with images, Danny Elfman matches with sound, with yet another excellent score. But it's clear from the get-go that the real stars here are the apes who look and move so wonderfully realistically, you'll forget that they're not. The makeup is so good in The Planet of The Apes, it's hard to see the actor behind the mask. But this seems more an asset than a liability for the ape actors who all put in very strong performances. Unfortunately the 'human' actors are another story: Mark Wahlberg is clearly out of his league and depth here and really struggles to carry the lead. There's a scene where Wahlberg tries to rally the troops and he was so bad, it's funny. Estella Warren looks great but does very little in a role that is really not much more than window dressing.As with many visually stunning films, more care and attention was paid to the look of The Planet of The Apes than the script, so we're asked to make some pretty big leaps of faith. The Planet of The Apes it's definitely NOT a movie to think a lot about when you leave the theater, as many plot points don't hold up well on re-examination.

If Tim Burton or anyone else could make a decent copy of the original that would be great. Why were all the humans able to speak? The actors who played humans didn't even have anything decent to say so it would have been preferable to have had them mute. Yeah the script was that bad and surely the muteness was an integral part of the original. The film had some 'to be expected' special effects but no substance while the original had very little in the way of special effects and so much more substance. It seems that Tim Burton used the cover of special effects (like so many other film directors these days) to hide a poor script. There are many other aspects of the film which I could comment on but I don't want to give any of the plot away so I'll refrain. I suppose you must expect a remake to be of inferior quality, you only need to look at the vast majority of remakes to know this. This film, unlike its predecessor, will not stand the test of time.

I would have felt the exact same way had that angle been explored more in this remake.  Helena Bonham Carter's character doesn't go through that discovery, she believes in the intelligence of humans right away it seems.  That fact alone made this version of \"Planet of the Apes\" far inferior to the original.

Whenever I see Mark Wahlberg in an acting role I don't see Mark Wahlberg , I see Dirk Diggler, the character he excellently portrayed is 'Boogie Nights.' Probably has something to do with the fact that that character was a dim porn star, and Mark Wahlberg is a dim former underwear model. He applied his dozy screen persona to good effect is 'Three Kings,' in which he played a dim soldier. He doesn't come across as the heroic, inspirational leader type, and in the scene where he is 'rallying the troops' before the final battle, this is clearly evident as the scene just doesn't work.It was clear to see that the actors were struggling to speak under all that make up, and Helena Bonham Carter seemed to be wearing eye liner and lip stick. This is a human version of attractiveness, and its just a bit warped really. If they were to make a realistic attractive female ape, they should have given her a big pink arse that stuck right out. or something.Mark Wahlberg doesn't seem too shocked, or even bothered to have landed on a planet populated by talking apes, merely a bit disconcerted. There is no fear, which suspends involvement in the film because you cannot relate with the main character. *Minor spoilers* The 'love triangle' of Leo (Wahlberg) Daena (the gorgeous Estella Warren) and Ari (Bonham - Carter) is never convincing. When Leo kisses Daena, you think 'what, they fancy each other?' and when Leo leaves, all Ari says is 'maybe you'll come back?' The ending leaves you baffled. I thought about it for a bit after seeing the film, then just gave up. Is the world at the very end a future version of the planet Leo initially crashed onto at the start of the film? Is it a future version of the planet he left after influencing events there? Is it something else entirely different? It was reassuring to see fellow reviewers were equally baffled and confirmed that I'm not thick (that thick anyway) but that the screenwriters of this remake (sorry, re-imagining) were keen to emulate one of the greatest film endings ever, even if it made no sense, and no attempt was made to explain it. 4 out of 10 (1 for Estella for being a tasty bird, 1 for the suits of armour, 1 for Tim Roth and 1 for the music).",

It's a fun science fiction film, and the cheesy one-liners, far fetched science, and comic relief were very enjoyable. Sort of like Burton's Batman or Beetlejuice.

The Good; The Make-Up; There are only two words to describe Rick Baker's make-up: In-genious. The guy has always been the best and now he has surpassed even himself. His ape-make-up is flawless. Even apes with a short amount of screen time have amazing detail and individuality in their features. Baker easily has an Academy Award coming for his work here. The Acting; The Best Actors wore the most make-up. Everyone in an ape suit busted their butt and delivered first rate performances. Maybe they had to work harder to overcome wearing tons of make-up, maybe I just credit them with good acting because they were wearing all that make-up, all I know is that the made up actors were more expressive and convincing than the barefaced actors. 2. The Bad. They cut out it's brain, those bloody baboons! Sorry, I coudn't resist. That's a line from the original movie. It gets the point across. All the great satire that the original possessed is gone,cut out, eliminated. The book was mostly social satire and the original movie was pretty true to that. But not this one. It flirts with satire,it dabbles in it,it buys a ticket to the game but never gets into the same ballpark as the original movie as far as the satire and social commentary. It's watered down. I know they were excpecting lots of kids to flock to this flick, but I think the apes brutality was really underplayed. I'm not even talking about violence , much of which occurred off screen. Except for Thade and the profiteer Limbo, the apes weren't all that nasty to the humans. There is even an Animal Rights group that supports Human Rights. I never felt the overwhelming,oppressing menace that I felt with the original movie. Also, when the two big silverbacks locked up for their Big Fight, it was so anti-climactic. I expected fur and blood to fly when the arch-rivals met, instead I saw a slap fight between two mincing flight attendants. The Acting; Amazingly, all the actors without make-up were about as emotive as a wooden bedpost. There was no need for the humans to talk in this version, none of them said anything worth hearing.

The parts, though, are greater than the whole.\nThe main problem, as I see it, was trying to recreate the original Planet of the Apes in the first place. The original was released at the peak of the civil rights movement, and it's message of tolerance and understanding had much more meaning back then. Now, without any social relevance to justify it, the film comes off as nothing more than a loud, disposable summer flick. Of course, if anyone could even come close to making a good POTA remake, it'd be Tim Burton. His vision of the apes' world is incredible, and he comes very close to making the film work. The makeup effects by Rick Baker are also an impressive achievement, but, once again, it played better in the original because it was new. Another thing that made the first one so brilliant was the clear social distinction between ape and man. The film made the humans appear inferior through one very obvious, but effective, manner: it took away the humans' speech abilities. This made them more animal like, and it made Charlton Heston's character more relevant. But in this new version, the humans can speak, which makes their inferiority to the apes unclear. Physically,  the apes are much stronger than the humans, but the humans out number the apes 4 to 1. And the new hero, played by Mark Wahlberg, has no clear attribute to make him stand out to the benevolent \"human rights activist\" Ari. She notices him for a somewhat creepy sexual attraction. The most disappointing thing about this new version, though, was the ending. I won't give it away,because it was a surprise, but I was very let down. It unsuccessfully tried to recreate the startling final shot of the original, but without the aspect of suspense the whole epilogue seemed forced and sloppy, not to mention ludicrous. On the bright side, there is the aforementioned Burton and Baker, some welcome (but slightly misguided) comic relief, and a sexy human heroine in Estella Warren, who has an incredible body but a very sketchily defined character. Overall, I can't honestly recommend it to fans of the classic original, but non-discriminatory summer audiences may enjoy it.",

For instance, since there are supposed to be four humans for every ape, then why would it be so hard for humanity to fight the apes? Especially since people have the power of speech in this new version.And how, at the end of the flick, did Capt. Leo get from Saturn to Earth in his little space pod thing. And of course I must object to the usual liberal political correctness that permeates Hollywood.  Would we seriously expect a bronze age culture to have a \"Human Rights\" group? As usual, so much more could have been accomplished with this film.  But instead they settle for the two week thrill.  Another great movie theme sacrificed on the alter of the summertime box office. The sequel can only be better!",

That's it.I saw the original again a few weeks ago and I thought, just because, let me pull out my dusty 2001 version. They have two things in common, period. They both have apes, they both have humans at a lower level.The incredible drama and interplay of conflicting beliefs such as racism, nuclear holocaust, intolerance, animal vivisection never appear in the newer version, so...and now I ask the obvious...WHY remake a classic with something only created for green screen shots?I can only come up with one answer and it saddens me. Very few of today's younger generations don't have the same attention span as \"us\" older folk. I can't imagine them sitting through (let's face it) the rather boring action-wise first few minutes of the film:but, the problem is, those first few minutes help to set up the entire movie; something the remake doesn't. I can imagine it would be like making a 16 year old sit through \"2001.\" No zooming spaceships, no lasers, no action or fighting.I am vehemently opposed to most remakes. Granted, there might be a handful at most that improved upon the original, \"Dracula\" pops to mind, but very, very few. I wish directors would get some imagination and try to think of something PARTIALLY new. I know the Bible, Ecclesiastes 1:9, said, \"there is nothing new under the sun,\" but come on. If you can't do any better than a remake it's time to hang up your directing hat and go fishing until retirement.",

            "content": "Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed the original Planet of the Apes and its sequels.  But the new version does tell a different story and therefore not a remake of the original.  Here, Mark Wahlberg plays Captain Leo Davidson aboard the space station Oberon in the year 2029.  After routine simulated test flights with chimps, the station's sensors detect an ion storm (a term familiar to Star Trek fans).  Despite Davidson's protests, his chimp is sent out to take scans of this storm up close.   Greatly concerned for his well-being (you just gotta love his compassion for animals), Leo goes on an unauthorized shuttle launch in efforts to rescue him only to get caught up in the storm himself.  Sure enough, he goes forward in time and crash lands on a jungle-like planet.  Before he knows it, he's caught in a conflict where humans are running for their lives against an army of huge, talking gorillas.  He, along with the rest of the people are captured, imprisoned, and sent into slave quarters in a civilization run by these intelligent apes.Unable to accept life as a slave, Davidson organizes an escape with his fellow humans and a few ape sympathizers, including Helena Bonham Carter's character, Ari.  After returning to his wrecked ship, Leo is able to recover a few devices that detects a signal indicating his crew is searching for him.  The ensuing 2-day hike leads to some shocking revelations for Leo once they find the signal's origin.  It's from this point that Davidson is thrusted into the role of the reluctant hero as more and more humans become inspired by the quest to escpae slavery from the apes.  The ending of the movie also provides a major twist that most certainly indicates a sequel. After what happened in those last scenes, I'm quite looking forward to it.Overall, I thought this was pretty well-done.  Many of the lead characters undergo significant development.  Mark Wahlberg goes from being a happy-go-lucky animal-loving pilot to the role of reluctant hero to a bunch of rag-tag humans.  Carter's Ari becomes more of an activist for humans knowing that they are capable of being more than slaves.  Of course, you have the main troublemaker in the form of Tim Roth's General Thade, who's willing to murder even his own kind to maintain the status quo on the jungle planet.  Of all the character developments, my favorite was that of Michael Clarke Duncan, whose Attar character goes from being one of Thade's lackeys to a free-thinking ape who realizes the truth as to whom the real enemy is once he's presented the proper insight.  Duncan was a pretty good choice for this movie, especially considering how big he is.  Some might say he's really part-gorilla, and thereby born for the role.  I got the DVD of the movie and liked the process he went through with the make-up people. They were still applying his fur and make-up as Mark Wahlberg comes in for a brief touchup, which lasts less than a minute.  The two actors trade jokes and in an instant Wahlberg's back out shooting scenes while Duncan's still changing into ape form.  A good funny bit here!Again, we have a good story that goes from basic science fiction to the main theme of the battle for freedom.  At the end, it goes back to the element of sci-fi with a major twist.  Hopefully, the sequel will help to provide some revelations as to how this twist occured.  Mark Wahlberg has proven to be a good actor in previous film roles, as he did in this movie.  With the numerous trashings of this new Planet of the Apes movies, it's very likely he'll do a good job for the upcoming sequels.  I'm definitely looking forward to them.",

            "content": "*** spoilers ***I neither do belong to the core-fans category for the classic movie from 1968 nor am I a huge fan of Tim Burton movies. Nevertheless I think Burtons \"re-imagining\" is better than the critics generally say about it. The center problem is I guess that most people stay with comparing it with the original version although Burton always said he invented new characters and therefore it's not a remake. OK the story-line first is comparable and actors re-appear in the new one but the way Burton used these elements for his new version, is partly very funny and sometimes cynical. I like the scenes when Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) tells Davidson (Mark Wahlberg)\"Take your stinking hand from me, you damn dirty human\" (remember Heston when he shouts out this one in the original but then dedicated to the apes) or Charlton Heston appears as Thades (Tim Roth) father and telling him about the former power of the humans because of owing guns (that is cynical, especially when Heston tells this and I liked it). But the Burton version has a strong visual accent, perfect make-ups of the apes main-characters (Thade, Attar, Ari, Limbo), a break-through performance by Roth and an interesting story why these apes do rule the planet. It's quite entertaining and - come on - for what further reason was this movie produced? Some things - very independently from the original - could have been made better, for example the acting of the human roles. I guess that Wahlberg in his role as crash-landed pilot is physically strong but not very emotional. He does not seem to be very surprised to find himself in a world upside-down. That's sad because I think he can act quite superb. Estella Warren is only there because they needed a kind of female human that attracts the male moviegoers I guess. She never does find a real part in the movie. There are also logical mistakes in it, some scenes are superfluous (especially some scenes in Ape City) and the ending is strange but what's the point? It's a movie on a blockbuster-concept and it's made for the masses. With this target I guess Burton has done a solid job.",

Hopefully they will all be on the DVD, and one of them will be better than the one that was chosen, which was, for me, a bit confusing.  WARNING!!! SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!  Ok what exactly happened? the monkey gets lost in space, Marky Mark goes looking for him in a pod, then his crew's ship goes looking for him, everyone crashes on the planet at different times.  The crew's ship crashes first, starts the evolution (The planet somehow mutates the apes on board and makes them more human like, and they kill all the humans)  then, thousands of years later, Marky Mark finally shows up and raises hell, starts a man-versus-monkey revolt, in the middle of it Marky Mark's chimp finally shows up and then Wahlberg takes his chimp back to Earth but when he gets there, it's the 21st century and everyones still a damn dirty ape, but they're just like us right now.  Now here's where I get lost:  did he crash land on earth in the first place (which wouldnt make sense since the ship was already there) and then he just went farther into the future, OR did he just go further into this Monkey Planet's future which turned out to be just like ours, OR did he leave the Monkey Planet and get back to Earth which is now also a Planet of the Apes, so now there's two???? What the hell!?Another problem I had with this movie is that it wasn't done in Burton's traditional style.  Sure it was dark, yadda yadda yadda, but usually in a Burton film you're meant to root for the outsider.  Well, who's the outsider here? Mark Wahlberg or the entire POTA?  The POTA makes sense because no one's normal, but Wahlberg also makes sense because he's the minority on the planet.  Maybe I'm griping too much.",

            "content": "Being a formidable Burton-fan, his remake of the 1968 classic, THE PLANET OF THE APES, was an affair I'd looked forward to for quite a long time. But, after having seen the film, I regret to say that my emotions are mixed at best. First off, THE PLANET OF THE APES, doesn't have the feel of a Tim Burton film. The one thing I love the most about his films, are the characters in them. You really get to care for a Burton character. But the only character in this film that might resemble a previous Burton character, such as Edward Scissorhands or Jack Skellington, is Ari. She's the typical outcast in her society, set aside by her revolutionary ideas that humans should be treated equally as monkeys (sorry, apes\u0085), but other than her there really aren't any other characters in this film that can evoke care and emotions. The film doesn't visually have the Burton-esque style to it, either. There are occasional shots where some of that Burton magic shines through, like when we see the ape-city at a distance (it looks bewitched), but for the most part the visual style of the film is typical Hollywood extravagance. It would actually seem fair to compare this film with BATMAN. Both films are financially huge projects, where the producers seems to have put a lid on Burton's imagination, perhaps in fair of loosing the bigger audience. \u0091Tis a shame\u0085 Also, the film doesn't feel grand. I, personally, was expecting a huge film. After seeing the intense trailers, I though THE PLANET OF THE APES would be a film that could give us a taste of what's to come, with LORD OF THE RINGS looming in the distance, speaking in terms of huge CGI made battles and such, but alas\u0085 There's only one such scene, and it's over in a flash.There are also several things that bothered me in the script. First off, the beginning, which was too short too explain why a pilot would risk his life going after an ape lost in an electromagnetic storm. More time should have been spent, or been spent more efficiently, on this bit. There was also stuff in the characters development, which didn't fit. *SPOILERS* There's a scene in the film where Ari sneaks back into the camp of the vicious Thades, to conduct some sort of peace meeting, where she ends up being branded by Thades with the mark of humans. The film doesn't explain why Ari would attempt such an act in the first place, or why Thades would just let Ari and Sandar, who accompany her, leave afterwards, and the scene isn't followed up later in the film. It's only there to give Thades a chance to mark Ari. The writers should have thought of another way for this to happen. Also, towards the end of the film, we see Colonel Attar suddenly betray his patron, Thades, after, for the most part, being a pretty grim ape himself. It didn't seem like a logical course of action for this character. They should have sown the seeds for such an act earlier in the film. I also thought the filmmakers dispatched Sandar too easily. He was the former superior of Thades, but cast into shame when Thades betrayed him, and in the battle scene, where he's supposed to fight his previous prot\u00e9g\u00e9, he's intervened by Colonel Attar and defeated in a minute or so. I would have thought such a character, as Sandar, would have deserved a better exit.The ending, high above all things, must be discussed. Naturally, there was a huge amount of pressure on the filmmakers to come up with an ending that would match the original 68-ending, and take it's audience by surprise. It seems to me, that in their desperation to concur such an ending, they exit the film with more questions than answers. *HUGE SPOILER* I see only two possible answers to the end: (a) Everything took place on earth all along, and Captain Leo Davidson has only been traveling back and forth in time, as in the original film, or that (b) we are talking about two different planets. If it's the first, (a), then Captain Leo Davidson should have been able to figure all this out, by calculating coordinates and such, but if it's the second, (b), then how in the nine hells did Thades make his way to earth? Puzzling.Tim Roth, who stars as Thades, makes it clear that he's one of the meanest villains out there. Mark Wahlberg is a fine enough actor, who's done better before, that pulls of the part of Captain Leo Davidson quit nice, not being especially heroic, but not too much of an anti-hero either. Helena Bonham-Carter, as Ari, is, next to Tim Roth, the best actor on the cast. Putting Michael Clarke Duncan behind the make-up of Colonel Attar was also a good move on Burton's behalf. First off, because he's big enough to fit the role, and second, because his melancholic eyes are perhaps the only thing that lends credibility to the fact that he chooses to disobey his patron, Thades. Paul Giamatti was superb, creating comical relief with Limbo, the slave trader. Estella Warren, in her skimpy Xena outfit, was incognito at best. So, all in all, as I arrive upon my conclusion, it must be said that THE PLANET OF THE APES is a pretty entertaining film, if nothing else. The film is clearly less political than it's predecessor. It seems to have no ambitions. It only wants to entertain. And so it does, many thanks to a good cast, great make-up, enough funny scenes, and, last but not least, an excellent villain.",

            "content": "Finally, a movie a primate-lover can watch and not groan.  I'd read a lot about the making of this movie and was optimistic to see it, because along with LOOKING like apes, the actors reportedly had training to make them ACT like apes.  I was not disappointed!From vocalizations to subtle physical movements to the violent tantrum thrown by Thade (Tim Roth), the actors did a good job of portraying apes, not just being humans in ape suits.  Anyone who's studied apes (or watched the Discovery Channel a time or two), would recognize the animals on-screen.(Spoiler alert in this Paragraph) To me, the most important line in the movie was very early on, uttered by Leo (Mark Wahlberg) to the primatologist on the spaceship Oberon.  In speaking about the chimp he's training, Leo says something to the effect of \"He's the best money can buy...gene-spliced and chromosome-enhanced\".  In that line is the key to the whole movie, what made it so much better from a scientific point of view than the original. In the original 1968 picture, the premise was that apes had \"evolved\" on a post-apocolyptic Earth, learning to speak and walk upright.  This, of course, is ridiculous to a scientist and goes completely against evolutionary theory (I'll refrain from a long explanation of that...if anyone's confused, just email me).  But in the new version, humans TAMPERED with the genetic makeup of the apes (presumably to make them more human), and THEN the apes were left to evolve after the Oberon landed on the new planet.  That is a scientifically plausible event (if we suspend our disbelief and accept gene-splicing, which is not difficult for a futuristic film).So, this version is far more palatable in respect to plot and the portrayal of apes.  I did NOT like the ending of this one as much as the original, and that's what keeps me from giving it a 10 (I give it an 8).  I felt like the ending was trite and contrived, but I forgive Burton for doing it.  A \"trick ending\" was obligatory and necessary for Hollywood to remake a \"classic\" like POTA.The not-so-subtle social commentary on how we humans treat animals, particularly apes, was fairly glaring, but I think it was well-done.  The scene where the little human girl is pried away from her mother to be made a pet is something anyone considering taking a primate as a pet should see. And the line about getting rid of her before she hits puberty because \"one thing you don't want in your house is a human teenager\" is apt on several levels.I liked the humor in this film, too.  The comic relief of the human trader and the human sayings the apes used were good.  And the best bit of humor was achieved through irony in the cameo part played by Charleton Heston. Heston, a known NRA lacky, portrays an elderly Ape who cautions his son to be wary of the humans because they possess the power of dangerous technology; he holds a gun in his hands and declares it the root of human evil.  That was masterful!So, overall this film was a joy to watch.  From good jokes and clever irony to a plausible plot and interesting characters and conflict, this movie had it all.  I will see it again and again, just to take in all the details of the apes' world.  I will, however, not watch the final two minutes, because I think the obligatory Hollywood ending spoils an otherwise great film. It's still better than most movies made today, but Burton's remake would have been better without the ending.  As I said before, though, I forgive him for it, and I thank him for making a movie in accord with primatology.(Spoiler alert)One side note about the movie... one other problem with the believablity was created by a simple fact of biology that some people may not be aware of.  At the end of the movie when Leo's chimp lands and exits his spacecraft, it is obvious that he is much smaller than the \"evolved\" chimps, and that creats a visual inconsistency.  That is because that chimp, as with all chimps used in films and TV shows, is a very young ape, probably just four or five years old.  An adult chimp is close to the size of a small adult human and would have looked much better.  However, adult chimps are not used because they are so large, agressive, and strong.  An adult chimp is easily three times as strong as an adult human, has large canine teeth, and could kill a man in a few seconds.  So the necessity of using an immature chimp in the role is evident, and we can forgive the movie that small inconsistency as well.",

Why care about humans or apes or even horses??  I say kill em all.  Ravage the land and destroy all that exists.  I mean, this is supposed to be another planet, right?\nPlanet of the Apes is SO much different from the original.  Of course it is supposed to be!!  But this has become altogether changed for the worst.  I don't see how I am made to care.  Tim Burton has gotten us to another world where we DO NOT sympathize nor feel for.  IF apes that talk land on Earth and threaten human existance, that'd be so cool and I'd care.  Charlton Heston landed on future Earth and I cared as well.I gave this movie a 3.  3 based on Special effects and AWESOME music.-4 on story and -1 on acting.  6 for directing and 9 for music.  9 for action sequence and -5 for credibility.  This is a pure Hollywood popcorn movie so many people love/hate.  I personally love these kinds of movie, but with a Superior version done so many years ago, I say this was done in utter disgrace and disappointment.

It has a unique look throughout, with some wonderful and vast sets and locations. The scenery is always slightly different, and that makes it interesting to look at.The conversations between the characters are involving, entertaining and in places even charming. There is some very amusing humour in there as well, nothing hilarious, but enough to get a laugh from the audience.... \"There's nothing you want around your house LESS than a human teenager\" for example, or the Ape with false teeth!The plot is also good. And to a certain extent keep you wondering what will happen next. Mark Whalberg is excellent as the main character. He's just the type you want in a film like this. Lets face it, you wouldn't want Sylvester Stallone or some other muscle bound 'Conan' type bloke down there. But Whalberg makes a very believable main character. General Thade's character is fantastic throughout also.Finally, you know throughout that SOMETHING will happen at the end. It was inevitable. And what IS at the end was very satisfying, hard to get your head around, but really cool none the less.And anyone who thinks that your a shallow individual for thinking that a 're-make' (or re-imaging) is good, is totally wrong. Planet of the Apes is a fine film that entertains throughout and doesn't disappoint anywhere......... and thats ALL anyone can ask for!",

From what I understand, the first movie was a commentary about race relations and the sort, but I think this movie did try to cover animal rights to a degree (please, if you desire, email me at let me know if you agree or disagree and why). There were plot holes ****SPOILER (kinda)****** Where did they get those horses, were they already on the planet and if so, why did they look like earth horses? Or, were they carried on the ship. If so, where? There didn't seem to be enough room for horses. My semi-theory is that perhaps there were horse embreyos or something, though I am not sure where they were \"grown\" into maturity. Also, and this really doesn't take TOO much thought, but if I recall that it was mentioned that ALL the humans died when the ship crashed, obviously, they didn't ALL die, or else there wouldn't be humans on the planet, but anyway..it was silly. ******SPOILER END*****Finally, the end confused me, though I might have missed something. *ONE MORE SPOILER** Was he on earth at the end, if so, how did Thade influence earth? What other options are there? I read that he really didn't return to earth, but went back to the same planet later in time, but this only makes partial sense, I mean, we were led to believe that everything was cool with humans and apes, so what was up with that?**Spoiler end***\nAnyway, this movie was fun, and I enjoyed it in spite of all the problems I had with the plot. The make up was cool and Tim Roth was super! I give it 7 out of 10",

Other characters get slightly better treatment, but what about the kid who Wahlberg's character saves as the ape army attacks? Almost no background, just a couple of shots of him being insubordinate to Wahlberg, a person that the humans on the planet are in awe of.  Would a kid really be that brash?The story is good, the acting is fine, the scenery is superb.  The climax of the film is great, though I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it. However, one thing can always ruin a good movie: a bad ending.  Let me just say I think Mr. Burton wanted to see apes in police squad cars and ape tourists.

But on the other hand it does have it's advantages over the new Tim Burton version.\nIn the original version, Humans are treated like animals because they can't speak, and the apes are being like humans cos they have the ability to speak.  And it shocks the apes when they finally hear one man speak.\nSo there's a conflict in the ape kingdom because the scientists see the human more than just an animal, whilst the others do not want to know and still prefer to think humans are still animals.Where as in the remake, the humans and apes can speak yet they are treated as slaves and also as animals (which contradicts itself in a big way).\nWith slavery- there's always pressure groups and other organisations that will try to abolish slavery no matter how different they are, so I couldn't understand why an entire race would hate humans-for no reasons other than they are humans- and only one person who sees them as something more than.\n************************************************************************ ***************************WARNING SPOILER ALERT************************ ************************************************************************I thought finding out who Calima really was was a dead rip off to Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  Where Kirk finds out who V'ger(the creator the alien race was searching for) is buy scrubbing the dirt away the name V'ger, and finding out that it's actually Voyager.  So Calima when Mark scrubs the rest of the dust away was actually Caution Live Animals (And there was me thinking that Calima was homage to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).I can't understand why people are confused about the ending to Tim Burtons remake.  What Tim Burton is trying to say, is that as Darwin's evolution tells us, we are direct descendants from apes, now that Mark and his scientist friends, they have tampered with the evolution process, and now the apes are direct descendants from humans.  And the statue Mark sees isn't Thade or anyone else but An \"Ape\"briaham Lincoln (I know corny joke).Another thing is that according to the (TWIST) ending he was on earth all along so therefore where did all those people come from in the ape world? Are they cave people if so how can they speak English perfectly well?  If they are on a different planet, are we supposed to put our brains in to Star Trek gear and believe that everyone in the universe speaks English?******OVERALL VIEW OF THE FILM ((((NO SPOILER))))******On entertainment value it is good, but if you're looking for a Tim Burton film- you won't find it here,There's none of his trademarks- the humour is more Hollywood than Tim Burton, and there's nothing strange, or unusual, or magical, that you get when your watching a Tim Burton movie, it's all Hollywood and no Tim.Floyd_Dylan 2001 (review 1)",

My quibbles: Mark Wahlberg wasn't the best choice for the lead. Burton should've cast someone a little older, with a little more presence. George Clooney perhaps. The humans being able to speak in this version  (as oppossed to the mutes in the original) added nothing to the story as they really had nothing interesting to say.

I was expecting another duplicate of Planet Of The Apes '68 with hyped-up special effects and celebrity actors (well it did, but they where apes).  Acting was ok, Wahlberg was not that great (loosen up man, it's just a movie), but found Tim Roth, Paul Giamatti, and Carter to be very entertaining.  We got a completely stand-alone movie that went in a different direction than the other five films with the same namesake (or maybe not, we may see...).  I can see where alot of people may not like this movie. For one, I think too many people went into the movie thinking it was going to be more closely related to previous films, from what I understand they where not even going to call it \"Planet Of The Apes\". Overall it is nothing spectacular, a few nice surprises on the way, but equal to most action/sci-fi movies out there nowadays.  As for the ending, come on people, not every single big-budget movie has to have a happy, close-minded, all mysteries solved ending.  It's refreshing to have a thought-provoking ending.  Although, I did find that the apes driving cars and all that a little awkward looking, not because they are apes, but something just did not look right, and somehow if this whole thing was supposed to be a two-way time travel deal and the apes took over years and years ago, I would think that cars, buildings, and so on would look slightly different, then again maybe they took over a few years before he got there in the end, who knows?  In most cases, sequels can kill a series of movies, but in this case I think it can only get better if written and directed correctly.  One thing is for sure, I am sure they could get the audience and sales for a second movie just based on people wanting a resolution to that ending!  I got stuck watching the crappy pan & scan version and to me the shots where framed way to contrived for a movie like this, then again maybe I just need to see the widescreen version.

Here we are 5 years later and still no sequel. It's unfortunate, because amidst all of the speculation about the meaning of the ending - it certainly screams SEQUEL!

Movies like these (ESPECIALLY Sci-Fi movies) are very rare, and i must admit, when I was walking into the theatre, I thought this was going to be an awful movie ripping off the previous \"Planet of the Apes\". I was so wrong.The movie starts off with Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) in a USAF Starbase that experiences a strange nebula. The captain sends out one of Leo's monkeys to explore the nebula, but they lose contact with the monkey. Leo jumps in another spaceship and goes looking for the monkey (Which was very strange in the beginning, but they had to get him on the planet somehow, I guess). When he gets trapped in the nebula, he goes forward in time and lands on an alien planet (Unlike the previous movie, where Leo lands on a futuristic earth). He encounters a group of humans who are running from the apes. Leo is very confused, which becomes a major point for the beginning of the movie.The film is a direct remake from the original, but is much darker, thanks to the wonderful directing of Tim Burton. He captured the atmosphere from the previous film perfectly, but he also added a bit of an extra touch by making the apes seem much more menacing. The performances aren't Oscar-worthy, but they aren't bad (Including Mark Wahlberg, who I think was always a good actor since his starring role in the movie \"Boogie Nights), and the make-up by Rick Baker is sure to get him an Academy Award. The music by Danny Elfman is amazing (Including the opening theme, which in my opinion is probably one of my top 5 themes) and it perfectly captures the atmosphere in the movie. But probably the most controversial point in the movie is the ending. It was either you understood it, or you didn't. Luckily, I was one of the people that understood it, and it almost made the movie for me. But without spoiling any of the ending, let me just say this: It's very sequel-friendly (Which in my case is a good thing)Review: ****1/2 / *****",

Could anyone really see Arnold delivering such lines as \"get your stinking hands off me you damned dirty ape!\" Talk about your comedy films.Burton, who is probably best known for his dark and mysterious works such as \"Batman\" (the first one and only really worthy one) and \"Sleepy Hollow\", has scored once again with his retelling of \"Planet of the Apes\"  By showing a certain reverence to the original ( the above referenced line by Heston is now spoken by one of the apes ) as well as certain character names (Nova for one) he has given it an original twist and (although I must admit a somewhat confusing) ending that will have people talking in the breakroom for days about it.The actors, story all of it is first class and well worth the admission price.  Remember, these aren't your 1968 apes.  Burton has them behaving less human and more ape-like, complete with hanging off the ceiling and grunts and squeals.

And remakes will always be viewed with scepticism by a generation old enough to have enjoyed an original.I watched it without any plot info on purpose (so it could unravel honestly and maybe I could enjoy it more) Anyway, I mostly did enjoyed it until the end then I got the impression there was enough plot for a sequel jammed into the last 15 mins. So if I sum up a few of the plot twists: Apes are descendants of our genetically engineered space cadets. They are deeply religious - except for Thades' bloodline (was his great grandaddy the violent one in the cage they were talking about in the beginning?) Ok we've got that sorted. I think that Leo's character was fairly honestly acted by Wahlberg. He didn't really care about any of the people or apes but just used them to get back to his ship (or what he thought would be his ship).  So if for a minute we agree that he is a selfish individual, and that he has no choice but to rally the human troops or be killed by the approaching ape army even quicker (and ignore all that 'we can do it' crap) Heres my version of the ending: The second pod comes down with his chimp mate onboard (this is ok as we know the cosmic whatever has cause this time displacement) Leo doesnt just walk over to it and start man-handling the 'deity' as I'm sure the Gorilla Commander would have taken him apart. But the Space cadet bounds out into Leos arms in Friendship at least giving the still pumped up ape army something to think about for a minute. General Thade who lets face it is not going to calm down for even Simo himself goes all out to kill Leo as he is obviously threatened by the possible shift of power. The Fighting kicks off again and in the scramble Simo is killed, Thade has to kill his own Commander (who is religious) and Leo makes a run  for the pod and escapes. In his escape into the sky we see the human element being once and for all dealt with by Thade and his now un-opposed command. Leo enters the cosmic anomally again and is ejected on the other side to what he can visibly see is earth (maybe just thinks he is lucky) he chooses america and flies in etc. Then the end could play out as written. I know I've rushed that a bit but at least it would have tied in the twist ending more plausibly. It also keeps with his selfish character, the total ape population of the 'final' planet and with the overall dark tone (Thankyou Mr Burton) of the movie. The overall massage of these films is what B******s we as a species are. So why even attempt a happy ending, and then mess it up even more with a meaning less twist at the last minute?",

Although direction wasn't the main problem with this film, the writing was 2-dimensional and atrocious to character development.  It relied heavily on apes screaming and tossing humans 20 feet in the air at the drop of a hat (not that I blame them; I would've done the same to Mark based on his wooden performance).  The battle scene was solved with such an element of corniness, the teeny boppers behind me with eyes glued to Mr. Wahlberg actually came to their senses and laughed.  This movie deserved better craftsmanship of plot vehicles.The only really redeeming thing about this film was a \"pretty good considering\" performance by Helena Bonham Carter, monkey makeup and all. She found a wry character and an interesting crush on Mark Wahlberg's character, handling everything that she came across with a fair amount of grace.All in all, the movie is worth checking out- once.

The only thing that I really have issues with is the fact that some of the characters didn't really serve much purpose.  I don't know if they had all their lines cut out or what, but they don't really do a whole lot for the film.  Even Mark Wahlberg doesn't have a hell of a lot of dialogue.  But the film starts off much different than the first, and continues along that idea.  Most of the same themes are revisited, but skewed a bit.  The cinematography and makeup are both amazing.  This movie lived up to my expectations.  Go see this movie and judge for yourself.  I heard people coming out of the movie and saying that it sucked.  But, they probably have no basis for comparison if they haven't seen the originals.  I would give this movie 9/10.  Nearly perfect.",

The ending, which I will not give away so not to ruin it for the poor souls who are still considering seeing this piece of garbage is absolutely pointless and adds nothing to the movie. In fact the ending makes absolutely no sense and feels as though it was a last minute ending that was added on a week before the movie was released. This movie will also be very offensive to a certain minority group.

Yes the Planet Of The Apes films have always reflected the racial tensions in this country but they certainly never made a joke of it.I think it is time for Richard Zanuck to retire being he hasn't made a good film since Jaws and Tim Burton should stick to making films like Ed Wood which showcased a lot more of his talent than this piece of garbage.",

Leo (Mark Wahlberg) does not care for any of human on the planet of the apes but himself. His goal was just get himself out of the planet as soon as possible. The director knows too well that he is not a hero, that's why he decided to add a scene of heroic rescue of a young boy in the movie. But it doesn't help to make him a better character but too obvious of an effort. Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) was a confusing idealistic character that she believes ape and human should be equally live together. But the movie fails to show her feeling when she watches human killing her own kind. Instead of an internal struggle inside her, she just blindly help human beat up her own people. And the third main character, Daena (Estella Warren) she was just a pretty figure follows Leo everywhere until the end. It's not her fault that she couldn't act, it's the movie doesn't give her any chance to act. It was a failure when Leo farewells to Ari and Daena in the end, there's nothing there to drive the audiences to any feeling. It's as if we watch some stranger say goodbye\u0085They could have brought up much more than this.

He acts the psychopathic homicidal ape perfectly. Even the walk he seems to have perfected. No wonder Quentin Tarantino hires him so much; he works well with twisted characters and plotlines. (Watch Reservoir Dogs if you don't believe me... Mr. Orange)The love triangle of Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and the blond chick with a big chest [i think she was called Deana] (Estelle Warren), is hilarious. Some critics have said that they wished that Davidson and Ari had more of a relationship instead of the blond chick with a big chest and Davidson. This is totally crazy! Have they SEEN THE MOVIE??? The only thing that blond chick with big chest did was kiss Davidson once and look exactly like a blond chick with big chest. She is a token piece in this movie.... The relationship with Ari and Davidson not only involves a kiss but he saves her life more than once, and they even TALK! I think that some critics need to cut back on their drinking!Speaking of blond chick/big chest being the token piece, she is only in the movie because people expect her. They screwed up the ending, so why keep her? But yet again the adolescent male attitudes that every guy keeps hidden SOMEWHERE rear their ugly heads. Look at most of the movies these days, find one that doesn't have a token chick with a big chest? It doesn't seem well\u0085. Natural.Well then, the makeup jobs. INSANE! Each of the prosthetics that the actors wore was individual created. Unlike the original movie, every ape has a different face, which is highly expressive and flexible, Kudos to the makeup crew:Rick Baker,   Brigitte Bugayong,  Gabriel De Cunto, Toni G, Teressa Hill, Jamie Kelman,  Patricia Miller (II),  Denise Paulson, Alex Proctor, Robin SlaterI was highly impressed.The directing was impressive as well, timing the movements and brining a vision to life was left up to Tim Burton and yet again he brings the screen to life.

Yet the themes are the same: racism and equality being the most important. Another theme in the movie is the complexity of time travel that Burton deals with in the same way as e.g. ex-Python Terry Gilliam did in '12 Monkeys'.The apes are outstanding e.g. because of their walk and their interactions in general.

            "content": "Tim Burton has shown many things in his life as a filmmaker: a knack for gloomy atmosphere; a real sense of empathy for the lonely and different ones; a wicked sense of humor; he's even shown that he can play by the rules of the studios, delivering not only once but twice, even making a sequel and pulling it off.Sadly, none of that shows in \"Planet...\". The problem does not lie in the fact that they tamper with the story from the first film. As they've made clear, the producers and director are not trying to remake a classic, but use it (and the book it originated from) as a stepping stone to build the new movie, so their deviations from the original would not be a problem... if they were good.Burton doesn't have a good starting point: the script is very, very bad, your usual Hollywood-esque pastiche of old lines with (supposedly) new parallelisms and not-very-bright pop culture references. All that would be interesting if something happened, along the story, to the characters. Sadly, it is not so: the astronaut, the good apes and the pretty girl remain the same (that is, totally uninteresting) throughout the movie. Even the bad apes are not really changed, as the ending goes. And let's not even start with the inconsistencies...This is by far Burton worse movie ever, light years away from his classics. His trademarks barely show: we don't care about what happens with the characters at all, the sets lack the grandeur that we've learn to love and expect (\"Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Batman\" come to mind) and his \"wicked sense of humor\" is limited to changing classic lines from being spoken by humans to simian mouths.The acting is really bland, too. Mark Wahlberg has proven that he can act. But he wanders through \"Planet...\" with his best \"Keanu-I-don't-know-what-the-heck-is-going-on-Reeves\" look on. And Stella Warren... well, she IS pretty. Helena Bonham-Carter is as boring as usual and Tim Roth has lots of fun but is well below some of his best movies.The summing up of all of this is in one word: disappointment. Not from what it is (even at this point the movie can be seen if one has enough popcorn and soda) but from what it could had been with the talent implied. And yes, the make-up is awesome and Heston's cameo is really cool, but somehow they are not sufficient to save a picture from being just another fancy way of wasting your time and your money.",

The movie was good, except for this contrived and senseless plot twist that is completely tacked-on.Besides the fact that the movie ends up not making any sense after it was on the right track, the musical score, I hear, had to be completely redone mere days before release.

He turned the campy original series \"Batman\" into a dark, seething masterpiece of a film.  He transformed his own \"Nightmare\" into a moral tale that kids and adults could both appreciate.And now he has remade \"Planet of the Apes\" with reverence and technical prowess.From the get-go, this film has you hooked with its brooding atmosphere and careful storytelling.  The plot is carefully laid out from the beginning, and even though you might begin to think you know what's going to happen, you are constantly surprised.I found my jaw hanging open throughout the whole sequence where the hero (played by Mark Wahlberg) crash lands on the planet.  The effect was so well done it was hard to imagine it being anything but totally real.In classic fashion, the heroic characters are super-good, though not without their flaws, and the villainous characters are supremely evil.  The roles are reversed in this film, with the apes being the masters and the humans being the ones who are caged and kept as pets.  By the way, monkeys don't make very nice masters.  Which reminds me, the addition of a young monkey girl keeping a small blonde-haired waif as a pet was a classic Burton touch.I don't feel like I can talk too much about the plot without giving it all away.  From the first moment of the film to the surprise ending, it's a non-stop roller coaster ride of a movie, and might possibly now be one of my top five films of all time.  It's a masterful work of art.  Tim Burton surely has his place in history now as one of the greatest directors of all time.I have not read any reviews of \"Planet of the Apes\" before writing this review, as I did not want them to taint my feelings about the film.  Even if the critics pan this movie, though, there is no way my feelings will change. I am in awe.Finally, I cannot end this review without a nod to Danny Elfman, my favorite singer/songwriter/composer of all time and a frequent Tim Burton collaborator.  Elfman's music in this film is quite different than his usual style, but at the same time fits right in with the theme and darkness of it. The beginning of the film is like \"Batman\", with a close-up shot through the credits while the music builds up an-almost frightening momentum until the movie actually begins.See it.

The story and characters.  That's what this film seemed to lack.\nThe original Planet of the Apes had the advantage of a brand new idea (to anyone who hadn't read the book) to enthrall the audience.  The story was new and the characters had feelings and interactions that fit well with the effects.The 2001 version, unfortunately, had Mark Wahlberg playing an unfeeling robot of a character.  From the moment he lands on this mind-blowing planet, he never deviated from his primary motivation.  Granted, this is a necessary element for all scripts, but usually the motivation is complimented with other story elements and characters along the way.Wahlberg's character never takes notice of any other character or for that matter, any event that is taking place around him.  This becomes frustrating for the viewer as a story is desperately trying to reveal itself but is constantly stunted by the main character.As for the ending, well, it's a thinker.

            "content": "All the confusion over the ending is understandable if you have not read the original Pierre Boulle novel on which Planet 2001 (and its predecessor, to a much lesser degree) is based.Boulle spends a lot of time on evolutionary theories and we learn as the story develops that Cornelius, a very bright chimp scientist, is on the verge of a discovery that will destroy the foundations of the apes' beliefs concerning their evolutionary superiority.In Boulle's Ape world, the apes believe they have always been the intelligent ones and the humans have always been incapable of rational thought.  Cornelius discovers the opposite to be true during his archeological dig in the forbidden zone -- he finds among the ruins a human doll with a voice mechanism, which hints at the previous existence of a hi-tech society. (a similar scene occurred in Planet 1968).The real shocker comes towards the end of the novel, when Cornelius, desperate to show that apes are not just skillful imitators (he is afraid that this truth may explain their progress up to this point -- they have simply copied what humans have already done throughout history), demonstrates via shock therapy on human subjects that he and his colleagues can actually tap into HISTORICAL human memory and shock subjects into babbling about events that took place hundreds of years ago.\nSome of the snatches of vocalized historical memory reveal that humans rested on their technological laurels, became lazy, and, before they knew it, apes had taken over their world.  Snatches of these ancient memories reveal that apes were hungry for knowledge while humans were hungry for leisure (what, humans hungry for leisure?!  never!)  The takeover was violent and humans were enslaved.  Fast forward to Boulle's planet Soror and you have apes in control and mute humans with brains turned to mush.When Boulle's hero Ulysse Merou heads back to earth, he too is shocked to discover that apes now rule his home turf.  Yet, how hard is this to believe when we've already seen what has happened on Soror?  The formula is well-understood by now.  Superior species accomplishes much and then loses its edge.  Formerly inferior species, long discriminated against, tortured, etc., takes advantage of human sloth and eventually assumes control.In Planet 2001 we have seen the same thing.  Leo returns to earth naively expecting it to be similar to the way it was when he left.  Thade is worshipped here for the same reasons he was feared/worshipped on his planet -- he is the alpha-warrior and leader of the apes.  What happens on Earth is similar to what happened on Boulle's Soror.  Human minds melted after too much television, pornography, and sports/entertainment.   Though Leo eventually went back in time to return to earth, he still had to make the trip back to earth and that means hundreds of years have passed while he's been in space.  Thade's legend is well-known throughout the cosmos at this point and we should not be surprised to see him worshipped on earth as well, where he's obviously been the inspiration for the ape takeover.One last note: during the feast at the senator's home early in the movie, we hear one of the table guests exclaim (paraphrase):  \"We're getting lazy, we should be careful lest the humans take over.\"  This is a nice homage to Boulle, who works the reverse angle in his novel when the human electroshock subjects reveal through historical memory that it was the human race that dropped the ball the first time around.The lesson is clear:  let your mind melt and you will perish.  I think the homage just mentioned actually telegraphs the plot of the sequel, in which the apes will be corrupted by the same mindless entertainments that corrupt us today.  Leo will lead a revolt and a new breed of humans -- men and women hungry for literature and learning -- will rise up and reclaim their planet.",

Each ape actually looks different from each other one, and they all move like you would expect an ape/human hybrid to move. The acting is great, especially Tim Roth.  His character Thade is one of my favorite parts of this entire movie.  I have to say I think that the only real weak link is Mark Wahlberg.  I usually like Marky Mark too, but this time his performance seems to fall a little flat.  I know alot of people probably aren't going to like this one.  Some people will mistake certain aspects as being corny, but that can be said about just about every piece of Science Fiction in existence.  The end is good, maybe not as good as the beginning of the original, but good nonetheless.  Overall I enjoyed this film a great deal and recommend it to all.",

            "content": "The new installment to the \"Planet of the Apes\" saga is a skillfully made film.  It combines a new adaptation to the familiar story of the original. However, it is by no means a remake.  The new movie has some very striking similarities, but is a new and different film.  This \"Planet of the Apes\" uses enough of the now famous content, that made the original great, to sell it to the older fans, as well as a new story to win over a younger generation which would not properly understand the social gripping message of the 60's version.  This film is clearly Tim Burton's best work.  The cast does a very good job, especially considering all of the makeup.  Charlton Heston steals the show as Gen. Thade's father, proving once again that no one does a \"Planet of the Apes\" film like Mr. Heston. Despite the overall excellent nature of this film, it is flawed in one major aspect.  This film has no star quality.  No offense to Mark Wahlberg, but he is not capable of carrying a summer blockbuster by himself.  Mr. Wahlberg is a fine up and coming actor, but he has not yet reached the point in his career (and maybe never will) where he can open a film by himself, let alone a major film such as \"Planet of the Apes\".  Wahlberg tries his best to play the reluctant hero, but the key word is \"tries\".  He lacks the major presence that Charlton Heston provided in the original.  Wahlberg is unable to sell himself as an \"action star\".  His lines are not believable, and are quite commonplace.  In order for such a film to have been properly done it would have required a big time action star.  That star could only have been Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose name was mentioned for the Wahlberg role. His presence in the film would have made a big summer hit into a mega summer blockbuster.  Just imagine Arnold delievering the lines \"I'll be back..you dirty apes!\" If the casting directors have any sense they will make sure that Arnold is back when they make the sequel. Despite all of this it was still a very entertaining film. 3.5 out of 4 stars.",

So I suppose my learned skepticism somewhat saved Planet of the Apes for me.  I had absolutely no expectations for this film, after having enjoyed the first one so much.  And of course, the new version does not live up to the original.  The original was filled with layers of political, racial, and sociological themes; and it had an incredible ending.  And who can match the tortured, almost humorous essence of Heston.  Oh, and it was fun too. \nBut the greatness of the original does not make the new version a bad movie. In fact, it was in my opinion quite an enjoyable movie.  It surpasses the original in terms of its visual effects. While the theme/story is more simplistic, it is very well told; it moves very fast and fluidly, yet is not so packed with chaotic action (see Armageddon) that it does not allow for slower moments that can be saviored.  For example, there is a great scene with Heston in a cameo.  I wonder if he knew what he was saying when he said it: humans are deceptive and dangerous and are even more so because they have guns; beware of them?  Not exactly the NRA's mantra.  Anyways, he had a great cameo.  There are many other humorous moments as well.  Basically, the movie did not take itself seriously.  It tipped its hat to the original without trying to mimick its feel.  It is obvious Burton wanted to have some fun with this movie, paying tribute to the original while at the same time trying to give this movie its own unique perspective.  I believe he succeeded and I believe that that is the movie's saving grace.",

The only \"ape\" character who is able to look convincingly like a gorilla rather than a man in make-up is Michael Clarke Duncan. Now, of course, one could make the same complaint about the original, but one of the stated reasons for remaking an SF film is that the special effects have progressed to the point where the story can be better told. Not the case here.....Because the film relies so heavily on production design and quick editing, the viewer is never able to invest in the story or the characters. Mr. Whalberg, you are no George Taylor, though in some calculated way, I'm sure you appeal to a certain demographic.This is a film contrived by marketeers and sociologists. Apparently, Mr. Burton shot 6 endings in an attempt to find the one that would guarantee the most box office. The one that made it onto the print is non-sensical (unless it is explained in a sequel). If you want time travel, Star Trek has done it ad nauseum over the past few years. Mr. Burton isn't doing anything new here.The original film had facets and layers. No characters were truly evil, none truly good. George Taylor was a cynic and a loner. There were aspects of adventure in the story, aspects of suspense, social commentary, comedy, all done in a subtle enough manner, with enough change in theatrical pacing to make it a classic that still stands up to repeated viewing today.The new film is \"good guys vs. bad guys\", there's the requisite central antagonist, Mr. Whalberg's sole motivation appears to be saving his pet chimp, and his only expression is a blank stare.Lines from the original film (there are two of them that I could tell) have been thrown in, and delivered with little context, and therefore not fitting into film. They serve as a reminder of the superiority of the first series.The marketeers have called this a 'reimagining' of the first film. Mr. Burton likes to 'reimagine' other people's work: Batman, Sleepy Hollow, Mars Attacks. His one good film was an affectionate (therefore, non-moneymaking)tribute to the \"B\" movie film-maker Ed Wood.Mr. Wood would be proud of this remake. Both Burton and Wood share an 'understanding' of SF, and this is a film that stands proudly and comparably with \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\". Congratulations Tim and Fox. Well done!!!!!",

(A nice touch that George Lucas did in the Phantom Meanace).Did you catch the meaning of CALIMA? CAution LIve ANimals, easy to miss!If the apes wanted no one to go to CALIMA, why was the it so poorly protected?If it was the center of their universe for thousands of years and so easy to reach, why were there no apes AT ALL there? Wouldn't they come to \"worship\" at least?How come Davidson all of a sudden cares about this kid? Just exactly what was the point of having him stay behind the ship? Who was the kid? What the heck was going on there?Did you care at all when Kris Kristofferson got killed? Nope!\nDid you care a little when a couple of guys in Davidson's original band got iced? Only a little.What was the point (from the writer's point of few) of taking out the (cool) gun? He brought back later, anyway. With two guns, that might have been fun. One guy shooting up himself was just stupid, didn't you think?Just exactly where did all the aps and all the humans come from? I mean, seriously, would the humans live so close to the apes if they were rounding them up as pets and slaves? Give me a break! I'd have found a better neighborhood.  (On top of that, there's a little problem of genetic diversity here of there were no natural apes and humans on this planet in the first place. But, we'll give Tim poetic license on that).So, the GOD arrives, literally out of the sky in a space ship. NO ONE is scared of this technology AT ALL. They recognize this is a prophecy come true yet they have NO PROBLEM letting the UNCLEAN Davidson walk right up to their DEITY.  Then, they proceed to beat the daylights out of the diety nearly kill him.  (I guess that answers why no one was worshiping). Question: Is there a story here or not? No!Would a good alternate title be \"Crouching Humans, Hidden Monkeys?\"Who exactly would have the Lincoln-esq Thade have liberated to get the statue? I think it might have been humans, don't you? So, maybe Davidson didn't do as bad as is implied. (But, now, it looks as if he should have stuffed the girl into the capsule with him, eh?)How did this movie get made?

            "content": "I guess I should warn you that there are a few minor spoilers in this review. So if you don't want to know even minor details about the plot, do NOT read on... (but judging how much money the film made over the weekend, most of you have already seen this film...twice.)I went in to Tim Burton's PLANET OF THE APES really expecting to see one of the worst films ever. This was a surprise since I love every Tim Burton film I've ever seen (definitely not counting Batman 3 & 4 which he produced, but had no other evolvement and it shows). From his first big screen film Pee Wee's Big Adventure, to my favorite Ed Wood, to the recent Sleepy Hollow, I've admired his style and direction...though most of his films seem to have been edited overnight in some parts.His latest is a \"more faithful to the original book\" adaptation of the french book; Planet Of The Apes...and just so you don't get upset while watching the film, the book is NOT set on Earth like the original was. In case you were born in the eighties and never knew the joys of playing with the Mego toys of the same name back in the 70s, I'll explain the basic story. A guy gets trapped in a space-storm that flings him to a world where monkeys rule and people don't. Yep, that about sums it up.The book was adapted to film in the 70s starring Charlton Heston and a bunch of similar guys with beards. I believe that the original's sequel Return To The Planet Of The Apes won a special achievement award for Best Beard in a Speaking Role. Not much is known about what happened to those beards after the 70s. I'm sure we'll see an \"E True Hollywood Story\" about those beards one day, but I digress...Actually one of the first things that sticks out in this new version of Planet Of The Apes is the lack of beards on most of the human characters. Mark Whalberg (of Boogie Nights) plays beardless human astronaut Leo who trains geneticly engineered monkeys to fly spaceships. When one of his monkeys gets lost, he follows it into a space-storm that hurls him to the planet below. This is where the story most of you all know kicks in. Leo is hunted down by human-like bearded apes. Soon he meets a human woman named Daena, her father, a chimpanzee woman who believes in Human Rights, and an orangutan slave trader who deals in humans.So basically we get a peek into Ape society and meet General Thade played by Reservoir Dog star Tim Roth who hates all humans, but loves to jump around and make monkey noises.I won't give any more story away, but lets just say that man and monkey fight and surprisingly the Apes do NOT throw poo. If there is one way to catch a human off guard it would be to throw \"monkeypoo\" (which, by the way, is my 1 word review of the film Monkeybone) at them. Actually, if they did throw copies of the movie Monkeybone at the humans they would have surly been destroyed much like our own society almost was when it was released.Ok so I liked this movie... There were a few things that bugged me like the make-up on the female \"apes\" and all the \"wired\" jumping and, of course, some of the dialogue. But in the end it's a movie about a planet where apes rule and people don't (see 3rd paragraph above). It's campy and yet interesting.Mark Wahlberg continues to bury his Marky Marc image in a role in which Keanu Reaves would have said \"Whoa\" a lot like in all his films.Helena Bonham Carter's Ari character is actually interesting unlike Estella Warren's Daena character who stands around gape-mouthed for most of the film.The make-up is excellent. Can't get much better `cept for the female apes that I mentioned already.And, YES, there is a \"twist\"...just not the one you remember. Check it out. Also look for cameos by Danny DeVito and George Clooney. If you blink, you'll miss them. And also look for interesting twists on dialogue from the original film.So, again, I went to this film with the most lowered expectations due to a lot of bad pre-press, but came out liking the film a lot. I'm actually going to see it again and you KNOW I'll buy the DVD when it comes out too. So go...enjoy. Buy candy at the liquor store and sneak it in. $2.00 for candy?

The lifelike and varied ape makeup, combined with the effort that has gone into making the apes... well, apes, and more individual than the oppressed humans can manage to be, makes their society utterly believable. Helena Bonham Carter delicately brings out the character of Ari, shewing us that a full face prosthesis need not handicap a great actress, and Tim Roth camps it up completely as Thade (which you may not think is a good point).On to the bad parts. Mark Wahlberg does nothing to arouse my sympathy, or indeed interest. It doesn't help that his character is halfway between James T Kirk and Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, and does not develop at all throughout the film. The plot is stupid, ridiculous and yet utterly predictable, and forces characters to act unrealistically. The eventual resolution is contrived and unsatisfying, it gives no extra depth to anything, in fact, it seems to be the only way the writers could think of to finish off the plot. The ending is tacked-on and inconsistent.I would recommend avoiding this film unless you really have nothing better to do, and no expectations of intelligence. But stylistically it's worth something, and Helena Bonham Carter's performance is worth adding a couple of marks, so reluctantly, i give it 4 out of 10.",

            "content": "Before seeing this film, I was a fan of Tim Burton's famous work such as Beetle juice, Batman, Edward Scissor hands, and Mars Attacks! When I learned that this move was directed by him (I didn't see the film until 3 years after it came out), I was dying to see it. I had watched the 1968 original and was familiar with the original novel. After seeing it, in all honesty it was the biggest waste of garbage I had ever seen. Oh sure the make up and special effects were good, they always are, that's why they spend so much time working on that stuff rather than writing a good plot or developing characters. The dialogue was cheap and the acting was more wood than a redwood tree! Mark Wahlburg's acting was so out of place for this film, throughout the entire film, he really shows no emotion and when he does it's only for a split second. I wasn't expecting something like that of Charleston Heston's epic role in the original (heck his role in this film was only minor yet beats the crap out of the rest of the cast), but I'd at least expect some effort to be put in it. All the characters really just filled out the stereotypical roles seen in the real world today from the war mongering general, the peaceful animal loving hippie, the rebellious doubtful sergeant, the ignorant leaders, the royal waitress, and the bumbling idiots the humans. The plot was as straight forward as a derailed train. Everything was just hoping around and far fetched even for a movie like this. It is basically this, guy lands on planet, gets caged, frees a bunch of prisoners, goes through a chase in the desert, rounds up prisoners, rebels, uses rocket buried in the sand for centuries to blast away charging army. Than monkey comes from the sky and everyone is best friends with each other. h yeah, Apes can not swim, because... well that's never explained. And the end was the worst attempt at a twist I have ever seen. And it's bad when the director in the commentary couldn't even make heads or tails out of it. I was relieved when the end credits came. That was the last Tim Burton film I have seen and since seeing this utter failure I avoid all his films, even the ones I liked before. If you don't want to take my word for it, fine, but don't blame me for wasting your time with this sad excuse for a movie.",

Therefore I was prepared to accept the new movie on its own merits.Even so, I walked out of the theater scratching my head and wondering why they'd bothered doing it at all.Yes, I love Tim Burton.  Yes, the costumes, make-up, and sets are amazing. Yes, it was fun, had some good lines, and featured some marvelous acting on the part of Helena Bonham Carter, who was remarkably believable in her chimpanzee-inspired mannerisms and movements.Other than that...so what?Without spoiling too much of either movie, I have to say that the message of the original was far more intelligent.  It really made you stop and think: who's right, who's wrong, do we have any right to judge the apes or should we learn lessons about our own failings in theirs?  This one was merely simplistic summer-movie fare, with a predictable plotline I was correctly forecasting as little as five minutes into the movie.(Yes, and I easily guessed the \"surprise twist ending\" everyone is raving about.  Yawn.  You want a REAL surprise twist ending, go watch \"Sixth Sense\" or \"Unbreakable.\")Last but not least, I find it interesting that Heston's character was likeable precisely because he WAS such a crusty cynical old b*****d. Wahlberg's \"brash hotshot pilot\" persona conforms to almost every \"hero\" stereotype in the book...and, thus, is entirely bland and uninteresting, though I do not knock him as an actor.  I DO give the writer(s) full credit for not going the obvious route with the annoyingly \"perfect leggy blonde\" potential love interest, but other than that...well, not much I can say.In short: rent the original and pretend you don't know the ending.

The film starts of promisingly enough, but one we get to the planet of the apes it is as if the scriptwriters figured just shooting scenes of flying apes and a ragtag group of humans trying to escape (Hmmm sounds like something from the Wizard of Oz) would be enough. F-One feels sorry for the cast for having to muddle their way through this script, but then cast is not up to the task of even handling this script. Only Tim Roth as the evil General Thade turns in a great menacing performance, and winds up out acting the rest of the cast. D (Roth A+)And let's no even talk about the ending! Anyone who has watched any sci-fi films involving wormholes, etc, must have seen where this film was going from the opening few minutes.

At first, this seemed like a brilliant idea. Who better to direct a new version of Planet of the Apes than the odd yet brilliant Tim Burton?Well, great ideas often do not lead to great finished products.And that is what this film really is. It is not a great movie. It is an average, sometimes funny(especially Paul Giamatti), sometimes thrilling(battle sequences are amazing) film. But as a whole? Average.\nThe problems with the movie all come from the fact that Burton did not know exactly how he wanted to re-imagine the movie. Should it be a serious, sci-fi version? The last 20 minutes seem to point in this direction. Should it be a \"spoofesque\" movie that doesn't take itself too seriously? The entire middle section of this movie seems to point in this direction.In the end, this film is confused and awkward. Tim Burton wants you to like this movie, it's clear the entire time. Unfortunately, the acting is strained and the movie too muddled to ever develop into a classic.I am suggesting that this movie is worth renting or going to the theater, but it's not worth owning(unless you are a huge Burton fan). This movie is better than Mars Attacks and Sleepy Hollow, but it does not even approach Batman or Edward Scissorhands.I give this movie ** out of **** stars.

The special effects were great, the scenery was realistic, and the cast seemed to be very talented (opinion not based on this movie). However, they were lacking in one MAJOR department: the script! As someone said before, I agree that you and a bunch of your friends could have written a better screenplay for the movie than these talented, well-paid writers did.There were many interesting directions this movie *could* have taken and didn't. I noticed that in the beginning of the movie, the woman scientist on the spaceship mentions that with chimps the female is dominant sexually. Of course, this led me to think; `What an interesting twist to the movie! The female apes could be really domineering instead of the males!' But instead the comment seemed to hold no relevancy to the rest of the film whatsoever! It turns out there were hardly any female apes at all, and those were hardly very aggressive.Maybe I shouldn't have gone to see the movie with such high hopes for a great flick, but I did. I am officially insulted at spending good money on a film that seemed to have lots of possibility but no delivery. For those of you who haven't seen the movie and plan to, my advice to you is to go into the movie with lowered expectations and maybe you'll appreciate it more than I did.5 out of 10",

As many have said, the acting (at least of the apes) was astonishing.

Yes, the ending was strange and didn't follow logically whereas for the most part the rest of the movie was logically self-consistent. However, it was a good ending and I'm willing to reserve judgment to see how they develop it in the next film. My few quibbles with the movie were these: * I didn't see any gorillas on the space station and such large apes seem entirely inappropriate to the space mission, so where did the gorilla breeding stock come from? * I realize the apes are stronger than humans, especially the gorillas, but when they hit someone, the impact of the punch was ridiculous even considering their strength. If you could hit as hard as 5 Mike Tyson's on his best punch, you couldn't even come close to getting the target rocketing through the air like they did. And if you hit that hard, it would seem to be instant death but wasn't in the movie. I know, I know, Hollywood needs to really exaggerate. * The year was something like 2032 that it all began, right? Well, there is no way the world will even be close technologically and space achievement in 31 years. Transportation pods smaller than a compact car that can land on an earthlike planet and launch again? The apes genetically engineered to be very smart? The military has a massive space station?                This would be more believable in 2132. Enjoy, Jon",

            "content": "There is a certain perception that is suggested when Tim Burton takes the helm of a movie. That perception is that you'll see something very different than the usual lint that's produced after good movies are tumbled about in the Hollywood dryer; with all their wrinkles removed, sickly pseudo fresh (like a Downey fabric sheet that touts it smells of `Fresh Rain' yeah right), and softened as not to cause chaffing. But Burton is different. Burton has vision. Burton is a visionary. I have uttered those words before in reference to his litany of twisted, incredibly clever and dark films. Burton's early shorts, Vincent and Frankenweenie, are things born of a mind and an eye that's capable of seeing the world through gray colored lenses. Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, Batman, Mars Attacks\u0085every one of these movies had that vision\u0085that dig up the dirt up and put it under the light feel.Which is why then, with Planet of the Apes, I can claim as the only explanation for such appalling drivel is that Burton completely and utterly sold out for the lure of a `Big Budget Hollywood Summer Blockbuster'. Who better than Burton to `revisit' P of A (as Burton nearly screams in every interview that this is NOT a remake), one of the darkest and engaging sci-fi films made? But, here's the question: if this is not intended to be a remake, then why not cast that famous Burton vision on this piece and make it something more strange, more\u0085dare I say\u0085human? Take Burton's other films\u0085the hero is most often an odd, socially maladjusted, misunderstood, feared, decidedly melancholy, alone, scared and scarred, but somehow better than the lot of others around him. His characters, in their own eerie way, show the more benevolent side of human nature.So, then Mark Wahlberg's self-serving Leo in P of A is someone NOT from Burton's world. So, then the `plot' (and I use the word `plot' with hesitation) of P of A is also something not Burtonesque. Thus the whole experience is such a total let down that it makes one wonder if big budgets and high profile stars stifles anything creative as easily as a 40ft wet blanket thrown on a single lit match (enter into evidence America's Sweetheart). Burton usually strives on lancing the boil of our perceptions and getting to the raw under layer of cultures\u0085and P of A (the original was a hearty, if campy, examination and damnation of the snobbery of humans to dub ourselves as rulers of any planet) would seem to give Burton the chance to perform a wonderful social surgery.The gray colored glasses though were replace by the $green$ colored lenses, and so we are left with just another shell of a movie. The only vision Burton can see, for what are supposed to be genetically enhanced apes, is that they will emulate human social customs\u0085they will form armies, they will have a senate, conduct dinner parties and sport Jackie O bobs; this is visionary? Hardly. In the end all we learn from Burton's P of A is the same thing we see in too many movies and the same thing we see in nearly every nook and cranny of the world; whoever can beat one's chest the loudest, whoever can physically beat the other side down, whoever has better weaponry will ultimately prevail. Burton had the chance to show a better way\u0085instead he merely aped his lesser peers and created another loud, ridiculously expensive and mindless testament to violence.",

There really not a lot of action in this film except for some fight scenes toward the latter half of the movie. Looking back at the original Planet of the Apes, you could see where there was a definate plot and goal. This remake doesn't have that cohesion. It does work well with the relationship between Whalberg and Carter. But the relationship between Warren and Whalberg develops too quick after the demise of Kristofferson. In that type of primitive society, Kristofferson could be father or husband but we don't know because Warren just says \"my family\". It's too obvious that the writers used her as competition for Carter. In fact you really see no reason for Kristofferson to even be in the movie. Whalberg's involvement with the primitive humans comes too quickly also. It's like they cut out a part where Whalberg should find out what this planet is for the sake of the length of the movie. The fight scenes seem inconsistant. One minute an ape kills a human with one blow but our hero (Whalberg) takes several blows and falls. But somehow,again, Whalberg maintains the common sense he has in many of his movies. Somehow through all his movies, writers give him lines that make him act (or react) realisticly. While the others have lines and actions that don't seem be what it would be if it was real, Whalberg comes in and acts like the only one sensible or realisitic being.

Tim Burton did a fine job visually, but there can be no comparison between the '01 Apes and the '68 version.Dramatically speaking, scene for scene, these newcomers to the Apes myth have dropped the ball. Where are the scenes with \"Leo\" confronting the Ape Senate? Wondering, along with us as an audience how this \"Ape\" world could have come to fruition? Those narrative points are sorely missing here-- so Leo becomes a most passive hero. Do we care for him? Do we follow his point of view with much fervor? Not much. But we dig the visuals, and we don't like Thade too much, so we go along with it. Ari is a breeze of fresh air, for sure. But they dropped the ball when it comes to nailing the apes v. human conflict at the climax. I'll take Taylor with his rifle holding Dr. Zais hostage any day.Am I nuts? Where's the drama in this new version? What are the stakes involved? What happened to Cornelius holding the doll that mutters \"mama\"\"? I love Danny Elfman, too.

The acting by the human-played apes was marvelous, mannerisms such as hoots and grunts in amusement, anger, or excitement were quite well done.  Burton was also able to create a scientifically logical theory behind the concept, engineering the thought that the primates were tampered with in the human image, and taught English when they were genetically engineered, which all of course was fantastical but eerily plausible.  The ape culture was intriguing as well.There was moments where I was saying, \"Wow, that was a really great idea\".  However, there was also times when I found myself saying, \"Jesus Burton, not that!\", although the latter was less common.\nAll throughout his career, Tim Burton was trying as hard as he could to balance entertainment with his cinematic vision, and this time he struck gold.\nAll in all, Planet of the Apes is not the kind of remake that people who loathe action films would enjoy, nor people who despise art films, but if you have no preference (Or you can at least stand both), the new Planet of the Apes is truly great science fiction! My only complaints were the blonde supermodel (Paper thin character), and some really lame dialogue(More character developement would have been nice too).  Both a B movie and a cinematic marvel (If it's possible).Ah, and on a final note, Helena Bonham Carter (the period-piece-princess) made a rather attractive chimpanzee!",

            "content": "Like almost every viewer of the latest \"Planet of the Apes\" who has chosen to comment on the film, I too have been disappointed by the latest version, seeing how it falls short of the freshness that Tim Burton brought to many of his films. In some respects though, I am not as harsh in my criticism as others.It is naive to compare Burton's latest film to his more offbeat successes like \"Ed Woods,\" \"Edward Scissorhands,\" and \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\". Those were personal projects, conceived and driven by him, not projects like the \"Batman\" films which were studio-driven and intended, first and foremost, as money machines. As such, it was highly unlikely that he would have been allowed a great deal of license. (Remember the fate of his planned version of \"Superman\" with Nicholas Cage? I'm sure Burton does.)However, Burton *can* be faulted in two places. First, the one point in the story where originality and daring might have played a role was in the Leo/Ari/Daena relationship. I wouldn't call it a love triangle--even though it was promoted as such--since Wahlberg's Leo never registers any particular emotion towards either female. Part of this must be attributed to the script which doesn't give him any lines or action to suggest attraction towards either Bonham-Carter's Ari or Estella Warren's Daena (though that a more resourceful actor could have communicated something nonverbally).Despite having Bonham-Carter display obvious interest in Wahlberg, Burton fails to follow through by having his Leo reciprocate (or at least display ambivalence about a female chimp flirting with him).\nThe studio's reported objections to a graphic love scene are not surprising. What *is* strange is why Burton introduced the idea and then failed to develop it. Certainly a skillful director can explore the idea of such an unusual relationship without resorting to explicit sex; but Burton just teases us with the idea and then drops it.Equally disappointing is the ending. While I will not divulge it, I think it is enough to say that it has no meaningful connection to what precedes it. A \"problematic\" ending of a film at least allows workable interpretations. Burton's ending does not. A *major* flaw in any sort of story.",

Edward Scissorhands has been his best so far- I think because it was his concept, it was so bizarre and yet he made a boy with Scissorhands the most emotionally engaging story I have ever seen. As the critics said \"beauty told in simplicity\".Planet of the Apes (POTA) is very distinctive from the opening credits as a Burton film. There are elements of 2001: A Space Odyssey and other little movie references to be found throughout the film. Wahlberg is ideal as the Taylor/Leo character. As an actor he can't go as far as some others but the role is suitable for him. The supporting cast are excellent as apes/chimps/gorillas- the whole bag of bananas. While some will see their antics and comments as corny or cliche, keep in mind this is Burton's own vision (reimagining- that itself is now a cliche!) of Boulle's original novel \"Monkey Planet\".The social comments are very clever and will have you chuckling at certain points. Look out for a classic moment where Burton's partner Lisa Marie performs an exotic ape dance for her man, err ape, err orangutang. The make up is amazing and the set design of Ape City is very stylish. The only quarm I have with it, is it comes across as more like \"Ape Housing Commission\" because it seems so small or claustrophobic.The story is strong, but missing certain power in some parts- however where one element weakens, Burton knows how to fill the screen with something else to take your attention away. I have no doubt in saying Rick's makeup will score him a 2002 Oscar at the Mann Chinese Theatre, not to mention a few others possibly for other areas....And the ending. Oh, the ending. Many will not like the ending, but many will be very intrigued. I thought the ending was unreal- totally Burton!I definately reccomend you go see this film. It is one of the better films of the year. It is not Burton's best, and in a way he has slipped. But we are talking about Burton here, so rest assured he will quickly pick himself back up and create something BRILLIANT again!

Sure you see the year in the ship fly up, but I still don't believe he went into the future.  I believe he actually goes into the distant past, on Earth.  Why else would there be humans (and monkeys, as noted in one conversation) on that planet?  All the humans on the ship were killed by Zemos.  It's too hokey to think there are humans on another planet.  By the time Marky Mark gets there, the humans will have learned the English language that the apes had been speaking all this time, thanks to the brain enhancements the ship scientists had been making to the apes.At the end, Leo goes back to the present-time of the movie (2100something, I don't remember) and lands on Earth, as the monitor on his ship stated.  He never notices he landed on Earth the first time, because he was going after Alpha Pod, and was busy trying to land safely, etc.  And in one scene in the beginning, the people in the Obeuron start getting the signals on their monitors that are showing all the events of Earth's past - hence, giving Thade and his future generations, the idea to construct things like the Lincoln Memorial and cop cars, etc (ok, it's strectching a bit, but it still works).So basically, if Leo didn't chase after the chimp, thus having the crew chase after him and crash land on ancient Earth, and if humans weren't trying to manipulate the Apes' brains chemically, the Apes would not have evolved, and in the end they would not have taken over the Earth.The movie, especially the ending, which I thought was a little silly, but still satisfied me, makes a lot of sense when you think that he actually never did go into the future in the first place, but the past instead.Which brings this movie to the same lesson that the original one did: Humans are always F-ing themselves over....Oh yeah, I gave it a 9 out of 10.",

Isn't the fundamental rule for science fiction/drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief.  POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning, suckering us in, but thereinafter Mr. Burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains.  The over the top libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter's chimp, the worthlessness of the humans' lockup, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary skills of horsemanship (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt), the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable.  Mark Wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down.  Compare to the original, in which Chuck Heston's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events.  The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation, and we never really wonder about his well being.  Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in real jeopardy.  Tim Burton should have used some of the f/x budget for some competent screenwriting.  In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats. Let them walk.  Trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in Planet of the Apes 2001.  I'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent.

Leo(Wahlberg) was well... about what I expected from Wahlberg (He was a better Dirk Diggler then Leo Davison), and Daena(Warren) was either to attractive for her part, or should have had more lines, (i may have enjoyed this movie more if her and her family were developed a little more) but whose to complain.

I thought that with today's effects technology, and a story idea as compelling as Planet of the Apes, I thought there was no way this could fail. But boy was I wrong. There is utterly no character development aside from pointing out to us who are the villains and who are the heroes. There was no motivation for General Thade's (Tim Roth) hatred or Ari's (Helena Bonham Carter) great compassion. To call the plot shallow would be to imply that there was any substance at all. And all the inside jokes concerning the original series got old, too. However, nice touch having Charlton Heston appear in a cameo as General Thade's dying father. Mark Wahlberg, who has consistently turned in very good performances in films like \"The Perfect Storm\" and \"Fear,\" falls flat with a one-note character stolen from the pages of a comic book.Sure, the effects were great and the costumes were superb, but no matter how much make-up they pancaked onto my grandfather at his funeral, he was still lifeless, as was this film. All in all, a disappointment; no drama, no suspense, no depth of plot. Just another forgettable action film. My rating: D.",

            "content": "I was only seven years old when the original \"Planet of the Apes\" was released in 1968 and, compared to other films of that era (\"2001, A Space Odyssey,\"  \"Bullitt,\"  \"You Only Live Twice,\" etc.) I was able to recognize \"Planet\" for what it was: pure, unadulterated schlock, and boring schlock at that.  The sorry parade of Ape movies that followed into the '70s was my first experience with Hollywood's \"Sequel System\" of pumping as much revenue as possible from any spavined idea that is a hit with audiences.  This may, in fact, have been an early iteration of that now-standard practice.Needless to say, I had no expectation of anything more than a mild diversion when I wandered into a matinee showing of Tim Burton's take on this shriveled old chestnut. To my surprise, and despite the fact that Mark Wahlberg sleep-walked his way through the entire movie, it worked a lot better than the original.  General Thade (Tim Roth) is by far the most engaging character in the movie, and the only one that overcomes his ape makeup with an identifiable personality. I was almost rooting for HIM by the end of the movie.Burton's portrayal of the preening, officious Ape Elite and their personal habits is a sly look at some of our own human foibles. I recognized a couple of ex-bosses during those scenes. Original cast member and current NRA President Charleton Heston has a cameo that becomes hilarious when he shows son Thade his \"proof\" of human ingenuity. I wonder how many viewers missed the humor in that because they are ignorant of Heston's NRA activities? It's refreshing to see an actor of his age and station who is able to poke fun at himself.Happily, this \"homage\" to the original carries enough originality to keep it interesting (let's just say there was never a Statue of Liberty on this planet) and has better pacing and a lot more action than the original. The effects are seamless and there is enough humor to break up any monotony.The movie climaxes about 10 minutes before it ends, which is too bad. The last few scenes are a total throwaway (and perhaps a foreshadowing of the dreaded Sequelitis), but hey, we can't all be Shakespeare all of the time.",

However, a smarter move on the part of the directors would have been to scrap the film, and screen the preview in theaters.  This film in the region of the worst film I have ever seen.  Mark Wahlberg, as usual, adds nothing to the film with his despicable acting and moronic facial expressions, except the impression that he is severely constipated; Tim Roth (who has contributed to such great films as Reservoir Dogs and Little Odessa) was physically painful to watch; and I still don't understand why they bothered to include Helena Carter in the cast at all.  It takes a flight of the imagination to imagine Tim Burton saying \"cut!\" on the set, and being pleased with what he had created.  Bottom line: DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS FILM.  The actors are pathetic, the new ending is as pointless as it is absurd, and Tim Burton should beat himself in the face with a frying pan for this one.",

Tim Burton's stamp is all over this movie.  However, his style (along with Danny Elfman's great music) hardly make up for one of the silliest and emptiest scripts ever.  How in the world did it take 3 people to write the cliched dialogue and come up with the completely improbable scenes that saturate this movie?  Everyone screams, \"Wow, the special effects were awesome!\" The special effects were great, but special effects do not a movie make (Phantom Menace anyone, again?). To make things worse, the ending of the movie was so open that you can see at least nine sequels coming out of it.

It seems that this film is designed for popcorn summer entertainment and it does not sell short of this intention. Tim Burton's dark vision is one of the strongest directorial forces of all time.

I'm less sure about the costumes. (Most outfits appear to look like they're made primarily from vinyl.) In many ways, it's visually stunning. A lot of the things they did with ape culture, modes of expression, even movement were very creative. Though some turned out silly, like the \"running\".The acting was, on balance, pretty good. Some of the characters were preposterous (even ignoring the ape makeup), but in particular Tim Roth and (in stark contrast) Paul Giamatti were amazing in their roles. In some sense, just the variety of personalities shown in the apes was impressive.But the story had holes in it bigger than the ones the spaceships flew through. While I understand that it's a fantasy, rather than SF, given the \"auteur\", the inconsistencies in the plot, if you will, were too much for me. I can suspend disbelief for the big things, but the details are too much to handle. (Some of these questions may be spoilers.) How did the apes become masters of vinyl-making, when they can't produce a decent knife? Where did the horses come from? And for that matter, where were the gorillas from? Their \"escape route\" from the city was laughable. The climactic battle was *terrible*! And the \"twist\" at the ending evoked more stupefied laughter than awed thrill.Maybe upon repeated viewing, I can gloss over these flaws, but I don't think so.",

Where the original Apes film (note that I only refer to the first of the original series...no business involving underground A-bomb zealots or Ricardo Montalban as a circus master in this review, thank you very much) was more character driven and used social and political issues as its driving force, Burton opts for a richly visualized, humor-laced action film that features more Saturday-matinee gusto than most films I've seen in a long while. It's a different flavor of ice cream from the first folks, and it's still tasty. And while I won't give away the much-talked-about twist ending--which I quite enjoyed--I managed to find a perfectly logical (though mightily implausible) explanation for how it could have happened...and before the final credits even began rolling (based on elements laid out earlier in the film.) Misters Burton and Broyles must have done something right if I reached such a conclusion that quickly...and if I'm right, and they've done what I think they've done for the reasons I think they did them in that finale, I personally would love to see a sequel.

There is NO possible way that the events at the end of the film could have followed anything that came before it.

A great looking film, well delivered by Tim Burton, who was the ideal director to carry the primate adventures into 2000.Burton brought subtle humour to the film (which I had anticipated being a lot darker than it turned out). The orang-utan love pastiche, the little girl as a pet, and the two card playing apes - one calling the other a \"Cheater\" (Cheetah).A lot of acknowledgements were given to it's father film. Several quotes and a cameo Heston. I preferred the fact that the apes on Burton's planet were unarmed, other than with clubs, the original (especially the TV series had them kitted out with all sorts of weaponry). It was a shame one of the original underlying mantra of \"ape shall never kill ape\" was dropped, but by and large it stayed relatively true to it's original.Overall: A good re-working. 8/10",

            "content": "WARNING! PLOT POINTS REVEALED! Hmm, Tim Burton tries his hand at a remake - sorry, \"re-imagining\" - of the 1968 \"classic\". Inevitably, comparisons to the original abound, however, not having seen the original thankfully precludes me from such comparisons (though, yes, we all know it was the Earth. damn them).Burton's film is helped firstly by his imagination. The ape abodes and milieu are beautifully and naturally presented. The considerable advances in makeup technology allow more depth of character to be achieved when it comes to the citizens of the ape community, and the sheer variety of simian forms and facial expressions is itself impressive. The only quibble I would highlight is the \"muffling\" of the actor's voices and the obvious difficulty which they had speaking through the stuff, however this was not too distracting. Wahlberg meanwhile is a sound action hero, but provides little sympathy or interest for the viewer. Bonham Carter is well drawn as the radical humanist ape, but the \"semi-romance\" between her and Wahlberg seems half-hearted and therefore uninteresting. A rivalry between her and the ridiculously-costumed human love interest is just a waste of time, and the girl really serves no other purpose but eye candy and therefore becomes annoyingly superfluous to proceedings. Roth, however, is superb as General Thade, chewing scenery like nobody's business and delightfully hamming his way through revenge dialogue and lots of shouting and leaping about. His body movements too are by far the most excellently observed.Clearly Burton does not wish us to take the film too seriously, given the comic touches which he has added, which include a slightly farcical (and very predictable) lampoon of the Lincoln memorial. The ending, however, does indeed seem tacked-on - useful for interchangeability (he apparently filmed 4 different ones) but not so good for continuity. Considering Burton had a choice of endings, it would appear that he chose the least original, however, it is refreshingly surprising to find that the ending is not as upbeat as may have been expected from the more sentimental proceedings of the rest of the film. All round this is still a good watch, but you can't help thinking that there was far more potential in the material. Burton avoids re-hashing the political stance of the original, however the result is visually stunning and well imagined but with little beneath the surface. Roth steals the show and provides most of the interest throughout the film, and it's a shame that Wahlberg and Bonham Carter never get much to work with.",

At the end of the original, we realized that he was on earth after all. Simple as that. But this movie leaves me with so many questions that I am counting down the days till the next one is released. I compare the ending of this movie to that of the original Star Wars.....abrupt. But I did indeed enjoy the movie, for several reasons. One was the great special effects and terrific Make-up and Costume usage. (Give em the Oscars now). I had to keep reminding myself there were humans under all that make-up. I didnt care too much for the beginning, it just seemed a little far-fetched, like this might have been the best idea out of a bunch of bad ideas on how to begin the film. Man risks life for monkey? As it went on, we saw the viciousness of General Thade and wondered \"Whats up his butt\"? Although thoroughly p***ed off the entire movie, Thade does display a side of him that is very human. His scene with Heston as his father bleeds with politics, because the one possesion he has of the humans is a gun, and considering its Heston, Pres of the NRA, I couldnt concentrate on what they said to each other, because I was chuckling at the Irony of this scene. Heston saying humans are dangerous for creating this kind of technology? Did I hear that right? Wow...... We have all heard of movies that are too slow. This one went too fast. I wanted more explanations, and more about the apes...the general daily life of these apes is hardly delved into, and we go into the sequels knowing very little about them, except they dont like humans and they screech a lot. The ending did leave a lot of doors open for sequels, but will this movie go down as being better than the original? Probably not. Will this movie be remembered for its stunning visual images? Yes. And thats why you should see it. Dont get too entangled in the plot...because you will be tangled for a while. Enjoy the movie, and wait for the sequels to explain what we dont know.",

The original Planet of the Apes is undoubtedly a good film with some stunning moments ( it's wonderful how a film gets elevated to the level of masterpiece when people need a reason to moan about its sequel / remake ), but the potential was in the premise for a different type of film. For all the original's strengths I think you'd be hard-pushed to claim it was exciting, or visually interesting. Tim Burton has seized the opportunity to explore these possibilites, resulting in a highly entertaining if undemanding film. As a complete redraft of the original it is ultimately a very different entity, but it in no way embarrasses  the original nor takes anything away from it. Honestly, what do the 'how dare they do this to a classic film' brigade imagine is going to happen? Do they think the original is going to cease to exist? That from now on people will only ever discuss the remake? Unlikely. There is little in this film that will cause much discussion, but then I've never heard anyone discuss the original either. And yes, the ending is obvious and not as good as the first one ( as the most known 'twist' ending of all time they could scarcely have repeated it ), but there is nothing in the original that scarcely comes close to the amusing satire on human behaviour to be found in the first half of Burton's remake. Most important of all (and this goes out particularly to those who decry the tarnishing of the original 'classic'): This movie is FUN. You can't say that for the '68 version...",

Why can't the studios just bring out the original films, instead of remaking them? I will admit that I went to see this film with as much trepidation as going to see Gus Van Sant's misguided redo of Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" a few years back. This isn't as bad as that, but it's very close. Franklin Shaffner's original 1968 film is a classic (yes, classic!).  It holds up very well today and should be seen by anyone who hasn't. The new version has none of the political and social satire that makes the original so fun to watch.  I knew that Mr. Burton wouldn't even attempt a political film, so we are left with a fairly mundane film in which our new time traveler encounters a planet ruled by apes, and then immediatly wants to get the hell out of there.  The problem is there is absolutely no danger.  Mark Wahlberg doesn't face immasculation or lobotomy like Charlton Heston faced in the original. He is only faced with a villain that hates humans, but we never find out why.  Tim Roth is quite good in the role, but we need a backstory. The film does brighten up for a few minutes at the midway point, with a brief cameo.  Let's just say it's the best acting in the film. If we are going to have to sit through remake after remake, please let's try to make a film that is inspired.  Tim Burton is a very original filmmaker, who this time out is hampered by a very poor script. If William Broyles cannot come up with anything more witty than an ape saying \"Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty human!\" then perhaps he should start working on that script for \"Apollo 13 Part 2\" What the audience should be saying is \"Keep your stinking paws off of classic movies, you damn stupid producers.\" In conclusion, I hope that Tim Burton can find some way to get the \"Batman\" franchise back from Joel Schumacher before he causes any more damage, save Michael Keaton from doing \"Jack Frost 2\" and stop screwing around with classic films from the past.

On the acting front, Tim Roth is utterly fantastic as General Thade and he just about makes up for the price of admission on his own.So what's the problem?  Well as much as I want Mark Wahlberg star to continue to rise, I just don't think he has the charisma to carry Charlton Heston's role.  Not that he was bad or anything, his acting is fine and he is certainly a lot better looking than Chuck ever was.  But is he really the brave and indignant leader of the human race who defies the apes and their dirty paws?  Maybe he would have been better as the plucky young male that defiantly chases after the hero (read George Clooney) after being told to stay behind with the others?But in Mark's defence, I don't think replacing him would have necessarily made the film any more satisfying.  This was a difficult film (conceptually) to make when you consider how highly the original is regarded.  Do you just remake it with the same emphasis of script and story, or if you are going to do something different, what do you change?So Burton does what he does best and creates a film that emphasises style over story, and action over acting (or actors).  It worked for Batman and I think it does for POTA.  Time will tell after the franchise has come and gone whether people criticise \"POTA Forever\" as not holding a candle to Burton's original!Enjoyable: 7/10",

The result is an exciting, rousing adventure with thought-provoking ideals that set it apart most of the bang and blow-up action films put out today. It manages to keep many of the elements of the original that made it so enduring while adding new twists to the story. The make-up by Rick Baker is astounding. Certainly his best work to date.

It's also his character, Leo Davidson, who gets transported to the future after he dives into a nebula of testosterone.If you need me to explain the plot, go out and rent the 1968 version. But Burton and friends took liberty with adding typical action flick characters and scenes that'd not find home in the 1968 classic. Like General Thade (Tim Roth), who sets himself apart from all other Apes by talking in a series of near incomprehensible grunts. Or Karubi (Kris Kristofferson), who not surprisingly sacrifices himself to save everyone else because he's old (originality?). The movie, like the entire franchise, is hauled into a dark alley and beaten to death, kicking and screaming the entire way.\nOne thing that I loved so much about the original was it's unique score, primarily composed of drums and horns. The opening of the remake has exactly that, even better. I loved the opening score, yet that's the problem; it was only used during the opening. I faintly remember hearing it in the background for about twenty seconds later in the film. But Burton and Elfman decided to follow traditional boring action movie music, the kind that makes you want to attack the screen in a flurry of shotgun blasts.\nI sat bored through most of the movie. It's really really boring; half the scenes are dominated by General Thade bouncing off the walls and howling `Get the humans!' Or Mark Wahlberg (who can't be surprised by anything, even landing on a planet rules by tyrannical apes) heroically taking the lead with lines such as `Uhh\u0085we've gotta escape\u0085' Scenes invite groans, such as Wahlberg's insta-army. Once the escaped humans, and their ape companions have made if far enough away from the ape city, an army of humans come to join them. What's so terrible about this scene is that the army comes in from all directions simultaneously. In the next five minutes an army of humans are ready to go. Also, the ape city was walled off, with no room for expansion, what are they trying to wall out? Or in?You may remember Charlton Heston's kiss to Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) in the original. Considering that Helena Bonham Carter's character Ari is nearly a spitting image of Dr. Zira (the reason why I liked her the most in the film) it isn't surprising that she gets a little smooch from Mark Wahlberg. This is the big disappointment in Burton's `Apes'. Here is a chance to go over the top and really screw with the audience. Why didn't spaceman Leo Davidson sleep with Ari? Instead of kicking the audience in the ass, he's just invited snickers from the audience moms. If you're making a movie about a planet that's ruled by tyrannical monkey-men, how can you not go over the deep end? The 1968 version was a great movie with mixed satire, the remake fails.From the way I sound, you must think I hate this movie. The remake had some redeeming features I loved. I loved the ape costumes and how director Burton used the apes in a more primordial fashion. In the original the apes stood up and ran straight. In the remake Burton lets them run hunched over and perform bouncing leaps. The greatest thing about the remake? The ending of course, I won't spoil it, but it's genius. It doesn't make sense, it doesn't have to (just look at the title to the movie).The remake should've been titled 'Mark Wahlberg vs. the Planet of the Apes' because that's what it is. Instead of producing a social satire that explores dual bestiality and the inner workings of a nations ruled by apes (which would've been great). Burton throws a summer action movie at us with little redeeming features and wooden characters (except Ari, of course).",

Yes very much ! The special effects are superb, the monkeys are very scaring, Thade is brilliantly casted and acts like he truly is an Ape's general.Really nice when watched in a big cinema with a big screen and great Dolby surround sound!I liked it very much, although it could be a historic movie.Too bad.",

Do serious approaches exist in modern American cinema? Would \"Soylent Green\" contain line-after-line of Arnie's witticism if they were to make it now?I'm not a huge Science-Fiction fan - for the most part, because most of these films never suspend my disbelief - but they can work, and they only work when they're played straight.I know that on rewatching the original, many have commented on Heston's bad acting or the film's just plain silliness in places, but give it the one credit it deserves - it played the concept straight-as-die.Most detrimental comments of the original derive from a certain misplace nostalgia:On rewatching, we feel like the film lets us down in some way - That's because our memory of the film is stronger than the film itself, and it tells us that we should expect so much more because the incredible premise of the story has haunted so many of us for so many years.All I asked of the remake was that it treated the story respectfully.I knew I shouldn't go in there expecting a comparable ending or a scene-by-scene remake, but does a re-imagination mean we have to deal with Paul Giammatti's ridiculous slave trader, or Wahlberg's cardboard stock hero one-liners, Heston's embarrassing cameo or the Senator's wife's home-in-the-Hamptons dialogue?Take the remake's phenomenal art-direction, make-up and effects, (and Tim Roth's amazing performance) mix it with the originals heart and you'd have one hell of a movie. Instead we have an off-the-shelf, early 21st century popcorn pusher. Come on Burton, what ever happened to the kind of imagination you had when you enthralled us with Scissorhands?",

It's a slightly original action movie that supplies enough twists from the usual good guy v. bad guy flick to make it interesting.The movie makes some ham-fisted attempts at social commentary.  At one point in the movie an ape played by Paul Giamatti even exclaims \"Can we all get along?\" That line has been parodied so many times, it's almost painful.  In fact, as memory recalls Tim Burton had Jack Nicholson say the exact same line (to a much greater comic effect in \"Mars Attacks!\"  The racism allegories seem so forced, it's distracting.  You almost expect Helena Bonham Carter's ape character to organize a big human-ape chain and start singing \"I'd like to teach the world to sing\"But aside from the failed commentary, the movie succeeds.  All of the performances were above par. Tim Roth treaded the line of overacting, but never crosses it and makes a great, and perpetually angry, Thade.  Micheal Clark Duncan surprises as a loyal, and religious gorilla general.  Mark Walhburg makes a convincing action hero, although the tough guy role doesn't allow his trademark less-than-brilliant charm to come through as well.  And Estella Warren, well, she stands there with a look of constant surprise on her face. But, hey, she looks great doing it.The only thing I thought was missing was more of Tim Burton's trademark quirkiness.  If you had shown me this movie, and told me to guess the director, I would have had no clue.  Burton's eye for the odd is what excels good movies to great ones.  But, all in all, a fun couple hours.

Visually, it's stunning, but the story holds together about as well as sand castles in high tide. True, the remake does a better job of having actors, you should pardon the expression, ape the movements of simians, but little else of this movie is an improvement over the original.The movie doesn't really create an ape society so much as it takes aspects of present human society and has apes do them for satiric purposes. Not only does this joke grow old very quickly, it's frustrating to watch the movie squander the opportunity to produce real satire or explore more deeply the aspects and workings of this ape society. That could have been interesting. Unfortunately, the movie moves quickly to the action sequences so doesn't spend enough time in Ape City to do much more than give satire or social commentary lip service.Still, the movie wasn't bad up to a point, but you hit that point -- the final reel and the ending -- with all the grace and abruptness of a crash test dummy.About that end: without revealing what the end is in the remake, said end pales when compared to the end of the original. The famous surprise ending of the original was set up in that movie. It made sense within the context of the movie, because Taylor's speech at the beginning of the movie, when he's recording his log entry, lets us know that conditions exist which make the surprise at the end possible. The ending of this remake is not set up. It comes from nowhere. (Yes, I know where the ending REALLY came from, but, again, in the context of that source material, its ending made sense. In this movie, the end has no context and no set up.) The remake's end simply made no sense. Nor did the several plot contrivances or the unexplained personality-altering epiphanies of main characters which all occur within the final ten minutes. No sense other than that they were necessary to end the movie. It was as if writers William Broyles Jr., Lawrence Konner, and Mark Rosenthal and director Tim Burton realized, we only have ten minutes left, we'd better throw out logic for the sake of expedience.Then, just when you thought the ending couldn't get any worse, well...",

I myself don't understand the ending 100% and am therefore making an effort to find out what it means.Some of the plotholes pointed out by others are minor and don't really make the film any less enjoyable.  Then again, I don't fully understand what happens in the film so maybe the plotholes are significant.  Anyone who claims to understand the end can feel free to explain it to me.Possibly the poorest area of the film was the action scenes.  They just weren't exciting enough.All in all, although I didn't fully understand the ending, the film is entertaining and definitely worth seeing.  I might change my mind if I ever see the film on video, seeing how the special effects and sound effects were breath taking, but I'm sure I won't ever consider this to be a dismal pointless movie.  There's just too many clever ideas for that too happen and I can't stop thinking about the film now.My provisional rating: 7.5/10.",

The beginning is a nicely done introduction, letting you see what Mark Wahlburg's charachter is all about, he is the classic american hero He doesn't take orders well, which makes you wonder why he is in the Air force, but whatever, this Is an action movie, and the plot takes a side role to the suspense and fight scenes anyway.  The film wastes no time enslaving him, and wastes less letting him escape, it gets better after he leaves the hatefull city, and the interesting side plot about his divivded love between the gorgeous human, and the intelligent, compassionate ape.  The final battle does an excellent job of tying up all the loose ends, both by fulfilling the ancient prophecy, and taking care of the antagonist Thade. There my like for the film evaporates as Tim Burton ends it with something only one large fan of the original series has been able to explain to me as \"jumping to another dimension\". I don't know about you, but \"another dimension\" is code for, \"the writers ran out of GOOD ideas\". the biggest shock of all comes after you've seen the film, and then realize that Mr.Burton shot an additional 4 DIFFERENT endings, and THIS is the one he chose! overall: two hours of entertainment, followed by 10 minutes of mysterious crud.",

I was trully surprised by Burton's handling of this story with a respect for the original in intent.

When reviewing the deleted material on the DVD, I was puzzled why two very detailed scenes were redone which tied up a couple of loose ends the finished story failed to answer. The time differences were not great, so I am not sure why they were removed. With the exception of the choice of Mark Wahlberg (who I still feel cannot act his way out of a paper sack) Tim Burton did a superb job.

I loved the original, but understood that this was a re-imagining rather than a remake, so the movie was bound to be at least a bit different.  Burton does an excellent job of visualizing what a city built by primates might look like, vaguely jungle-like, but with buildings.  The plot is at least as good as the first one-I found that whole humans are mute angle just a bit much in the original.  This deals with rights of a stronger group over a weaker, touches on the dangers of allowing military leaders to make political decisions, and in general creates a believable world, especially when it becomes clear just how the apes got there in the first place.  (Just a note of science here-genetically altered chimps can only mean mixing DNA with a compatible species and we share 99% of the same DNA as chimps)  Carter and Roth are outstanding, details such as the gait of the apes are considered and the special effects are kept to a minimum.  I admit I am still undecided about whether or not I like the ending, but let's be honest here-Burton would be less than human if he wasn't planning on a possible sequel.  So why the uproar?  It's not every day you get to see an interspecies love story either.  There are some minor complaints I had, such as why Wahlberg was hell-bent on trying to get all the way back to Earth in what was obviously nothing more than a landing craft, but that hardly detracts from what was an enjoyable and entertaining movie. I recommend it.",

Is it a blockbuster like Armageddon, Independence day and the like? Almost. Did Shrek and even American Pie 2 make more money (which means more warm bodies and eyeballs)? You bet. Without giving away the weak plot, Tim Burton has screwed up, and had his first bad story, bad acting and his first sell-out. When analyzing a movie, I look at the director's choices: cast, editing style, photography, dialogue and subtext. Cast: Mark Wahlberg deserves a huge movie, he deserves the cash and the popularity. Michael Clark Duncan is typecast as a big tough guy. Tim Roth plays a good bad guy. Helena Bonham Carter could have been replaced by anybody. The savage humans were poorly used, and where did the female human store her MAC makeup kit? Editing: Typical use of quick cuts, swish pans, high speed shutter shots, typical of current batch of action films, usually disguising a bad action sequence. Photography: adequate, did not give away effects, slow motion overused in action sequences. Dialogue: Terrible. Granted, even the Star Wars films have crappy dialogue, but the actors pull it off. Much of the conversation is trite, and the exposition is blatant. The humans should not speak, making the astronaut all the more unusual to the humans and the apes. Subtext: Not enough of it. They hardly touch upon the whole issue of the sensitive apes wanting to free the humans. And the sappy speech by Helena about the human who came from the stars...gimme a break.That being said, the makeup was good for the men, bad for the women, overdone for the female human lead. The sets were overdone. If they had metal helmets and spears and shields, why are the cages made out of wood. The whole time for bed escape scene was too campy for this film. Finally, as a movie that keeps one's interest, this movie fails. About 30 minutes in, I wondered if it was over yet. Thank goodness it's over now. Rule the Planet? I'm afraid not, Tim. Stick to superheroes and Johnny Depp. And if you've got Kris Kristoferson on your payroll, I think the world is ready for Pee-Wee Herman and the Last Crusade.",

Of course it has its bad points like some atrocious dialogue like \"..a human from the stars\" from Helena Bonham Carter but its a more ambitious film with more content and ideas than say Jurassic Park 3 which was just another tired franchise film. The ending was a fun homage to the original and was not supposed to top that original film but is a part of Tim Burton's reimaging. Mr Burton said in a recent interview that he would rather jump out of a window than make a sequel even though Fox want to turn it into a franchise so maybe there should not be a sequel but just let this film stand as a worth successer to the 1968 version.

Because it's a different film! There's simply no reason why they couldn't speak!? They are the decendents of english speaking humans! \"How can I not compare it?\"... okay, they're both about monkeys! But the story line is completely different from that of the original. Star Wars and Star Trek are similar but the two are very rarely compared.The make-up is fantastic, the movement and acting is generally above par. The special effects are pretty awsome. The sets range from spectacular to pretty unimaginative, but this was possible intended (how interesting can you make a barron desert?)The statue of liberty style \"twist\" at the end isn't done in the same format. After seeing the original you would say: \"Oooooh, right! That's what happened!?\" After seeing POTA 2001 most say: \"How the hell did that happen?\" - though this has been critisised I think it was a deliberate attempt by Burton to give the viewer the option of drawing his or her own conclusions (yes, you have to use your brain!).

It's certainly not a great movie, nor is it a bad one.Visually it's amazing, as with any Burton film. The sets are spectacular, the CGI is convincing and not burdensome and the ape make-up/costumes look truly realistic and in some cases, menacing, particularly the character of Thade. Danny Elfman's musical score is suitably brooding and savage and I think the slew of weird percussion sounds is inspired. The acting is good, with stand-out performances from Tim Roth, who is the perfectly grotesque Burton villain, and Paul Giamatti, providing light relief.The story and script seem to be the main culprits for all the controversy. I actually like the fact that there is little dialogue. Sometimes movies suffer when there is too much dialogue, as it just becomes convoluted. Although Planet of the Apes is nowhere near as profound as Kubrick's 2001, this is the perfect example of 'pure cinema'. There is not one word of dialogue until 40 minutes into the film. Not everything needs to be explained with dialogue, a picture paints a thousand words, as the saying goes. As for the ending, it's more true to the novel. I will say that the Ape Lincoln memorial makes a mockery of the film, which is a fabrication and NOT in the novel. Although there is humour throughout the film, the ending loses its impact as a result of Burton's outlandish joke.",

Big explosion in the sky and down comes a spaceship with a test-monkey in it, which turns out to be the God off all the apes. Of course it saves the hero, Mark Wahlberg. They should have spent some of the special effects money on the plot. I'm surprised that Tim Burton did this film.",

I saw it with a friend of mine who didn't like it much the first time, and it turned out that she simply didn't understand that plot. I think that most of the comments of people who didn't like it just didn't get it. Let me try to enlighten you: **SPOILER SPOILER** 1. they said at the beginning that the monkeys were genetically enhanced to be smart enough to control the ships. that's why they evolved into talking apes when they got to the planet. 2. yes, the blonde girl was totally underdeveloped. but in the original, she didn't even speak! so give burton some credit. 3. the end DOES make sense. if you look at the pod's calender, the numbers go backwards, but it never says that Leo got back to the right year, which would be 2029. there was no uniformity in the electrical field, so how would he be able to aim directly to the right time? he didn't go back in time at all; he went forward. obviously if there are genetically enhanced monkeys in space, they had to have been created in earth labs. so the same thing happened on earth that happened on the planet. the earth apes eventually heard the story of the human rebellion on the ape planet and commemorated Thade. **END OF SPOILER**So there you go. But I suggest just watching the movie and enjoying it, without all of the analysis. I didn't think about the end until I got home, but when it happened in the movie I flipped out. It was awesome and surprising and scary. And even if you didn't think it made sense, you must have had fun watching it.",

Tim has a lot to make up for after giving us this junk.  Granted I know it's mostly the scriptwriters' fault.  Just look at their credentials: Entrapment, Mighty Joe Young, Beverly Hillbillies, and Superman IV?   Who here is surprised by this drivel?Ok, the makup WAS good, but I HATED the female makup.  It all looked fake. I couldn't get it out of my head that these were human women with masks on. They looked stupid and plastic.(Fair warning... SPOILERS here.)The main problem though, and here's where I just CAN'T forgive, TECHNICAL flaws.  There are three.  Where did the Apes come from?  Yes, there were chimps on the space station.  But where were the Apes.  There were no apes on that small space station.  And even if I missed them or if they were implied, Apes do not belong in space.  They are too large and heavy and not intelligent enough.  This space station didn't need the muscle.  But then, could chimps have evolved into apes?  NO! Apes and Chimps are on different branches of the evolutionary tree.  And Chimps are HIGHER that Apes.  Chimps cannot evolve into Apes. They would have to DEVOLVE into Apes.  It just doesn't make sense.  And where did the Orangutan come from?If the apes killed the humans, where did the human inhabitants come from? Of course, they must not have killed them all.  But if even a small group of humans survived a chimp or ape attack, especially a group of scientists and engineers from the future, they would not let the Chimps evolve into intelligent apes that would take over the planet.  They would hunt down and kill the Chimps, before their numbers got out of hand.Another flaw: the end.  How did the apes get to Earth?  (Here's where I smell the sequel.)  The apes were sent into the future, not the past.  If the space station were sent into the past, the chimps would have had time to evolve enough to get to space and conquer Earth.  Of course they will say that the intelligent apes went through a wormhole into our past.  This would work, but it isn't very clean.  It would have been better if they had had the apes go into the past.I can abide holes in a story, if they do not pertain to the story itself. Example: The Star Wars trilogy had quite a few holes.  Who is this Jabba the Hut?  How did Leia and Luke get separated at birth?  How did Bobba Fett get his Mandalorian Armor?  None of these holes affected the story though.  They did not happen during the timeframe of the movie themselves.  These holes added interest, not confusion.  Planet of the Apes' holes happened DURING the timeframe of the movie.  If Tim makes a sequel, I'm going to sneak into it because I paid to see a whole and complete Planet of the Apes, and he only gave me half.",

            "content": "When I first heard they were going to \"re-imagine\" the original Planet of the Apes I just about freaked out. It is impossible. The original has such an intense impact. It works because the viewers are expected to suspend disbelief at least a little bit in order to really feel the power of the movie. The original runs more like a parable or an urban legend than it does a believable action movie. This was also in a time where almost all movies and TV shows were done in the same vain- look at Alfred Hitchcock films, The Twilight Zone, and even Welcome Back Kotter - the list goes on and on. In this day and age people want to criticize the reality of everything and the filmmakers(and TV producers) see that as a challenge. This fact makes Planet of the Apes(2001) fail. I admit that after finding out Tim Burton and Danny Elfman (both of whom I am a gigantic fan) were on board I got very excited. I believed it might be done properly. I knew it couldn't be done but still got suckered in. After seeing it I realised that what I knew all along really was true. The costumes and makeup were perfect and so were the sets but there is no denying that this movie falls flat where the other made it's mark - the ending. They did pretty good with the story by putting a whole new twist on the origin of the Planet of the Apes, but in the end it all turned sour. When I first watched the original I thought of how they were going to end it and there was a certain ending that I (and many others) thought of that would make the movie stupid and very cliche. Thank god they didn't do it and instead made history. Unfortunately the new version of this movie has the EXACT twist ending we were afraid of seeing in the original. Very stupid, very easy and worst of all VERY unimaginative. I was actually cringing in my seat hoping they wouldn't end it the way they did. All I can say is \"Bummer\".",

I don't know what was going through Tim Burton's head.At no point during the film did I think that any of the characters (simian or otherwise) were believable. The dialogue (what there was of it, anyway) was appalling. Characters acted rashly for no logical reason, and there didn't seem to be any cause for these actions. The super-intelligent apes treated the humans like dirt...but why? There was no explanation for anything.The worst example of this lack of explanation comes at the end. I won't say what happens (don't want to ruin the 'fun' for everyone), but its absolutely impossible and it really doesn't make sense. Sure, it was jaw-dropping...but only since it was utter nonsense...As opposed to the original, I don't know what Burton's purpose was (other than <chi-ching> $$$). Well, in any case, kudos to Carter, Roth, Duncan and the rest of the apes for going to school and learning to act like an ape. And as for the 'human' cast, maybe they should have gone to a school to learn to act like, well, a human (emotions are an integral part of life)...The bottom line is: if you want to look at a bunch of animals, go to the zoo...oh...and stick to the originals...",

            "content": "When 'The Haunting' flopped at the box office while the ultra-low budget 'Blair Witch Project' became all the rage, it was a prime example of how the most sophisticated high-tech special effects don't guarantee a good remake of a classic movie (or, for that matter, any other movie). Consequently, I expected much the same when I heard of the 'Planet of the Apes' remake: today's advanced effects, prettier actors perhaps, and essentially expensive rehash. Tim Burton's version of the classic epic is a pleasant surprise. Sure enough, the movie does have dazzling special effects--the most impressive beyond a single doubt Rick Baker's ape makeup. And the actor's are, for the most part, new-millennium pretty (even some of the apes). But the story has also been completely and compellingly re-imagined and re-created. This is a new tale which has little in common with the original movie except that they are both based on Pierre Boulle's book--and that they are both excellent. The attention to (often hilarious) detail in Tim Burton's movie is delightful, and for those who remember the original 'Planet of the Apes' well enough, there are also a few pleasantly twisted nods to the classic to discover. The story moves along at a brisk pace and never fails to involve, making the movie seem shorter than it is, and the plot surprises in intelligent ways during the final part of the action. Another wonderful thing to observe is how well the makeup allows the actors behind it to bring their characters to life. While the masks in the original films were impressive, they allowed for little more than moving mouths and the occasional twitching nose. The masks in the new movie, on the other hand, accommodate a seemingly unlimited range of facial expressions. It takes more imagination to picture that there are human faces behind the makeup than it does to accept the simian characters as genuine. This new 'Planet of the Apes' is indeed not a remake, but an original movie based on the same novel that inspired the first one. A strong story, solid characters, AND amazing special effects, that's the stuff the 'suspense of disbelief' is made of. Let's just hope it won't suffer from the same sequel-itis as the original.",

If nothing else, Tim Burton's new APES carries the torch in this respect- even though I knew what was coming, the gorillas, orangutans and assorted other talking simians repeatedly raised the hair on my own neck, especially Tim Roth's incredibly athletic and menacing Thade.  On top of that, Burton manages to throw in quite a bit of humor, including some goofball nods to the original APES. The sets of course are magnificent, and so are the makeup and effects.  The SciFi sensibility of this version, however, is lacking (especially compared to how far ahead of its time the original was).  The beginning of the film has a rushed feel to it, and there are some plot holes regarding space travel and basic physics that will turn off many hardline SciFi fans.  All in all, though, summer audiences don't ask too much of their summer blockbusters, and this one delivers on that count.  Never a dull moment, lots to look at, and the simians in this version are a LOT more ape-like. The acting achievements of Roth and Bonham-Carter are amazing, and steal a lot of thunder from the human co-stars, including Wahlberg (who unfortunately for his female audience never appears bare-chested... sorry girls).  7 out of 10.",

The new Planet of the Apes immediately got off on the wrong foot with me when in the first few minutes of the movie Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) disobeys his commanding officer and takes a pod cruiser from the station.  It's stupid and it makes no sense.  The script writers could have come up with a dozen better ways to get him out into the storm in the pod.  It just makes the characters unbelievable from the start.Once we're down on the planet, things move along, but we don't seem to make any real progress in character development.  Why does Ari (Helena Bonham-Carter) care so much for the humans?  What's with Karubi (Kris Kristofferson)?  He shows up, but the character never develops.  Daena (Estella Warren) is easy on the eyes, but contributes little else. Ultimately I didn't really care all that much about these people.  There was no outpouring of sympathy from the audience when any of the characters died. That's because no one cared.I could possibly accept the complete lack of characterization if this were an action flick.  It failed there also.  The climactic fight sequence needs re-editing.  The climax was incredibly slow moving.  The pacing during the climax was all wrong.  For no apparent reason, this kid that we barely see and know nothing about (Birn, played by Luke Eberl) is all over this sequence.  Why?  Please, cut him, or at least make us care about him.  The climax needs to be tightened up a lot.Leo also manages to reinforce his stupidity with his plan (or lack thereof) for the climactic battle sequence.  Why blow your one big shot on the initial charge?  Why not come up with a plan that take advantage of your enemies obsession to make a bigger dent in the attacking army?  I like movies where the characters are smart or clever, again the characters just stumble along here with barely a semblance of a plan.  (Leo's escape sequence earlier in the movie suffers from the same problems.  He gets away, but it's mostly dumb luck.)The conversion of Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) is also just not believable.All of this could have been fixed with a better script and better editing. Perhaps what disappointed me most was that you could see a good movie stuck behind this mess.

I was hoping that 1) This film earned its \"Directed by Tim Burton\" tag, 2) I wanted a half-way intelligent story, and 3) I wanted to marvel at the monkey (excuse, me, *ape*) makeup.Let me take those points in reverse.  You've probably heard that the makeup is incredible.  Well, it is.  Different species of simians are represented, from baboon to monkey to chimpanzee, and the \"evolved\" forms represented in the movie are pulled off well.  But it would be for naught if the actors themselves couldn't \"get into character.\"  Let me tell you, the ape cast did superb jobs.  Mr. Roth, playing the villain general Thade, should get an award; his imitations of simian mannerisms (pawing of his comrades, wild vine-climbing screeching fits of anger) were spot-on.  Helena Botham-Carter kept up with her costar in her role of human beneficiary; she would toggle back and forth between heated intelligent arguments on the worth of humans and \"ooh ooh ooh ah! ah! aaahh!\"-ing when she'd panic.  Ok, that's exaggerating, but you get the idea.Story-wise?  Ehh... I think I would have liked it better if we were focused on the monkeys rather than the \"spaceman\".  Mark Wahlberg (sp?) was decent, but he was a bit rough in some parts, and when the movie trailed behind him and his rag-tag bunch as they fled the city, it dragged.  When the focus switched back to the apes (especially Thade), you had interesting dialog exchanges, wonderful acting, and a generally more interesting movie.\nAre you going to this movie to see a Tim Burton movie?  ... Well, you *may* be disappointed somewhat.  I didn't get the Tim Burton feel like I did watching \"Sleepy Hollow\".  But if you go in simply expecting to see a well-directed movie, you'll probably like it better.  Burton fans need to draw their own conclusions, but it felt like the movie was being directed by someone else, though someone equal to the task.Bottom line: It's not the best film.  But it's a good film.  I didn't feel like I wasted $7.00 seeing it in the theater.  I hope you don't, either.\nRating: 7/10",

But to believe, in a \"relativistic universe,\" where we all supposedly evolved by pure chance without intelligent design nor moral purpose, a BEAST like an ape is going to develop a moral sense and espouse a knowledge of \"right and wrong\" (where this came from is never stated) is just laughable.  And this is almost how the movie comes off.I would have been more able to suspend my disbelief had the apes--ALL the apes, been truly beasts.  It would have been horrific and been, FINALLY, this remake's only shot at equalling (let alone improving over) its 1968 original by creating a more potent nightmare.  Instead, it tries to re-create the original's formula--as if any of us would still be \"oh'd\" by the notion that this \"actually could happen.\"Been there, done that.So, instead of exploiting the truly hellish potential of this concept, we are constantly reminded that this is a remake.  No risks are taken.  No opportunity missed to \"sensitize our political ignorance\" (thanks, Ms. Ape). For lessons on creating a masterful (read 'believable') science-fiction world, the makers should have studied Ridley Scott's ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER, or Cameron's TERMINATOR series.",

            "content": "I think I should have realized that the 7:45 showing of Planet of the Apes selling out was a veiled premonition not to watch this movie. But my chakras were unaligned and I stuck around anyway for the 8:25 show. The plot goes like this. The year is 2029. American astronauts are testing chimpanzees as pilots on a space station. After losing a prized chimp in an electric windstorm, Leo, played by Mark Wahlberg tries to rescue him. The electric windstorm also acts as a time warp and transports Leo into the future onto a planet where Apes are evolutionary superior to humans.What has it been about Tim Burton's recent movies that have just left a bad taste in my mouth? Sleepy Hollow was bearable but certainly not up to par with Burton's earlier work. Call me nostalgic, but I think back to the days of Batman and Beetlejuice and I see genius. I watch Planet of the Apes and I think sellout...I went to this movie with no real expectations. Admittedly, I was suspicious of all the hype this movie was getting but I was interested to see it, soley because Burton directed it. Where do I begin? I was disappointed with the acting. Mark Wahlberg played his lead role of astronaut turned hero with complete stoicism but no human depth. Estella Warren was there purely for eyecandy; if she is capable of acting, she wasn't given the chance. Even Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter, well established thespians, were held back with a dry, clicheed script. Of course the special effects and set were amazing...blah, blah, blah. But Burton doesn't usually forego story for effects. His effects from earlier years have been just as impressive even with a smaller budget. The set is supposed to add to the movie and storyline, not surpass it. Speaking of storyline, where was it? This movie didn't have one, or at least an original one. I know you're thinking it was just a remake...how could the story be original? If you're going to bother remaking a film, you should do it for a reason...to show a different viewpoint or take on it; go somewhere the first one could have but didn't. For example, the 1968 original was very philosophical and dealt with religious issues. It was kitsch for the time, but it also made you think. 2001's Apes seems to have bypassed all philisophical debate and just provided a limited plot, excellent makeup and set, set, set.  Thats basically all that this movie has to offer, which in my mind is not worth $9 and two hours of my time.",

It's a complete waste of screen time.As for the ending, I suppose that Burton and/or the studio wanted to have something of the shock value that the Statue of Liberty had in the original and set themselves up for a franchise of sequels, but this one ruins all logical sense of the movie. If Leo traveled back in time instead of forward (That's what I took the ending to mean, anyways...) how did human civilization exist BEFORE the Apes'? How were there guns before guns were invented? And how do apes believe in Hell before Dante wrote the Inferno? As in \"Damn them to Hell.\"",

            "content": "The original Planet of the Apes was a brilliant satire of human nature that touched upon such themes as how man treats animals, how science being led by religion leads to nothing, and of course mankind's ability to destroy themselves. Every moment in the film was earned through a slow and effective pacing, good dialogue, and a horrific visual ending that put a chilling exclamation mark on everything the movie had been saying throughout.Tim Burton's new Planet of the Apes valiantly tries to make some of these same points again but never lets it sink effectively in our minds due to choppy dialogue, non-existent characterization, and a tacked on ending that will again cause a lot of discussion. But not in the way the filmmakers intended.The good parts of this film are how it plays with your expectations of the original. Hearing some of the classic Apes lines said in a new way gives the audience some laughs. Charleton Heston plays with his own role by being an ape in this film, and getting to talk about some of the film's best themes of humanity's power of invention and destruction. (I'm sure Heston never imagined being in another Apes movie, especially after convincing the producers of the original series to let him blow up the planet...) The apes themselves are reimagined in a spectacular way. The different species are more noticable and the primal way they move and interact with one another is better in the original making them seem more animal like. Some of the plot is revealed in effective and believable, at least as much as can be for a film of this type, ways. The setup of the film is compelling and effective enough. Which unfortunately makes the payoff more dissapointing.The bad parts of the film start to show up as more and more characters begin interacting. Characters are introduced in as simple of terms as possible. Their is no shading of these characters. Characters also seem to come to grips with difficult choices, change their views of the world, or suddenly change character with no effort at all. All this seems to stem from what seems to me to be someone wanting to show us 'cool moments' and then not knowing what to do with the characters after. SPOILERS: Examples being when an ape gets a human girl as a pet. Our heroes rescue the girl and then LEAVE THEM WITH THE APES! If you don't want your daughter around apes, don't leave them with them. Characters dies with no effect on anyone. Apes scar one another with no explanation really given other then to create a 'cool visual moment' later in the film. Suddenly a character becomes rebellious and almost ruins our heroes chances. Since this wasn't effectively established into a character I liked, or let alone noticed. I didn't care and really hoped the apes would get him. An ape's entire religion changes in a split second and it doesn't seem to effect him. The secret of the planet can work, but is highly, highly unlikely given the information shown to us onscreen. And where do the horses come from? The only explanation for them at all is that they were in the original so they should be in this remake. But having horses in the original makes sense. The climax feels very by the numbers with a huge fight scene that plays too messily. And we have our hero kiss both women, way to make a choice screenwriters. And the ending is the worst of these 'cool moments' of all. A shock ending was written just to have a shock ending. I know the ending is true to the original novel but the original novel didn't really earn that ending anyways. This film earns it even less. The original film's ending was truly an extension of everything proceeding it. This ending will cause a lot of division among filmgoers.In the end Planet of the Apes has some great makeup, great physical acting with the way everyone moves, and honestly some cool little moments. But it's script is a great example of bad big budget filmmaking. Huge plot holes that are created through the need for 'cool moments'. With the original film being such a great insight into human nature bringing to the big screen the idea that we are able to destroy ourselves the only thing this film shows us is that Hollywood also has the ability to destroy themselves.",

            "review_title": "The little movie that could... but didn't.",
            "content": "Planet of the Apes has many things going for it.  The first three are the creative minds of Tim Burton (director), Rick Baker (Make-up), and Danny Elfman (Music).  The sets and locations work well with the costuming and make-up to give this an original look and an authentic feel even though it is a remake.  The cinematography and music work well together because neither one overshadows the other making the combination very powerful.\nThe acting was good and I must take my hat off to Helena Bonham Carter and to Tim Roth who did exceptional in their portrayals.  The supporting cast didn't stand out like Carter or Roth, but they did a good job of holding their own ground.  Mark Wahlberg's character, Leo Davidson, is the classic military hero who never shows too much emotion because he is trying to stay in control of the situation.  It almost seems that if Wahlberg weren't an actor, he would have actually been this guy.  Estella Warren's character could have easily weighed down the movie by being the typical sexy woman, but thankfully Burton never really draws attention to her in that way: we know she's beautiful, but we don't need to waste 20 minutes of the movie proving it.  She doesn't have any dense lines bent at attracting Wahlberg or any slow motion shots of her character taking a hot bath.  Instead Estella Warren does a good job of playing a character simply caught in the story and reacting in a realistic way.  A personal favorite part of mine was the cameo appearance of Charlton Heston, who almost has the same classic line that he had in the original.The story, though shaky at the beginning, quickly regains its composure and holds the audience's attention.  Once upon the actual planet, there are many satirical references to the way our society has treated animals, the environment, and each other (in cases of slavery).  It is this ability of holding a mirror to society that has made Burton a genius in his craft. Even though the storyline is a tad simple and any audience member can guess or just about guess how the whole story transpired, it doesn't matter because we are trapped in this world and we become interested in the characters interaction with each other.The ending is what could have wrapped up the entire experience into a good movie\u0085 but didn't.  The last ten minutes of the movie was a horrible attempt at a twist ending.  If you watch closely you can see the movie end, but for some reason, another whole ending is added.  The problem with the second twist ending is that there is no bridge that connects this ending with the rest of the movie, so instead of discovering an ending you didn't even know you were looking for, you leave the theater thinking `Ummm\u0085 ok, that doesn't make very much sense.'  The storyline should take you from point A to point B, but the ending tells you that you are actually at point C and doesn't attempt in any way, shape, or form to explain how you got there.I gave this movie a 5 because it has the attempt, it just doesn't have the follow through.",

As I\u00b4m a Tim Burton-Fan, I had to watch the new \"Planet of the Apes\" - and I liked it.It is a great movie, full of fantastic pictures - the great comic-style, which I love Tim Burton for. The soundtrack is perfect, the special effects are great and , what is the most important: the story is very entertaining and full of suspense.Of course, as many of you did, you could ask many logical questions as: - Why are there horses on the planet? - Why are there different races? - How is it possible for a few humans and two apes to ride through a complete camp of aggressive apes? - Why does the chimp land exactly at the moment when Leo is about to lose his fight? - How is it possible for a small spaceship, to fly from the planet of the apes back to the earth? And why does it only take three minutes? - Why does Estella Warren wear lipstick? - Why is the earth full of apes at the end?I read many questions like this, and of course there are many more you could ask! But please don\u00b4t forget, it is a fantasy movie! A fantasy movie doesn\u00b4t need to be realistic, and it also doesn\u00b4t want to be!Nobody asks why it is possible to hear noises, when space ships in Star Wars shoot at something - although it is impossible to hear noises in space! A fantasy movie lives of exaggerations! Why do you always bother about realism in fantasy films? If you want to watch a realistic movie, then you should watch a drama or something, but no fantasy or science-fiction movie! - Or at least, don\u00b4t wonder about exaggerations!Of course it was not a perfect movie. Mark Whalberg really didn\u00b4t act very well, and I often asked myself why Estella Warren is in this movie. She is always in the middle of the plot, looking beautiful but speaking only five sentences over the whole movie.But altogether it was a very nice movie. I will have to buy the DVD as soon as it is available!Therefore 8 out of 10.Well, I think I will watch the original movie soon, but I\u00b4m not looking forward to compare the movies!",

            "content": "***spoilers***   ***spoilers*** ++Spoilers++People need to remember that this movie is a reimagination of the 1963 BOOK...not the 1968 movie.Also, the ending of Burton's Apes equals the ending of the BOOK...why blame or criticize Burton for remaining faithful to the BOOK?  If you have fault with the ending, take it up with the BOOK...not the movie.  Stop acting all surprised (er, ignorant) about the ending of the Burton Apes.  Better yet, go read the book and compare for yourselves.  Reading takes time and effort, of course.The POTA Book, written in 1963, was written by Pierre Boulle.  He also wrote the Bridge Over The River Kwai.This movie does a good job of updating the original premise put forth in the BOOK, without giving away everything and explaining every little detail in full technicolor for the movie going audience.  Both the book and Burton's Apes are similar in a few ways.  For one, the main character(s) travels through time, into the future, to a planet inhabited by Apes.  We learn that the planet was once ruled by humans (Thade's father and the pistol, a doll in the Book), and that the Apes would prefer keeping this secret. Finally, the main character returns to Earth only to find out that Apes inhabit Earth.On the main plot points, the Burton Apes is similar to the BOOK, even the ending.  On lesser points, the book and this movie are also similar.  The Apes, having taken control of the planet, haven't made much technological progress in the last X thousand years...still using tools, weapons, etc., that existed way back when, when they took control.  The book explains this by mentioning that while the Apes are good with mimicking what they see already...they lack the ability, for the most part, for creating new ideas. They simply took over, while humans left for the jungle areas and lived that way for 10,000 years (a short time in evolution standards, agreed) until the main character (Ulysse) shows up.  The \"ape hunts human\" scene in the beginning of both movies is similar to the book as well.In other areas, they diverge.  In the book, the humans cannot talk (much like the 1968 movie version) and Nova plays a large role.  The Apes don't speak English (actually French...the main character (Ulysse) in the book is French) but rather an ape language, so at first Ulysse doesn't understand them.  He learns their language in time, however.  Both Cornelius and Zira play critical roles in the book, similar to the 1968 movie as well. However, Dr. Zaius is not as powerful in the book as he was in the 1968 movie; in fact, \"gorillas\" are the dominant players in the book, the Chimps and Orangutans are in leadership positions only because gorillas allow them and support them in those roles.  The gorillas are the real doers in the book.\nThe book was more of a satire...an updated Gulliver's Travels, that poked fun at society, thinkers, educated people, etc.  The ending of the book involves Ulysse, Nova, and their son returning to Earth.  On both the trip away from Earth, and the return to earth, much time has elapsed on Earth (due to scientific explanations of which I won't bore anyone).  When they land, Ulysse is expecting to see futuristic vehicles and buildings and so forth, and is at first surprised that things look not much different than when he left (which would have been hundreds/thousands of years previously). He is shocked, of course, when he sees a police car pull up and 2 gorillas step out.  At that moment, he realizes that what happened on the Planet of the Apes (decline of Humans, rise of Apes, not much technological change for X thousand years) also happened on Earth!In the movie, this is not entirely clear.  What really happened, it appears, in the movie is that Wahlberg returns to Earth well into the future (not the present) and learns that humans declined, apes took over, and not much technological advances occurred in between.  In other words, the ending of the Burton Apes is similar to the book!  The explanation of \"Honest Ape\" Thade at the end could be one of two things, at least.  One, it could be a monument to another \"Thade\" that rose to power on Earth and has no connection whatsover to the Thade left, in captivity and decidedly NOT killed on the Planet of the Apes.  Or two, it could be that Thade escaped from his cell, commandeered a flying vessel (either repaired the one in the water, or perhaps another pod lands shortly after the chimp's did) and flies to Earth at a time much sooner than Wahlberg and precipitates an uprising leading to the downfall of Man and rise of Apes.In all, a very interesting movie based on a very interesting and funny BOOK that provides the viewer with much to think about.  Special effects are very good, and while I don't think it's a perfect movie by any stretch, I do think it's definitely worthwhile and entertaining, worthy of seeing. Also, read the book...and stop complaining about the ending of the Burton Apes.",

Especially the boy who always wants to help Leo and Leo's love interest ( he talks to her like 3 times in the whole movie!).On the plus side the acting is pretty good, the special effects are A+ and the ending, while it doesn t have the same impact the original had, wont disappoint you. Tim Burton is known for his great visual style(Sleepy Hollow, Batman) and he does a great job here too.7/10",

If not for Ari's (Helen Bonham Carter) \"too human\" make-up, it wouldn't take you too long to forget that they were actors only made up to look like apes.  Tim Roth WAS Thade! Both Tim Roth as General Thade and Paul Giamatti as Limbo deserve a nod come Oscar time. Unfortunately the majority of the cast looked as though they were phoning it in.In a couple of scenes you could see that Estella Warren was wearing heavy lip gloss but this could be a cinematography problem as in another scene it appeared as Mark Wahlberg was also wearing lip gloss.As for the story, it is one that a non sci-fi fan would assume was \"good\" science fiction, however it wasn't.  The plot had holes the size of Texas and there was no sign that anyone had tried to fill them.  The original movie ended with a \"Gosh WOW!\" and this one ended with a \"what the f..., HUH?\"  I can still remember coming out of the theatre after seeing the orginal for the first time with a sense of wonder.  Of course that was back in a time when the thought of the human race nuking itself to oblivion wasn't that big a stretch.  I was thinking about the ending of that film for weeks, I doubt I'll be thinking about the ending of this one tomorrow.  One good thing to say about the ending is that it more closely echos the ending the book \"Monkey Planet\" by Pierre Boulle than the original film did.Having said all these nasty things, there is still much to enjoy about this film.  The direction was very good and the score was delightful.  The music over the opening credits was very much an homage to Jerry Goldsmith's original score.One can only hope that the inevitable sequel can shed some light on the confusing ending.",

I tried to like it but in the end I'd have to deem this attempt at a new \"Apes\" as a disappointment.Sure, Tim Burton's masterful visual style and Danny Elfman's evocative musical scoring are in full effect as always, but in service to a mediocre script that plays like a typical action movie.  The pointed social commentary of the original film, released at the height of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War is not quite as effective here.Sure, there's also a couple of plot twists that rival the final revelation of the original.  A couple of classic lines from the original are cleverly worked in, and Charlton Heston, who carried the first picture and made us believe in the story, this time plays an ape. Nice touch!But the bottom line is, there's nothing new here to justify the time and expense of this film.  I expected more from Tim Burton!",

But I thought Burton might make it work. Well, I was wrong. I adore Burtons work and in my personal opinion he is Hollywood\u00b4s greatest director, but that does not mean that I love every piece of celluloid that he comes in contact with. POTA has some potentials but somehow they just fizz out. You can never stop asking yourself \"Why?\" Why make a remake of a near perfect film? If POTA 2001 would have been the first ape film, this might have been hailed as a great film. The fact simply is that we have seen this before. And what what is Burton doing with a comic relief?! Limbo is doing the same for this movie as Jar Jar did for Episode one! He is to much, to \"haha funny\" and should have been killed when the humans escaped. But no, we have to endure him throughout the whole film! The movie does have some good points though. First of all it has Tim Roth. He is without a doubt the best actor in this film and his ape impression is at times very frightening. The sets, costumes and everything in that department was impeccable, in a Burtonian way. There have been some who say that the make up in this film is no better than in the original. That is pure nonsense. I am inclined to think that these people are only blinded by some hate of Burton and his POTA and for fouling the memory of the original that they can\u00b4t give credit where credit is due! The makeup in this movie is sheer brilliance. The movement of the actors lips are now visible and so are other discreet features. This is better make up and saying otherwise just underlines that some people can\u00b4t judge films without letting feelings cloud there judgement. Last words. See the film at least two times. The initial shock wears off an you like it better the next time.",

In reality Mark goes back in time and the Station in following him gets sent even further back and populates the Earth with men and apes.

            "content": "I have been disappointed to one extent or another all year long.  Usually, I pick one or two movies each year which go on my \"buy the video\" list.  Last year, it was \"The Matrix.\"  This year so far, it's \"Shrek.\"  What do these two have in common?  They were well written.  Good writing, when accompanied by good visuals and a good score, can make a movie great.  \"The Matrix\" and \"Shrek\" prove that people actually appreciate good writing.  Most of the reviews concerning \"Planet of the Apes\" complain about plot holes (bad writing), the ending (I liked the reviewer who revealed the clue Ape Lincoln---in fact, the ending may have been \"forced\" on the writer because of this pun, and now they have to make sense out of that pun by writing a sequel that explains it), uncreative face-offs / battle scenes, and character development.  I think this country is full of good writers, but they apparently only infrequently make it through the Hollywood meat grinder.I have to agree that \"Planet of the Apes\" suffers tremendously in the writing department.  I liked only three characters, Ari (a fine line between human compassion and simian behavior), General Thade (convincingly evil), and the human slave trader (a few good laughs).  These characters were minimally written, but at least they had character.  No other ape or human in the film was developed.  Estella Warren was totally devoid of any character, and did not exist in this plot for any reason.  She wasn't even good eye candy.At the very least, the movie should have ended after the chimpanzee in the pod removed his helmet before the ape masses, giving Burton more time to develop the characters from the beginning of the film up to this point.There are many points to make about how to write a good script.  One point is that a battle between two good characters is almost always more interesting than a battle between a good and evil one.  As a point of reference, think about the ending of \"The Vikings,\" where Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis battle to the death on a seaside castle.  You really care about both characters.  You don't want either one to die.  It's so much easier to play the \"I want comeuppance\" card than the \"tragedy\" card in a battle scene. In \"The Vikings,\" it's not even brute force that determines the victor.I love science fiction, and my favorite is still \"Aliens,\" which defies most sci-fi cliches in the sense that it's an action picture with good writing and a child who actually enhances rather than detracts from the film. However, \"The Matrix\" is on my top five list.  Hopefully, the Matrix sequels will be well written.In short, Hollywood needs to go back to basics and only film well written stories.  I'm sure there are thousands of average people out there who could do a better job (the reviews here prove there are a lot of good heads) writing a movie like this.  But the average person will never get a chance.So, if you go see \"Planet of the Apes,\" do so for the visuals and a decent score.  Maybe that's enough for casual entertainment.  But it won't stir any activity in your brain (unless you write movie reviews afterward!).",

As an aspiring film maker, I understand that in order to get paid, one must first appease the investors, (studio's). Burton however has managed to do this, without compromising his art, up until now. It seemed that Burton wanted to make a...for lack of a better word, darker movie, that addressed some perverse issues, but was forced to back up by a force off camera.  (Perhaps the whole bestiality issue would have been interesting?)  there were plenty of other issues that could've been explored but weren't. I loved the little details however, the ape with the music box and the human midget as his pet, it was great, you really got a sense of culture, I just wish I saw more of it.  Many of the issues in the film were great\u0085but there could've been more. I also felt that the political aspect of the film wasn't addressed.  Perhaps a scene that took place in the ape senate would have been interesting.  (Or maybe that's just the Sparticus inside me talking?) I really would have liked to see Glen Shadix a bit more. As usual, the film was visually stunning...but for the first time ever, I feel that Burton has sacrificed substance for style.  The film was eye-candy indeed, but lacked that human, (or ape...sorry), quality. Marky's character was also lacking.  He was the outsider, Burton's on-screen alter-ego...why would Burton not developed him more?  Burton's renowned for glorifying the \"outsider\"...how could he let this one slip?  He got Carter's character right, why would he over-look the obvious freak? Last but not least is Elfman.  His score was lacking as well.  That beautiful sense of pensiveness or melancholy wasn't present in this score. Perhaps I'm getting too picky, but like so many others, I expected so much more. I'm not criticizing Burton for \"selling out\"\u0085(after-all, isn't that the goal of every director)?  And I didn't think this was a bad movie, as a matter of fact, I liked it and thought it was a good movie\u0085I just hope that Burton doesn't compensate his art for the sake of a sequel again.",

It was especially noteworthy because I live in a moderate size town. The stuntmen in this movie seem to be trying out for \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\".  At the same time they made it look very simian.  I thought this movie was well done.  It is a little too dark most of the time but I'm pretty sure this is on purpose.  There is one problem with this movie that I noticed.  Actually I've been noticing it for years.  That problem is the adolescent actor (in this case Luke Eberle).  For the past years both televison and Hollywood have written two main types of characters for adolescent actors.  In the first type the adolescent character is told to: go in the house, go over there, etc.  Why is it that the \"adult\" actors are afraid for the adolescent characters to be an integral part of the defense of the home or whatever the movie entails.  The second type is where the adolescent character either is allowed to help or just does.  However, the \"adult\" character either has to fix what the adolescent character did or save the adolescent character from death etc.  This movie is no different.  In it the Luke Eberle character is basically told to go hide by Mark Wahlberg.   The Luke character then refuses and decides to try and help.  Then in typical fashion the Mark Wahlberg character has to save the Luke character from certain death.  When is the establishment and the \"adult\" actors going to realize that adolescent characters actually can  help in defense situations and many other situations as well?  I realize that many of these adolescent actors have not \"paid their dues\" yet but to me that is a terrible reason to perpetuate a stereotype.  For that is indeed what it is.  So even though this movie perpetuates both of these stereotypes I think it is still a rather good movie.  However, it could have been better had the writers filled the stereotype spot with something important.",

            "content": "This is the movie I have been waiting for 30 years to see, ever since I peeked over the back seat of the station wagon at the drive in theater waiting for Doctor Dolittle (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0061584) to start.  I was five years old, and this was before the days of real ratings.  Besides, the original Apes movie was rated an amazing 'G' as was that other talking animal film we went to see.That said, I was terribly disappointed in the 2001 re-visioning of the 'Planet of the Apes'.  Tim Burton is one of my favorite cutting-edge directors, and Danny Elfman a top composed.  The cast looks excellent - on paper, but in reality the characters are mainly one dimensional and shallow. The possible exception is Helena Bonham Carter as Ari, who at least seemed to have fun playing a rather muppet-like Chimp/Human rights activist. Burton didn't dare go anywhere but the obvious places, and even with the attempt at a surprise twist ending (which left me slack jawed at the sheer disconnectedness of it).  There were so many opportunities to build these characters in an otherwise visually stunning universe.  Would it be bestiality for two sapient members of different species to actually explore their apparent sexual tension that Burton was trying to portray?  Could it have been possible for Daena (Estella Warren) to do anything other than pine and heave her fur-bikinied breasts about?  There was a real opportunity to explore something here that Burton ignored.  And Burton usually hits these on the head.The first ape line of the film made me dread what was an otherwise decent start to the movie.  I won't reveal what it is, but it was too obvious an attempt to try to a) make you laugh, b) set the tone of the film, and c) nod to the original film.Overall, I give this film a 3 out of 10 for an overall impression.  I give Rick Baker a 10 out of 10 for an AMAZING bunch of creatures.  I give Mark Wahlberg (Capt. Leo Davidson) a -2 out of 10 for mailing in his performance and avoiding any sort of commitment to his role.  Helena Bohnam Carter (Ari) gets a 7 out of 10 for her role, and Tim Roth (General Thade) gets 8 out of 10 for being a peeved chimpanzee and a vicious character, and making me truly dislike him.  Or was it the complete shallowness of his character that I hated?  Wait, I give Tim Roth an 8, and I subtract two points from Tim Burton for not allowing such a fine villain to have any depth for a total Tim Burton score of 3 out of 10.  Visually, the film gets 8 out of 10 from me.Nutshell summary:  A mediocre attempt worth seeing for the makeup and soundtrack, and for the uncomfortable laugh at the end when you realize how much Hollywood is spending to produce crap these days.  This film is definitely worth a rental, but save yourself the $8.50 to see it in the theater.",

Mark Wahlberg was horrible (another big surprise...not!) the average door-to-door vaccum salesman would have been a better choice. Helena Bonham Carter (disguised by thick layers of polyurethane and \"you can see all their mistakes on every close-up shot\" make-up) was the only one who played their part well. She seemed oddly out of place, but made the movie a little more watchable. The ending was so absurdly stupid it gives me an aneurysm every time I try to think about it. The genius of it is: It's stupid on every conceivable level. It doesn't matter if you're Steven Speilberg or Steven Jones (the 80 year old crazy looking janitor at Homeland), you're simply un-able to like the ending at all. What's really sad is that this could have been a \"good\" movie. Wahlberg sub-par acting skills could have been overlooked if they just didn't add all the stupid scenes. If you choose to inflict this movie upon yourself then you'll know what I'm talking about. Certain things just didn't need to be there. Estella Warren, for instance. Her character did nothing of relevance at all. There was no romance between her and Wahlberg, she only had a few lines, but you could tell that they were trying to give the impression of romance, but it didn't work at all. And, despite the fact that she has lived her entire life in a desert wilderness being captured by Apes and forced to do slave-labor, and then escape, her lip-stick never fades! It's amazing! It seemed like a really \"americanized\" film though, all the way. But, if about 20 minutes of the film was cut (including, most-importantly, the retard ending) then I would give it like a 7 out of 10. But as is I'd have to give it a 7 out of 100",

Thade then takes off in the delta pod (possibly with another ape but i'm not sure, it is unlikely though) and manges to get into the electrical storm and make his way to earth. and because of the electrical storm he arrives long before Leo does. i think it may even be in the early 1900's. while he is there he, no doubt, wreaks havoc among the humans and through a series of unknown events, procreates and eventually overtakes the human race. and mysteriously history stays basically the same (except of course for the appearance of thade). thus when Leo gets to earth around the same time he left apes have long since ruled earth. we know its thade because if you look at the inscription on the back of the Lincoln memorial its says that it was built \"in memory of general thade\" (and it looks just like him). also, given that we now are back in time to the first present, Leo more than likely will not be able to go into space and have the beginning of the movie happen again and the first ape planet stays uninhabited.",

Anyone who was disappointed by this film did not use common sense.  Do you really think a movie this big, with this kind of budget, this kind of A-list director and this kind of cast was really going to satisfy you when it comes to plot and character development?  There has not been a hollywood movie out in years that has satisfied my intellectual yearnings, I have stopped seeking this kind of satisfaction in a hollywood film because it is Sisyphean.  This film did exactly what I expected it to do, it kept my attention for a full two hours.  Anybody who wanted to have the social commentary of the first movie, the melo-dramatic over-acting of the first movie, the garish orange costumes and the justified willful suspension of disbelief that the first film supplied you with you should have rented the first movie and stayed home.Anyone who enjoys Tim Burton's beautiful productions and just wants to sit in an air conditioned theatre for two hours without expectations should see this film, maybe even twice if your father missed it when you went with your girlfriend the first time.

If you are lucky you might be able to answer 1, possibly 2 or even three if you are very open minded (personally I've got one, John Carpenter's The Thing 1982).  Well Mr Burton knows that movie patrons and critics are very critical when it comes to the remaking of a classic film, especially if it is one of their personal favorites.  Thats why from the very conception planet of the apes 2001 was never intended to be a remake of the original classic film.  This seems to be the biggest handicap everyone seems to have getting in the way of actually giving this movie a fair shake.  I enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't a waste of 2 hours.

            "content": "Whether written or film, Sci Fi works best when it's either ahead of it's time and cautionary, or of it's time and satirical. The original Apes' films fell in the latter camp, using the generation gap of the late 60s, the optimism and expectancy of the moon shots and (increasingly) the racial tensions building up in the states as its themes. Tim Burton's film does neither, living with the glib message that \"we should, uh, just all get along and live with each other\".Though there's a fair amount of spectacle to enjoy and a cracking performance from Tim Roth, POTA is ultimately unsatisfying. Up to this point in his career Burton was part of that small (miniscule?) group of American directors who had managed to deliver witty, scary, ironic, enjoyable films AND managed to get them distributed to your local McMultiplex. POTA sadly whiffs of compromise and poor editing ending up being confused and confusing.Go and see it (at the end of the day it IS fun) but don't let the phrase \"hang on, why...?\" appear in your mind at any point and don't be be tempted to wonder that if, in 30 years during which we've been able to shrink computers to a tenth of their size and digital watches have come and gone, monkey make-up still looks as ropey as it did when Roddy McDowell first started piling it on to spook Charlton Heston.",

Mark shows up, then at the end the monkey shows up. now they were DEFINATELY ON EARTH!!!  changing the history of earth again by showing the apes that they need to live with man in harmony to gain their ability for technology. it gets into theology about man messing with gods plan and paying a price. then when Mark goes back to earth to the same year it was when he left the Oberon, it is to the earth with it's altered history. it is all there ari said it before he left \" someday they will tell this story and some will say it is just a fable.\" that is the setup for the end sequence. you have to read between the lines and read the inscription behind thade/lincoln at the end. Thade became known through telling of the story, as the great emancipator of humans.  it was all there you just had to put it together. the apes could not use technology, so he had to had to have landed in a world that has humans and apes living together hence the hybrid people shown in closeup. burton is a master storyteller, and because he made people think they say the movie is bad.  the acting is teriffic.... mark is just trying to get back to the ship ignoring all else. the reluctant hero, this no buisness of his... was this not obvious? this is the best SF movie i have seen in along time.",

Although I haven't seen the original, this film looks wonderful and dark, and this is surely thanks to Burton's skill as a director. It manages to make the slightly detached characters really work well together, and the acting was great throughout. Very interesting race/ animal rights issues are raised by this film and, although I'm guessing that the original also raised these issues, I suspect it provoked much thought with teenagers who wouldn't dream of watching the original. Of course, you've got to compare it with Burtons other films, and, as far as spooky, Gothic atmospheres go, this doesn't really live up to them. But as an action film it surpasses so many. My favourite character was the Tim Roth evil general. He is the kind of bad guy whose evil has been set so deep within himself that he can no longer control it, and when he kills those gorilla-type creatures it's absolutely amazing. He also emanates pure evil through his wonderfully made facial features. The ending is an issue that raises much debate, but I loved it, the master plan, killing one wave of the enemy with an explosion, was beautifully futile, and the coincidental monkey landing was pleasantly ridiculous. And his return to earth was just really cool. All in all, a great film, watch it. By the way, did anyone else find themselves fancying Helena Bonham Carter in this film.

            "content": "CAUTION SPOILERS WITHINHaving just viewed this film last night, it is fresh in my mind and I wanted to make a few observations. Not a review per se, just some thoughts.Although flawed, it does have a few good things going for it. Rick Baker's work is truly amazing. The flexibility of the masks/make up used allows the actors to produce varied, expressive and very believable expressions. Nicely done.Most of the art direction and costume design is creative and well implemented. The ape army is cleverly and boldly realized.The acting, overall, is good, and especially in the case of Tim Roth, David Warner, Michael Duncan, & Helena Bonham Carter. They help create believable, if somewhat two dimensional characters. The lovely Estella Warren does fine in an underwritten role.Danny Elfman's creative score, effectively covers a wide variety of moods ranging through suspense, comedy and militaristic combat themes quite well.And then there's the other side of the coin, an at times interesting, but largely wooden formula driven plot, with dialog suffering from a bad case of pun infestation.A few things that don't work:At no time did I get the feeling that Captain Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) was all that surprised or impressed that he had discovered a culture where apes could talk, and ran the planet. It was sort of like `hmmm, that's odd, talking apes in charge of the world, hey look over there, we don't have oak trees like that on earth, this is INSANE!'And then the escape from the ape city, whose route cleverly goes right through the center of about a half dozen ape houses, `we'll keep running through these houses until we find the forest, its got to be around here somewhere. Once we've checked all the houses we'll start searching for the forest outside.'What's up with people (and apes) flying twenty feet or more through the air when they are struck by any ape (not just the gorillas), not occasionally, but everytime?  The great strength of apes? It would happen on earth. Lower gravity? Then apes would fly when humans struck them. Lots of stuntmen with springboards? Maybe.And then there's that one scene that just defies any logic, and I'm not talking about the `surprise ending'. Its when Captain Leo, wins the battle, brings a new understanding and compassion between apes and humanity, finds himself as the leader of a new world order, and then immediately hops in the space pod to return to earth.

He knows his crew have been dead for thousands of years, he's just won this planet's version of the Superbowl, the Nobel prize, and been elected President, clearly Estella Warren wants to jump his bones, and even Helena Bonham Carter's Ari is obviously intent on more advanced and exotic interspecies research. Even if he chooses not to lead this world through a new political, cultural & scientific revolution, how about taking some time to smell the roses, you know, a few weeks to gather scientific samples to bring back, to help advance anthropology by studying cross cultural (and species) mating rituals, to work at turning his space pod into a two seater, or to even bring extra food and water for what is likely to be a long and possibly fatal journey?

Don't get me wrong!The new version of Planet of the Apes is not a bad movie and in it's own genre actually quite satisfying.The ape-masks are great(even though they make almost impossible to tell which actor is which) and the sets are pretty impressive.The biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't have the unique visual look and oddness of Tim Burton.The second problem is Mark Wahlberg.He has the same one impression on his face throughout the movie and is one of the most unintresting hero of all times.

So therefore I thought that Planet of the Apes Redux, or whatever one calls it, would be fun to see. And when I read Tim Burton had directed the whole thing I was even more excited. Edward Scissorhands- director doing a redux of one of the true movie classics, is that great or not.So I saw the movie and I was delighted to see how the masks had got even more realistic. And we also had Mark Wahlberg performing quite good, but alas he did not prove to be better than old Heston of the original. Helena Bonham Carter as sweet ape Ari was perfect for the role but this human-beings-seller in green? A typical sidekick, and I have never liked sidekicks. He has these spot-on comments to the movie's happenings but this true \" evil ape empire \"-feeling at once gets toned down by this fellow.\nTim Roth plays evil ape general Thade, the ultimate bad guy, breathing a little bit like Darth Vader in Star Wars. Michael Clarke Duncan have been showing off for the Apes- posters, so naturally he plays a great role as armyleader Attar. I have now seen the movie three times, one time on cinema, two times on VHS and I can't still figure out how the ending was like.",

(Which are sure to be tied up by the obviously sequel that the end sets up) Mark Walberg's tries to find his monkey and lands on a planet where Monkeys are superior and humans are the lesser primate. The make-up is astounding, and Mark proves to be a pretty good no-brain action star. Tim Roths is a pretty good monkey-gone-bad, but as I said before, this movies too silly to be taken seriously and his intense performance is kind of lost.After it's revealed how the monkeys got the way they were, (and why their English was so good) the plot just get's silly and builds up too a fairly laughable ending. The blond girl, Estelle, isn't bad as far as models-turned-actresses go, but her character serves no purpose other than to give 14 year old boys something to look at. Plus, even with more makeup than the cast of Cats used for 20 years, the best apes-actor is still the real thing, Mark's chimp Pericles, who gives a better performance than half his human-cousins.It's not a bad movie, it's a style-over-substance movie, but then again, so's most everything else that's at the theater.

Showing why the apes' beliefs were covered in lies and why humans actually were intelligent.In this Tim Burton movie it seems he has to add the violence and fighting needed to get the big movie producing budget from 20th Century Fox.In one sequence Leo (played by Mark Wahlberg) points a gun at an ape, but is told to not sink to his level (the ape was a trader-in-humans) by Ari (magnificently played by Helena Bonham-Carter). Yet in the end there is no problem to fight the Ape army in Braveheart-style.The whole magic usually included in Tim Burton movies is never there, and somehow he falls for the blockbuster-syndrome: a cool action-hero and a lot of incredible stunts.And the ending, without spoiling anything, must be the worst ever displayed on the screens.However, the costumes and make-ups are incredible, but they are in line with modern movie-technology. They could give one or two Academy Awards next year. But I don't understand why apes covered in body-hair/fur would want to wear clothing or uniforms. Overall, the great performances by Helena Bonham-Carter as a Senators daughter and revolting youth preaching humanism and equality and Tim Roth as the dangerous and evil general Thade makes this movie a pretty good entertainment and raising the Rating to 5/10.",

            "content": "When I first saw the original \"Planet of the Apes\" film on DVD, it blew my mind.  It was such an incredibly moving film and was so brilliantly well done.  Even the 1968 ape make-up was amazing.  So when the 2001 film came out, I was anticipating seeing it.My first sitting of the film was somewhat mixed.  The opening progresses quite quickly and jumps straight into the point rather than dilly-dallying with any character development.  There was an awful lot that happened in the film, and I didn't really get the chance to process it all until after the film had finished.  That's not to say that the plot was hard to follow; it just took me a while to process everything that had happened.  During that delayed reaction, I commented rather negatively on the film, but once I'd processed it all I appreciated the film a lot better, and thus the film was much better.During my second viewing of the film, I saw it for what it was: really good sci-fi action film.  That's not to say that the re-working of the film is a bad thing: the remake gives a fresh angle on the ape concept, which can be a great thing if it's executed correctly.  And the 2001 version of \"Planet of the Apes\" executes it brilliantly.In the modern film, genetically-enhanced monkeys pilot survey pods through unexplored space while the humans stay safely on their space station.  When one such monkey is lost in an electromagnetic storm, pod pilot Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlburg) decides to attempt a rescue.  With his navigation instruments down, Leo crash-lands on the planet of the apes....just as an ape hunting party is rounding up a fresh wagon-load of human slaves.Critics will say that the new film completely ignores Pierre Boulle's original novel, but it doesn't.  The modern story is very different certainly, but it is still closely tied with the novel.  Human-sympathising ape Ari (rendered absolutely superbly by Helena Bonham Carter) suggests a reason for why Earth's apes don't speak (\"the way you treat them; maybe they don't want to\"), which comes from Boulle's original novel.  And the movie's ending (one that'll make you gasp out loud) is lifted straight from the original novel.Everything about this film is excellent: the modern ape make-up is amazing, the peformances are of an incredible standard (especially Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth as the human-hating ape Thade), and the characterisation is just as superb as in the original film.  The film is brutal enough to make a statement about man's inhumanity to man (and ape), yet there is still a definite humour in the ape parodies of society.This truly is a great film.  Go out and enjoy it.",

SPOILERS! *******************************************I am not going to say anything major about the plot, as it has been related better before.This movie irritates me a great deal. It could easily have been so much better, by some simple adjustments.This film has a lot of plotholes, and most of them could easily have been avoided.1. The language problem Both apes and humans speak english. Pretty stupid if the two species have been on the planet for 1000'nds of years. Why couldn't the two species have spoken some unknown language which Davidson could have been taught in some months' captivity among the apes. This could also have given us a better chance to learn more about ape history and ape culture.2. What are the characters motives for doing certain things? This is a big problem, perhaps the biggest in the movie. A. Why do Thade hate humans so enormously? B. Why do the slave trader switch sides so easily? This could have been better explained. C. Why did Leo Davidsom escape so soon? Wouldn't it have been more sensible to learn more about the place he had come to? D. Why did the blond bomb have a role in the movie at all? Her actions didn't have any significance. E. Why did Ari return to general Thade if she was interested in \"The human cause\". F. Why did Attar turn against Thade at the end of the movie? H. There are much much more...3. I believe there was something about a man coming from the stars. If this was better explained it could have made Thade's killing of the two space-arrival spotters more easy to understand. It could also perhaps have explained why Attar switched side in the ending.4. There are more, but i gotta go to bed now...------- Im not sure if i will comment much on the ending of this movie as i'm not sure if i understood it. Here are some ways it can be understood. (Perhaps...)A. They were at the earth all along by some strange twist of fate and Davidsons actions altered history so that we got an \"Ape\" Lincoln. That does not explain that it said general Thade on the statue though. I don't like this explanation, and i hope it is not correct.B. The travelling through and forth in the magnetic storm got Davidson into some other dimension beside ours, where Thade was a hero. This could explain why there were fairly nowadays police equipment and cars when the cops showed up.C. Thade may have travelled back to earth and changed history there after Davidson had gone. We have to note though, that the cops seemed to be evolved apes. This seems to suggest that it must have been a vast amount of time since Thades arrival and Leos arrival at earth. Difficult difficult... Another problem: If Thade and the apes fixed the Oberon in some way, and got it flying, isn't it kind of strange that the original crew didn't managed that some time directly after the crash? Even sophisticated technology is best BEFORE it has been lying around for some thousands of years...This is perhaps just rubbish, and i will be very thankful if someone did this explanation better than me!!!",

            "review_title": "Interesting...to say the least",
            "content": "**SPOILERS**I'll start off by syaing that I'm not much for remakes.  I roll my eyes whenever I see a preview for a remake of a classic (i.e. The Time Machine this Christmas).  Nevertheless, I'm in line opening day.  Ever since Elementary School when my Dad made me watch the original Planet of the Apes I've been enchanted by it.  A school friend Robbie told me the ending before I saw it; yet it still captivated me.  The dialogue was a little weak in the original, and the special effects and makeup are a joke now; but they were pearls in the late 60s.  The ending was a mystical cliffhanger that made you want the world to freeze and allow you to just ponder life and our society for a moment.  I commend those actors, they did great back then, but it's just not a movie for the 2000 years and on.  This brings me to the remake. Not many people know, in fact, that both films were remakes of the original French novel by Pierre Boulle.  It upsets me when people call the new one a \"remake\" of the old one.  It's not...It's a new idea on an old book.  I commend Tim Burton.  He did a great job with the futuristic feel of this movie.  Most movies these days do a HORRIBLE job conveying the future. It's better to watch 2001: A Space Odyssey because the effects look reasonable. Take \"The Sixth Day\" for instance.  That movie was nothing but an excuse for Arnold lines and special effects.  They overused the effects, in my opinion, which created an overly-exotic, extremeley wild picture that I couldn't keep controlled.  Our current technology needs to be limited in the display of our future; a fine line George Lucas walked with Episode One.  However, I think Tim Burton did pretty good with not overly-special-effecting this film.  The opening scenes in our not-too-distant future seemed reasonable and not too stretched and wild.  I also really enjoyed the scenes on the space station, in which Tim paralleled our relation to apes with the apes relation to us.  They didn't do this in the original film.  It allowed younger viewerd to more basically understand the parallel between the two relationships.  The one thing I didn't like in the film was the humans. They didn't seem evolutionary-backtracked at all.  They seemed like normal humans who had just been scavenging around for 3,000 years while the monkeys evolved tremendously into an entirely new identity.  The \"Nova\" character, Daena I think, was interesting.  Obviously placed as a sex object, she didn't quite pull off enough of a attraction with Davidson (The \"Taylor\" of the film).  Oh ya, one more thing I didn't like.  The ending, after the struggle with the apes is over, I thought was too rushed.  THey should have slowed it down and taken it a bit steadier.  Otherwise, I loved this movie. The two parallels to the original film were great, and I felt out of place as being one of the only people in the theatre who was laughing at the line \"Get Your Stinking Hands Off Me You Damn Dirty Human.\"  Ya so it was corny, it was great.  The Charlton Heston cameo was an awesome tribut to a great American symbol.  It was awesome, and his last words \"Damn them all to hell...\" made me laugh really hard.  It was a great tribute and I applaud the writers for it.  General Thade I thought was great, he did a good job acting.  It was much different than the book's/original movie's Dr Zaius, but he still had the same premise.  All the ape characters were outstanding, especially the two Generals and the comic relief slave trader.  The premise was quite different AND IF YOU DONT WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING ***STOP READING NOW*** and I liked it but I didn't.  The idea of the space station going back in time and the monkeys taking over and evolving was interesting.  As said above, I thought it strange that the apes would advance so much and the humans not, but still.  I liked that idea; it was an interesting new idea. But it still lacked all the glamour the original ending got.  It didn't make me think and it didn't really spark an interest in me to question existence. It was good, but not POTA worthy.  The ending was, however.  I thought that all the cliffhangers were over with.  After Thade was locked up I think it was rushed way too much.  It all kinda wrapped up and took off too quick. When Davidson crashed on Earth I knew something fishy was up.  And when I noticed the Lincoln Memorial I knew what I was about to see.  What I didn't know, however, was that the modern-day Earth would end up completely controlled by apes.  This was a great cliffhanger ending and it made me puzzled at first.  However when you think about it, it leaves little to the imagination.  Obviously, somewhere in Planet of the Apes re-imagining sequels 2-5 Thade will go back in time and alter past.  When this will happen, how it will occur, how well it will be pulled off, who will be the characters, and exactly how many boring sequels we will have to sit through are all questions that lay heavily on the shoulders of director Tim Burton...good luck...   8.5/10",

However, Burton was TRYING to explain the course in which he thought that the human evolutionary pattern is following. For those who have seen the movie, you would remember that Leo's pod crash landed around 2400, when he had left from the 22nd century. The apes on the planet had said that the ruins of the origin of the apes was thousands of years old. This explains that the Oberon when passing through the electrical storm went back in time thousands of years. IF we say that the planet of the apes is really earth we can deduce that in the end when apes ruled present day it was because the oberon had crashed before Leo's departure from it. Because the ship's apes took over thousands of years ago they built up their technology the same as we had in our present day. Burton therefore is suggesting that the apes civilization fell and they were reverted to their ancient primitive ways. Then Leo crashed. Therefore although Leo was trying to make it back to his time, it no longer existed!PS.  I went to this movie thinking that even if it was bad, Burton's visuals would be nice as they usually are but all I received was two hours of run-of-the-mill scenes, with nothing special whatsoever.In conclusion, the only thing good about this movie was the music.

My pet peeve today is that movies have to take so much time in explaining every tiny detail about the plot.  In essence they are preaching to the lowest common denominator. In a movie that contains so many sub-plots, Tim Burton does a great job of presenting the foundation though dialogue, and then the rest of the plot though visual aids.  If you want to understand the movie you have to look for the details and then come to your own conclusions, which isn't that hard if you were actually watching the movie, and have some reasonable level of intelligence (which of course is rare into days movie viewing demo graph, and no I'm not an old cranky man\u0085I'm only 16).  If your tired of the same mush that infests out cinema today and want to see a movie that is smart, funny, and makes you think see this movie.

            "content": "NOTE: For those who haven't seen this film, please do NOT read my review. I will be outlining the plot, or lack thereof, in my critique.Several years ago, legendary scriptwriter William Goldman lamented that it was no longer fun to ridicule current films.  The present author agrees, citing Hollywood's limited imagination and obsession with proper packaging. One example can be found in Tim Burton's `reimagined' Hollywood's classic, Planet of the Apes.  Mr. Burton is known for the Batman series, The Nightmare before Christmas, and Beetle juice.  His Planet of the Apes is another dark foreboding film aimed at summer moviegoers.\nBurton correctly did not compete with the original movie's screenplay written by Rod Serling.  The creator of The Twilight Zone was inspired by Pierre Boulle's satirical novel Monkey Planet.  Now one can buy the novelization of the Tim Burton film.  As one local paper observed, Burton created another contemporary action film.   A US Air Force pilot marooned on a strange planet, pleas for us to love our neighbors, as we would love ourselves.  In other words, Batman passed through the Stargate to discover EnemyMine.  The author is grateful that he did not have to pay to see this forgettable remake.  However, one should keep perspective and view this film as part of Hollywood's highly successful strategy as an electronic baby sitter. Its core audience is probably unaware that Planet of the Apes launched the first commercially viable nerdocracy nine years before Star Wars.What was Planet's secret?  Great costumes, breath taking special effects, eye-catching explosions, token comic relief and of course sex appeal. The film team cut and pasted this formula onto the script but added his trademark: darkness protects evildoers.  Instead of swaggering through Gotham's streets, these nefarious characters literally swing from tree to tree.  Then our hero with the subtle last name of Davidson leads his people into the Wilderness.   Meanwhile eye candy masquerading as characters diverts the male lead's attention: Helen Bonham Carter and Estella Warren. His young male audience secure, Burton enlisted living legends Charleton Heston and Kris Kristofferson ostensibly to develop the plot.  However, the author suspects they were bait to lure the Baby Boomer generation.\nThus, one can discern a movie's full power without distractions like plot or dialogue. One applies this Zen-like state when watching Burton's film. You should suspend disbelief when learning that the US Air Force in 2068 cannot prevent a rogue space launch. Then Mark Walberg, our Rambo-like hero, travels thousands of years into the future not because of technology. He is a cosmic Dorothy sucked into a space tornado that accelerates his vehicle past 88 miles per hour.  Once in Oz, the newly arrived prophet reveals several millennia of tradition as a lie.\nHow does he do it one might ask?  Because Marky Mark is charismatic and bright.  His character only needs a couple of days to gather a band of followers and discover the ruins of his old space station.  Somehow falling out of orbit, the facility's nuclear power plant and computers still work. Our intrepid Spaceman discovers the truth:  On Space Station Oberon, human and apes astronauts lived in happiness.  Then the chimp Semos, like the Serpent in the Garden of Evil, spread hate.Apparently, Burton's filmmaking team believes that current moviegoers are unable to grasp ambiguity.  Whereas the original film showed a world of mute humans, Burton's world is one where man had nothing to say.  Heston's conflict at the ruins in the Forbidden Zone revolved around the clash of ideas.  Kung-fu trained gorillas fought  ideological issues the original film never resolved.In conclusion, the author believes he is too harsh.  After all, the movie had hot leads, good production values and the plot was enough to keep me awake.  My favorite part was ending, partially because the torture was over. However, another reason was Burton's ending was reminiscent of Boulle's finale.  In the novel, our hero lands his spacecraft at a Paris airfield is met by a police car.  Which was driven by a gorilla.",

READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.I couldn't enjoy Planet of the Apes because of the gaps of logic taking place.In the original, Heston (Col. Taylor) landed on a planet with air, with apes ruling over humans, and they could speak English!--all these strange things were explained with the ending--Heston had returned to the Earth of the future.In the remake, I was thrown off from the beginning.\u0095Why are we using apes in space exploration? This would have made more sense in 1968 original, with Russian cosmonauts and apes being sent into space.But right now we use robot probes to explore Mars. Wouldn't that technology be all the more advanced and probable than using simians in the future?\u0095This planet is not Earth. It's convenient that Leo landed here and that there is oxygen to breathe. But in addition to that minor point, this planet was populated with ape and human survivors that crash landed on a ship. This begs the question--WHERE DID THE HORSE COME FROM?Again, it made sense in the original--they were on Earth from the beginning. But here, on another planet, it doesn't make any sense.\u0095Where did Ape Charlton Heston (Thade's dad) get the gun?Again, everything on this planet started from what survived the crash of the ship on the planet. Leo uses a modern laser-like weapon. Where did Ape Charlton Heston get an old gun even by our current standards, to present to his son, Gen Thade?\u0095How can the apes evolve so quickly, and yet the surviving humans are in the caveman stage of things?Apes can speak, ride the \"native\" horses of the planet, have a whole society and hierarchy, yet man, with all his technological know-how is now running around in loin cloths. Righttt.\u0095I knew this movie wouldn't be perfect, but even the couple of beers I downed before the movie could get me over that idiotic ending.Okay, Gen Thade somehow got smart enough to get back to Earth before Leo, and change history. But it isn't a new ape-history, it's a parallel Earth history where identical versions of things exist--The Lincoln Memorial with an Ape head, Cop cars with Gorilla cops, society in duplicate form to ours, the only thing changed is apes instead of humans.I give up, maybe it'll be explained in the sequel--but I ain't going to cough up 8 bucks to find out why.",

Tim Burton brings his unique bag of tricks to a film that is perhaps uniquely suited to them. His dark Gothic visuals blend surprisingly well with the topic. The plot contains much of his trademark satire, which replace the heavy moralising of the first film and makes for lighter, more summereaque fare. The cast has its ups{Helana Bonham Carter and Tim Roth being the standouts} and downs {most of the human actors seem to be chosen for their physical archetypes}. The Danny Elfman music is superb as always, adding to the powerful action scenes which stress the sheer physical strength pf the apes . The only major criticism I have is the bizarre ending, which does come as a small shock to those who haven't had it given away for them by some useless trailer trash. But it doesn't mesh well with the rest of the film and actually to me makes a sequel harder to visuallize. All in all, I think this movie is the most entertaining film this summer {altho' that's not saying a lot}, worth your time and money and deserving of better reviewers {both for and against} than have been shown here so far.",

As for the ending, I don't see any difficulty in understanding it (although I'm not going to spoil it to anyone), it is just a pointless twist on the 1968 ending.

Oh dear! What's with these filmmakers, why do they seem to pay no attention to the story and script? Planet of the Apes (2001) is a stunning piece of film work with great make-up, effects (a few actors aside) an excellent cast.The first half of the movie is entertaining and builds well though it doesn't take a genius to work out where the story going. The second half comes across as though they ran out of time and were not sure which way to take the movie. Because this it becomes farcical! It looks like they panicked, the problem is the original movie is a classic and easily stands the test of time, the end, still a very powerful image. They concentrate of trying to replicate (in a different way) this but it's desperate. If you're going to see this film try to forget about the original and just enjoy it as a different film. This is difficult because they insist on repeating the classic lines from the first movie. I suppose they were trying to be funny, it was funny but for the wrong reasons. Planet of the Apes is an entertaining movie that does not carry much impact Michael Clark Duncan is big, Mark Wahlberg is good, and Tim Roth is great, though given the costume, setting and make-up not a difficult task! People will not be watching this film in thirty years. Yet another disappointment.",

This film parodies the previous \"Ape\" film with several one-liners. This is not supposed to be a comedy or satire, it is a \"message\" movie on how we treat and behave towards other beings. At least that was what the novel and 1968 version was about. I think another problem was that the director did not know whether to have the apes behave like apes or humans. Dd they evolve and become human like or retain there ape behavious and just learn to speak? So many questions? Goofs? Disjointed plotlines and other errors that cannot be detailed without giving away the plot. Enjoy the make up and effects but that's it!!!!!",

Like a music CD can have good songs badly produced (or vice versa), this is a pretty good movie with a great director.

Pretty average day so far.Finds spaceship, goes back into the past to find Earth overtaken by the same evil Ape he thought he'd left on a different planet in the future. Mmmm...go figure.After Leo goes 'home' Thade retakes control of the Monkey planet, uses found technolgy to develop space travel, tries to follow Leo with army, ends up even further back in the past than Leo does.  Conquers Earth with army, Earth becomes Monkey planet.  Leo arrives back on Earth after all this has already happened.Does any of this make sense, probably not...but hey my name's not Kevin Smith...only joking!Scenario for next movie, Leo has to get back to the future to prevent Thade from getting to Earth in the first place.

There is a humour and darkness to the film that can only be provided by Tim Burton as well as his trade mark scarecrows. But as with all good things, what was right about this film came to a crashing end and that comes at the end. The initial plot resolution seemed to be an afterthought and then the 'shock' ending was illogical and did not seem to tie in with events in the rest of the film. If anybody has any theories as to how the ending is possible please let me know as we haven't been able to work it out.So for effort, cast (especially Estella Warren), direction and initial plot I give this film 6 out of 10.

Helena Bonham Carter is also good in her role as human rights activist Ari. The greatly underrated Paul Giamatti provides a little comic relief as Limbo and Michael Clarke Duncan, who played the giant John Coffey in `The Green Mile', is well suited in his role of Colonel Attar, a giant silver back gorilla. Sadly the human characters are far from as interesting, not to say that the acting on a whole is bad, just a little wooden at times. However Mark Wahlberg is a worthy successor to Charlton Heston (who has a little cameo as Thade's father). Sadly the weakest part of the film is Estella Warren, who plays Daena, it is quite clear that she is in this film for one reason only, and that's not her acting ability.The ape make-up, done by Rick Baker, of `Star Wars' fame is absolutely amazing. Several different species of ape are recreated with exceptional realism, and when compared to the original it is clear how far special effects make-up has come.The ending is a bit predictable, a little ill conceived and on the whole a rather confusing affair, you really need to see it to understand why, it is clear that Burton was aiming for a twist worthy of the original, this is where he falls short as his ending is a little messy, although it does leave it open for a possible sequel, so watch this space.On a closing note, it is quite sad to see that the twisted genius that is Tim Burton, the man who brought us Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow, has apparently been manipulated by Hollywood into making a film for the mass market, hence the 12 certificate, to increase merchandise possibilities. It still has all the visual expertise of Burton but lacks the darkness associated with most of his films. However `Planet of the Apes' is still a highly enjoyable film, if not as memorable as the original. So I highly recommend it to anyone who likes their films with plenty of action, great special effects, and full of apes.",

One high point however has to be the talents of the actors playing the apes, their not just actors in costume but really become the apes they are portraying and for an instant you do feel like they are really talking, civilized apes. Much less can be said about the actors portraying the human slaves, I liked it better in the original when they couldn't talk.

This is a problem of any film trying to do something thats been done before, the film its self is lost in the comparisons, take 'The Phantom Menace' for example, if you hadn't of seen 'Star Wars' you'd probably thing it was a great film on its own.Long story short:  They've taken the original 'Planet of the Apes' and set it to a new target audience.

Helen Bonham Carter gives an absolutely steller performance as Ari. Ari is an ape that has pity for the humans because she see's how poorly they are treated by the Apes, after she meets Leo Davidson (Mark Whalberg)  she starts to realize that Leo is different from the other humans and she starts to believe in the humans more and more. Mark Whalberg Delivers a good performance but nothing that he will be remembered for.

If this were an eighteen film it'd be Silence of the Apes! He won't, but should be up for an oscar.And for effectionardo's off the first movie and it's glorious ending, don't panic. I have to say that (despite the improbability of it) the writers have managed to come up with a nice play on the original.I have to say that of all the summers movies so far this is the one I'd want to see again, and while Tim Burton can't resist getting cheezy for a moment or two with us throughout the movie, it won't make you gag as much as most of his others.Go, enjoy, ape it up.",

Tim Burton DID develop the ape social structure very well, but it took HALF the movie to do so. the whole humans versus apes battle was not exciting at all. The action just wasnt good.the big PLUS of the movie though were the Apes. The makeup and set design were awesome, and the actors LOOKED like apes! so, kudos to Rick(or rich?) Baker for the makeup, but that wasnt enough to save this movie.it is worth going to see once.",

Now, I am almost 40 years old and grew up with the original films,TV series & cartoon.I was an apeaholic back in the day!I had everything from the Mego figures to the Don Post masks. I had realized early on,that this was NOT a remake but a \"re-imagined\" Planet of the Apes by Tim Burton.I am not a huge Tim Burton fan,though there are a couple of his films I enjoy.After seeing his version of POTA last night,I have to say that I am very impressed!Great story,great acting and fantastic make-up! Though the story and the names have changed,Burton's film is exciting to the core.I will not give much away as the movie has yet to be released on Friday,but I will say that there are more than a couple of original POTA quotes thrown in and the ending is a nice twist (as it was in the original).

The Makeup was fantastic; the action was great.

Also, given the ending, Wahlberg's understated performance and lack of sympathy for the other humans makes perfect sense--how ironic that his entire mission was to get back to Earth at all costs, making \"no promises\" to the other humans, only to accomplish his mission and find that taking a little more time, and caring a little more for the other humans, may have made all the difference.  All in all, I feel that this movie has all of the things that movies should--basically making a worthwhile statement or telling an interesting story, done in an artistic manner.

The make up is top noch, and thank god burton hates to make any overkill CGI efects, that plagues many of new Hollywood \"super productions\" And for all of the people crying about that humans \"did talk\" heres Burton\u00b4s view of it:second striking difference in the re-imagined APES is the fact that the planet's homo sapiens can actually talk. If you recall, the original portrayed humans more as animals (much like how apes are seen today), hunted and caged for sport by intelligent (almost human) apes. In Burton's film, the dichotomy between the two species presents a truer political allegory \u0096 a more spot-on metaphor for socialComing to this planet [at this point in] its evolution where the apes are still retaining some of their primal instincts, even if they're at odds with themselves \u0096 you have some apes that are kind of moving more humanesque, you've got apes that are wanting to maintain their apedom and you've got people who still talk. Eventually, the history of this planet will probably go the way [of the original], but the human's self-esteem is still being beaten out of them at this stage.'My complains? yes how the hell Estella Waren keeps a incredible make up all the movie, please!!! make it ugly and dirty, even few scars heeheSimply the best of this summer, and i really love the ala Twiligth Zone ending!!!",

I won't elaborate too much on what others have already noted as too much of a stretch - the ending, for example.  There was a perfect opportunity to end the movie as (SPOILER!) Leo gets sucked back into the electric storm.  That would have been believable, and would even have set viewers up nicely for a sequel - as well as letting us imagine the ending on our own, leading to debate, speculation, and better box office receipts when/if a sequel ever does come out.My biggest beef is with other requirements of the suspension of belief. For starters, where the hell did the horses come from??  If everything was supposed to come from the space ship, then why weren't we shown any horses on the spaceship?  How come more apes weren't killed in the rocket blast? They may be strong, but they're not immortal.  How come Thade wasn't killed by a ricocheting bullet??  C'mon, he unloaded a whole bunch of them, why didn't *one* touch him?  Why was there always a branding iron laying conveniently nearby, ready for use?  How could the humans have fought the apes when they were probably starving and dehydrated?\nObviously this film did not entrance me enough to ignore or not even notice these inconsistencies.  I suppose Burton thought the movie would be action-packed enough to induce the audience to overlook them.  The theatre was full, but the only reaction everyone had (SPOILER!) was to the half-second where Leo kisses Ari.  Gasps of disgust (what'dya expect - it's evolution-free Kansas).  No one was involved enough in the film to cheer when the rocket blasted, egg on the bad guys, or laugh at the comic relief.\nI did enjoy the Charlton Heston scene.

He only wants to go home.  He only cares about himself.  And all without the arrogant 'attitude' we're used to seeing in movies.  It's either Look at me I'm cool, or Look at me I'm a hero, Wahlberg's character and final decision in the movie pave the way for turning upside down everything you ever thought you knew about what's really going on.  A perfect sci-fi where the seemingly explainable goes unexplained.The plausibility of the opening year at 2029?  A stretch...only if you believe we're in the same reality, which you will find out becomes one for the X-files.   The original 1968 movie left you with a shock, so you could figure out the timeline and the ape evolution.  This movie doesn't try to shock, as many are thinking it's supposed to.  It's actually supposed to make you THINK who came first, human or ape?  You will realize that you would have never reached this point if Wahlberg walked the path of the true hero.",

Im a 34 year old who saw the orginal movies and series on Tv or video but never in a Theater. Burton and crew really entertained me without taking on the unnecessary and futile task of re-inventing the wheel. They knew that we know the basic premise and they made what was predictable exciting and awesome with a plausible story that doesn't compete with the action. Guessing who's in Ape face, he Puns, and the effect could easily catipult POTA 2001 into a midnight movie cult fave for some time to come. (spoiler Alert) In fairness I must say that the filmmakers seem to play it safe and in 3 areas and traggically comical in another.1. Where are the female gorillas and orangutans - were they left out as no to offend certain ethnic groups. 2. The undone/editted out love scene between female chimp Ari and hero Leo is noticeably missing. 3. Where are the half breeds there would certainly be some given the ape/human relations in this movie 4. Last man standing, Leo,s more attracted to an ape than to a woman. How funny!

For two full hours, I was thoroughly convinced that this was the best movie I've seen all year. Better than Proof of Life, better than X-Men, better than Moulin Rouge, better than The Pledge, Traffic, or Shrek.  I was minutes away from leaving this movie in awe.Then, the walls came a-crumblin' down.I thought that this \"reimagining\" had many great additions to the plot that were excluded from the Heston classic:  an explanation of the origin of the ape population and intelligence, the early fate of the humans, the origination of the holy scripts of the ape culture, a reasonable and more realistic adaptation of evolved apes (keeping some ape attributes in the process), and a less predictable twist-of-fate discovery on the foreign planet by the hero.  This time, it's not Earth he discovers, just like the pre-movie trailers say it isn't, but he discovers his role in the history of the planet.  It works well, as does the whole plot, in a wonderfully designed planet with great costumes and backgrounds.  It was an A+ movie until the ending.I had heard that Burton filmed many endings for this film and then chose one.  If this is true, then I have a great idea for him:  send out the alternate endings in the next coming weeks and tell the public you've done so.  Let us see the different endings on the big screen, never knowing which one is with the movie! It would be a real first, and would give us a chance to make peace with the end of this movie.The end of this movie, of course, being the only part of the movie that was not spectacular.It's not that we movie fans don't love a surprise ending, or a happy ending, or an unhappy ending, or a predictable ending;  it's just that we do like it to make sense.  The ending of this movie makes absolutely no sense, none. It is in logical, chronological, and collossal error.  It does not correspond with anything else in the movie, and it simply makes no sense whatsoever.  This is perhaps the worst ending of a movie since Waterworld, and ruins what was over two hours of the best movie I've seen all summer. It was a great movie, it should have ended greatly.  I give it an A++ for two hours or so, and an F-- for the last few minutes.

I thought the comedy was great and something I didn't expect.SPOILER ALERT:I wouldn't have wanted Mark to be more \"human\", after all he was a military guy. My biggest gripes were that the apes had more strength than they should've and the female apes were poorly designed.  You immediately knew which ape species the male ones were, but the poor females (what few there were) looked worse than the '68 ones.  Maybe the makeup artists should've paid closer attention to HOW female apes looked when they went to the zoo for research...\nEveryone wonders about the ending. (for all who haven't figured it out), there were 2 spacecrafts on the planet, remember.If you still don't get it, you never will.  Just wait for the sequel.Even my 10 year old got the ending...",

One easy way would be to change the date.  The movie starts in the distant future of 2029??  In 28 yrs we will have star trek like shuttle that can go in and out of orbit with a single stage and then travel across the solar system.  We will have a magnificent research center somewhere around saturn that has batteries that last thousands of years. I just can't wait to see what we will have before I am 50. The next big gripe is the uninhabited planet that has only apes and humans...and horses.  Where'd those horses come from?  While I appreciate the attempt to explain the source of the apes, it could have been much better.  How'd the apes rebel against the armed humans in the first place? I'm sure an ape can kick my butt, but I can blow it's head off with a gun. There are countless other problems with the movie that I don't feel like bringing up.  The movie was also slow for an action flick, two hours pass and you can count major moments on one hand. The final gripe is the ending which I won't \"spoil\" for anyone.  Try as hard as you want to defend it, but it makes absolutely no sense.  It was meant as a shocker, but the surprise came from how ridiculous it was.  People laughed in the theater where I was. Don't waste your money on this movie.  Maybe rent it, but I'd recommend waiting for it to be on a movie channel.",

            "review_title": "OK ... so it wasn't the best movie ...",
            "content": "So I went to see Planet of The Apes at the Cinerama theatre here in Seattle (nice giant 65ft screen, wicked sound system, etc ...)I think that all I can really say is that this movie was no academy award winning piece of art, however it wasn't the terrible production that people make it out to be here in the user comment section of IMDB.Of course, like all the other crud coming out of Hollywood, this film was definitely aimed at the dumber bunch of us humans ... i.e. the lowest common denominator, then again it is a summer popcorn movie.Anyway, I enjoyed this movie for what it was ... simple fun.Now, having read many if not almost all of the comments posted here, let me answer a few things that people have been asking and in most cases incorectly answering.  SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!1) Time & Place / Where & When:  The film begins in an orbit around/near Saturn in 2029.  Mark Wahlberg's character goes through the \"storm\" and gets booted to about 2329 (according to the ship's computer) and crashes into an uncharted planet with multiple moons ... in close proximity to a number of other planets which in no way resembles our solar system (past or present)... i.e. it is not Earth.2) Mark Wahlberg's spaceship:  There is no way that anyone on the ape planet could salvage the ship. a) no technology available b) ship's electrical system is fried (that's why it crashes) and what wasn't destroyed on planetary-entry was surely destroyed while underwater c) the pod crash-landed on a planet. its broken. d) the capsule's window/door was blown off by explosive bolts e) its under water f) nobody knows how to fly it (well except for the Pericles ... but I don't think he is going anywhere soon)3) The \"ancient\" gun: General Thade's lineage was said numerous times to lead directly back to the progenitor of their current species.  The ape that killed most, if not all of the humans after the crash ... who killed them with a gun.5) The Oberon wreck:  1) We did not know when the Oberon crashed into the planet, but since the storm was messing up their systems (remember the power going out?) it is safe to say that the station was pulled into the vortex so to speak.  It probably got kicked backwards quite a bit.  Remember, the pods went through numerous time-jumps becasue they were powered and had lots of forward momentum. So, the ship crashes way way in the past on the same planet that Mark Wahlberg lands on in the future.  Apes escape and continue evolving ... (it is possible that there were other animal species (maybe not horses) on the station (it was afteral quite large) like Gorillas, etc ...)  Station has three fuel tanks (2 empty and 1 full) and a nuclear powered electrical system ... which seemed to be shut down until Mark Wahlberg's character reactivated it.  He said it would keep its power for 1000 years or so ... but if it was turned off ... well who knows.  As for the ship surviving at all ... who knows.  It seemed to be in the desert (dry air preserves things) and it was in the \"forbidden zone\" so it wasn't messed with so it could have lasted a long time in its current state.6) When the ape's attack and they start the main engine, it is highly probable that most of the apes would have survived ... albeit badly burned becasue the engine exhaust was not pointed parallel to the ground, but rather upwards at an angle ... the point of the tactic was not to kill but more to confuse/scare the apes.7) Thade is doomed.  He cannot escape the ship's control room for a number of reasons: a) the only hand that can open the door left the planet. b) considering the glass wall/door survived impact from space into a planet without breaking probably means nothing on the planet is going to do the trick c) nobody likes him8) Someone asked why he was in such a hurry to get home?  Well, would you want to stay in a primitive world when you had the opportunity to go home to all that you know and loved?9) When Mark Wahlberg's character re-enter's the storm, he clearly re-arrives back in the orbit of saturn and he clearly sets course for earth where he crashes.  The chronometer on his computer display also indicates that he is back to 2020 something or other ...If anything is true ... I would have to say that when they jumped in time and space they also jumped realities. Saturn = mystery planet     Present = way in the future Humanverse = apeverseon the return trip, he didn't manage to jump back from apeverse > humanverse although he did get the time and space parts correct\nNow for my personal issues with the logic:1) Where did the horses come from2) If the original apes killed the remaining crew from the space station, where did all of the humans come from (remember humans purportedly outnumbered the ape population)3) If the humans are also descendants from the space station, and the apes evolved along with them, wouldn't the resultant society have been a bit more egalitarian?4) if the ape's planet really was a \"mirror\" to our own ... shouldn't all of the politicians have been humans?Well that's my take on this film ... again ... you can't go into summer event movies expecting anything to be really good ... you just have to enjoy films like these for what they are ... mindless entertainment (that costs $200 million or so to produce)",

The movements of the actors are astounding - the walking especially.  The makeup is incredible - becoming more rare as cinema progresses because directors and producers want to do things computer generated, because it's quicker and easier, even though makeup is more realistic.  Tim Burton's decision to go with makeup was very shrewd.Planet of The Apes is a fascinating film and provokes much thought, if you are open to it.  I liked it very much.",

I remember it being meaningful, instead of this new-age \"save the little people\" approach that try to teach us animal rights and how humans are cruel and unpredictable.Let me just get this out in the open, the ending sucked.  Sure it was a surprise, but it made no sense and it forces a sequel to explain it.  I would've enjoyed it better if it was more like the original (and not the book).If you've seen the original, it's nothing like this version.  He lands by himself and is quickly thrown into the conflict.  A minor change (that I wasnt expecting, actually) was that he could talk as soon as he landed, where in the original it took Heston a while to talk.  Dr. Zaius is back, thrown in a comedic role thus losing the serious role he had back in the original.  Again, it's just a matter of taste.  If you want a reved up, updated classic...this is the movie for you.Something has always bothered me.  It was in the original and in this one as well (I dont know if it's the same in the book as well), but why doesnt the main character get that HOT human chick?  He seems more interested in that female monkey!  Sheesh, Estella Warren is very VERY hot, and she's a Canadian as well! ;)  That chick from the original was hot too, but she's like 4 000 years old now... :(The effects were there, the musical score was there...the plot and development of characters was not.  We get a sense of the theme, but neither the main character or his human friends are developed in any way.Overall, it's a very enjoyable movie, however they took a lot from the original that hard-core fans such as myself dont like.",

Just so you know.Yes, the script was bad, no charater development, useless people (Warren). most of those are talked about in the other reviews.Yes, as I said before the script is pretty bad, but some things can be the actor's fault. Some of mark's (leo davidson) lines were very poorly delivered. In my opinion, marky shouldn't have joined the Funky Bunch, and he should have gone to acting school (or a better one if he already has). Besides him, everyone one's acting was pretty good, but some of Duncan's deliveries were also poor.Yes, I liked this movie, but I did like the original better. It seemed that everything that was wrong with the original, was good in this one, what was bad in the new one, was good in the old one. Was Burton trying to make it better, and just missed the things that were good, concentrating only on the bad parts?Yes, the ending was bad. When Marky (leo) landed on earth (it wasn't the same planet, the solar system is our own, and it is earth when they show the large picture). He lands on the steps, and sees that the memorial now has Thade's head on it. The cops pull up, apes jump out, in full cop clothing, they pull guns on Leo. About this time I put my head in my hands, and just lost it. I laughed for a couple minutes, because of how rediculous it was. Hoping, that there was more, but no. Sure to be more if and when there is a sequal. Will it be a reimagining of the second original (lets hope not)?Yes, many people have tried to explain the ending. This specifically mentioned before in the movie contradict those theories. I have my own, which, fits EVERY thing mentioned in the move. It's not a realistic ending, but it FITS with EVERYTHING.",

Complaints about the super-strength of the apes, and the exaggerated leaps are wrong.  The apes were GENETICALLY ENHANCED, that's why they EVOLVED and turned into the talking apes that they are.  How else would the apes have revolted against the Oberon crew, unless they had that strength? The ending, although extremely confusing, is good for two reasons: would you REALLY want a clich\u00e9 ending where Wahlberg goes back to Earth and lives happily ever after, and it causes discussion and deep thought even long after the movie is over; something that is rare in movies today. Roth's performance steals the show, while Wahlberg does an OK job (not like you'd expect him to be spectacular anyways).",

Ever do any research?  It's true, they don't swim; they sink and drown.  And anyone who has ever been to the zoo should ask the keepers about the accuracy of some of the primates with various \"missiles\" such as food or feces.  They are DARNED accurate! :)I loved that Tim used people from the original movie!  Anyone notice Charleton Heston?  Or that he was anti-gun?  What a blow to the NRA! :)I loved Tim's use of action, movement, reality, fear, emotion and just plain FUN throughout the whole show.Perhaps some of the people who really didn't like the movie should go once more, with a very open mind, and see the movie for what it is: an excellent story of what COULD be, WILL be, or WAS...Grade from our family: A+",

I did not like Planet of the Apes (2001), not even a little.From the opening of the movie until the end, I found the cinematography to be amatuer, I was never able to get into the movie as it appeared fake, a movie set.Not one human character in the movie could act, with the male and female human leads being horrible actors (Mark W. and Estella W.) and badly cast. The worst scenes in the movie are when these two are together, she in her \"just from the salon\" hairdo and inflated lips, and he with his immature camera presence nearly made me groan out loud when they were on screen together.The human characters were all over the place with a polished butler and maid, a grizzled old bushman, an african-american with face-scar tatoos, and the hot babe, all speaking perfect English that they learned in their tribal villages in the mountains...The only two actors of note in the movie, Tim Roth (as the Chimpanzee General Thade) and Michael Clarke Duncan (as the Gorilla Commander Attar) were quite good, with great fierceness and expression, but their excellent performances only showed the flawed performances of the other actors, even Helena Bonham Carter (as Ari the Chimpanzee Humanist) performed poorly in this movie.The makeup I heard so much about was very good for the ape males, but I found the ape female makeup to be far inferior and distracted me from their characters so much that I could not enjoy watching them.Many times during this movie I wanted to groan out loud, especially at the ridiculous events that completely ignored science and probability.  Humans randomly running through ape quarters kept bumping into every character you had met previously, how convenient.  Two spacecraft getting hit by random time distortions show up at the same time in the future.  Apes killing apes without remorse, even hundreds at a time.The ending is just plain stupid, won't mention it here but most people walking out of the theater hated the \"surprise\" ending.

Not as good as the original (what remakes are?), I found everything in the film to be 'acceptable', even some of the cheesier heroic scenes from the Wahlberg character, but the ending just went too far. That drastically changed my impressions of the film, which I was thinking of as a 5 or a 6 until the finale reduced it to a 3. Wait for HBO: You won't be missing much.",

I think the jokes are funnier if you know the original.  I also think the humor would have been enhanced if we knew something more of the characters.  When I think of Batman you really fell in love with the Joker. Batman wasn't developed too much, but the Joker was.Much of what would happen was somewhat predictable, although not to the point of destroying the film.I would recommend going to see the film.  Don't compare it to the original, and don't look for any deep message or plot.2.SPOILERS!Having watched a lot of Star Trek (which as one person commented, helps to understand Holywood's love of time travel screw ups), I thought I'd try and comment on some of the things that don't seem to mesh.On the ship landing thousands of years earlier, Whalberg showing up thousands of years later, and the chimp showing up days after that:The chimp had to show up or you couldn't fix that scene!  (LoL).  With time travel through a storm, everyone would end up at different unmapped points.On earth being all apes:Whalberg had probably been on earth the entire time and just not have known it.  At first I figured he ended up on the same planet thousands of years later (which he did) but I didn't think the planet was earth.  Remember the signals they were getting from the storm?  All images from earth at different times.  They thought it was a reflection.  It may have been the actual signals coming through the storm.  When the ships passed through the storm they were actually be transported to earth at various points in time. Once again, since they did not know how to navigate the storm they would have no way of controlling where in time they would land.Who really knows at what moment the space station crashed on the planet (I assume crashed, not landed as someone else hinted at).  If it was thousands of years before modern man, these super monkeys could have taken over and destroyed man's progress at whatever level of civilization they had grown to.  I doubt it was 2029, otherwise someone have known the space station came down from space.  It could have been in the future (as in the original) in some sort of post apocalyptic thing.I thought the Abe Lincoln thing was kind of cheezy, but it helped lay it all out neatly and will garner another 20 bucks out of many of us.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I really enjoyed this movie.  As remakes go, I thought it was done well. It did justice to the original, while changing enough of the story to make it unique on its own.  As for the ending, when I read through the other comments posted on this site, I realized that many people did not understand it or they have alternate explanations to what I believe.  Unfortunately, these other explanations do not make sense.  Therefore, I will explain the ending to clear it up.  First of all, and this is the most important fact, the planet that Mark Wahlberg crash lands on is not Earth.  The whole story and everything that happens on this planet is a separate issue from what has happened on Earth when he returns.  When he does return, he finds that Earth is now controlled by apes, obviously leading us to the question of how it happened.  Well, we are given the most important piece of information to understand this, the statue of General Thade.  We then know that he is the one who led the apes to the control of the planet.  The next question would be how he accomplished this task.  Well, he must first get to Earth in order to affect any change there.  And the only way to get to another planet is to fly there in a ship.  What ship?  The one that Mark Wahlberg crashed in and the one that General Thade knows all about.  How will he fly or learn to fly it?  The chimp pilot that is left on his planet.  So basically, here it is. General Thade is alive when we last see him.  He escapes or maybe just pretends to accept the changes that have occurred on his planet.  In order to flee the planet and perhaps to get some revenge against the human who changed his world, he salvages the ship from the water, somehow repairs it, assuming it needs to be repaired, since all we know for sure is that it had a rough landing, and then learns to fly it with the help, possibly by force of the chimp pilot.  He travels back along the same route as Mark Wahlberg and enters the storm.  He is transported back in time, but farther back then Mark Wahlberg.  Once there, he leads a rebellion of apes on Earth against humanity and wins.  That's it.  It is simple and makes perfect sense and contradicts nothing we saw in the movie.  And it is not even a new idea. If you have watched the old movies, and have seen \"Escape from the Planet of the Apes,\" you will remember that the apes got to Earth in almost the identical way.  They salvaged Charlton Heston's ship from the water, somehow repaired it and learned to fly it and returned back in time to Earth.  I actually think that is part of the reason this ending was used; as a throwback to one of the elements of the old movies.  Of course, this ending is a stretch to the imagination, but this is science fiction and the fact that it is possible is all that is required.  If you have watched the old Planet of the Apes movies, you will know that the stories stretched the line of believability even thinner.  This ending also adds the irony that is needed in these types of stories.  Mark Wahlberg changes the course of history on another world and then leaves to go back to his own, but is thwarted by General Thade, who basically does the same thing to his world. Now he is stuck on Earth in an even worse environment then the one he wanted so badly to leave.",

            "content": "***Spoiler Alert*** I don't actually tell the ending of the movie, but I'm sure I've written something that could ruin it for someone.Everyone who hates this movie seems to dislike if for the same reason-the ending. I loved the original POTA, and feel it has one of the best surprise endings of all film history. While the original movie followed the overall plot of the book, (yes, book. It was a book first, and obviously NOBODY who has posted here has ever read it) its ending is vastly different. This new incarnation has absolutely no similarity to the book other than an astronaut being stranded on a planet of apes-AND the ending!This is what I think happened, Burton knew he really couldn't top the ending of the original, and so settled for the next best thing by paying homage to the book's ending. A quick synopsis of the book's ending for those who haven't read it: The astronaut flies off of the planet of the apes. He flies back to earth, makes radio contact with ground crews, and lands. On the ground (I seem to remember him landing at an airbase) he sees jeeps and trucks approaching his ship. But as they get closer he sees that they are being driven by \u0085 APES! My details may be a bit off, I read the book over 10 years ago, but that's the gist of it. The planet of the apes and Earth were two different planets in the book, as I believe they are in the new film. You see, the thrust of the story is that the hero isn't merely trapped on a planet controlled by apes, but trapped in a universe populated by them. Alternate reality, parallel dimension, whatever. It kind of ticks me off that all these sci-fi geeks that are ripping the new movie for time-travel flubs can't broaden their minds to possibly accept the fact that Wahlberg was traveling through dimensions as well as time. Think about it people, in this film you buy into the idea that inter-stellar travel is possible in 40 years, apes can walk and talk, and a `magnetic space storm' can toss a tiny little ship through time, but it's too ridiculous to think it could open portals to another universe.I'm not claiming that this is a perfect solution to all the problems and questions the movie brings up, but I think it is closer to what the film makers were trying to convey.Was it just me, or did anyone else think the faces in those fuzzy, static filled video images at the beginning and near the end of the movie looked rather ape-like? More clues that it is an alternate reality?Did anyone else catch the Wizard of Oz line? `You go this way, you go that way, the rest come with me and we'll surround them!'Oh yeah, I enjoyed the movie. It entertained me for two hours and that's all I was hoping for. I never really expect Oscar-like performances from mega-hyped summer blockblusters. The original is still better in my book, though.",

From the first scene the sound and special effects are great.  You get wrapped into this film quickly and intensely.  You are, in fact, held throughout the entire film.Burton, as usual, has created a very, very dark film that seems to offer no hope for salvation.  Characters become aware of their \"sins\" and misconceptions of reality.  The battle seen of ape vs. man shows the reduction of man to his survivalist instinct, and a hope, albeit distant, for reconciliation.Most films would have stopped there.  Kudos to Burton for going further, but where did he think he was going to take us?  A great film was RUINED by the ending.

            "content": "I have not seen any of the previous \"Planet Of The Apes\" movies, so my review is purely based on this film's success as an entertaining Hollywood flick. That said, \"Planet Of The Apes\" succeeds in many ways as just that. The fast-paced plot moves along nicely, and the colorful special effects awed me into partial submission. Indeed, if I wasn't such an intelligent human, I might be able to close the part of my brain that yearns for better character development as well as some dialogue that stimulates a human above kindergarden age. Perhaps, what I suspect is true; that Tim Burton is partial to the apes, and truly believes that us humans aren't really that intelligent.Most of the characters in \"Planet Of The Apes\" do things for no good reason. Mark Wahlberg's character risks his life for a monkey for no reason. Helena Bonham Carter's character risks her life for a human for no reason. Neither one of these characters has a history that warrants such actions- yet they forge ahead with such heroic impulse! Estella Warren's character just shouldn't even be in the movie. In fact, I didn't really notice her until the end when Mark Wahlberg kisses her for no apparent reason- did he steal glances at her that I didn't notice? Did he really have time to notice her \"t and a\" while escaping from the apes and planning a battle? The only character which was developed was Thade. There is a scene with his father that explains why he hates humans so much.In a movie where dialogue is sparse, sentences are loaded. When a character opens his mouth, the audience has expectations.Hollywood action movies always have some one line jokes. In this movie that's all there is. Action sequences are interrupted by marvels such as \"don't touch me you stinking human\", or \"in my planets monkeys live in cages and beg for treats\". These utterances only serve to emphasize what we already know from the intense visuals. It feels like they were placed there to help the PG audience understand what is going on. It's as if Tim Burton is telling the audience \"Look guys, the humans and the apes don't get along on this planet. I mean they really don't get along. Get it?They don't get along. Get it?\"Okay, I've already spent too much time on this review.  I wish the producers of this movie had spent as much  time on their script! Oh wait I didn't explain the surprise ending!

Of course then the time to an observer moving at that speed would seem to slow down relative to an observer outside of that frame of reference (time dilation effect).  This was explained by Albert Einstein in the early part of the last century.  Worm holes are another consequence of Einstein's relativistic theories. Regardless of how a being views the \"device\" that propels the travelers in both movies, I must concede that the first movie was better written, and that even in fantasy with a willing suspence of belief, there are certain rules of internal logic that should be followed. That is why so many people are struggling to make sense of this movie.  In a good movie one does not need to work that hard.  Dr. Who was a much better time traveler, and the writing was much more consistent.  Besides, the hero in this movie can't even fly a space pod as good as his ape assistant!

            "content": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Yes, here's another person so full of their own opinions that he feels compelled to post them on the internet.  Here's my $0.02:First off, I agree with Leonard Maltin that POTA 1968 is a near-classic. However, people who espouse the movie's cultural importance are exaggerating to a certain extent.  Let's \"talk turkey\" for a moment.  The chief concern with POTA 1968 was to produce a well-scripted, entertaining family movie. Concern #2 was that the Ape prosthetics were believable and not something the audience would laugh at.  Here's a little bit of trivia:  As revealed in Arthur C. Clarke's \"The Lost Worlds of 2001,\" Stanley Kubric and he were furious that POTA beat out 2001:A Space Odyssey for a special make-up effects Oscar.  Go figure.The political commentary was tertiary.  It was craftily woven into the script but was not the key purpose of the movie.  Indeed it was so well written some viewers didn't even realize they were watching a work containing political metaphors and social critique.  In fact 20th Century Fox studio exec. Richard Zanuck himself didn't even see those aspects of the movie, or to this day refuses to admit they exist.  It is of some note that he produced POTA 2001.Modern day viewers who criticize POTA 1968 (or even go so far as to say the 2001 version in better) should keep in mind that we watch a movie with eyes affected by the era that surrounds us.  The perceptions of a person who watched this movie when it first came out (or during a re-release sometime in the 70's as I did) will not be the same as someone who watches it for the first time today.  I can only imagine what disparaging comments viewers in thirty years are going to say about the vapid quality of Hollywood excreta nowadays.Now let's look at POTA 2001 piece-by-piece: Script:  I had a bad feeling when I saw three screenwriters, three executive producers plus a full producer!!!  Whoah!  This is just way too many hands dipping their opinions into the cake mix.  It's no surprise that the story often screeches to a halt or leaves viewers scratching their heads in confusion.  I won't go into the plot contrivances and holes except to say that Tim Burton should have asked for at least five more drafts.Make-up:  Who needs to say anything more about this?  One of the best parts of the movie.  Previous user comments say all the chimpanzee women look like LaToya Jackson.  Don't you think this is just the teensiest bit racist?  I guess I'm the only one who thinks Ari (and Helena Bonham Carter for that matter) is pretty.Sets:  Burton only directed this, folks.  He didn't write, produce or design sets.  However, it still comes off feeling like a peek into Burton's mind: dark, grim and definitely moody.  The set direction is somewhat claustrophobic.  Though this may be purposeful, it doesn't quite match the expansiveness conveyed by the long shots of the city.Acting:  There's a reason so many of us love Tim Roth.  I agree that his Thade will go down in the annals of cinematic villains.  Are some of his lines incomprehensible because of the way he speaks?  Yes, but Tim Roth sometimes mumbles and grumbles with any of his roles.  So what?  At least he's not Estella Warren.  Guys think this woman is beautiful?  Yuck. That's beside the fact that she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.  Why did they decide to have the humans talk anyway?  Nothing was added to the story by their dialogue.  Then again, almost none of the dialogue adds anything to the story, so what the hell. Carter is okay as Ari, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa gets a decent role, David Warner is still alive and kicking, Mark Wahlberg is cardboard and emotionless (though this may be on purpose to reflect most modern day men) and the cameo by Chuck Heston is simply priceless.The ending:  The next part is a bit spoily, so proceed at your own caution. As far as the ending is concerned, this is going to be disparaged and debated amongst pro and anti groups for some time.  First off, before you put down a movie, try reading the book (for those that don't know - that's what you do with books; hold them in your hand and read them.)  As stated in another user comment, the Boulle novel took place on a world other than Earth.  When the astronaut returns to Earth we get a similar situation as in POTA 2001.  But how could this coexist with the explanation of the ape origins in the 2001 movie?  Simple, as explained in another user comment, with Thade recovering Davidson's pod, repairing it, and learning how to use it.  In fact if a person thinks about what's going on instead of just letting their mushlike brains stagnate, this adds new irony to the end wherein Thade does to Davidson's world what Davidson did to Thade's.  On the other hand, much of the rest of the movie cultivates our brains into mush so it's not surprising the end did nothing but confuse most viewers.Yes, this theory is hard to believe.  But the entire premise of the third Apes movie, Escape from the Planet of the Apes, is based on Cornelius, Zira and a worthless throwaway character finding Taylor's ship, lifting it out of hundreds of feet of water, learning how to use it, finding fuel for it, and somehow managing to travel back in time with it.  And all this is back story; it is never explained.  At least Thade knows exactly where Davidson's pod is.  And we're talking about a pod, not some multi-thousand ton craft. It's sitting no more than thirty feet below the surface of a tiny pond. Also, Thade has a tutor:  the Ape Davidson left behind.  However, it's a stretch even for someone who suspends his disbelief as easily as I that a little pod has 1) The power to achieve the velocity to break free of the planet's gravity well as well as 2) Fuel capacity to travel from Saturn to Earth.All this being said, I enjoyed this movie.  Why?  Because it was fun.  Tim Roth was Damn scary.  Wahlberg was convincing as a bland, everyday \"stranger in a strange land.\"  Much, though not all, of the supporting cast makes the world come alive to a certain extent.  There's just enough of a story and hints of character development to pique interest, though granted not enough to last the entire movie.  There are a lot of little things that are likeable, such as the tongue-in-cheek references to the 1968 POTA with the lines, \"Get your stinking hands off me you damn dirty human!\" and \"Damn them all to Hell!\"  There's the reference to V'Ger (Star Trek: The Motion Picture) and Zardoz (Zardoz) with the name of the forbidden \"Calima.\" POTA 2001 has it's flaws, but what doesn't these days?  If you don't want to risk 8-9 bucks, go see a matinee.To the people who say \"This isn't science-fiction\":  Let me put it this way: If I film myself lighting a match, that's science.  If I film myself lighting a match in a cro-magnon setting, that's science fiction.  Don't be a sci-fi snob.",

There were some great aspects of the film, some of the characters had real depth, the acting and special effects were very good, and the general feeling of the Ape world was certainly believable.  The problem for me was that firstly the initial plot twist was very obvious from the first minute of the film (expecting a twist, a space station with Apes and Humans above a strange world - an unusual space occurrence, straight from Startrek Next Generation?) and I'm still actively puzzled by the ending.<Do not read onwards if you have not seen the film and wish to do so> The end of the film, the hero locks general thade in a zoo with supreme irony, kisses the ape, kisses the girl and fly's back to earth (surprisingly quickly for a space exploration shuttle). He arrives to find that General Thade has beaten him to it, and that Apes evolved as the superior species to man on Earth.  That's where I get confused, was it a parallel universe (star trek again?), in which case how did Thade get there? Was the Ape planet actually earth, and after 'Leo' leaves the planet he returns to find that millennia have passed and Thade had taken over and become the leader? Is it all a coincidence, why have the timelines changed on earth?  how did Thade appear as Abraham Lincoln and just how did Apes invent fire engines and police cars etc when Charlton Heston himself (Thade's dying father) had told us that Apes lacked the creative genes necessary to do this?In conclusion, I think I liked the film, it is amusing, thrilling and intelligent.  The ape effects are really good, and whilst some characters are nicely developed, there is a shallow element to some.  The ending does have me mystified, but its possilbe that I missed the point.",

I had no problem with the acting, Tim Roth is always great, look forward to anything he's in. I didn't get Wahlberg's performance till I thought about it a bit more and realized that was his character, a bit selfish and tunnel-visioned. He kind of deserved the ending ; ). And I rather enjoyed seeing a different version and wouldn't mind seeing more directors do this. Seeing the second version of Psycho mimicked shot for shot left me cold. This version of Planet of the Apes still dealt with the important issues and I'm glad for that. We all had a lot of discussion about the nature of human behavior and how we all need to get along somehow. I know the cynics are scowling now, but its true. I see some folks don't get the ending and I'm not sure I do either. Perhaps that was intended, because it was left wide open for a sequel.

Mark Wahlberg has no chemistry with anyone really and the villain in this isn't good and is extremely forgettable. Some of the big apes are well designed but the small chimp looking ones are stupid. The humans are extremely forgettable and have no chemistry either and almost no backstory and are the definition of one dimensional. Even the friendly girl ape who I can't even remember her name was just ok. Paul Giamatti was terrible in this and completely miscast as the comedic relief. His character should've been cut completely. The biggest shortfall here is the dialogue is NO WHERE near as compelling and riveting as the first and can be very boring at times especially the part in the first half where they all have dinner and it reminds me of Coursant in Phantom Menace. The cinematography isn't bad but is one of the most frustrating parts watching this. you can tell there is lots of effort in the ape designs, sets, lots of practical effects that are well done and SHOULD WORK but they are weighed down by the stupid chimps jumping 10 feet, stupid ape noises/expressions, and during night scenes it is way too dark lots of times. The CGI is dated and average but 85% of this is practical so it's not a big deal. The ending is also sooooo dumb and bad. The music is boring and forgettable. The editing and pacing are not good either. This is clearly trying to be a Action/Adventure movie with Sci-Fi mixed in more than the first was a clever Sci-Fi Social commentary. This has NONE of the underlying messaging or thought provoking moments the original had that sets it apart from all others. It tries to focus more on the background of the apes and their backstories and society. But the dialogue isn't as riveting, and it loses focus on the humans and at the expense of giving the apes more backstory it doesn't give the humans hardly any. Heck for 30 minutes in the first half Mark Wahlberg just disappears into the background. This is sooooo boring to watch by the second half because of the boring characters, dumb villain, miscasting's, the lack of backstory of the humans, the dumb interjected chimp fighting moments, and the worst part the stupid ending. The plot twist of the monkeys on the ship they were testing evolving into the apes makes no sense either because were never given a reason how that happened. Also are you telling me the chimp police drive Ford Crown Victoria's meant for humans and mimic the Lincoln Memorial....it's so dumb and looks bad. The whole monkey he was chasing after at the start in the ship being their god is sooooo dumb as well. It has good parts to it but just never makes it work together in a cohesive way. Just watch the 1968 one. This is a insult.",

It is, though, a surprise that this film flopped given who got attached to it. Tim Burton as director, with the acting talents of Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Paul Giamatti. It's neat that Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison (stars of the original) made cameos, though.\n\nWahlberg feels a bit miscast, though Bonham Carter and Giamatti are solid; the latter particularly seemed to enjoy the role. The film does have a Burton edge to it, as expected, but this is one of his weaker films no doubt.

Because the producers needed to shoehorn an ape into the opening scene of this pathetic attempt to cash in on the original franchise. Instead of good writing we get lavish special effects and instead of actors we get Marky Mark Wahlberg, proving once again that his acting abilities range from large biceps all the way to ripped abs. An actual cardboard cutout would have been equally as watchable. Marky is however perfect for the role - this soulless attempt to cash in is emblematic of his own acting capability, which is comparable to a mannequin filled with botox.\nThis garbage has no redeeming features, from appalling dialogue, stock characters and writing that was presumably done by the chimps themselves.\nThe producers probably thought putting Marky beside less evolved simians could possibly place his performance in a favorable light.

Like the original he is chased by the apes and rounded up with a group of primitive humans.  We see Burton's vision of Ape Planet, and the  film makers decided to go with make up and prosthetics instead of CGI, it was a good call as the CGI would not have been up to par in 2001, the new Planet of the Apes showed it was possible to make great CGI apes, but that is now, and this was then.  This film again suffers from a watered down and confusing social and philosophical commentary, the caste system is gone, gone is the conflict of race, nuclear war and religion.  Instead there are call backs to some of the other Ape films, with humans as pets etc.  The humans however primitive do not act that way so again there is some confusion, and the twist at the end is funnier than it is original, the movie lends itself to some silliness that has a B movie quality to it, so it is watchable, but is very much more inferior product.",

This looks like a film that should've been made in the 80's, thanks to its terrible acting and cheesy ending, as well as the horrible jokes that are meant to deliver but fail to send. The action is dull and boring, colorless and uninventive. It's nothing that hasn't been seen before, and Burton has proven on numerous occasions that he can do far better. A bunch of monkeys jumping around like frogs and hitting each other isn't appealing anymore, and while it may have worked three decades ago, it certainly doesn't now.

This Planet of the Apes reboot brings little to nothing new to the series with a brutally dull outcome.\n\nLook, it's easier said than done.  Remakes and reboots have a lot of pressure and usually wind up being a waste of time.  But there was serious potential here.  With Tim Burton coming off a few solid films with Johnny Depp and box office success with Batman, you'd think he would have a grapple on what to do with the Apes franchise.  Sadly, it was the exact opposite.\n\nThe original 1968 classic was thought provoking and lead to a couple really well done sequels, but Burton's take is disappointingly more creepy and awkward than it is cerebral.  I'm sorry, but I just don't care for seeing Mark Wahlberg have a strange romantic relationship with a female ape.  Or, rather, an equally dull relationship with a human, played by Estella Warren.  No chemistry between the two, whatsoever.\n\nBut there are a few redeemable qualities surprisingly.  Instead of a massive Statue of Liberty reveal at the end, Burton makes a few middle act changes that actually benefit the story in the long run.  Having the very cause of the apes taking over earth being due to Wahlberg's mistake was interesting, but I'm just not sure it was earned.  Something else that wasn't earned is the entire third act.  Talk about an atrocious piece of mess, the third act tries to propose so many ideas and take twists and turns that it just all feels tiresome.  Unfortunately, by the time the big battle comes around, you just don't care.\n\nIt's easy to look at a film in hindsight and say it shouldn't have been made, but seriously, this Apes entry should not have been made.  It wasn't yet the time where visual effects offered up the opportunity to do great motion capture or picture perfect-looking Apes (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 2014) and using old make-up was the wrong choice.  It's nice for the 60's but using it in 2001 is a completely different entity.  But the main problem is that the characters and story are second to an attempt to build out impressive set pieces.  Tim Roth's one-note villain and the film's choice for romances make for one brutal viewing.\n\n+Some interesting subtle changes\n\n-Lack of reinvention\n\n-Awkward romances\n\n-No reason for 2001 to be the time for a remake\n\n4.6/10",

The make-up effects and the ape movements are outstanding and the whole look of the film is great. I like the way they have combined the ape species instead of compartmentalizing them. Oh but there is so much wrong with it. The story seems to be more like the book in the sense of the planet, but this script is dire and the plot so see-through. The acting isn't terrible though. The cast are doing what they can with a dire script. What brings this tumbling down is the ending. Just awful.

Also, the villain acts and looks obvious from the first second you see it, lacks the build-up that charmed the film series, Not-Zira and all females look unrealistic in comparison to their male and female 60's and 70's counterparts, forced romances, stupid villains, stereotypes like the dumb teen and those that shouldn't have existed by then like black guy 60's attitude in white's point of view, modernizing the apes too much and out of place, ripping the kiss and other elements from the 1968 original, sci-fi elements that do not belong to the franchise, and on top of all, a horrible ending that is only less worse than the second film. Still with so many cons, there were a few pros, the make-up (for the male apes) is outstanding, the music by the great Danny Elfman is powerful, and the action sequences are the least bad of the franchise (because the series doesn't belong to the action genre). But overall, this film is the second worst of the franchise, just behind Beneath.",

        {
            "content": "I went into Planet of the Apes with my standards set pretty low because as I learned from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Dark Shadows, Tim Burton is no mastermind of remakes and is better at sticking to his own original material. And since the film he's remaking is famous for having one of the most surprising plot twists in cinema history, the surprise isn't there anymore and the plot is obviously predictable, and for a man not skilled at making remakes to handle a story that's been told so that it seems fresh is a case of the blind leading the audience through what has been seen once and doesn't need to be seen again.\n\nAnd his faults as a director, the man who was supposed to bring this film to life make themselves apparent very soon. \nFor one thing in terms of poor storytelling, I don't think the first thing that Astronauts would do upon finding a deadly electromagnetic storm is to send an inexperienced monkey into it followed by an astronaut in to find the monkey. There's a certain sense of logic in storytelling which Tim Burton naturally fails to pick up on.\nNext, Tim Burton's poor direction makes Planet of the Apes into a Science fiction comedy B-movie with its apes being largely used to comedic extents in human situations, but it's not funny and not beneficial to the science fiction theme which renders it a double failure. Not to mention that combined with a crappy script which can't go 20 minutes without butchering the classic line \"Take your stinkin' paws off me you damned dirty ape!\" by paraphrasing it in a manner that can be deemed insulting to the original film. But even worse the crappy script repeatedly hits viewers over the head with its message about how Planet of the Apes is an allegory for slavery of black people, because it makes humans not just the pets of apes, but the chefs and maids too. Not to mention the fact that humans can all talk in this one which removes the concepts of human beings being animal slaves to apes and replaces them with being general slaves. This isn't convincing, because they're a bunch of f*cking monkeys! If you can't figure that put, Tim Burton, then what had this all been for?\nAnd lastly, the actual 2 seconds the film spends reminding us that this is supposedly set on another planet from Leo Davidson's perspective is a prime example of the half-baked writing that went into Planet of the Apes. If I was half baked I'd probably enjoy it more, but I believe in saying no to drugs as well as saying no when Tim Burton wants to remake a film. This should be a good enough reason why.\nAnd the cast emit a mixed response.\nMark Wahlberg uses a routine charm as a means of giving decent line delivery, but his physicality makes it look like he's taking too long to figure everything out, and for a supposedly intelligent astronaut he looks like he's on some mix of marijuana and cocaine which can't decide on making him to calm to worry or too stressed to act. He isn't presented with any sort of character at all, so he just does a routine Mark Wahlberg job. If not for the terrible direction, it would be a routine success. Alas, Tim Burton tries hard to make sure this is not the case.\nHelena Bonham Carter proves to be of no benefit to the cast in Planet of the Apes, because her single tone of human voice, her humane physicality  and unconvincing costume make her seem like she's just an attempt to make a female look like I without remembering that this is a film about Apes which she seems to have forgotten too. Planet of the Apes is one of her much lesser efforts as an actress.\nEstella Warren's only real benefit to Planet of the Apes is to make a presence similar to Raquel Welch's in One Million Years B.C. where she had few lines and the focus was on her visual appeal. This is the same case for Estella Warren who has few lines and is only really there to give the pre-pubescent male viewers a boner. She may have done a better job if she had more lines, but hen again based on her monotonous stare in Planet of the Apes and poor performance in the sports film Driven which was released the same year I wouldn't be surprised if this was a false assumption. She succeeds at looking good though.\n\nOn a more positive note for the cast, Although Paul Giamatti is unfortunately stuck in the part of playing a comedic orangutan, which isn't benefitting to the film, luckily, Paul Giamatti's skilled physicality make him a convincing ape and his line delivery is pretty good.\nMichael Clarke Duncan is a great ape in Planet of the Apes because his intimidating physical structure and iconic voice make him reminiscent of the ape played by John Huston in Battle for the Planet of the Apes, which was the high point of the film. Michael Clarke Duncan is a good casting choice and does a good job, making himself seem like a real badass villain.\nKris Kristofferson is a genial presence in Planet of the Apes because his classic heroic western persona and facial hair cause the filmmakers to decide to model him after Tarzan. This is cool, because it's Kris Kristofferson and it's just cool to see him active on screen again.\nTim Roth did a decent job too, capturing a sense of sadism and insanity.\nPlanet of the Apes features great visual effects which capture the true science fiction essence of the story, and the film editing and cinematography help combine to make sure that Planet of the Apes is some kind of technical achievement. Much of the time these technicals make Planet of the Apes reminiscent of 1960's science fiction adventure films but with upgraded visuals, and so there is some satisfying nostalgia involved in Planet of the Apes. The musical score is also good because although not that iconic, it's intense and atmospheric which makes it effective.\n\nBut despite some decent cast members and technical elements, Tim Burton's direction ultimately brings Planet of the Apes down, making it start up on an unsatisfying note and end on an even more unsatisfying one.",

Burton focuses way too much time on the apes and not enough working up interesting scenes for the humans.  Either way, both species suffer with having to say bad lines and fall into flat stereotypes.  At least the actors can't be blames for that.  The insanity and preposterousness continues to escalate to the final act until reaching the twist ending.

            "content": "This new Planet of the Apes is one of those lazy remakes: it does everything it wants in a very rushed and simple way, and it does nothing that the 1968 original did right. I do wonder how Tim Burton could make such a mess out of the Planet of the Apes. I guess we can blame some of the writers, as two of them worked on another big lazy and rushed movie: Superman IV. But still, how come Burton thinks a script like this one could be the best for a remake of a classic? This is a big misfire, a letdown and a self-indulgent movie that cares little about its uneven tone and structure.\r\n\r\nWe have a great cast here, but surprise, there's Tim Burton and her Helena Bonham Carter, but not Johnny Depp. Instead we have Mark Wahlberg, who does a decent job, but his character barely has any emotional resonance, ultimately nothing compared to Taylor, played by Charlton Heston in the 1968 original. The rest of the cast is top-notch, but their characters have little to workout. It doesn't help that every single character uses pure exposition to tell their stories: they tell what happened, instead of why it happened. And the movie sadly has exposition as the mechanism to tell the whole movie. The story itself is nothing special, it's very simple and the twists at the end are weak and self-explanatory, but cryptic. It's like the movie is always trying to end as quickly as possible, but the thing that made the first movie so great is the build-up of every single part of the story, until we finally see the truth at the very end: all build up lead to that. Here, it's only to make the story end, no build-up, no intensions of leaving a lasting impression, no intensions of care the bit less about the original. It deftly destroys the legacy of the Apes. In the original, it made sense that the humans were slaves, they were dumb, and they couldn't even speak or think. Here, it doesn't make sense, as the humans can talk, can think, THEY EVEN CAN FIGHT AGAINST THESE APES! Seriously, how did the Apes conquer earth when the humans had all the weapons at their hands? That is dumb, insulting to our intelligence and an insult to the original. Plus, the Apes are also dumb too. Auch, that hurts. There's one scene, when the humans are escaping, we see a bunch of apes doing the stupidest things: about to have sex, one of them is using a wig, another one is putting flowers around him...man, it ridiculous and shameful, that IS a big insult for the original Planet of the Apes. Plus, the ending is very...mixed. So much going on and so little explained...many declares this ending as one of the most horrible, but i didn't find it that bad. Surely a sequel was planned at the time, and plus, after almost two hours of shitty things, what other kind of ending could you expect?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I found this movie admirable. It does have some B-movie elements and nice visuals. I like B-movie elements and visuals. It's the same case with the Clash of the Titans remake: I like it because it does everything wrong, but in a semi-epic way. I liked that they make the Apes characters still the most interesting in the movie, I liked the fight at the end, I liked the tone they gave to this movie, I liked the sets, I liked the short and fast-paced story-telling, I liked those make-up techniques, even if the female apes look very unconvincing, I liked the score by Danny Elfman, I liked the environment of this movie, I liked how they wanted this to be an action packed movie, damn this movie is full of my most basic movie instincts. I recognize why the hate, I sort of do too, but I also love it because of that, it's a guilty pleasure to say the least.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes with the other Planet of the Apes movies, this one is the second worst; the first is Beneath the Planet of the Apes, which is a bigger misfire. I'm sure I will return to watch this crap over and over. Curse my likes for B-movie charms.\r\n\r\nOh, Tim Burton...man, you made Batman! What the hell happened?!\r\n\r\nHAPPY HOLDIAYS REVIEWS PART 20 (FINAL): Planet of the Apes (2001)",

The ape make-up has definitely advanced, as have the special effects, but it's just lost all the heart and soul that the original had, to the point that not even the action scenes could save it.

This special effects spectacle looks great on screen, but lacks the character and intelligence of the original. As a result, APES was a commercial success, but a critical failure. Astronaut Leo Davidson is thrust through time to find himself trapped on a world ruled by apes. After a planned escape, Davidson becomes the unexpected hero in a human revolt against the apes! The only real hero in PLANET OF THE APES is seven-time Oscar winner Rick Baker for his phenomenal make-up designs, which bring the apes to life in a wide array of different shapes and sizes. The apes simply look incredible, but unfortunately, the appliances hinder the performances of the actors, and often cause them to stumble through their lines. This is not the case for Helena Bonham Carter, who prefers to whisper incoherently, or Tim Roth, who just spits his vile contempt for humanity like venom. Where screenwriter William Broyles Jr. makes his biggest mistake is in allowing all humans to have the capacity of speech, which completely destroys the impact of Davidson's arrival on the planet. There can be no questioning of ape ethics or breakdown in ape philosophy if the lead character is no different than the humans that already exist on the planet. Coupled with Mark Wahlberg's stagnant performance, PLANET OF THE APES misses the point entirely. What is left is an entertaining but empty space epic that will be long forgotten in the years to come. \n\n-Carl Manes\nI Like Horror Movies",

This was the first Planet of apes film that I have seen.\n\nNone really understood the climax- a lot of my friends complained that the film's climax was too sense less. They mostly did not like the idea of apes behaving as modern day humans. It means that Wahlberg traveled through dimensions in the space ship and  reached the future of the planet of apes where the apes developed that much intelligence that they live almost like our modern day man. The critics always have a habit of criticizing anything they didn't fully understand, that is what happened with Cloud Atlas. Blade Runner was a film made by Ridley Scott. Upon release the film received lots of flak from critics because they couldn't understand it. Now Blade Runner is one of the most cult followed and critically acclaimed classics. I do not expect this Planet of apes version to have such a grand fan base in the future, but people may understand that it is not entirely stupid.\n\nThe only problem that i felt here was that the film has some idiotic humour sense as in the case with the most senseless Burton made 'Mars Attacks' (1998). You could actually experience the helplessness of Mark Wahlberg's character. The special effects are good too.",

If his goal was to piss people off...it worked. But I must commend Burton for including an ending such as the one in his vision of Planet of the Apes. Whether people liked the ending or not, it was memorable and it left an impression. Also, it was well within Burton's character to have an ending like that....very Burtonesque.

            "content": "My original review did not due justice to my dislike for this remake of the 1968 classic, especially after seeing every film in the franchise. This film deserves a fierce critical bitch-slapping, and I intend to give it one. I have no problem with remakes, and I have enjoyed several notorious remakes...but not this one. I could not find it in my very forgiving nature to give this giant middle finger/piss stain of the franchise a pass. The film was pretty doomed from the start since not only does Tim Burton seem out of his element directing a film like this, but the studio had the audacity to hire complete hacks for writers to pen the script - two of whom were the same two people who penned the script for the infamous Superman IV: The Quest For Peace, I shit you not. The biggest problem of the film, is the storyline, which is a major problem since storytelling has been a very pivotal aspect of the series, even during some of the wackier entries like Battle For The Planet Of The Apes (Which I enjoy as a guilty pleasure, but it views like a high-class art house flick in comparison to this piece of crap). The storytelling in this film is an absolutely horrible disaster with no focus, virtually no character development, ham-fisted messages about the evils of war and racism, and conflicts that feel forced and pointless. I didn't give a shit about any of the characters and I didn't even know the names of most of them by the time the film was over. I also didn't enjoy whatsoever how the film completely butchered classic lines from the original film. When I heard these new lines, they sounded like a cross between nails on a chalkboard and Justin Bieber music simultaneously occurring.  The film also fails miserably to be salvaged as a trashy action flick in the tradition of Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes and Battle For The Planet Of The Apes, but even both those films were far more intelligent in terms of plot. Compounding the horrible storyline and horrifically dull action scenes is the horrible acting, which is surprising considering the talented cast that was assembled, which includes a brief cameo from Charlton Heston (Who only stops by to piss all over his legacy and then die unceremoniously. What a great use of a cameo!). Despite three horrible areas of the film, I must compliment a few things. First, the special effects (Both makeup and CGI) were absolutely spectacular and stunning to look at. I also must compliment the people who built the set pieces because those also look fantastic and should have been used for a much better film. And, finally, Danny Elfman manages to put together a decent score (It's certainly not his best work, but it's good), which feels suitably epic (Too bad it was wasted on such a turd for a film). However, those are the only things I will praise about the film, because the rest of it is an atrocious mess that insults the franchise and can't even be salvaged as a standalone film. This is one of the worst sci-fi/fantasy films and one of the worst remakes I've ever seen. No wonder it killed the franchise for another ten years! Thankfully, the franchise seems to be back on track and hopefully we will never see another film like this to curse the franchise.",

For instance, the humans are not brain dead and can actually talk!  The film's strengths are in its action scenes as well as its ability to represent intelligent apes with little reliance on CGI.  Mark Wahlberg is in the early stages of becoming an action star, and Tim Roth plays a very convincing evil ape.  I actually prefer the ending of this one over the original.

Planet of the Apes is a decent movie taken at face value, perhaps best watched when the memories of the original, and superior, Charlton Heston version have become but a blur to the imagination after an extended period of time in between viewings.",

Comparing the Mark Wahlberg's character to Charlton Heston's, we see straight away what Tim Burton's remake lacks, the depth, the intrigue and the emotion. Many have said the film has a B-Movie feel and I agree with that 100%, however, the film deserves some recognition for the fantastic work done in the make up department for the Apes and Tim Roth was one of the actors in the film that stood out as being decent. Some changes in the plot were unnecessary and drew away from what made the original special and the great reveal and plot twist at the end was somewhat lackluster and failed to raise any hairs on the back of my neck or create any interest. Compared to the original, which it always is, Tim Burton's remake is abysmal and never quite reaches the standard of an alright movie.",

The sets, costumes, and make-up are all remarkably good and help to enhance the film.  However, the film concludes with one of the most ridiculous, nonsensical \"twist\" endings in history.

From there, he tries to organize a resistance and create conditions to return to his ship and travel back to Earth. That is, Burton didn't know how to use his famous creativity to show us something new. This story is almost entirely something we have already seen and read (if we consider the origin of everything, Pierre Boulle's book), dressed in new clothes, more modern or different. The work of the actors is generally acceptable, with Marc Wahlberg standing out with the main role, followed by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth. The human characters are downright poor and main character's love interest attempts always seem out of context. Overall, it's a movie good enough to be seen but not enough to be remembered.",

I liked the start...However, as soon as we got to know the nature of the apes, I started to really despise this movie. I thought it was pathetic, gay and boring. Personally, I found it hard to take the ?ape city? thing seriously. That lasted for about 25 minutes or so and then BAM! the action hit me like a bomb and I loved it. That lasted for pretty much the rest of the movie. All of it was a blast after the crappy parts in the ape city and I was really entertained watching the adventure and escapist story. The apes themselves can be sort of unintentionally funny at times, but the make-up for them was amazing! Wow, I just gave up trying to guess who the actors where after a while because the ape make-up was so astounding and convincing, you couldn?t even tell who?s eyes were under that hunk of hair! The actors do well, Mark Wahlberg fits the leading role well and gives it his all. I don?t think his character was very considerate and I think he tried to be a little too much like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic, but apart from that, he?s done well. Helena Bonham Carter was really fantastic and has the pleasure of playing the most developed character in Planet of the Apes, giving her character and performance depth, more-so than Wahlberg?s sometimes selfish hero. Tim Roth was evil and believable and the most ape-like actor in the film. Tim Burton?s direction shines through the movie, especially the final reel. He puts focus to his camera-work and knows he?s up to the job. Some of the characters are annoying at times but you all care about what happens to them.",

However, the film loses speed near the middle and ends up turning into a pretty uninvolving road movie with many boring and useless characters, particularly the human love interest, played by Estella Warren, who has like four lines of dialogue. However, Burton deserves credit for not making a direct remake of the 1968 original, instead creating his own vision. I did like the slow revelation to what the planet of the apes is (not exactly what you'd expect, those who have seen the original), and the unexplained but fabulous twist ending.",

This special effects spectacle looks great on screen, but lacks the character and intelligence of the original. As a result, APES was a commercial success, but a critical failure. Astronaut Leo Davidson is thrust through time to find himself trapped on a world ruled by apes. After a planned escape, Davidson becomes the unexpected hero in a human revolt against the apes! The only real hero in PLANET OF THE APES is seven-time Oscar winner Rick Baker for his phenomenal make-up designs, which bring the apes to life in a wide array of different shapes and sizes. The apes simply look incredible, but unfortunately, the appliances hinder the performances of the actors, and often cause them to stumble through their lines. This is not the case for Helena Bonham Carter, who prefers to whisper incoherently, or Tim Roth, who just spits his vile contempt for humanity like venom. Where screenwriter William Broyles Jr. makes his biggest mistake is in allowing all humans to have the capacity of speech, which completely destroys the impact of Davidson's arrival on the planet. There can be no questioning of ape ethics or breakdown in ape philosophy if the lead character is no different than the humans that already exist on the planet. Coupled with Mark Wahlberg's stagnant performance, PLANET OF THE APES misses the point entirely. What is left is an entertaining but empty space epic that will be long forgotten in the years to come. -Carl Manes\rI Like Horror Movies",

First of all this is a remake of one of my favorite movies of all time, so that's a check for me. It is made by Tim Burton so there was some hope for pleasing visuals and interesting dark storytelling. I got one of those aspects, this movie is great to look at; much like how the Bayformers are great to look at, but is yet lacking in any depth. there's also a big name star; I think, in the leading role, who I can say safely I don't care about. Okay so I don't like the main character, this isn't going so well. I can say at least that the costuming in this film is very good, I might consider it better than the original, but that alone doesn't make up for this film has done. First of all, why do the apes jump so damn high? I never knew apes as such aerodynamic creatures, whenever I see the bad guy; I don't care who his real name is, jump around like the Cocoa puffs bird, it makes the realistic makeup loose all of its effect. The climax is so clich\u00e9, of course it is fun to watch like I say repeatedly, and i feel like the end to that climax is really unsatisfying. The ending is by far one of the most stupidest of all time, it's no where near as clever and dark as the original. That about wraps it, and all there is to this flick is some good visuals and jumping apes.",
