            "content": "When my nephew picked this out from the video store, I sighed but felt carefully optimistic. After we sat through an hour and a half of this unrelenting hell, I told him to leave and never return. Let me give you an idea of just how bad this movie is. The end credits are literally the best part of the film. There are enough joke names and bits strewn about to make you crack a smile. The only problem is that to get there you have to slog through ninety minutes of the most unfunny slapstick I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing.  I'm serious: my thirteen-year-old nephew thought this movie was stupid. And it's rated R. What exactly is going on here? There's a zero gravity scene that's so painfully ridiculous that it sucked the humor not just from our living room, but adjoining apartments as well. Believe me when I say I have done humanity a favor by viewing this film and warning the public to stay away. As bad as Rollerball is reputed to be, it can't be worse than this. All John McTiernan has to say is, \"At least I didn't make 2001: A Space Travesty\" and people will have to admit that he has a point. Had Albert Pyun directed this, people would have expected an apology. Once more: I cannot stress how horrendous this movie is. Quit wasting time reading about this and go do something worthwhile, like churning butter or feeding the homeless. I consider this film one of the worst moments of my life thus far.",

After the success of the \"Naked Gun\" series, he has been restricted to a career of playing the same character over...and over...and over....This time, he is US Marshall \"Dick\" Dix (the first of many human anatomy puns/so-called \"jokes\"). I wonder how long it took them to come up with that one in the writing room.\"How about Agent Butt K. Isser?\" \"How about Agent T. Itz?\" \"No, wait guys! I've got it! Dick Dix! Haha we're comedic geniuses!\" The budget is very obviously on the low end. Special effects are terrible. The film tries to lampoon the space travel segments of Kubrick's \"2001\" and fails miserably. Nielsen sucks food through a straw and can't manage to get it up the straw the whole way. Hahaha I chuckled all night thinking of that one! Or how about the woman in the back of the space shuttle who has huge breasts and manages to accidentally shed out of her clothes, which float around and slap Nielsen in the face? No, it couldn't have been the ugly fat woman whose clothes magically disappear...it's the busty blonde...I love Hollywood.",

To the days when you and that Priscilla whatever-her-last-name-is were laughing while walking out of a movie theater playing, \"Platoon\"? To the days when--I guess you get the idea. It's not that Leslie Nielson doesn't have the acting ability; it's that the movie is probably the stupidest and worst comedy to come along in my lifetime. It broke dead even with Mystic River in the laughs department: none (unless you count after the movie, in which case Mystic River is way ahead. Academy Awards, ha!). I kept waiting for something funny to happen and the movie to suddenly go good, for everyone to pop out and go, \"Hey! It was all just a joke! We only wanted you to think that the movie sucked because then the rest of the movie is great!\"Didn't happen. Avoid at all costs. I mean, I LOVE Leslie Nielson and it still sucked.

            "content": "Now I do like spoof movies, when they are funny and done right. There are some funny spoofs around, Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety and Loaded Weapon 1 for example, but the spoof genre has also had some excrement such as Disaster Movie and Epic Movie. 2001: A Space Travesty is not as bad as any of the worst of Friedberg and Seltzer. However, that is not saying much, 2001:A Space Travesty is still a terrible movie, being contrived, embarrassing and unfunny and it makes you think what possessed Leslie Nielson to take on this project.As I said in the review title, the irony in the word \"travesty\" is correct. To be honest, while hardly clever or original the title is the best asset of this movie, as well as the end credits which was the only time in the entire movie when I cracked a smile, you know immediately there is something wrong when that is the case. The production values are cheap, with the costumes more reminiscent of fancy dress, shoddy camera work, dismal special effects and wobbly sets. The soundtrack is poorly thought out, In the Navy by The Three Tenors especially felt as though it was shoe horned in.The story is predictable and almost a non-event, the pace didn't draw me in in any way and the direction was decidedly patchy. Also the characters are little more than stereotypes and caricatures and really bad ones at that with names that felt like poor Carry On lampoons. The acting is terrible, yes including from the talented Leslie Nielson. Nielson shows he can be funny as with Naked Gun and Airplane, which are comedy classics in my opinion, but he overacts and mugs shamelessly here which saddened me hugely. Everyone else either overplay, are bland or seem to be playing themselves. Worse is the humour, the film just isn't funny and is filled with the crude and vulgar kind of humour that doesn't come close to the inspired zaniness of the best of the spoof genre. The homages and references to sci-fis such as 2001:A Space Odyssey(one of my favourite films) are obvious and poorly thought out and the script is abysmal and didn't make me laugh one time.In conclusion, not the worst of the genre but a mess all the same. 2/10 Bethany Cox",

Leslie Nielsen plays a guy called Dick Dix in this movie, and guess what, that's one of the better jokes. It's absolutely painful to see Leslie Nielsen in this movie, desperately looking for one bit of material that he could make work. The script centers mostly around slapstick that doesn't go over at all, but sometimes it takes a break from that and goes for some terrible political satire. This is a movie that gets a Clinton impersonator, and focuses on how he plays the saxophone. That's hard-hitting satire right there. Remember how Clinton always played the saxophone? I do, kinda. Later Nielsen narrates about a woman's finesse while she's beating everyone up. Comedy. Pavarotti also threatens to castrate a guy, the pope swears, the three tenors sing \"In The Navy\", did Germans write this or something? The type of comedy isn't even consistent, one time it's the aforementioned slapstick, then it's \"satire\", then suddenly the writers remembered they didn't have any in-jokes yet. So they put in like ten in a row. This thing sucks like you wouldn't believe.",

It seems that nowadays all the writers or director of a movie need to do is tell Nielsen: Hey we're gonna make fun of some other movies, interested? And Nielsen would just sit there like, 'yeah'!Instead of what the title would assume, 2001's main victim isn't A Space Odyssey but the more recent Men In Black. But, having said that, I cannot think of one decent joke relating to that movie. Nor can I tell here what the story is all about... it's got something to do with the president being swapped with a clone, or not, or whatever.By lack of anything good to offer director Goldstein just throws some lusty women into it, but perhaps it says all that no well-known woman apparently would like to take up the job, so we have to do with an unknown French woman and an unknown German one...In fact, I don't know of any reason why I should recommend this movie. Some lame jokes are just about OK, but nothing more than a 2/10 if you'd ask me.",

Especially parody movies, since I wasn't into 2001: A Space Odessey, I thought that this was a fun looking movie that would make fun of that film. Well, it turned into something pretty bad, I really couldn't find myself laughing at any of the situations, which is sad, because I find the stupidest situations very funny and I am easily amused. But I was curious if maybe it was my bad mood that killed the comedy for me, but I looked on IMDb before watching it again and it's not just me apparently.Well, a some what take off of the Naked Gun series, only in outer space situations, Leslie is now Dick Dix, a clumsy detective that is sent to a planet called Vegan where he learns that President Clinton has been kidnapped and cloned and that the clone is on Earth with bad intentions for the world. Or as it seems, Dick actually plants the clone by accident and well... it just wasn't funny.The jokes tried too hard and the story was just weak, it could have been something special, but unfortunately they took too much advantage of the Naked Gun series, which was pretty sad. I know Leslie can do much better and he has, so I forgive him. For those users who are looking for a recommendation here, I'm not going to give you one because like I said, I thought it was just me that didn't like the film, but I think the rating is enough warning in itself.3/10",

            "content": "When Leslie Nielsen became a hot star overnight after \"The Naked Gun\", he didn't forget his Canadian origins, taking breaks from starring in big budget American movies to star in Canadian projects, this being one of them. But considering how awful those Canadian projects were, he would have been better off forgetting about loyalty to one's country and just choosing the best projects offered regardless of their country of origin. \"2001: A Space Travesty\" is not only his worst Canadian film, it's probably the worst movie in his career. There is not one single joke in the movie that makes you laugh, smile, or even smirk a little. It seems to have been written by people who just saw one \"spoof\" movie in their lives, and not having any sense of what's funny and what's overkill. And it's directed in a manner that has no proper comic timing, and often plays in a confusing manner that takes you several seconds to figure out just what happened on screen. It's no wonder no American distributor picked this up for theatrical release (and why it bombed so badly in its half-hearted Canadian theatrical release.) Only if you are REALLY wanting to see clean-cut Nielsen in an \"R\" rated movie... though I felt that the content of the movie deserved no more than a PG-13 rating.",

All of these had a few things in common...excellent writing as well as the Abrams/Zucker alliance. In other words, Nielsen alone was NOT the reason these projects were so funny. This is sadly apparent in a string of films he made with hack writers/directors...resulting in crap films like \"Repossessed\", \"Scary Movie IV\" and this one, \"2001: A Space Travesty\". Watch it if you'd like....but don't expect it to be funny nor worth your time. And remember...it's not just my opinion...the film is #73 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list!So why didn't I enjoy this film? Well, to put it bluntly, the film was cheap and unfunny. Many of the special effects and costumes were dreadfully bad...especially at the beginning with the \"2001\" intro parody. Additionally, too often the movie went for cheap childish laughs instead of clever ones...relying too often on things such as farts, rip-away dresses and crude character names (such as Dick Dix and Miss Menage). By comparison, Mel Brooks' worst films seem like works of genius by comparison. Overall, a tedious and mostly unfunny film seemingly written by untalented chimps....very untalented ones.",

Even the sight gags--which are the easiest part of comedy to pull off, were lame and uninspired. Leslie Nielsen has really embarrassed himself here. In his successful Zucker Brothers spoofs, he's a master at playing ridiculous scenes completely straight, and thereby making the funny stuff work. Here he acts desperate. He mugs just to inject some life into the dreariness of it all, and, as other reviewers have mentioned, embarrasses himself mightily. If you want to see him in a movie devoid of intentional laughs, check out the original POSEIDON ADVENTURE. At least that flick has some inadvertent giggles.",

            "content": "This is another spoof movie starring Leslie Nielsen, and I first heard of it a while ago, and knew it was obviously a sci-fi spoof. The title is derived from Stanley Kubrick's groundbreaking 1968 film, \"2001: A Space Odyssey\", though this film is certainly not entirely a parody of that one. I've seen that particular Kubrick movie several times, but was not as impressed with it during my last viewing, in January 2008. Still, the title of this 2000 comedy, \"2001: A Space Travesty\", was what brought it to my attention, since I obviously know where this title came from. I could see that this was not one of Nielsen's popular spoofs, but after a while, and only about 24 hours after first watching \"Airplane!\", an earlier parody film with Nielsen (and a MUCH better one) this week, I watched this despised sci-fi comedy. While I didn't find it to be QUITE as bad as many others have (maybe most other people who have seen in at some point in the past decade think it's worse than I do), I still thought it was a lousy attempt at comedy, so I can't defend it.Marshall \"Dick\" Dix is a clumsy detective who is informed that the President of the United States (a nameless character, but obviously based on Bill Clinton) is being held captive on a moon base called Vegan and has been replaced by a clone! The detective is sent out of Earth's atmosphere to this moon base, on a mission to rescue the real president and find out who's responsible for the crime. He is accompanied on this mission by an officer named Cassandra Menage. Together, the two of them make it to Vegan, where they see that there are many beings around, both human and alien. Dix and Menage begin their inspection, which will obviously not be helped by Dix's clumsiness. After defeating the evil Dr. Griffin Pratt and his hoodlums in a fight, thanks largely to Menage's martial arts skills, the two inspectors escape from the moon and take the president with them. Back on Earth, Dix puts who he thinks is the real president back in the White House, but it turns out he has just replaced the real president with the clone! Even though the detective has messed up, it's still up to him to save his home planet, so the mission which started with a trip to the moon now continues on Earth! \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is obviously too slow paced for some viewers, and it did seem too slow to me the last time I watched it, but with only one viewing of \"2001: A Space TRAVESTY\", it seemed to me that it had the opposite problem, it was too fast! The direction seems so rushed and unfocused, and so does Leslie Nielsen's narration. Unfortunately, the problems certainly don't end here. The movie is full of very juvenile and unfunny humour, and since it's a comedy, that's its main problem. This already shows during the opening sequence and is featured in many other scenes, including the penis jokes about the main protagonist's name, Dix trying to use a spaceship toilet on the way to the moon just as the artificial gravity is turned off, a human on the moon coming out of the bathroom covered in alien waste, condoms which are found later in the film, etc. There are so many gags here which obviously took no comedic talent whatsoever to come up with! Not only does the toilet humour fail, so does the slapstick, with such occurrences as Dix accidentally making a huge mess during his inspection on Vegan. The gags generally seem like they were just thrown in with very little or no thought put into them. In addition to that, the film also seemed too noisy to me.Unfortunately, with all this movie's flaws, it's most certainly a misfire. Leslie Nielsen's character here is like Lieutenant Frank Drebin, his character in the \"Naked Gun\" series (they're both clumsy detectives), but if you're a fan of any or all of those movies, that certainly doesn't mean you're guaranteed to like this later spoof. I remember one time when I was in high school, a student was banned from my school bus route after playing with a dildo during the ride home and giving the bus driver attitude when he told him to get off the bus. \"2001: A Space Travesty\" seems like it was written by hyperactive high school students like that guy! I'll admit, I did smile at times while watching this film, but this was VERY rare, and I never actually laughed. Not only did it not make me laugh, I may have had a slight headache while watching it, which the film didn't help. Yes, my rating for this sci-fi spoof is 4/10, which is higher than what seems to be the most popular rating for it, but I still don't like it. I even feel like 4/10 just might be too generous, and know that many people would believe that saying this rating is too generous is an understatement! If you've never watched this unpopular 2000 comedy, I strongly suggest you don't, whether you like Nielsen's comedy roles in general or not.",

Poor old Leslie Neilsen must be the only movie star who feels like the rest of us: every day he has to get up for work and do the same thing over and over and over again...This so-called comedy is in the style of Neilsen's Naked Gun flicks, but the humour on display here is far removed from the inspired zaniness of that series of films. Neilsen's OK - he can do this kind of thing with his eyes shut, I imagine - but everything else about this film is bad. The female lead in this just about passes muster, but she only weighs about two stone, and the bad guy used to be Richard Briers' suave neighbour in Ever Decreasing Circles back in the 80s, so its just about impossible to see him as a real baddie.The film itself doesn't really have much to do with 2001 - in fact it looks more like a take on the Men in Black flicks, although films of every genre are referenced throughout. It does get marginally better in the last 20 minutes when the three tenors give a spirited rendition of Village People's In the Navy, but by then only the strongest-willed of viewers will still be around.Bottom line: Everyone involved in this should hang their heads in shame...",

They must have enough subtlety to deliver each joke, pun, sight gag as a surprise and not as the central point of each shot or scene.\nWhat made earlier NIELSEN spoofs so successful was not its excesses but the way that you didn't know where the next joke was coming from.     One scene in a disco was so badly conceived because it had no direction.  It had so so very many \"jokes\" piled on top of each other, the shock value of each new attempt at comedy was not allowed to breathe.  In two words:  NO TIMING.3-  Too many gimmicky STAR CLONES.

            "content": "Released in 2000, \"2001: A Space Travesty\" spoofs space shows/movies and anything else it feels like making fun of, like politicians and musicians (e.g. \"Bill Clinton\" is one of the characters). Leslie Nielsen stars as a Frank Drebin-like character and the movie shoots for the goofy humor of The Naked Gun trilogy, but fails. With the wealth of material at its disposal, I don't know how this movie could've gone so wrong, but it's rarely funny and often downright bad; and this is coming from someone who enjoys goofy humor a la The Naked Gun. It doesn't help that the 2-3 most prominent women aren't sexy; to me, at least. Worse, the sex-oriented jokes are more gross and vulgar than funny. Thankfully, the third act is better than the first two, but that can't save it.The film is overlong at 99 minutes.GRADE: D+",

            "content": "Despite Leslie Nielsen began as a movie actor in the mid-1950s he didn't become widely recognized until when he did the AIRPLANE and NAKED GUN movies. These movies are true classics of the spoof genre, and mostly because they were cleverly written, well acted and with likeable characters all around. Unfortunately this didn't continued as the years passed because Nielsen ended up appearing in wretched movies badly written/acted/directed like REPOSSESSED, DRACULA DEAD AND LOVING IT and this one. If you watch it do it, but don't expect it to be a masterpiece or a comedy of the level of NAKED GUN. And I am not the only that hated it remember... the movie is currently number #96 on IMDB's everchanging Bottom 100 - the list of the 100 lowest rated major releases of all time.So why the movie is easy to hate? Well, first of all, it's unfunny. Many of the jokes are crude and the costumes' design and the sets are incredibly bad. Plus, for most of its time the movie went for cheap and annoying jokes such as farts, revealing dresses and the dumbest characters' names you can find (such as Richard Dick Dix or Miss Menage). And Ezio Greggio, despite SILENCE OF THE HAMS bombed, didn't learned his lesson of leaving acting to real actors!Overall a dumb and unfunny movie that looks like it was made with a 500$ dollar budget, horrible sets and a director that seemed very clueless.",

You know this movie is awful already before seeing it - and that's because its trailer does not contain a single funny scene. As you probably know, movies of this sort put all their good jokes in their trailers (vide: Mel Brooks's Dracula). The trailer for this one has nothing funny in it, and that is not because the makers kept the good jokes for the movie itself but because they don't even have one funny gag to show - the whole \"film\" consists of some jokes older than the Pacific, plenty of awful \"sex 'n' barf\" kind of \"humor\", and a lot of dreadful, unimaginative, uninspired, boring, inane and inept attempts at a parody (\"SAL! oh, that's Italian, and there's that music from GODFATHER playing, oh how funny!\"). I don't blame Leslie Nielsen for this dreck - the writer and director (or, I should say, the \"writer\" and the \"director\") are to blame for it - but it's sad to think that he hasn't appeared in a movie worth watching since \"The Naked Gun 2 1/2\"...",

            "review_title": "Some slick packaging around an uninspired, embarrassing mess",
            "content": "I found this movie in a bin of bargain-basement, second-hand videos. I seem to have a weakness for \"spoofs.\" I liked the first Naked Gun (even though the cop sidekicks were better cast on TV's Police Squad), and rode out the two disappointing sequels. I tried but never got into the Airplane movies. I stuck with the increasingly thin, sophomoric Austin Powers films. I made it through Loaded Weapon, Scream, three Scary Movies, Not Another Teen Movie, and a series of Leslie Nielsen clunkers so lame that I did not think it could sink any lower - Repossessed; Dracula: Dead and Loving It; Spy Hard; Wrongfully Accused; and Mr. Magoo (by then, all a well-known film critic who had once praised Nielsen's comic talents had to say about him was that he was the \"bozo du jour\"). But Spy Hard is a masterpiece compared to \"Travesty.\"\"Travesty\" has enough budget and production values to not quite give away by its looks alone how bad a film it really is. The name of Nielsen's character -- Dick Dix -- is catchy (certainly better than Spy Hard's weak \"Dick Steele, Agent WD-40\"). Early on, there are a couple of laugh-out-loud moments: Dix being snapped back and forth from front to back of a space shuttle by the suspenders of his pants snagged on a seat, sending him flying head-first into a levitating anvil; and Dix crushed on top of someone and undergoing various contortions during a gravity-defying drop in a high-speed space elevator.But the movie is a thin, slow-paced, forced, brain-dead mess. It does not even get Dix into space until it runs through an infantile \"history of the universe\" sequence (featuring the constellation \"stifficus\" and takeoffs on a \"white dwarf,\" a \"moon,\" and \"aliens\" (shots of Michael Jackson and Dennis Rodman)) and scenes that play like rejects from a bad Naked Gun movie. Dix is a \"Marshal\" with the \"International Security Force\" (whatever that is). His car radio is conveniently tuned to the local police frequency, and he butts in on a hostage situation at a fast-food joint. He goes from there to more unfunny, chaotic scenes at the \"bull pen\" of his D.C.-area headquarters.You expect things to pick up when Dix is sent to a moonbase for humans and aliens to investigate a report that an evil doctor there is cloning and replacing world leaders. But almost immediately, it becomes clear that the film has nothing interesting to do in space. It sags and drags.This is partly because of a cut-rate, no-name supporting cast which has zero rapport with Nielsen. The worst are a laid-back, jive-talking black dude and a hammy, low-rent, Italian-version Inspector Clouseau, neither of whom manage a single funny or even understandable line or action in the entire movie; and two unremarkable novice actresses who go through the motions with little or no apparent acting skill or characters to play (reviews that slobber over them need to get a life -- or take a look at any random actress starring in any major movie).It is also because of crude, childish, labored, unfocused, rip-off gags that smother anything remotely funny. For example, Dix chases around after and makes a disgusting mess of the doctor's toupee; Dix tracks ink all over the white carpet and destroys an office; Dix gets hands and feet stuck on a door bearing a note written in glue; and so on. A disco scene is another loud, chaotic waste of time.The movie even ruins the elevator scene by having Dix and the woman remain entangled long after the doors open, with him standing up and holding her upside down, facing him, so that she has to peer through his legs and he gets a \"fart\" in the face. The movie also sinks to this kind of \"comedy\" in the space shuttle bathroom; in sloppy mispronunciations by a French security guard (\"backstage p*ss\"; \"no one will get p*ssed\"; to musician, \"you can blow your instrument with confidence knowing I will be here holding the f*rt\"); and in the simple-minded gimmick, after the end credits roll, of disembodied sound effects with captions. None of this has anything to do with satire about space movies or anything else. It is cheap, junk \"humor.\"By the time Dix returns to Earth, the film has become unwatchable. What feels like the movie's last half, or more, slogs through desperate, disorganized, clumsy, endlessly drawn-out scenes at a Paris opera house, before a \"world leaders' conference.\" Dix and his cohorts (wearing stupid, unfunny \"disguises\") and the villains take forever to reach and then fight in the control room for the stage, trying to keep their version of the U.S. President in place.Along the way are senseless, tasteless jokes (Pavarotti's condoms?!?); quick cuts to bad impersonations of dignitaries or pop stars in the audience (the Pope is the worst); lame, obvious humor about the Clintons (he acts like a good-ol'-boy boor and she rolls her eyes); and frantic, loud, boring antics backstage and on stage. Cutaways to the increasingly embarrassing supporting cast and material, which by now have the movie in near-total meltdown, ruin an already forced bid for laughs with the \"Three Tenors\" singing \"In the Navy.\" The movie limps to an end with a strained, tacked-on scene at a restaurant where one of the young women, who the movie never bothers to develop as a love interest, dines with Dix, who for no reason makes a mess.Mindless, goofy, silly movies can be fun. But calling something a \"parody,\" \"satire,\" or \"spoof\" hardly makes it an automatic laugh riot. And any feeble effort that comes along is not worth recommending with the lazy, sloppy excuse \"come on, this is supposed to be bad.\" It is no fun to watch a stand-up comedian die on stage, much less to watch it for 100 minutes. This pretty much sums up how it feels to watch \"Travesty.\"",

Leslie Nielsen may not be regarded as a comedic genius by anyone's standards, but he has made some stupid, but enjoyable films in his career.  In contrast, his latest, \"2001: A Space Travesty\", is just stupid, a very poor rehash of Leslie Nielsen's \"Naked Gun\" series and character with dated attempts of humor that just aren't funny.\tLeslie Nielsen is Richard Dick Dix, a total rip-off of his Lt. Frank Drebin, his most well-known role from \"Police Squad!\" and the \"Naked Gun\" series.  As his name and the film's R rating already tell, instead of going for light-hearted stupid slapstick comedy a la most of Nielsen's other films, \"2001: AST\" attempts light-hearted stupid sexual comedy.  This in itself wouldn't be a bad thing if it didn't fail so miserably at it.  There is a ton of crude toilet and sexual humor, and none of it is funny to anyone over the age of 10 (and the majority of it wouldn't be funny to anyone under that age either).  Nielsen's trademark straight delivery of absurd lines and situations is still present, but the material isn't by any means even remotely funny so it doesn't work.\tA good portion of the material is not only unfunny, but dated as well.  A Bill Clinton impersonator playing the President is OK considering production of the film began in 2000 and probably before the new election, but scenes near the end featuring \"celebrities\" include impersonations of the Three Tenors, Madonna, Prince, and Hulk Hogan.  This dated nature can also apply to the jokes; in reality they are no different than those in \"Naked Gun\", except that the last film in that series was made almost ten years ago, and sex-based humor has moved on, which would explain why it's just not funny. Director Allan Goldstein and writer Alan Shearman have no expertise in comedy to notice or help matters much.  Shearman in particular hasn't written a comedy since 1990, which further explains the dated feel of the film.\tPerhaps if this film had been released 10-15 years ago it would be funny. I would still be a child who would appreciate the attempts at toilet humor, and lewd sexual comedy was still on this level.  The dated \"celebrity\" in-jokes may have even made sense.  Even then, however, this film would still be known as the worst \"Naked Gun\" film.  Released today, my ideas of comedy have matured much past this simple childish toilet humor, the dated jokes make no sense, and it's just terrible, by far one of the worst films I have ever seen.",

In this one Leslie Nielson plays a government agent sent to the planet Vegan to rescue the president who's been kidnapped and cloned.  Along the way he encounters aliens that look like Muppets, he always gets the girl, and saves the day!  Leslie Nielson sure has a lot of vigor and charisma for someone his age, especially if he's still doing movies like this.  My favorite scenes were when his friend went into the bathroom and an alien went in with him and came out all slimy!  I also liked the whole scene at the opera and the parodies of the Three Tenors and the Village People, \"In the Navy\". \n  So, if you enjoyed Airplane, The Naked Gun trilogy, and Spy Hard, then check out 2001: A Space Travesty!  But skip, \"Wrongfully Accused\", though. So what if 2001: A Space Travesty got bad reviews, it's still a deliriously funny movie!  I give it 3 stars.",

Not one joke was funny. And I do not mean \"laughing out loud\" funny. Not even \"a chuckle\" funny. If children indulged in that sort of spectacle, maybe one could forgive them. But watching adults, hopefully conscious adults, in this trash defies all explanations. I don't care how much they were paid. Showing the  the world that you can lower your standards to this, just to be paid, is demeaning.

After spending an hour and a half of my life watching it I feel some people have overreacted to it . Okay it's certainly not a comedy masterwork but neither is it the cinematic atrocity some people are claimingCertainly the opening sequence is very tough going , so much so I can't help thinking the people pouring vitriolic hatred on the movie actually gave up on it at this point . To say the film could only get better at this point is to state the obvious but 2001 does indeed improve down to the fact that Leslie Neilson may be playing a character called Richard \" Dick \" Dix but is detective Frank Drebin in everything but name and the introductory sequence where Dick ends a hostage crisis in his own unintentional style is fairly amusing and leaves one hoping for more of the same similar to the style of THE NAKED GUN movies This sums up the problem with 2001 and that is that is it sustain the laughs and is very patchy . There's a long segment set on a moonbase and it really belongs in another film as the audience anticipates the sort of antics we'd expect from Frank Drebin . Instead of the sharp , witty , snappy one liners we more often than not get jokes that are stretched out beyond their natural length , most blatantly the three tenors having a Village People routine which gives the impression the writers aren't trying too hard In summary 2001 A SPACE TRAVESTY isn't a classic Leslie Neilson comedy but contained enough jokes to bring the occasional wry smile to my face . Everyone else on this page seems to hate it but if you genuinely think this is a bad movie starring Neilson I suggest you watch both REPOSSEED and DEAD AND LOVING IT which really were so bad as to be unwatchable",

All the sequences of the Opera de Paris was, in fact, shot in my hometown of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. It was done in the Thompson Theatre, which was, from 1928 to 1979, the cin\u00e9ma Capitol, our own little movie palace. All the original stuff still exists today, as they were in 1928. This is really a beautiful old movie theatre. This film was made in 1999, and we, from Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, had fun watching the extras (all local people) come in of the old store, which was rent as the dressing room. It took one week to shot the scenes, but the crew was there for about 3 weeks, giving job to many people of my town. It's a strange feeling to see the old Capitol theatre in a movie! In 1998, there was another movie shot in the same place, starring Bette Middler. That's why I look at this horrible movie : memories from the summer of 1999 !

I strongly suspect this was an STV (Straight To Video) offering aimed at a specific European audience, and the credits do tend to bear this out - my guess is that most of the other actors are probably well-known outside the States and the UK (I know I've never heard of or seen them before).However, it's not a terrible movie (I've seen very much worse) and if you like the style of acting found in French, German or Italian farces then you'll enjoy this one.",

This movie was at least bearable when they were in space, but the last half, back on Earth, was sheer torture to watch.",

It is, and I can say this without hyperbole, the WORST MOVIE EVER.  Never before have I seen a movie with such a cheap plot and inane characters.  The writing seems to have been done by a group of chimps, as there is nothing funny in the entire movie.  They try, of course, with bathroom humor and stealing visual comedy from the Naked Gun.  But aside from Nielsen, there are no funny characters and the only laughs come from Nielsen's \"Lt. Drebin\"-esque slapstick (and those laughs are few and far between, and only \"chuckles\", at that.)I think the people who made this movie saw they had a giant stinker and tried to \"dress it up\" by hiring Nielsen and putting him on the cover, so when you see it in the video store you will think it's funnier than it is. A Space Travesty indeed.",

            "content": "Leslie Nielsen is not funny.  He was not the reason that Airplane!, Police Squad!, and the Naked Gun movies were funny.  They were funny because of the Zucker brothers.  This is not a cheap shot at Nielsen, who played the parts given to him in those movies perfectly.  But without the writing, he can't do it by himself.  Not one single Leslie Nielsen comedy movie since Naked Gun 33 1/3 has been funny.  Not even with Mel Brooks at the helm.  Yet Hollywood keeps wasting money on such movies.",

            "content": "I personally don't quite understand why this movie is seen as so rotten. Sure, there are downsides to it. It's rather goofy, and a lot of Dix's narrative humor doesn't quite fly. And, most importantly, no I don't think real gorgeous women would find Leslie Nielsen THAT attractive. But let's face it: not all movies should be taken seriously, especially comedies. The pace was quick enough that it kept me watching the whole time, the action was entertaining, the plot was light but still actually made sense, and the lovely ladies featured didn't exactly hurt as well -- the movie is actually better than most I have seen in the attractive woman department. If you like silly slapstick humor, and particularly if you like the Inspector Clouseau Pink Panther movies and Galaxy Quest, I think you should enjoy this one. And if you haven't seen those, it should still be good if you want to watch some lame, non-serious humor to get your mind off all the trouble in the world. I'll give it an 8 out of 10.",

This movie has a comedic style very similar to that of the Naked gun series. if you liked the naked guns, wrongfully accused, or spy hard then you will probably enjoy 2001: A Space Travesty.The fact that the movie takes place on a space station adds the opportunity for many new and interesting jokes that make this movie as funny and original as Neilsons other films. It is truly a shame that such a great movie is relatively unknown. Disregard the rating and see this movie as soon as possible it is one of the best.",

It isn't the best comedy, nor is it the best one with Leslie Nielson in it, but... it is funny, with some good toilet humour, some cheap shots, some downright silly stuff which all adds up with a quite good and funny climax to the movie. Give it a chance, it's worth it! Spoilers!!! the funniest part is with the Bill Clinton doubles at the concert near the end, it's also the silliest, but it's partly what gives the movie it's charm. Actually the movie is well paced also without any boring bits, you certainly won't fall asleep (like with the Hulk) and you won't get a sore behind (like with Fight Club), you will smile, smirk and laugh :)",

Their timing is off and the mystery is not. This animal is not even in the same category as a spoof. If you see the first few minutes you have seen it all.A note on the VHS edition. There are approximately 20 minutes of coming attractions that make you look forward to looking at this film. After five minutes of the film, you will want to watch the coming attractions again instead.",
