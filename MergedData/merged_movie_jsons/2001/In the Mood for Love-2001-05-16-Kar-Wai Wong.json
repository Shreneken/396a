            "content": "An absolute masterpiece. A sumptuous feast for the eyes, and a turbulent, searing voyage for the heart. The premise is interesting, the setting is palpable, the characters are masterfully presented (or not presented as the case may be), the pace is precisely the right speed. The score is excellent and the main original song is catchy and well-matched to the drama, as well as a couple of other songs noticeably matched perfectly to the scene. You will find yourself immediately in the hands of a master, and you'll wonder how all cinema is not like this. Wong Kar-Wai uses a color pallete and close, intimate shots to do much of the work of setting the tone and feel of the film, which is a profound longing amid a kind of despair at being betrayed. \n\n*Spoilers*: In a masterful coda before a final ruminatory scene at Angkor Wat Temple, we see the subsequent visits to the apartment building in Hong Kong years later.  Mrs. Chan is shown \nas a single mother with a son, suggesting at least to this viewer that the love affair and offstage final night spent together between her and Mr. Chow was a sexual encounter that resulted in a pregnancy. Later when Mr. Chow shows up to check on the apartment and discovers that \"a woman\" who he suspects is Mrs. Chan is living alone with their child (we have seen her seeming happier--though still longing--wearing her hair down and wearing a less formal dress than we have seen before in the film), which he never knew existed. He smiles and pauses at her door on the way out as if thinking about knocking, but decides to leave them alone. Their friendship and strange secret--but pure--romance created life. Likewise in the final scenes at the Angkor Wat Temple in Cambodia, we see that Mr. Chow's secrets are being whispered into a gouge of rock and covers it with mud to keep it safe forever, per the old folktale of the region. A few frames later we see that a snarl of grass is growing where he covered his secret with mud, alive against all odds. This is partly a reflection of how a secret, like the secret friendship with Mrs. Chan and their secret rehearsals and conversations, can be healing and life-giving.",

The performances and other technical aspects make it clear that this is a movie film lovers will appreciate, but as far as romance movies go, this one might be very real, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it one of my favorites.

Time that reveals itself repeatedly throughout the film: literally with the continuous insert shots of clocks and cigarettes, abstractly with the weightless slow motions and the evanescent motion blur of Doyle's cinematography.\nChow and Su's tormented mel\u00f2 collapses when they realize what they feel about each other. So, they flee, perhaps because basically it is always the ideal of love that the two protagonists are in love with. The metaphysical vision of love, uncontaminated and intimist, which in the incompleteness of their desires remains forever suspended in time, ethereal and immortal.\n\"In the Mood for Love\" is made up of hesitant glances and suppressed caresses, in a turbid whirl of regret and passion.\nIt is a love story that never blossoms, but basks in its indecision, forced to remain a secret buried for millenniums in the prison of one's heart.\nWithout a doubt, Wong's highest aesthetic and narrative achievement and one of the best films of the 21st century.",

Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) and Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung) have a couple of things in common: they live adjacent to each other in the same apartment (kind of like a rooming house?) building and their spouses are cheating on them with each other. The plot follows Su and Chow as they grow from a platonic friendship \u2014 which feels more out of necessity, to ward off loneliness \u2014 to something more. The surroundings are tight \u2014 cramped hallways, small bedrooms, alleyways filled with customers and workers, it is Hong Kong, after all. Our protags are subdued, polite, and you want them to get nice and good and mad. Other than a couple of moments of unrestricted painful emotion, Su and Chow take their spouses' infidelity on the chin. The timing isn't right for them because it can't be right for them, it wouldn't make as touching a movie. Their style is defined by early 1960s glory. The recurring slow-motion shots \u2014 including the notable \"Corridor Glance\" \u2014 set to \"Yumeji's Theme\" highlight the runtime, which is shot on film and it shows. I'd known about the sentimental final sequence, as it's rightfully lauded, and wasn't disappointed as it appeared before me. Simply, it's gorgeous. Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love is a must-see for cinephiles, and while it may be too slow or not exciting enough for a general audience, I'd recommend anyone give it a try.",

The acting was ok, if a bit stoic like many Asian films. The problem is the dialogue didn't compensate, so it was hard to know wth was going on. Movie moves extremely slow n tedious as well, and I wasn't sure about main themes before looking them up. For instance, where they sleeping together-i guess not. Also, somehow we are supposed to know the women and son next door are the main actress n her son? A movie for the critics-the worst kind.",

In The Mood For Love was ranked, in 1 poll, as the 2nd greatest film of the 21st century, an assessment which, I have to say, I'm dumbfounded by. The film goes for a minimalistic quality, especially in regard to the dialogue. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, in fact it's quiet refreshing. Most of the emotions are conveyed through camerawork and facial expressions, with no need for lengthy explanations. The faces of the unfaithful spouses are never shown, because the film is not about them. The focus is on the bond which develops between their partners, and its resulting consequences. I enjoyed the movie at first, but soon the real lack of any substance starts to wear thin, and before the 3rd act had begun, I'd already mentally checked out. The film has so much dead air, so much wasted time where nothing happens, but feels the need to linger, because that's what audiences want to see apparently. The slow, quiet moments didn't feel like they were there to let emotions register or feelings develop, it felt like the film just didn't have anything interesting to say. It's sensitively acted by it's leads, which is to say they look mildly annoyed and cry occasionally. It starts with promises but falls flat by the last frame. I wouldn't see it again, and unless somebody had absolutely nothing else to do for an hour and a half, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either.",

The main impression I got from this was that Wong heard someone say that it's impossible/very difficult to shoot a movie in a location as cramped as a real-life apartment complex with its narrow hallways and no room for good camera placement and opted to make this movie to show like 35 different ways to do it, shooting from angles like underneath the clothes in a closet or through a peephole or from an open doorway in the hall or from on top of the fridge in the kitchen. I didn't find the story itself particularly believable as it would be nonsensical for either main character to assume they would carry on a years-long close relationship without either catching feelings for the other. The notion that either would have really stayed with their spouses for years during/after their respective affairs, particularly with an obviously superior choice of life partner sitting right next to them didn't seem logical to me whatsoever and I don't think cultural differences fully explain that. The actors were excellent, but the dialogue wasn't creative/interesting enough to make this a superior movie to 2001's Amelie.",

I watch virtually every film that becomes available to me, including mainstream and at the local art house.  When it comes to foreign films and art movies, I wouldn't say they are uniquely my jam, but I don't shy away from them either, and like them at about the same rate that I would like anything that comes out at the mainstream theater.\n\nI certainly recognized the technical virtuosity and artistic sensibilities brought to bear on this film.  It was haunting, and at times in grossing, and I don't think anyone could ever claim that the acting was anything less than excellent.  \n\nThat said, it can be slow, obscure, and abrupt in a variety of ways, and for that reason, it demands a lot of the viewer over the course of its runtime.  I was on board for that journey throughout, but did expect more pay off than ended up being there.  \n\n(vague semi-spoilers follow)\n\nI suppose it is possible that this ended up being revealed in a way that was subtle enough that I missed it, but so far as I can tell, it was not really explained how either of the two marriages involved proceeded from the events of the core of the film. That is to say, the ending was fairly vague, and I'm not afraid to admit that I found the last handful of scenes collectively rather confusing.  not that I don't get the general gist of how the romance at the core of the movie ended up, but I guess I'm not sure in much detail how the lives of those characters proceeded, nor even why they made the decisions they made or how they felt about those decisions- especially Mrs. Chan.  And again, it's possible I just missed it, but I also happen to have absolutely no clue what happened to Mrs. Chow or the Chow marriage.  I was also confused as to what Cambodia in particular had to do with anything or why Chow went there, aside from providing some nice scenery for the closing sequence, and was especially unclear as to why it was so important to the story that the location deserved its own introductory archival footage right at the end of the film.\n\nI just genuinely found the overall effect to be pretty frustrating and a bit confusing, and you'll have to take my word for it that I'm no dunce in film interpretation generally-speaking, even if it turns out that I botched this one.",

The colors and the look of the characters, from hair styles to wardrobe choices, gives a real sense of 60's films. There's even a touch or two of new-wave Euro movies of that era. Great choices were made throughout by Kar-Wai Wong. The subtleties of glances, quiet but telling body language, saying so much in silence, and those tight shots of Su Li-zhen exuding femininity as she walks up those stairs show the signs of a mature director who knows the power of the visual image and how it can say as much as a shot/scene filled with dialogue. \nExcellent work also by leads Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Cheung Man-yuk. \nI think of the scene where Chow and Su are first sitting in his apt./room, with the camera set as if under a table or through a keyhole, with us as voyeurs into their new secret friendship, which hints at being more. And then the crushing reminder of history at the very end, along with a secret whispered into a stone wall that makes up part of the halls of a structure constructed for mankind to ponder the mysteries of life, to help resolve our questions and searching, and to reach the peace of mind, security and happiness with our place in the world that the love of a faithful other can bring us. 3.7 stars",

In just over 90 minutes, it conveys, through a voyeur-like cameras eye and spot-on, often silent, acting from Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, an intensity of locked-up longing that's perhaps never been so captured on screen. The leads' spouses are having an affair, which brings them together unwittingly, though they too live in neighboring apartments. Initially joined by mutual heartbreak, they become joined by shared desire for one another that, in 1960s Hong Kong, is verboten. The leads are never joined through plain expression, but rather in often tense, mannered, scenes where they share a space (e.g., a cab) and communicate through just a glance or movement. And, in these scenes, the camera latches on to their subtle gestures with a yearning of its own that brings slight, soft acting full circle, giving it clear meaning. The leads encounter one another, repeatedly, in somewhat scripted, yet somehow not contrived, terms. An encounter might involve bumping in to a neighbor running a common daily (or nightly) errand. Indeed, an encounter of this sort becomes a centerpiece of the film, and the subject of perhaps the most entrancing visual sequences put to film in recent decades. In the Mood for Love is about quiet but telling action that, when enveloped by the camera, becomes loud. Wongs rich visuals tug the viewer into a muted world wrought with emotion. A feat many directors aspire toward. A feat Wong executes to perfection.",

Their intimate conversation gradually turns to regular dinner meetings where these two modest individuals find a unifying chemistry, and in time a subtle romance comes to life.\r The two leading characters are portrayed as introverted, somewhat static and well educated people with high morals, and brought to life through Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung's low-keyed and emotionally demanding performances. Wong Kar-Wai wants us to emphasize with our hero and heroine even though we are aware of the fact that they are about to commit the same deception as their spouses have done. That one feels emphatic towards Chow and Su is hardy unavoidably considering what they are coming to terms with, but Wong Kar-Wai's real masterpiece is that he has us sitting through most of the film wishing for the main characters to become lovers. The esoteric dialog is convincingly communicated and Shigeru Umebayashi's theme song \"Yumeji's Theme\" is like a hymn to Chow and Su's tranquil and romantic friendship.\r \"In the Mood for Love\" is a film that lives on it's on terms and invites the viewer into a dreamlike, poetic and hypnotically beautiful universe. It's without clich\u00c3\u00a9s, filled with hope and contains lyrical shades that makes the film seem like one great love poem or an exploration of human behavior affected by love.\r This unforgettable slow-moving tale from one of the greatest visual storytellers in modern cinema stands alongside \"The Piano\" (1993) as one of the most profound love stories i've ever seen.",

As a result, director Kar-Wai Wong's moving film touches onA truly melancholy yet poignant experience, In the Mood for Love is a truly devastating look at those on the other side of infidelity. Yet, at the same, purely and subtly romantic. As a result, director Kar-Wai Wong's moving film touches on themes of adultery, marriage, and love, as these two people try to cope with the way in which their lives have been destroyed. Blessed with good cinematography, good acting, and a great score, In the Mood for Love is a wonderful work that really hits home.\r After moving in next door to one another, Mr. Chow (Tony Leung) and Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung) discover that their spouses are having an affair with one another. What plays out is them imaging their spouses' spending time with one another, as well as them imagining confronting their adulterous partners. Unfortunately for them, their spouses heavy travel schedule leaves prevents any of these interactions from actually taking place, thus leaving them in eternal limbo as they await their returns. As expected, the two fall in love and spend more and more time with one another, but repress their emotions to keep up appearances. By the film they are willing to move on their love, time has passed and they simply can no longer because together as life has brought them extenuating circumstances.\r A decidedly melancholy film steeped in themes of respect and loneliness, In the Mood for Love only subtly pays off on its hinting at the main characters' love. Though Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan certainly hit it off and love spending time with another, the film goes out of its way to showcase the two of them maintaining their purity and not becoming their spouses. Instead, they hold themselves back and keep on just being friends. Wong does great at capturing this element as the romantic tension and longing between the two shines through in large part to the camera work and acting.\r In the Mood for Love is incredibly slowly paced, which allows for the full emotional impact of their trauma and regrets to really linger with this audience. Even more, this slow, methodic pacing almost becomes wholly melodic and poetic as Wong weaves his way through this relationship, the crumbling of their marriages, and their later attempts to reconnect but to simply be kept apart. In particular, the discussion of the old method of hiding secrets and then seeing Mr. Chow do exactly as he described while in the ruins of Cambodia is a truly moving and poetic ending to the film. Yet, incredibly subtle and restrained, as is the case with Wong's characters. Plus, this scene does a great job capturing larger topics in the process. it was not just our two protagonists whose lives changed, but also all of Hong Kong. As hinted to at the end, Hong Kong has changed dramatically since they met four years prior to the end of the film. Not only have their former landlady's moved out, but times have changed and people are moving on. The fact that Wong chose to end the film in Cambodian ruins is also attached to this element, considering it is a very visual representation of the way in which time moves on and leaves destruction, ruins, and memories in its wake. The camera work in this final sequence is particularly moving as it moves through these Cambodian ruins as Mr. Chow visits them.\r Ultimately, Kar-Wai Wong's In the Mood for Love is a truly tragic exercise in heartbreak, repression, and loneliness. Though these two may love one another, they simply cannot allow themselves to express this in the conservative Hong Kong. If they did, it would be the end of them socially. Thus, they remain silent. Wong does a tremendous job capturing their chemistry even in silent moments and developing his characters, as well as their relationship. Wholly authentic, In the Mood for Love is a film that may be very slow, but it is a truly melodic and poetic experience.",

Personally, I find it not only incredibly difficult to go through but also is left in awe with the structure of the film. Probably, because there isn't any. Dashing across the film, the script tells a story from a third person's perspective. In a sense that the fable is narrated to him or her, as a memory shared in the form of highlights. Now, this sort of writing has always inspired me. Something that you can see majorly in Pawel Pawlikowski's Cold War. Often, while writing such a material, you are under sheer pressure to not boast off about something inessential to the storyline and also not make the events loud enough to give away the trajectory of these characters.Walking that fine line, comes a nuanced vocab, that the writer and director, Kar-Wai Wong is speaking flamboyantly. Not, for a split second does he give away its essence beforehand. And plus, this format of jumping forward with an uneven pace, helps the maker create a jarring impact on you that is soothing despite of the poignancy that it breathes perpetually, there was always very little window for these characters to peek through and almost impossible to go through.As Evan Puschak observed so smartly in one of his sort-of-reviews, the film is majorly shot with a frame within a frame tone, that helps us dive into the \"observer\" theme instantly. Plus, the enactments of these characters for their supposed situations, is just pure fun where later on, the slow-motion montages nail the final nail in the coffin expressively. It would and should provoke everyone to be In The Mood For Love, since it first and foremost is about the evolution of a friendship; innocent I find this world.",

And In the Mood for Love is definitely this movie. The plot of this movie is more cohesive than of the other Wong Kar-wai films.The rest of his films don't have a conventional plot, but rather disjointed beautiful and hypnotic sequences that allow emotions to flow through them. This is not the case here. In the Mood for Love still doesn't have a linear narrative in the traditional way, I mean it's still a WKW film, but the movie has a more contained narrative to say the least.Unfortunately, the movie didn't hit me emotionally as much as it should. Don't get me wrong, I was moved by the movie even more than every WKW I've watched so far, with the exception of Chungking Express. The issues I had with Days of Being Wild and Fallen Angels are what kept me from being fully emotionally engaged, but as for In the Mood for Love, it's the over-control upon the movie's story that deprived me from being entirely connected emotionally. It may sounds strange, but that's what I felt, and in all probability that's what many people also feel if they have been already familiar with Wong Kar-wai style.I don't want to seem as if I'm just creating problems, or make some flaws up out of no where, but I felt that some emotions and feelings passed quickly without hitting me hard.On the other hand, having control on the narrative aspect of the movie, Wong Kar-wai's poetic visual style became more mature. You can easily identify his trademarks, which the movie is full of them; playing with the time, using elliptical editing, and repeating songs, but they are utilized in a more beneficial and purposeful way, hence more delicate and exquisite way.Even the beauty of the cinematography is different from those of Wong Kar-wai's other works. Here the beauty comes from the sumptuous colour palette more than anything else. In the Mood for Love is unquestionably one of the best movies in cinematic history in terms of using colours. The colours here set the mood, and keep enriching it throughout the film's fleeting runtime.However, the characters of this movie along with the performances are the real pleasure I got from. All the subtlety of the characters are brought out by a magnificent cast. Tony Leung Chiu-Wai is quite possibly one of the most talented actors ever. His performance is simply ingenious. Maggie Cheung is equally terrific, if equally, perhaps marginally inferior in comparison Leung, but it's her character that astonished me. Unlike Days of Being Wild's Su Li-Zhen, this character her is jaw-droppingly multi-layered. And the way the brilliant script delves into her is just mind-blowing. Every time Leung's character, Chow, shares the screen with her unravels a new layer in her character, while showcases the talents of the two lead, especially Leung's unique gift.The masterful combination of the ingenious symbolism of Wong Kar-wai, and the movie's sprawling and elaborate narrative is what makes In the Mood for Love stands out, either from Wong Kar-wai's oeuvre, or from the Romance genre. In the Mood for Love is undoubtedly worthy of being hailed as Wong Kar-wai's masterpiece, but Chungking Express is still my favorite among WKW's cinematic gems.(8.5/10)",
