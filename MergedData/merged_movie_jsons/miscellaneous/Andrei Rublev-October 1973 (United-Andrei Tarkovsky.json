            "content": "Andrei Rublev (alternately transliterated as Andrei Rublyov) is an epic film created by the Soviet-era director, Andrei Tarkovsky. It was financed and created during a brief cultural thaw in East-West relations, marked by the end of Kruschchev's reign. Within reason, the 205 minute director's cut represents exactly what Tarkovsky wanted in the movie. Unfortunately for Tarkovsky and for us, Kruschev was deposed shortly after filming began, and the 205 minute version was not seen until twenty five years after its creation. The Breszhnev-era censors first trimmed 15 minutes from it, then censors and marketers trimmed more. The shortest known version has been truncated to 145 minutes. Even more sadly, Tarkovsky was never again to get approval for the projects he really wanted to film, or an adequate budget to film the ones that did get approved.Fortunately for us, this movie, recently rereleased in a DVD transferred from a pristine 35mm print, may now be viewed intact, and it is one of the great triumphs of mankind's stay on the planet. It is a masterpiece almost without flaw. The beautiful painterly images follow one another in breathtaking succession. At least three of the eight chapters, if taken individually, could stand alone as separate masterpieces.The ostensible subject is the life of Andrei Rublev, a 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia's greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Rublev himself, however, is merely a useful device. Little is known about him, and most of the episodes in the movie come straight from Tarkovsky's imagination of what might have been. Sometimes one must ignore the facts to get to the truth.The movie is not about one talented monk, but about Russia, and Rublev stands in as a useful symbol since he lived in a time when he could personally witness two of the key elements in the development of Russia's unique culture: the growing force of Byzantine Christianity, and the Mongol-Tatar invasions. In addition he was an artist and a thinker, and experienced first-hand the difficulty of following those paths in Russia. Rublev's own inner conflicts allow the filmmaker to illuminate thoughts on the pagan and the sacred, the nature of art, the relationship of the artist to the state, what it means to be Russian, and what it means to be human.It is beautiful, mystical, and profound, but the truly inspiring aesthetics are matched with complete technical wizardry. I simply don't know how some of the shots were created. One I do understand, and stand in awe of, is a continuous single camera shot, just before the church door is breached by Tatar invaders, which involves action in several different locations at multiple elevations as well as the correct timing of hundreds of extras and horses. It makes the first scene of Touch of Evil look like a high school film project.It is a difficult movie to follow. One might liken it to James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake as a work of genius so monumental and complex, and so disdainful of traditional narrative form, that it requires extensive thought and study to understand it. And even after studying it, watching it repeatedly, and reading Tarkovsky's own comments about it, one still finds it opaque in many ways.Tarkovsky was free to create the work of art he wanted, without concern for profit. The original 205 minute cut was also free from outside censorship. He used this freedom to realize his personal artistic vision. There is no other movie like it, and there may never be. Score it 11 out of 10.",

            "content": "He has ruined cinema for me and this is one of the masterpieces that did it. Everytime you see one of his film's you proclaim: \"That's the best picture ever made!\" Which can't be true as that was the last Tarkovsky film you saw. I've seen this one many times at the cinema and is the best three hours of celluloid you're likely to see apart from Solaris, which is Tarkovsky anyway.Tarkovsky wanted to make art that would change people's lives and in this he succeeded. Although his life was troubled and his projects clawed into life randomly from the grip of his film studio bosses, when viewed as a whole they seem to be all part of some great plan that was meant to reach fruition right from the start. He believed that ultimately it is best to do things that deepen one's inner life rather than impoverish it. That may explain why you leave most Hollywood films feeling soiled. There are too many great scenes and moments in this astonishing and monumental work to mention so I won't. Suffice it to say it would have been fascinating to have seen what Tarkovsky would have made had he lived and returned from exile to his homeland. Recent events in Russia and the Balkans make this film even more vital and pertinent today.The trouble is Tarkovsky's films have such extraordinary purity and spiritual depth that no other films seem able to satisfy one in the same way. They seem flat, lifeless and unable to compete. Why watch the let's-pretend-grown ups like Tarantino when you can watch a real grown up? So like I said, Bloody Tarkovsky. He has ruined cinema for me.",

Over seven periods in his life, spanning 1400 to 1424, we see the history of Russia, the power struggles, the role of the church and religion and Rublev's dedication to his calling.A bit difficult to review this movie. It is clearly the work of a master craftsman: the exquisite cinematography, the sheer scale of the subject matter and time period, the themes, the obvious adoration director Andrei Tarkovsky has for his subject. Yet it is often quite a grind to watch: clocks in at well over 3 hours and moves very slowly. Several scenes will go by without development in plot or theme. Furthermore, the separate time periods don't necessarily form a narrative. They often just feel like things happening, with no connection between them.While acknowledging that the film is well made, I fail to see how it is so highly regarded. I did not come away feeling that I had just watched a masterpiece, something incredibly profound or moving.",

            "content": "This film is impossible to understand at once. You need to watch it at least twice to be able to understand something. At first it seems to be an abstract art-house film about a painter in the 15th century, a film which talks about one artist's plight towards his own ideals in difficult times, a philosophical/historical movie. And it may be the part of the great Tarkovsky's intention.Yet as you watch it twice you realize that it is also about religion. And about the ideal of man. The first scene clearly shows how man has always strived to reach towards something higher and how he often failed. This film is also about human nature, as always in Tarkovsky's films. We follow Andrei through his dark and troubled times and adventures and of special importance is the Tatar attack part. Here we see Tarkovsky depict the everlasting hunger for power and the effect it can have on a man. The Russian prince betrays his own country and must stand trial to his own conscience after watching the town of Vladimir get destroyed by the horde of wild Tatars. The scene in the church is also of greater significance, as is the river scene with the pagan festival. They all show the conflict of religions and also moral values.All said, the movie wouldn't be as great without the last part, the one with the boy and the church bell. It illustrates the rebirth of Russia, Christian Russia and the final scene with the hoisting of the bell is one of the best scenes ever in film history. It shows us that faith is a feeble thing;if the bell didn't work, everything would have ended differently. But thanks to a boy's dedication and hard work, the bell tolled and the faith returned to the feeble heads and hearts of people.The miraculous sudden appearance of color in the very end and the wonderful,solemn music really highlight the ultimate message of this film. Which is-art is sacred and immortal and transcends time.At the time of its release, I believe only Tarkovsky himself and perhaps Andrey Kontchalovsky, the co-writer, knew just how great a masterpiece this film really is. It has taken the world some time to discover it, but it was worth it. With perfect acting, specially by Anatoli Solonytsin, perfect music, perfect screenplay and perfect direction, what else can I give it but a perfect 10?",

            "content": "Just as Andrei Rublev faced doubt about whether or not, having sinned, he could continue his celebrated iconography, I likewise find myself in two minds about Andrei Tarkovsky's film. My experience with the director's other work is, as usual, limited, but I still couldn't shake that persistent expectation that I would love 'Andrei Rublev (1969).' There is certainly much to love about it, but my appreciation for the film can best be described as admiration rather than affection, and, though I can speak with only the utmost praise for Tarkovsky's achievement, it doesn't occupy that exclusive space close to my heart. The film is a deeply-personal religious work, an examination of faith and moral values, and so perhaps it's inevitable that the film didn't leave such a deep impression, considering my preference towards atheism; one unfortunately cannot discard all personal convictions for the mere purposes of appreciating a work of art. I do, however, like to think that the majesty of cinema, in most cases, is able to transcend religious boundaries.Andrei Tarkovsky released his first feature-length film, 'Ivan's Childhood,' in 1962. Even prior to its release, the director had already expressed interest in filming the life of great Russian iconographer Andrei Rublev, even though very little is actually known about his life. Working with a screenplay written by himself and Andrei Konchalovsky, Tarkvosky began filming in 1964, and a 205-minute cut was screened for a private audience in Moscow in 1966. The critical response, however, was mixed, and sizeable cuts were made to the film's running time, before a 186-minute version screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 1969. I'm not entirely sure which version I ended up watching; the time counter indicated somewhere around 165 minutes, though my brief research couldn't uncover any major missing sequences. In hindsight, I should probably have held out for longer and acquired the Criterion Collection DVD, which restores the picture to its four-hour glory. In several years' time, when I inevitably decide to revisit Tarkovsky's film, I'll make certain to do just that.'Andrei Rublev' is divided into nine distinct segments, including a colour epilogue displaying Rublev's weathered icons as they exist today. They each explore a facet of the great painter's life, placing particular emphasis on his faith in God and how it relates to his work on frescos and icons. Interestingly, though Rublev (Anatoli Solonitsyn) himself appears in most of the stories, he is often hidden in the background, a passive observer on the behaviour of others, including Kirill (Ivan Lapikov), who is jealous of Rublev's recognition, and young Boriska (Nikolai Burlyayev), who successfully casts a bell using faith rather than knowledge. One consequence of this narrative format is a lack of cohesiveness in Tarkovsky's storytelling. We adequately follow the plot of each segment, but, as the whole, the film doesn't seem to build towards any notable climactic revelation \u0096 the completed film is equal to the sum of its parts, which is still very impressive, but pulls it short of being a masterpiece. Once again, however, I must acknowledge that the 205-minute version may potentially correct this problem.One statement that can not be disputed, however, is that 'Andrei Rublev' really is a beautiful piece of film-making. Vadim Yusov's black-and-white photography captures the exquisite delicateness of nature with almost heartbreaking intricacy; even the raindrops of a midday shower are imbued with the gentle elegance of the Heaven from which they ostensibly fell. Tarkovsky finds simple beauty in the quiver of a tree branch in the breeze, the leisurely flow of a river, herds of livestock fleeing from an aerial balloon. In portraying the complete opposite, the destruction of nature, the director is capable but not quite the master he is otherwise. The raiding of Vladimir by a troop of Tatars was obviously supposed to be the centrepiece of the picture, but Tarkovsky underplays every detail to such an extent that his \"chaos\" ultimately winds down into a staged conflict. Compare this sequence with Sergei Bondarchuk's burning of Moscow in 'War and Peace (1967),' in which one feels as though he has descended into the fires of Hell, and the contrast is telling.",

            "content": "Russia have been responsible for some truly fine films, fantasy, animated or otherwise, but Andrei Rublev is truly something special. If there is a Soviet film more visually stunning, powerful, thought-provoking or emotionally profound than Andrei Rublev I've yet to see it. Sure, it may not appeal to all, there have been complaints about the animal torture/killings, the slow pacing and being perplexed by the symbolism but neither were problems for me(but if they are for anybody else that's understandable).Andrei Rublev looks absolutely stunning for starters, not just of any Soviet film but one of the most beautiful-looking films ever, every angle and frame is perfectly composed and with a hypnotic dream-like quality. The film also contains some of the most jaw-dropping and powerful symbolism of all of film, the casting of the bell was the standout with Rublev's colour montage close behind, but the snow crucifixion, the battle and the balloon flight were also memorable images. Tarkovsky's direction is just impeccable, so much so Andrei Rublev for me has to be one of the best-directed films there is. It's very thoughtfully scripted, the hauntingly exquisite music score is not one to forget, the pacing while deliberately slow beguiles rather than bores or frustrates and the story is powerful, inspirational(in how Rublev struggled to overcome the hardships he faces) and poignant. Not only that, but Russian medieval life has never been captured more authentically on film to the extent that the viewer is drawn right into this world, nothing idealistic or overly stylised here, this is compellingly hard-hitting stuff and not in a sadistic way(to me). Anatoli Solonitsyn commands the screen in the title role with vigour and emotional intensity while Irina Tarkovskaya is like a Russian Giulietta Masina(a regular Federico Fellini leading lady if you're not sure), and that's meant in a good way.Overall, majestic cinema(a phrase I very rarely use) and a film that film buffs must see if they haven't already.

I have endured it but once and will, for the time being, disregard the encouragement to revisit, to find what I've missed, to bridge my appreciation.

            "content": "I follow several threads of fine films. Most of these concern intelligent notions of structure, of architecture. Welles, Greenaway, Eisenstein, Kurosawa. These mend sense and intellect enhancing both.But there is another thread, one that eschews selfaware structure -- where idea is anathema. Nature is celebrated. Rich intuition and meditative spontaneity are sufficiently nutritious in some hands, but these are amazingly few. The so-called 'new wave' tried it, at least initially. Lots of other appearances as well, mostly failures, some lovely. Among the attempts, I know of only two filmmakers who have mastered this tricky approach of avoiding knowledge: Tarkovsky and Malick. Of these, Malick is more abstractly sensual.After all, Tarkovsky must deal with that dark cloth of Russian self-pity, that tradition of grand themes and epic fate, something which does not burden Malick. So the metaphoric content is heavy. That's fine, an acceptable skeleton for a nearly three hour meditation. All is self-referential: a set of images about an imagemaker: the actor's wife played the retarded girl who factors so importantly. During the production he was cheating on her with who was to become his second wife. The girl goes off with a Tartar, leaving Rublev. Many other scenes refer to Rublev's situation, resolved by Tarkovsky's action. For instance, we have a sequence where Rublev hesitates to paint a scene of fateful pain. This is followed by Tarkovsky doing just that. The extension of metaphor among parts of the film (ballooner and bellringer to Rublev's story) extends from the film to the filmmaker and thence from him to us.What I found even more interesting was his confidence in complex compositions and long, long multiperspective tracking shots. Compared to other swoopers, this camera seems curious, impetuous, not at all as if the shots were planned. Hard to believe it is only his second feature. This alone expands one's imagination with only a couple viewings, but combined with the notion of folded metaphor (including visual metaphor) it becomes a truly great and singular work.(Some classical symmetries touch multiple places: a jester within the play; solitude in the context of relationship; creating in the unknown; broken symmetry through one twin killing another. Some new ones: pagan fire and water underlying ritual exuberance, either sex or religious art.)Alas, the DVD has a discouragingly vapid commentary. But then I guess that's the whole point, and with the loss of potatohead Soviets, we need to substitute the next best thing.",

The plot is well-told. There is impressive imagery in this, both in the visuals and in the dialog. The latter holds truth and is well-written. Deep, poetic, haunting. The acting is magnificent. There are universal themes herein. The editing and cinematography are excellent. Neither leave much of anything to be desired. The war-scenes are an achievement... so much chaos on the screen, yet when we're meant to focus on something, we do, and anything that's supposed to be noticed, is. There is violent and/or disturbing, but none that felt gratuitous, material in this. There is some nudity in this, and it is not captured in a way as to conceal it.

            "content": "As someone who has seen this movie roughly five times and regards it as the greatest masterpiece in the history of cinema, I find it difficult to fathom how anyone can think that Andrei Rublev is \"slow\" or \"boring\". It is true that it's slow-paced, and perhaps too demanding in its unconventional structure of narrative, but I would prefer this to anything commercial cinema releases in its quest to appeal to as broad a market a possible. In other words, given the choice between a film that treats its audience with respect and gives you enough credit to assume you are willing to sit through roughly three hours of lengthy dialogue and long takes, not to mention some of the most mesmerisingly beautiful visuals ever seen on screen; and one which treats its audience like a demographic that can be appealed to like consumers, not individuals with their own dreams, fears, hopes and aspirations, I know which type of cinema truly bores me.It is often the case that art serves as a mechanism used to comment on social- or individuals ills; rarely however, if at all, does it reflect on itself and its own function to humanity. This is what makes Andrei Rublev a unique and important film, since it addresses the role of the artist in the world. Any questions regarding historical accuracy (or rather lack thereof) towards Rublev's personal life are slightly pointless, since the character is merely used as a vehicle to drive the thematic elements of the narrative. That's not to say that Rublev here is an empty shell, it's simply that Tarkovsky used him as a means to impose his personal views on the subject. Why create art? Does being an artist mean expressing love for humanity? If so, why should one express love for something which seems to hate itself? These are just a few of the questions which arise from viewing this film (and some of which Rublev seems to ask himself, illustrated by at first a naive belief in the good in all humanity, then disillusion, and eventually a rekindling of faith), but it makes the montage of Rublev's work at the end of the film all the more effective, since it creates an understanding of the pain and anguish that lie behind these images.To regard Andrei Rublev as one movie (assuming that the general definition of a movie is simply a big chunk of storyline) would do some injustice to the brilliantly unorthodox nature of its narrative, in that it's a collection of eight mini-story lines, all of which can be viewed as individual pieces, and three of which could easily pass as masterpieces in their own right. My personal favourite is the third one; Rublev's dialogue with Theophanes The Greek over the self-destructive nature of humanity is, to me at least, one of the most moving moments on film (this is possibly due to Theophanes voicing an opinion I personally arrived at some time before initially watching this film - and one I unfortunately happen to agree with).Like most of Tarkovsky's movies, Andrei Rublev demands repeated viewings so the film can be absorbed and understood in full. But by doing so you'll begin to realise that this is possibly the most rewarding of all cinematic works, and consequently the most wonderful. The best film ever made? I certainly think so.",

I have seen \"Andrei Rublev\" three times (twice on the big screen), at three very different points in my life.  Each viewing, it has spoken eloquently and directly, has immersed and fascinated me.  And has moved me with superlative skill and force. Other great movies have entertained me, inspired me, made me think; only \"Rublev\" has palpably altered my outlook on life.Andrei Rublev was a medieval Russian iconographer; the film chronicles his struggle to maintain faith and artistry in a world of immeasurable cruelty and suffering.  Rather than give us a crackerjack plot line with all the proper scene climaxes & paradigm shifts, director Tarkovsky presents us with a world in which we must immerse ourselves; once we are inside, we are confronted with rigorous pain and profound triumph.  The movie is divided into chapters; the final one, involving an orphaned bell-maker's son, is a stunning film-within-a-film that provides a microcosm of the whole movie. That section, if it stood alone, would be my all-time favourite film.Be warned: \"Andrei Rublev\" is SLOW.  You have to slide into it; it's not a flick which dazzles, it is a world which beguiles, and which demands to be inhabited.  Also, there are EXTREMELY difficult scenes to watch--torture and bloodshed abounds.  Watching the Tartar attack on a Russian town is the most painful  experience I've ever had--not just in a cinema, but in life.For those willing to make the gruelling trek, however, \"Andrei Rublev\" is an inspiring, life-affecting experience.  Created under an oppressive Soviet regime (which banned the film for years, recognizing its symbolic commentary on 20th-century Soviet government), the film shows how life can be valuable and even joyful, no matter how much suffering stands in the way.Especially recommended for Tarkovsky fans, Dostoevsky fans, fans of medieval art, and anyone grappling with questions about suffering and human expression.",

The first part has an adventurer test riding a hot air balloon while a superstitious mob rush to stop him. It's surreal and sets the tone of this movie as an ongoing tragedy. The second part is just as tragic. Andrei and his friends are traveling. They take shelter in a village where they are entertained by a jester. Soldiers arrest him for his dissident material. The third part is where I faded. While the first two parts laid down the tone, it doesn't explain our main characters. By the third part, I lose the thread to these characters. I'm not connecting with them. The movie gets epic in part five. It's definitely big and I think a horse gets killed for real. There are some eye-opening scenes and true devastation.

The church influenced every aspect of people's lives from birth to death and was part of the state. It means religious leaders were as important as rulers.In Russian society men were wearing beards and women covered hairs. Remove a beard from a man or uncover woman's hair and you will humiliate them, they would feel like modern people being undressed in public.Paganism is a form of religion, where people believe in many gods instead of one. The main Russian pagan gods are the goddess of the earth and the god of the sun. Among others - the god of storms and lightning, the mythical young women living in forests and rivers. Despite many centuries of suppression of paganism by authorities some in modern Russia still celebrate the feast of Ivan Kupala (which could be translated as Ivan Gathering) depicted in the movie.Also I have to mention, that Soviet censors told Tarkovski the movie is too cruel. They told him the scene with a burning cow, for example, is absolutely unacceptable. Tarkovski tried to defend the movie. The cow wasn't harmed, was his reasoning. Still the film was cut. The censors knew better what is good and what is not for the viewer.This brings us to what is the message of Tarkovski in this film. There are many messages actually. I'll be telling only about one here, because it is not hidden. It is there, in the dispute between Rublov and Theophanes The Greek. They both are talented, both want to bring people to humanity. Theophanes is tired, he says - common people live in darkness, they are completely consumed by sin and the only way to make them humans is to scare them and punish them. Rublov advocates for love. He says: people live very difficult life, it's amazing how they endure it. We have to love them, to remind them, they are humans, they are Russians. You see, the first is the position of the Soviet system, the second - of Jesus Christ.Me? I'm still sitting on the fence. :)I recommend to watch this movie many times. You will do it without my recommendation though, if you (like me) will not understand everything from the first view and you like to think. The mesmerizing beauty of this movie will help you to return easier. For the first time be prepared for not a cakewalk. There are two things to consider here. One is the cruelty. Though it is absolutely necessary in this film, most of us living in a comfort of modern society are not ready to it. The other is the pace. Often it is a pace of real life. Peace.",

The epic narrative, though a bit harder to follow because I had to rely on subtitles, is nearly unmatched in scale.

            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky's great epic is about events that occurred in and around the life of the 15th century Russian icon painter Andrei Roublev. It is not about the life of Roublev himself and, unlike other films about artists, it is certainly not about Roublev in the act of creation. Tarkovsky saves his creations to the end of the film in a series of tableaux in colour, (the film is in black-and-white), of Roublev's genius. Divided into a series of chapters, it touches on those significant events to which Roublev was a witness and although the historical episodes are presented with an uncanny attention to detail, it is more with the spiritual and metaphysical elements that Tarkovsky concerns himself.Roublev's journey through life is a deeply religious one but he is continually questioning and rediscovering his faith. His own inherent goodness is tested by the evils of the world around him. Even within the enclosed order of monks there is jealousy, envy, arrogance and doubt; so rather than being an account of the life of Roublev the film can be seen as a discourse on the thoughts and beliefs of it's creator.In cinematic terms it is an extraordinary amalgam of form and ideas. Tarkovsky composes the film with the bravura of an old master, (you can see the influence of Ford as well as Eisenstien in the compositions). Films made today just don't measure up. Made in 1966, Tarkovsky made no concessions to either popular taste or to the direction which international cinema was going. It is, on the one level, art-house cinema of a deeply reflective kind while on another level it is an accessible historical epic that works on a visual, as well as a visceral, level. Mind-blowing in the very best sense of the word.",

            "review_title": "A haunting film which explores dehumanization",
            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky is one of my favorite filmmakers of all time. His films evoke mysterious feelings that I rarely find in other movies. Not only do his films have impressive cinematography, but they also come with grand stories despite how simple they seem at first. Since this film was over 3 hours, I was a little concerned that I'd have trouble getting into it. However, I found it to be a truly engaging experience.A couple decades in the life of the famous medieval Russian painter Andrei Rublev is depicted in this epic. We see his interactions between other painters, buffoons, pagans, and Tatars. These experiences shape and influence his actions over the course of the film.I first began to pick up on the movie's themes when I asked the question: What caused Andrei to refuse to paint the church walls in Chapter 5? When I re-watched the movie with this in mind, I began to see the movie as a representation of dehumanization. In several of the opening chapters, Andrei witnessed many people either get beaten or killed. He also witnessed several bizarre sites such as seeing a group of naked pagans running through the woods. These experiences effected him in many ways such as how he refused to decorate the walls of a church or how he murdered a Tatar to save someone during a raid. With this, Tarkovsky is saying that the brutality of the world caused Andrei to lose interest in painting.I also liked the prologue and the final chapter of the film. At first glance, the prologue felt misplaced as the characters in the opening scene were never seen again. However, I think Tarkovsky did this on purpose as he was trying to let the audience know that this was one of the films' most vital scenes. I've seen a few theories on what purpose the opening serves. Some people said that it exists to introduce us to the brutality of the world. My interpretation, however, is that it and the final chapter serve as bookends to Andrei's journey. The opening scene depicts a man named Yefim escape an angry crowd in a hot air balloon only to crash and, presumably, die. The final chapter shows a boy named Boriska attempt to build a bell for the Grand Prince. The thing that Yefim, Andrei, and Boriska have in common is that they are all artists and visionaries in some way as they attempt to overcome odds to create something awe-inspiring. Both of these men bookend Andrei's journey. Yefim represents the death of an old artist while Boriska represents the birth of a new artist. Near the end of the film, Andrei comforts Boriska after he admits that his father never told him the secret to building bells. I interpreted this scene as Andrei trying to encourage the boy to remain interested in art, so he could eventually replace him.Tarkovsky usually handles dialogue exceptionally. If I pay close attention to the dialogue in his films, I find a lot of it to be thought provoking and powerful. There were many great lines of dialogue in this film. The first great scene of dialogue is in Chapter 3. In it, Andrei has a conversation with Theophanes, another famous Russian painter. Their dialogue shows the main difference between them. During their conversation, Theophanes says \"People will lump the blame for their sins on one another...will be justifying themselves before the almighty.\" Andrei replies to him with \"I don't understand how you can paint, having thoughts like that.\" This scene shows the personality traits of both men. I explained earlier how this film is based heavily on dehumanization. Their conversation is a great representation of this. The reason Theophanes has these thoughts while Andrei doesn't is because Theophanes is much older than Andrei. He has seen more of the world's brutality. Andrei hasn't seen enough of it yet to relate to Theophanes' world views. Another great scene of dialogue happens in Chapter 6. After Andrei survives a raid, he encounters the ghost of Theophanes. Andrei tells Theophanes that he is disgusted by how he killed a Tatar during the raid. He mourns the loss of his work and the evil in the world he lives in. He may not have agreed with Theophanes in Chapter 3, but later on, he eventually concurs with him. The reason for this change is because the numerous instances of brutality Andrei encountered caused him to become dehumanized over time.The cinematography was also haunting. A lot of classic movies which were praised for their haunting cinematography back in the day don't unsettle me that much. However, there were some legitimately unnerving moments in this movie which held up pretty well. Most of them were in Chapter 6. Some scenes which stood out from that sequence was how liquid metal was poured into someone's mouth, when a horse fell down a flight of stairs, when a cow was lit on fire, and, like I mentioned earlier, the conversation between Andrei and Theophanes. There's also numerous shots of horses which Tarkovsky said were a symbol of life, the most famous of which occurs at the final shot.In my review of \"Stalker\", I compared Tarkovsky to Stanley Kubrick, my favorite filmmaker, by calling him the \"Russian Kubrick\". I feel like this is a valid comparison, because both filmmakers create movies with simple, yet grand stories. The more I watch Tarkovsky's films, the more this viewpoint gets enforced. \"Andrei Rublev\" sets itself apart from other movies based on true stories due to its thematic power on dehumanization, which is carried from the first half to the next.",

            "content": "The camera work in this movie is wonderful from start to end. Unfortunately, the beauty of the camera work sometimes gets in the way of the story-telling. In almost every scene, the camera lingers beautifully on scenes, so that I both appreciate the visual art and wish the movie would hurry up and tell the story. All of the acting is very good, but it's rarely demanding because the camera owns the scenes, not the actors.The story is episodic, with little connection between most of the segments except the recurrence of the title character, a 15th century icon-painter. The first episode, about people flying a hot-air balloon, seems to have no connection to the rest. In another episode, Andrei wanders into the frolicking nudity of a pagan summer festival, where his monastery robes make him obviously out of place.A few of the episodes shared another connection besides having Andrei present. The connection is a pair of twin brothers, both princes, who hate each other. In one of those, a prince guides a band of Tatar horsemen to Vladimir, a town ruled by his brother. He invites the Tatars to loot it, so that in the process they will kill or terrorize many of the other prince's subjects and ruin one of his towns.One episode can't properly be described without a spoiler warning. Skip the rest of this paragraph unless you like spoilers. It shows a band of workers who, after building a palace for one of the twin princes, set off to work on their next construction job. But their next employer is the prince's brother, who intends to employ them to build an even grander palace. The prince sends horsemen after them, where they blind the unfortunate workers. OK, no more spoilers.The best episodes are near the end. The main character in one of them is a woman Andrei had rescued during the attack on Vladimir. The woman was mute and somewhat disturbed, possibly as a result of the attack. Similarly, Andrei was deeply troubled by what he had done to rescue her. When Tatars appeared again, she ran to their leader. Andrei tried to rescue her again, but she resisted. Fortunately, she turned out not to need a rescue that time.The final episode was the best of all, and features the most challenging and impressive acting performance. The teenage son of a bell-maker leads the casting of a huge church bell, because all the other bell-makers had died of the plague, and he is the only one who can be found who knows the secret of bell-making. It's a big job, requiring construction of a casting pit, a mold, melting furnaces, and a structure to lift the finished bell from the pit. He is very nervous, because he's doing an expensive, difficult, uncertain job without his father's guidance, for an employer who might kill him if he fails.I saw the director's original 205 minute version, on the Criterion DVD. Soviet censors cut the movie, troubled by the allegorical reference to treatment of artists, including movie-makers. Later distributors cut the movie further, to make it accessible to a broader audience. While I would object to cuts for censorship, I think the movie would tell its story better if it were heavily cut for length. Any editing to improve the story-telling would unfortunately come at the cost of some wonderful cinematography, since every scene in the movie was a visual wonder. For all its beauty, I don't think there was even two hours of story-telling in this movie.",

It is a pinnacle of film-making for me - one of few most visually beautiful films as well as one of the deepest films ever. The beauty of every frame is exquisite - I have to pause film very often just to admire it.There are only couple of more films that have touched me as profoundly as Andrei Rublyov did. I am always surprised to hear that it is very slow film - for Tarkovsky, it is very well paced, and I am never tired of its 3+ hours running time. Film based on life of the 15-th century monk and icon painter Andrei Rublyov who wanders through the country torn by barbarism, and later by Tatar invaders. Tarkovsky explores several very important topics in his film: what is talent and how an Artist is responsible for it? The Man and God, the Artist and the Power. The final 20 minutes of the film are the best and most inspiring I've seen in the cinema. For me, the last chapter of the film, \"The Bell\" is perhaps the greatest in its emotional impact piece of cinema ever made. I can't stay calm and collected when I see it. Boriska sobbing like a child after his Bell rings - and he is a child, a boy, lonely and lost; Andrei breaking his vows of silence, his words to Boriska of hope, of many roads they would walk together. Andrei's icons that we are finally allowed to behold and admire, their breathtaking divine beauty and serenity, their melodic lines and pure joyful colors, the faces of the saints and angels with their eternal mystery, quiet knowledge and sadness, looking inside themselves and inside our very souls; the music that literally takes you somewhere above this Earth, to the heights of such purity and beauty that you could hardly breath and where even the \"swiftest birds\" of pain and death can't reach you...",

If you can get past any preconceived notions of what the movie is going to be like,and just sit down for a few seconds and watch it, you will probably be able to see from the beginning that this is an extremely important, unmissable film - not to mention captivating and exciting, although very dark and disturbing throughout. The amount of skill and thought, and work that went into this film echoes within the timeless imagery that the director has created. Any serious fan of the cinema would be doing themselves a serious disservice by avoiding this movie any longer. If you interested in the works of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, you'll be able to take something of another level from this film, as there are many subtle references and parallels to their writings and teachings throughout this movie.

Riding on cloud 9, I popped Andrei Rublev into my DVD player with quiet anticipation as this film is considered by many to be Tarkovsky's greatest film (and one of the best films ever made).Sufficed to say that my excitement subsided slightly after a ridiculous opening air balloon sequence, and dissipated completely within the first hour of mind-numbing boredom. Tarkovsky's trademark atmospherics are nowhere to be found, the dialogue consists of tireless sermonizing, and the scoring is hopelessly over-dramatic. I can't believe that this film was made by the same director of the aforementioned quality films. This outing feels like one of those over-hyped Hollywood \"classics\" that are moreso exercises in amateurish movie-making that are lucky enough to earn recognition from nostalgic sympathy alone. Overpraised, poorly made tripe like this is why many people refuse to watch older movies.Now, I've read a boatload of positive reviews that point out the various symbols and hidden meanings within this film, so I revisited certain portions with added vigor. To my disappointment, however, the film continued to hold no more interest than an instruction manual. Give me a 150-minute Yasujiro Ozu film any day of the week and I'll eat through it in one sitting. But \"Andrei Rublev\" is dry, coma-inducing cinema at its worst. I'm sure film students and their kin will love dissecting the various camera angles, but the entertainment value of this film is near zilch. Unlike some of the PETA nutcases here who rate this film a 1/10 due to horse-killings, I dislike \"Andrei Rublev\" because it's quite simply an incredibly dull film. The running time is about an hour too long. Disregarding the fact that self-congratulatory, pretentious directors like Peter Jackson and Akira Kurosawa would find much to like in an additional 60 minutes of nothingness tacked onto an already stretched out movie, I need to apply my objectivity and point out that \"Andrei Rublev\" is sheer torture to sit through from beginning to end. Nostalghia (1983) is nearly as torturous, by the way.Overly long, blandly shot, frequently silly, and hopelessly dull, this exercise in over-dramatic fluff proves once and for all that most people have no taste in film whatsoever. There's no valid reason for this pile of horse manure to be considered a better film than the excellent \"Ivan's Childhood.\" I know that fans of \"art-house\" movies frequently lack the inner strength to criticize a film such as this, but some objectivity would be appreciated for those of us who care more for entertaining cinema than directorial pandering. Every director has some duds in their portfolio. Live with it.One thing that surprises me is how a frankly religious film such as this is uniformly praised by IMDb users. Most of the users I know are raving liberal atheists with a giant stick up their rear-end, so it's interesting to see them pine over this movie like no-brain lemmings. I guess artsy pretentiousness automatically overrides their fanatical hatred for religion, because the superficial preachy ramblings are laid on thick and fast in \"Andrei Rublev.\" How do all of these naturalists reconcile their subconscious thoughts \u0096 which are probably uttering the word \"bullsh*t\" after every line of dialogue in this movie \u0096 with their snobby lust for art-house trash?

Basically this story, divided into eight episodes, charts the life of the famous iconic painter, artist Andrei Rublev (Anatoli Solonitsyn), who lives in 15th Century Russia. The film is essentially a study and insight into the meaningfulness and importance of art, religion and faith, and how these ideas are challenged with the events played out. The historical events that occur include an attempt at the first hot air balloon, the decoration of Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow, and of course the Tsardom of Russia, which included the invasion by the Tatar people. Starring Ivan Lapikov as Kirill, Nikolai Grinko as Danil Chorny, Nikolai Sergeyev as Theophanes the Greek, Irma Raush as Idiot Girl (Durochka), Nikolay Burlyaev as Boriska, Yuriy Nazarov as The Grand Prince / His Brother, The Lesser Prince and Rolan Bykov as The Jester. In the leading role Solonitsyn is a good noble character with a keen eye for his works, being set in a medieval period the most memorable scenes for me were the battle sequences, a crucifixion, the unearthing, raising and ringing of a large bell, and a short breakaway from black and white to colour to see the real works of Rublev, I will confess I found it hard to understand what was going on, but for the imagery, such as costume and sets, this is a worthwhile biographical drama.

Why this isn't mentioned by more critics and die-hard film buffs is a mystery because this is easily one of the greatest achievements I've ever seen and it puts to shame some of the other films that have had the monitor \"Great\" slapped on them. Story is about the 15th century Russian monk and painter Andrei Rublyov (Anatoli Solonitsyn) who is summoned by the Grand Prince to work with Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev) in painting the Cathedral of the Annunciation in Moscow.*****SPOILER ALERT***** During Rublyov's journey he witnesses first hand many of the atrocities that are taking place in his country including a pagan orgy (in which he is tempted) and the Tartar raids that has Rublyov himself killing another man. All of this leads to Rublyov making a vow of silence, \"I have nothing more to say to men\" but over the next year he witnesses the casting and raising of a bell by a bell-maker's son (Nikolai Burlyayev) who knows that he will killed by the Grand Prince if it is not successfully completed. Rublyov is so moved by this that it restores his faith (spiritually and artistically) and tells the boy that they should go together, \"You'll cast bells. I'll paint icons\".With this one film director Andrei Tarkovsky has achieved something that most (if not all) other filmmakers could only dream of but he still had to deal with the Russian censors who forced Tarkovsky to edit certain scenes of brutality. The question of what is art and what inspires it has been a debate with Tarkovsky throughout his career but with Andrei Rublyov he seems to use him as a metaphor for where artistic motivation comes from. Without poverty and inhumanity would there be art? Tarkovsky asks these questions but this film is more than just thought provoking because it's also one of the most visually stunning cinematic efforts I have ever seen. Cinematographer Vadim Yusov's haunting black and white imagery makes the bleak Russian countryside look absolutely breathtaking and this is one the finest films ever shot. At 205 minutes this fragmented and episodic film covers events from 1400 to 1423 and while other films are lucky to have at least one memorable scene in it this seems to be one incredible shot after another and the casting of the bell stands as one the most indelible celluloid microcosms ever captured.

            "content": "It's such a bold stroke of cinematic prowess to make a film like Andrei Rublev, let alone at the age of 32, 33 that Andrei Tarkovsky was. This is a film that, while (from my perspective) imperfect, breathes with the freedom and abandon of a cinematic artist paying tribute to art itself. In this case, Andrei Rublev was a real icon painter from 15th century Russia, who witnessed many a strange, amazing scene in his time, and all of which helped make him a better, more confident artist attached to his faith. I saw mostly the end section of the film a year ago, the part titled 'The Bell', as well as the end sequence in color, and was really drawn into the story of a young man obsessed with building an object that might help him in some way, but in the end reveals something rather astonishing. The end sequence itself, too, I might mark as one of the most beautiful, deliberate, and successfully astute scenes of capturing art ever put to film. It's all images of the real iconic paintings, all still around after centuries, put to music that adds such a religious height that even for a non-believer such as myself it was quite moving.This being said, as a non-believer, here and there in part 1 of Andrei Rublev, aka the Passion According to Andrei, a little much religious talk ensues and almost threatens to dull some of the effect of the film. Not without interest, of course, but scenes where characters or Rublev himself start reciting passages from the bible (with one insert even of a simulated quasi-Crucifixion) drag the film's pacing a little bit, which is important in its three hour+ running time. Simply put, it's really, really worth a viewing of the film if you're at all interested in the \"art films\" of the European 1960s, as it represents a filmmaker's freedom in expressing the subject matter, while still having a deep personal connection with the material. And amid a scene or two that doesn't quite work, there are at least three or four that do fantastically. The sequences of the tragic-comic Jester, the bizarre 'witchcraft' portion with the pagans (quite amazing considering the time it was filmed, very entertaining), the violent, engagingly horrific raid, and the other sequences mentioned earlier, all make up the best scenes in the film. Amid the artistic dilemma that poses for Rublev, he is surrounded by the will, the damnation, the violence, the strength, the equal measures of ignorance and intelligence, and cinematically it all does come together quite well.With cinematography that's top notch (with OK editing), a good, if very large, cast, and a real vision put to the test, this is a thoughtful, faithful kind of epic that is rather daunting to finally see in one sitting. But it goes without saying that there are scenes which could possibly stand alongside those of Eisenstein as the most powerful, emotional, and challenging-to-conventions-of-cinema type moments from Russia, or even Europe for that matter. 9.5/10",

Instead, Tarkovsky used this historic figure to tell some universal truths about mankind in general and Russians in particular.However, he made a masterpiece. This is very demanding movie that requires multiple viewings to fully grasp its amazing content enriched by extraordinary shots. It's like reading a heavy Dostoyevsky novel \u0096 sometimes you must repeat some parts. But, if you are open-minded and concentrated the whole way through you'll be richly rewarded with some brilliantly clever, revealing and meaningful content about human vanity, responsibility and spirituality. Tarkovsky's skill is tremendous, pace is deliberate (in good sense), photography and sounds are breathtaking and acting is superb. You won't find entertainment in this one unless entertainment is profound meditation on human nature. So, if your favorite movie is something like Harry Potter... don't bother with this one.",

            "content": "My Rating : 9/10Why is this such a great film? Well, for one, it is Andrei Tarkovsky and he is the ultimate master of the visual medium.Films like this are what give the medium its purpose. It is rich, beautifully shot and acted, and extraordinarily powerful. Like all great works of art, it requires many viewings and much thought to discover the various layers of intellectual and aesthetic meaning within it. That is why a simple description of the plot would give the prospective viewer little idea of what the movie is actually about.In Andrei Tarkovsky's hugely ambitious 1966 epic of medieval Russia, a young man whose village and family have been destroyed by the plague convinces the Grand Prince to let him make a beautiful new bell. The boy, named Boriska (and played by Nikolai Burlyaev with a whipsawing combination of youthful exuberance and self-flagellating despair), comes from a family of bell makers. Boriska claims that before his father died, he revealed to him the secret of casting a bronze bell. The boy, fresh-faced and inexperienced as he is, is hired. He enlists a small army of workers and runs them ragged as the seasons pass. Bouncing around like a busy bumblebee, he berates them about the right kind of clay, the right kind of pit, the right amount of silver, and at one point even has his best friend flogged for insubordination. Only briefly, and secretly, does he betray any hesitation, any sense that he might fail. Giant holes are dug; coarse chunks of dirt pass among dry, scabbed hands; massive fires are built; mad, exasperated eyes stare out at us in indignation, fear, doubt, petulance. Are these people forging a bell or a new world?Finally, the bell is built, and hung, and rung. We wait an unbearably long time for its clapper to finally strike and send off a loud, low, clear, and perfect chime; Tarkovsky was known for making long, deliberately paced movies, but he was also a master of suspense. Having succeeded at long last, Boriska collapses in tears and frustration. Now, the film's protagonist, the legendary Russian monk and icon painter Andrei Rublev (Anatoly Solonitsyn, in one of the great passive performances of cinema history), comes to the young man and comforts him. Amid his tears, Boriska reveals that his father never imparted to him the secret of bell making. The boy has been, essentially, flying blind.Rublev is a mesmerizing portrait of an artist and cleric undone by a world that is cruel, chaotic, unexplainable. And it's obviously about a lot more than medieval Russia; Tarkovsky never shot an impersonal frame, and he spent his entire career struggling for the integrity of his work. Suppressed by Soviet authorities, Rublev wasn't seen in the USSR until 1971. Tarkovsky's diaries from the period, among the most candid and anguished writings you'll ever read by a filmmaker, are filled with exasperated accounts of officials placing obstacles in the path of his picture's release, even as it garners praise and awards internationally. When the movie finally opened at home, the director saw no ads or posters for it anywhere, even though it was selling out its screenings. Many of his later films would suffer even worse fates.Rublev's crisis of faith comes as a result of confronting a world that doesn't seem in any way to reflect the divinity to which he's dedicated his life. He's a monk wandering a godless world, unsure if there is anything beyond the misery and horror he sees all around him. Boriska has the bell he doesn't know how to make, and Rublev has the icons he's forgotten how to paint. To that duo we may also add Tarkovsky, with the films he's not allowed to direct, or release. All three men must find a way to persevere, to not only act as if there is a different, better world, but in some way to help bring it about through - and, perhaps more importantly, within - their work. What if, Tarkovsky seems to ask, the silence of God is the very essence of God? What if the fact that there is no secret is the secret?",

Ivan, Solaris, Stalker all were 9/10 that is I simply loved all those, but after watching this I have to rate this as 11/10 and my favorite AK's creation but it doesn't seem very real as all his other movies (so far I have seen) are all simply beautiful. AK's movies are the link between me and Russia, as I am not Russian and don't even know their language, culture or even country very well. So after watching his work it seems to me as if I am getting closer to the country and everything about it. It's an amazing experience for me as a viewer and a person.Now talking about Rublev, this movie is rather than a story of Rublev is a story of his times, times he lived in. Turbulent times that Russia in general went through as he lived in it as a painter. I think this is a major point why this movie is so good and works so well. The photography is amazing each frame of the movie is actually as if a work of painter, background score is too good blends very well with the scenes, acting too is good especially the main central role. He makes you feel his problems, worries, soul search all as real. Coming to direction it is undoubtedly one of the best works of Tarkovsky and I wonder why this movie is not listed in any of the top 100 movies of all time as a matter of fact any other Tarkovsky's movies. Each frame of the movie is picture perfect right from the opening scene when a man is trying to fly in the hot balloon to the end when the bell is tolled perfectly to the great art work of Tarkovsky in real. The movie has all the Tarkovsky's signature element in them, beautiful use of earth elements air, water and fire to the great effect as well his soul searching, God related questions, answers, explanation and all. Also most important point for many movie goers who criticize him for his slow paced movies, this one is very different from his other movies, even though it's long but not for a single second you will feel bored as it is not slow paced and keeps you engaged in the story. Rating: 11/10. I cannot wait to explore his other movies.",

There is so much about the film that one could praise or babel on about, but few words can actually describe what an experience this film is, and how deeply it reaches you, the viewer.The cinematography is amazing. Tarkovsky's use of slow motion, black and white, and long moving shots is astounding to say the least. The costumes and locations give the impression that the filmmakers went back in time to get their shots. The music is incredibly moving and haunting, adding another level of meaning and nuance to the film. Their are images and moments that are truly disturbing and others that are truly breathtaking in their beauty. This is not a \"light\" film; it fearlessly tackles many philosophical issues such as death and purpose of one's own life and the boundaries of faith and morality. It's an extremely complex journey that constantly provokes you to ponder your own life. The characters and their stories are very relatable, even if the film is set six hundred years ago.\"Andrei Rublev\" is certainly a film like no other, and a challenging and powerful viewing experience. It's also a film that demands two maybe three re-watches, as I plan on doing myself. Perhaps what it does best is encapsulate the human condition; for this alone it's worth your time.",

Tarkovsky's film is picturesque and beautiful, yes, but not on the same level as Bergman, for example. I liked the way the story is broken up into chapters but much of the material seems deliberately pious and the mannered performances don't help.

I think that they are different films, and all shortcomings that many reviewers of \"Andrei Rublev\" pointed out are far more obvious in that \"original version\" (which was released on DVD,unfortunately, by \"Criterion\", famous level among cinema lovers).Tarkovsky himself, after his emigration to West, never complained as if Soviet authorities had spoiled his film by forcing him to re-edit it.Of course he knew that the long period of re-editing, which was really annoying for him at first, allowed him to clear up surplus shots and episodes(including those of lengthy animal abusing, of wrestling of Great Prince with his younger brother on snow) and to correct inadequate editing(especially that of \"Bell\").So I recommend everyone to watch \"re-edited\"version, which is really \"Andrei Rublev\", and not to see lengthy 3 hours and 26 minutes \"original version\" which is half-made product. But if you are interested in the practical technique of editing film, maybe comparing these two films is useful. My rating is for \"Andrei Rublev\", which was a favorite film of I.

I decided to give this film another chance and I am very thankful that I did for it remains one of the five best films I have ever seen. It is hard to define this film. It is frightening, spooky, awe-inspiring, horrifying and incredibly dream-like. Ultimately, ANDREI RUBLEV is not necessarily about the title artist. For many, Andrei Rublev is about the artistic spirit of the 15th century painter. This spirit is manifest in various fictional and non-fictional figures placed within Rublev's time period. Several of these individuals include a bell-maker, a jester, a group of pagans, and Rublev himself. The movie highlights the fact that the path of the artist is not always an easy one. Even thought the artist may experience various tribulations and successes, he or she must try not to disregard the talent possessed. Rather, the artist must continue to create beauty within a world that is characterized by hatred, killings, and religious intolerance. The nature of the artist and his responsibility toward the community is perhaps the theme that most pervades and unites the film, and almost every episode presents at least some variant of it. The balloonist in the prologue takes the risks every true artist must take in stepping beyond the boundaries of the known, and challenging the fear and conformism of the people he wishes to benefit. The jester embodies the creative spirit of the people and their resistance to authority (religious and secular). Kirill represents the untalented artist and although he is untalented and jealous, he is aware of how the artist should endure and pleas with Rublev to resume his vocation. Rublev, in contrast to his three partners (Daniil, Kirill, and Theophenes the Greek), has genuine love, humility, and self-effacement, putting himself at the service of God and man. During the film Rubilev tries to forge a style that allows him to express his love for humanity. In essence, Tarkovsky wants the viewer to realize what the true artist represents and (from Tarkovsky's point of view) Andrei Rubilev represents the true Russian artist.",

Because of its length, it has been pruned by different distributors to make it a more manageable viewing experience.I watched the 178-minute version released on Blu-ray in the UK by Curzon. As with most of Tarkovsky's work, his concern is more with the visual elements of the film rather than faithfully following the plot. This elliptical approach can make his films hard to follow for audiences unfamiliar with the source material.My recommendation for all Tarkovsky's film, including this one, is as follows: First view the film without doing any research on it, so you can enjoy the film on its own terms. Then do a little reading on the film and its subject matter, followed by a second viewing, when you can experience the film with an enhanced ability to follow the narrative.",

            "content": "To review Tarkovsky's crowning achievement one must realize that this is a film that goes above and beyond what anything from any other filmmaker is capable of. Andrei Rublev is a film that goes beyond the capacity of conventional cinema (art film or otherwise)and becomes the essence of film as art. Andrei Rublev ceases to proclaim a message as many other films, but rather offers what every filmmaker strives for: a look at why art exists, and its role in life for all beings. Andrei Rublev is a film that won't speak to everybody, it won't even speak to all artists, but to those it speaks to will become moved in ways unimaginable. The film captures not only the essence of the artist's purpose, but also our purposes as individuals.The film begins with a short scene wherein a man tries to fly, but comes crashing down witnessed only by a horse. This short scene alone offers so much, the man representing the fall of all men or our need to become above other creatures, the horse representing life or loneliness and the barren countryside representing a world that is unfriendly to all men. This scene alone is up for multiple interpretations, many of which would be equally right. The film never tells you how to look at it, but allows you to bring your own philosophy and meaning to it. Ultimately its basic themes are vivid, but its many meanings remain as ambiguous as ever, countless viewings will bring more and more to the film, and in truth it is probably impossible to fully fathom the meaning of it. As with all great art it must be experienced and made to relate to one personally to find its meaning, it cannot just be viewed and admired.The vivid themes of the film come from the ideas of art, man's need for art and the artist's role in history. Andrei Rublev is a film that deals with both the futility of being a Christian artist in a Godless world, and with the impact art can have to bring God to a more personal level. These themes are developed in seven stages, each one differing immensely from the other, with the core ideas and the artist Rublev being shared in every one. Though these themes seem to center around and deal exclusively with art, they are very implicit to every human being's lifestyle. Art can be used as an allegory for our gifts, the idea that we should not hide what we can offer the world, just as the artist should not hide his art from the world. Our gifts and talents can be used to glorify God and bring hope, even if the world does not have a lot of hope, despite the often felt futility of doing what we are gifted in, we bring goodness into the world through them.Ultimately the film offers this at its core, however there are many more ideas and meanings the individual must bring out of the film to impart its full impact. Through patience and connections the viewer can make the film into a personal experience and in doing this may become moved deeper than ever before. After all isn't this every artists wish?",

And it all starts here anew.What is so fascinating about Tarkovsky is that he reaches so far, goes so beyond ourselves and our capacity to understand in images. His camera doesn't only move, it lingers, and it lingers all the way to our souls.And, if you are like me and enjoy instead of dread the existence of variant versions, it's very rewarding to see both versions, the so-called Scorsese cut (released by the Criterion Collection on DVD in late 1990s), and the one more readily available, the cut that Tarkovsky had to make after the authorities demanded some changes. But this doesn't mean that this shorter version should be any lesser. In fact, what has been omitted in the shorter version hardly touches the essence of the film. Plus, it has a bit more complete use of music.",

            "content": "Andrei Rublev is like no other Soviet film. In my opinion it's Andrei Tarkovsky's greatest cinematic achievement. The film is loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev, the great 15th century Russian icon painter. Andrei Rublev is set against the background of 15th century Russia. Although the film is only loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev, its depiction of medieval Russia is realistic. Tarkovsky created a film that shows the artist as \"a world-historic figure\" and \"Christianity as an axiom of Russia's historical identity\" during a turbulent period of Russian history, that ultimately resulted in the Tsardom of Russia.Filmed during the golden age of Soviet cinema Andrei Rublev was not however released in the atheistic and authoritarian Soviet Union because of the films's religious themes and political ambiguity. A cut version of the film was shown at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the FIPRESCI prize. In 1971 a censored version of the film was released in the Soviet Union. The film was further cut for commercial reasons upon release in the US in 1973. Because of this several versions of the film exist. Tarkovsky's direction is brilliant. He not only makes the film compelling but also beautiful (like a black and white painting in the style of realism). The film itself isn't really about Andrei but about Russian society during his lifetime. There was instability, suffering and mistrust. But even so there was still hope, and as Andrei later discovers, resilience and strength. There is also a good number of lessons in morality and philosophy. Even though the film is long not a single scene feels like it should have been left out. Unlike Sergei Eisenstein's historical epics Andrei Rublev doesn't have any elements of propaganda. It's an accurate look at the old Russia. I give Andrei Rublev my highest recommendation. It's unusual, powerful and significant.",

            "content": "Don't bother with this film if you haven't got patience. Don't bother with it if you aren't interested in being challenged by a serious art film. There is nothing fast or light here. Those who are seeking out films that are spiritual, reflective and artistic, you've found one of the absolute best.One could recommend it simply as a master-class in visual composition. Tarkovsky shares some of the mature Fellini's sensibilities for many different elements of dimension and movement in a medium or long shot. There are often people in the fore, and background. He includes fog, smoke, or drifting snow to add further dimension to the shot. It is very painterly. It is an interesting approach to a biopic of a painter that barely ever shows him paint. Instead, the encounters he has, the things he sees, and his reactions to these things are what inform us. His work is showcased at the end of the narrative, as a coda to the story. How true to history Rublev's story is, in my opinion isn't important. Tarkovsky has created a protagonist, and events that not only explore the mind of the man well, but also give an overview of what Russia was going through at that time. I recently watched this film for the second time. While the first viewing left me thinking that the ending segment is the strong pay-off for the patience it takes to watch the unabridged version (the Criterion Collection DVD was my my medium of viewing this film),on second viewing, I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. I would also recommend the partial commentary on the CC DVD in helping inform the viewer about Tarkovsky's approach to making this film. Rating: first viewing- 8 of 10 second viewing- 10 of 10",

The mystery, emotion and history of this remarkable country have found places in my soul I was scarcely aware of.  This masterful film manages to evoke the sensations I felt during my month's long visit.  The Russian people, among the dearest I have known, have suffered as have few others in all of history.  The art of this magnificent country is always tinged in dark tones.  The music, if not in a minor key, evokes minor key emotions.  The literature, even with Gogol, clearly delineates the suffering and hardships with which all Russians are familiar.  Therefore, it was not surprising to find all of this so strongly depicted in Andrei Rublyov.  However, the beauty that somehow transcended the misery and bleakness constantly before the viewer was redemptive.  The scene in which the iconographer holds the sobbing boy is one of the most touching and devastating on film.  I sat before the screen with tears streaming down my cheeks.  It may sound hyperbolic, but I found this film absolutely life-changing.  I am returning to Russia to volunteer in an orphanage.  Moreover, I am fully prepared to end my life in that great enigmatic country.  Indeed, this film has changed my life.  I cannot recommend it too highly.",

            "content": "\"Andrey Rublev\" (not the tennis player) is a Soviet movie from 1966, so this one had its 50th anniversary already and the director and also one of the writers here is Andrei Tarkovsky. He is also the one big name most film buffs will immediately recognize. I cannot really say anything about the cast, probably you may want to check out Russian reviews for that I'm sure there will be some among the big quantity of reviews to this movie here on imdb. The film is mostly in black-and-white and it runs for over 3 hours. There are several versions out there. The one I saw had 3 hours 5 minutes or so I think, but the original is almost 3.5 hours. Tarkovsky's films are almost always really long, no surprise. Now my review will certainly not according in length. I honestly don't know a lot I could say about this one, but I'll give it a try. It takes place in the late 16th and early 17th century and is about the life of the iconographer mentioned in the title. But the aspect of art felt almost non-existent to me. Instead it is a lot about fighting and evenmore so (sometimes connected) also about religion. Actually really a lot about relgion honestly, there were always links there somehow. But honestly I did not even feel it was this much about Rublev as I would have thought if they name the film after him and also with how long it goes. There were always other characters with major focus on. The best example is the young man towards the end in this really long part about the bell. As for my showing, it is really all I expected from Tarkovsky in terms of what I read about him and his works. There were people falling asleep and snoring, there were people laughing during really serious scenes and then there were the ones offended by the two previous one. Well, I was just sitting there quietly hoping the film would do something for me eventually, but it didn't. I thought it was a huge bore and I did make it through the entire thing. One thing I struggled with was how wildly the film moves from scene to scene and location to location. Another was the emotions. There are so so many, mostly negative ones, pain, despair, tears etc. but they did not touch me at all. I think the reason is that there is no buildup really. In one scene we see a woman catching on to the legs of her man and we have hardly no idea who these people are, at leats the woman in this case. How feel for somebody if the character is introduced like this. I guess the acting was okay all in all, but the film is really story-wise nothing that impressed me. And at some point you just check out and want it to be over. I can see why Tarkovsky is so divisive, or actually I cannot really see why so many people like him I must admit. The theater was also way fuller than I expected. I guess his approach to filmmaking is really one where people either hate or love him and for me judging from this film, the first I saw from him, it is the former. Actually fairly impressive or weird or just massive that he made this film when he was about my age in his early 30s. Would have expected it from an older filmmaker really. Anyway, his effort and the time he put in it all is undeniable. But A for effort can still mean F for quality and from my perspective it is true. I will still give him a chance I guess as there is a film retrospective on him currently here in a local theater and I'll probably at least check out Stalker and Solaris and maybe one or two others from his most known stuff. But for this one here, I definitely give a negative recommendation, still as you can see by the fact that this sits comfortably in the imdb top250, many people like it and see the artistic impact, so perhaps go watch the first 30 or 60 minutes and then keep watching if you do like and can deal with some really violent moments, but if not let it be. It's not getting any better or different. Honestly also these color moments and creations near the end before the closing credits did feel fairly pretentious to me and also added nothing to the movie or story except that he was really trying to be different at the end. Okay, that is all. I did not like it at all.",

            "review_title": "How to paint the face of God?",
            "content": "For his cinema perhaps all has been written, a dozen books at least. With only his second feature he was where other filmmakers would be at the end of their careers. A vision of how to see the world fully formed as its own chapter of cinematic history, where a tappestry rich in spiritual textures is entered and abandoned at will, the frame experienced then as disparate planes of existence which overlap, supersede and inform one another. His masterstroke is the removal of the cut, whereby essentially different scenes can now be read as a flow of life. And again in how reality is understood as a continuum that flows in and out of the mind, where shadows and reflections manifest where they shouldn't be.This is the first point I stand on, that Tarkovsky's world in this film cannot be fathomed outside of the mind, without the shadows it casts around us. The mind is then a fundamental tool where the formations of life begin.The existential problem posited by the film is how man, who is shown to be small and incomplete himself, can muster strengths and passions to complete a world left incomplete by creation. Having started out as mere characters in the middle point of this narrative we call life, how to become authors who can understand what has been created in order to write the chronicle of it. How to paint the face of god? And how to meditate on that struggle in film? Into this terrifying dilemma of existence, which is the quest for meaning and pattern, he places the artist with the divine spark, he who must paint the face of god. This is the starkest contrast of the film, the mechanism that drives it forward, how this humble man can accomplish this great spiritual task in a godless world where the face of god is precisely absent. It's not strange then that the icons of the Orthodox church portray Christs as lean, stoic figures. Suffering in this part of the world which now and then Attilas and Khans devastate it, is to be abided as the only mandate of god. Art then imitates life, these faces who must survive in the wastes, elevating it to a representation of the divine.We see the artist suffer a crisis of conscience at the face of this violence, a refusal to be the divine vehicle anymore. How Tarkovsky resolves this crisis is where the film falters for me.In watching a young boy cast a bell, a holy fool who succeeds against all odds, his faith is restored. Having wandered the latter part of the film a pathetic, passive figure of silence, he is made whole again by this meaningful, but chance event. The tools then by which we can understand meaning and purpose to life are not discovered inside, through a stillness of mind and right concentration (which in meditation is experienced as the appearance and disappearance of forms, leading at the ultimate stages to the disintegration of the mind and body), but rather are encountered as apparitions.Whether or not then god speaks through the ringing of that bell, the echo of it reveals the men who created it to be still small, prone to the same despairs and suffering. Essentially humans, aching for salvation in an ugly world. How to transcend then this mortality, the need for salvation which is a form of clinging that clouds the soul, this much remains outside the movie's interests. For that we'll have to go ahead to Solyaris.",

            "content": "\"Agreed-upon\" to be one of the cinema's masterworks, \"The Passion According to Andrei\" or simply \"Andrei Rublev\" revolves around the life of Russia's 15th-century great icon painter. The unique and great Tarkovsky carried the idea of this film from the first beginning, even before finishing his first film \"Ivan's Childhood\". Yet, after a single premiere screening in Russia (Dom Kino) in the year 1966, the film did not get a public release. Tarkovsky's masterpiece struggled for years in the Soviet Union and upon releasing it in December 1971 there were several cuts applied to it, where it was shown in the 186-minute version (the original was 205 min. long). Before that in 1969, the film was requested for Cannes Film Festival where it won the FIPRESCI prize, and from there on it was widely regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time.Rublev's character appears for the first time leaving the Trinity monastery with two other monks to search for work in Moscow. At the end of the movie, Rublev goes back to the same monastery, where he began his journey, to paint his \"Holy Trinity\". Between this and that, Rublev accomplished his spiritual journey and found his voice (innerself) not between the walls of monastery, but in the harsh circumstances of life back then. The film indeed shows little about Andrei Rublev himself and yet in a way shows a lot. As always Tarkovsky surprises his audience. The biographical film does not tell us about Rublev in the traditional meaning of the word, since he is most of the times a witness of what was going on and a passive observer. Yet, it tells us more about the interaction of this personality with existence, life, and with the conditions and occurrences of his time. In fact, Tarkovsky's psychological stance and spiritual meditation had to do a lot with the result of this film. That is why many regarded it as an allegory to Tarkovsky's own struggles in Russia or with his own-self. It is then the passion according to both Andrei Rublev and Andrei Tarkovsky.The film is divided into eight chapters (with a prologue and epilogue) each with a unique title. The opening scene starts with a prologue of a hot air balloon ride. Some consider this amazing scene as an allegory to our spiritual relationship with the \"world of appearances\". It may also seem an allegory to the struggles of the innovative, the spiritual, and the human in general with the circumstances life presents. Well, it may also mean both; since Tarkovsky uses powerful images that carry lots of meanings to evoke our emotions and drive us to react to them from our perspective. A horse (to Tarkovsky it resembles life) is seen collapsing. Rublev then is shown leaving the monastery.. the journey begins.Envy, desire, love, betrayal, freedom, faith.. wars and tortures and murders and struggles all of which Rublev feels and witnesses, and so he'd be greatly affected. He becomes disturbed and shaken.. and undergoes a vow of silence until he finds his faith again. Then, after seeing a boy achieve by faith what he was incapable of by knowledge, Rublev finds himself again in a moment of inspiration. Now we're ready to see Rublev's work in detail.. the film concludes with horses standing peacefully (the only scene shot in colors alongside Rublev's frescoes).The film's spirituality offended many officials, its depiction of Russia's history offended many nationalists, and its boldness offended some of the religious. Yet, Tarkovsky was not trying really to take sides or attack or criticize anyone. He was just being Tarkovsky.. the genius.. with his thoughts and emotions. He was presenting from what he deeply felt a piece of art.",

            "content": "In 1966 Andrei Tarkovsky directed Andrei Rublev, also known as The Passion according to Andrei. The film loosely depicts the life of Andrei Rublev, an early 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia's greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Tarkovsky used this historical figure to anchor the film in one of Russia's most tragic period, making Andrei Rublev not only a witness of his Time but also depicting the artist's creation process, the importance of his faith, the Loss of it and more importantly how the two (Art and Faith) can help go through event you can't really grasp or even understand. The complexity of the film as well as the political implications explain why Andre\u00ef Rublev was not released in an atheist USSR until 1971 and in a censored version mind you.The film starts with a prologue where we see a man call Yefim taking off from the roof of a church in a hot air balloon and escaping a mob trying to prevent the Take-off. Yefim seems highly exited and delighted by the sight he experiences from the air; but as the air balloon crashes, we understand that elevation in this obscurantist time is not going to be easy. We fall before we reach enlightenment. This is our Human Condition, this is what Life is about and the shot of a Horse lolling in the grass by a river bank epitomizes Life, its struggle and its beauty. This prologue summarizes metaphorically the seven chapters that follow narrating the trepidations of Andrei Rublev looking for elevation and falling back into his Human condition.For Andrei Rublev, Faith and Art are intimately linked, he paints religious icons and frescoes because he believes this is his priesthood the only way he can transmit his Faith to the people. Losing his Faith in Humanity might imply losing his Faith in God and so in Art. It's only when Andrei witnesses the casting of a bell that his life turns around. He meets the character of Boriska,the bell caster, another creative character a reminiscence of young Andrei and when Andrei sees the young Boriska collapsing on the ground of fatigue and breaking into tears, he takes him in his arms to comfort him and break his vow of silence. He understands he is not alone struggling with the concept of artistic creation and Faith as both (the young Boriska and the older Andrei) brought people so much joy. An artist with a vision can create and eventually echoes god's power of creation by using his or her technical skills but more importantly his or her heart and Faith.The \"tour de force\" of Andrei Tarkovsky is to use the same creative process than the one of his film's protagonist. By putting his heart and soul in the core of his cinematographic technique he transcends the genre and the medium. We understand that \"in cinema it is necessary not to explain, but to act upon the viewer's feelings, and the emotion which is awoken is what provokes thought\". To this respect Andrei Rublev is a film to experience and I humbly suggest we experience it with our heart and soul.",

            "content": "In production for a whole month before Nikita Khrushchev was deposed as head of the Soviet State and the cultural thaw he had led was forcibly ended, Andrei Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev was a thorn in the side of the Soviet authorities for years. Explicitly religious with a clear-eyed look at the oppressive nature of Russian history, it was far from the sort of nationalistic fanfare about a Russian hero of the arts the authorities wanted for propaganda purposes. Finished in 1966, but not released within the USSR until 1971, Andrei Rublev has gained the reputation as one of the pinnacles of art house cinema. Using the promised resources from before the thaw, Tarkovsky crafted an intimate story of the artist and faith in the face of terror and oppression with an incredibly impressive scale at the same time.It's also an incredibly non-traditional piece of storytelling. Andrei Rublev (Anatoly Solonitsyn), the historical figure, was one of Russia's greatest painters of icons. Little is actually known of his life, so Tarkovsky used that open-endedness to craft a story about the artist's relationship to his art. The story is a series of vignettes from 1400 to 1424, and in not a single one does Rublev hold a paint brush. He's also silent for the film's final hour. What each of these vignettes ends up doing is shake Rublev's faith and his confidence in his art's purpose in the world until his final decisions to go on and paint.The story moves through these vignettes with a singular purpose and vision. Tied together by Rublev's presence, involvement, and eventually just observation, each bit sees Rublev becoming increasingly disconnected from the violence of the world around him. It starts with a jester being carted away by authorities to prison, an artist (a bawdy one at that) being punished for performing his art in ways that the state didn't approve. There are also dramatic presentations of a nighttime orgy by pagans that ends in the morning with the authorities carting the remnants away.After seeing all of this, Rublev finds it impossible to work. Given the commission of painting the Last Judgment in the church at Vladimir by the Prince (Yuriy Nazarov), he cannot bring himself to paint such suffering. He wanders without purpose, trying to find a way to bring himself to do anything, but the church remains empty except for the scaffolding and blank, white walls waiting for him. His inaction drives his own artisans away, some of whom go with the Prince's brother, the Grand Duke (also Yuriy Nazarov in a dual role), to work on his mansion instead. The Prince sends his men to massacre the artisans, news that nearly breaks Rublev. The arrival of a girl simpleton (Irma Raush), though, provides him with just enough hope to change his plans and paint a feast in place of the Last Judgment.The next major section is titled \"The Raid\", and in any other movie it would be the standout sequence. It's the dramatization of the Grand Duke bringing in Tatars to attack the Prince at Vladimir. The scale of the production here is amazing, reminding me of the resources put behind Sergei Bondarchuk for his adaptation of War and Peace. The amount of cavalry, the scale of the destruction on screen with horses and troops plowing through the city, and even the on screen death of a real horse (shot in the neck by Tarkovsky himself, a horse that was going to be killed by a nearby slaughterhouse the next day, the carcass sent back for commercial consumption after filming). The invasion crescendos at the church, now fully painted, where the townspeople have gathered in fear with Andrei providing what solace he can to the simple girl. When the doors inevitably come down, Andrei takes an axe to save her life, killing the man carting her away. That act of killing finally breaks Andrei down, leaving him in a vow of silence where he can't influence anything. He never paints and, years later, he can't do anything when some Tatars come to the monastery he's taken her entice her with shiny things and their leader makes her his eighth wife.I said that any other movie would consider \"The Raid\" to be the standout sequence in the movie, but Andrei Rublev has \"The Bell\". \"The Bell\" is some of my absolute favorite filmmaking I've ever seen. Rublev himself is barely in it, wandering through the action as purely an observer, and he's observing the orphaned son of a bellmaker, Boriska (Nikolai Burlyayev). Boriska tells the Grand Duke's men that all of the bellmakers in the area are dead due to the violence and disease that have afflicted the are for years and the only one left who knows the secret of bellmaking is Boriska himself.He's arrogant and haughty as he lays out his qualifications (none of which include actually having lead the creation of a bell), insisting that the spot too far from the walled city is the best and that none of the clay nearby is good enough to use, eventually finding the perfect clay some ways away in the rain (the point where Andrei sees him first). The experienced help are dismissive of Boriska, insisting that there are better ways to go about the efforts, but Boriska heads off in his own direction no matter what, flying by the seat of his pants while insisting he knows everything and probably knowing little. It's even to the point where he demands an extra thirteen pounds of silver from the Grand Duke simply because he can.We've watched all of this arrogance play out leading to the creation of a bell, huge and impressive, but there are doubts about its construction and ability to ring. As the bell rises out of the ground, Boriska becomes quiet, barely saying anything, and the tension as the clapper gets closer and closer to the bell's interior is one of the tensest moments I've experienced. We know the dangers facing Boriska should things fail as well as the fact that he wasn't disregarding good advice left and right, and yet we have no idea if it will ring or not at all.Rublev finally speaks at the end, offering surprising solace to Boriska, and promising to find his art again to help bring beauty into the world. It's Rublev seeing that even though his land has been ravaged, raped, and pillaged, it is his responsibility as an artist to create something beautiful with Tarkovsky ending the film with a several minute long montage of some of Rublev's most famous works, ending with \"The Trinity\", as the only elements of color in the whole film.There's something beautiful about this harsh journey we follow Tarkovsky on. The three Andreis (Tarkovsky, Rublev, and the co-writer Andrei Konchalovsky) have created a portrait of a historical artist wrestling with his art in a terrible time. Rublev is portrayed as an almost innocent, dedicated to his art meaning something for him to the fullest extent possible. Reconciling that desire for beauty with the ugliness of the world can also function as a dedication to faith in God, a rather obvious connection when the central character is a literal monk.Andrei Rublev is an obviously deeply personal work on an incredibly grand scale. It's also a fascinating historical anomaly as an individualist finds a way to tell such a personal and religiously spiritual story in the middle of the collectivist oppression that was the Soviet Union. There's a reason Tarkovsky ended up in exile after a certain point.",

            "content": "What Tarkovsky has created here is nothing short of a masterpiece. I consider this to be a truly landmark film. How, exactly, is it landmark? This is the first film that established cinema as an art form. Sure, there were plenty of great films before. However, they were just that: great films. There were great paintings before painting became a pure art, just as there were great songs before music became an art.What is art? Was there ever a more passionately debated question that the meaning of art? Art is nothing that can be defined by words; words are merely symbols, and symbols each represent an individual concrete idea, which make up sentences that best attempt to explain a concrete idea. Anyone who has read George Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR is familiar with this concept. In it, the totalitarian government tries to be, well, a completely totalitarian government. It is so extreme that it even attempts to control the thoughts of humankind by changing the language they speak. This is precisely what language does - it limits ideas. How is this barrier surpassed? Though art, by Jove! Tarkovsky's only major film before this was IVAN'S CHILDHOOD. While an excellent film itself, it was only the precursor to a great filmmaker's oeuvre. The only other Tarkovsky films I've seen are STALKER and THE MIRROR. He has a very distinct, personal style. His films are the closest anybody has gotten to a creating a memory. They are not traditional story lines. This is where the landmark effect comes in. Before Tarkovsky, there were, as I have said, other great films. For example, there was the American CITIZEN KANE. At its time, it was a really revolutionary film, and the closest anything had gotten to being a piece of art. Many scenes from Citizen Kane were nothing short of mesmerizing. However, the film itself was still just a film, albeit excellent. Movies from that time were not yet an independent art form. They were sort of a mixture of other arts for all of the senses. For aural, there was music; painting, sculpture, and photography were feasts to the visual senses; for the mind, literature was created, taking the forms of books and plays. When movies came around, they were a combination of these older delights. Some music scores could stand alone by themselves. The stories told in movies were either adapted from an older play or book, or were written in such a way that they could easily be made into a play or book. The most beautiful films consisted of 24 potential pictures to be placed in a gallery per second. They never really fit together all too well. Sure, in the best films (again, CITIZEN KANE) they seemed at ease with each other, but they were still somewhat detached. Tarkovsky was the genius who changed this. Yes, there are those people who will claim that, \"Oooh, the pretty images were my favorite part,\" or \"I found the choral music to be absolutely delightful.\" That's not the point. Each of the elements of this film is like a brushstroke in a mural or a single violin in a grand orchestra. They all become one to form a new art: cinema. This new cinema can feel like many different things. Some people might get a dream or a pleasant memory from it. This is more the case with Tarkovsky's THE MIRROR. What is found most in ANDREI RUBLEV is a variety of emotions. The ultimate experience is that of finding artistic influence. Rublev, the title character, is never actually shown working on one of his paintings. The audience never even gets a good look at one until the very end. It's more about what made him into an artist. A good way of describing this is that it's a piece of art about art. Rublev's art is icon paintings. There is a young boy whose art is church bells. Tarkovsky, the good religious man, shows that God's art was his beautiful creations like the plants in nature and the animals that roam the land (namely horses). All of this is created by the struggles that every human experiences. We cannot express pain if we have never felt it. We cannot express joy if we have never experienced it. Throughout the film, the audience slowly begins to understand just how complex this idea really is. Tarkovsky has created something of an oneiric beauty himself. He does not limit himself; as he had often tried to stress, there are no symbols in a Tarkovsky film, only images. These images express what symbols cannot. This film reminded me in a way of a story told in Michelangelo Antonioni's THE PASSENGER. In it, there is a blind man who finally is cured. At first, he is in love with what he sees, but after a while, all he notices is all the ugly dirt everywhere, and so he decides to end his life. A Tarkovsky film has the opposite effect. It is so beautiful that we begin to see the whole world as it really is. It is easy to forget the grandeur of old trees or the soothing waves that a breeze of wind creates when it passes a field of grass. ANDREI RUBLEV is a refreshing reminder of these; it has one of the most satisfying conclusions in cinema history. The spiritual people have a god (or several) to thank, while everybody else can just relax and enjoy the beauty that has evolved from nature. It's not very often that a movie changes ones outlook on life.",

But while that movie had the decency of now being very long and having plenty of striking visual imagery to keep me entertained, Andrey Rublev is essentially a slowly paced three hour drama, with no interesting story or characters at all.To really show what I mean by this I want to talk a bit about the last hour. The last hour is basically just a boy, whom we had never seen to this point and know nothing about, building a bell for a local prince. What?!?!The movie never spends time with its characters, not even the title one, so that we can get to know or care about them.

Personally, I can appreciate a reviewer like 'Snoopy' on this board who makes a solid case for why the film is considered a masterpiece, but it's not enough to sway me to change my opinion or see something I might have missed in the first place. The picture and story line are somewhat dense, with little continuity among it's chapters, unless one is forced to make a connection. The one concession I'll make is that director Andrei Tarkovsky did provide an epic overview to his work, but that was more than offset by such indefensible scenes that included a burning cow, a horse falling off a set of stairs, and vicious dogs fighting each other for scraps of food. Maybe it's just something about this particular Russian film maker; I found Tarkovsky's 1979 film \"Stalker\" to be equally tedious and incoherent, the three minute difference in total run time it's only advantage.",

The film is shot in a (sort of)flat,lusterless black & white, with one colour sequence (I won't say what,or where), that looks hypnotic on screen & manages to capture the look of 15th century Russia. The films's pacing is slow (something that Tarkovsky was wont to do in all of the films that I have seen of his), but if you can get past that, a cinematic feast for the eyes is in store. The best news is that a brand spanking new print of the original 205 min. directors cut is now being screened in limited distribution (i.e. it won't play at most mainstream cinemas,so you'll probably have to keep your peepers open when/if it plays at your local art cinema),as it's (mostly in) black & white, and in Russian with subtitles.

Personally I am an enthusiastic lover of period pieces, particularly the ones with the best \"brush strokes\" as i like to call them. This film was hands down one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.Two of my most favorite filmmakers are Stanley Kubrick & Akira Kurosawa. I believe Tarkovsky belongs in the top league with the latter two along with Ingmar Bergman, Orson Welles & Alfred Hitchcock, amongst others. These filmmakers truly capture the artistic side of film-making while providing enough to tantalize our senses (breathtaking imagery, amazing direction, grade A acting, etc) There is too much going on this film for me to review. I will most definitely have to watch it again.

I was tired and the hypnotic quality and languid opening pace of Andrei Rublev put me in a right placid state. I was ready to fall asleep.But.Somewhere around chapter 4, the film just opened up as if the frames around the screen just melted away and I fully and wholly transported into the film, it was the kind of movie magic you only read about and rarely undergo; instead of falling asleep, I woke up into the dream world of Andrei Rublev.I absolutely loved it. There's not a lot I need to say about the film, and its place within Tarkovsky's oeuvre, about his poetry, about the lead actors, the Kurosawa-esque Tartar raid, the incredible segment with the bell, all of this has been written about more elegantly and prosaically than I will be able to do right now.But I will say that when Andrei chose to utter his final words, and the film shifted from black and white to colour, I was almost in tears, sure that I had witnesses something else; the magic of cinema.

            "content": "\"Andrei Rublyov\" may be one of a kind: a true, no-effort-or-expense-spared epic - in rich black-and-white.  But then, Tarkovsky was not inclined to make black-and-white films, or, for that matter, colour ones.  He liked to mix the two.  (I suspect he especially liked to mix them so much that you can't tell which is which - half of \"Stalker\" is a sort-of solarised tinted monochrome; one simply doesn't know what to make of it.)  So this gorgeous film, as true to the black-and-white ethos as they come, concludes with the glowing colours of its subject's icons.  And surprisingly this works.  The film, after all, tells of a brutal age, steeped in poverty and starvation, governed by stupidity and violence.  Rublyov's icons no more belong to that age no more than they do to our own.  The way Tarkovsky visually separates the artworks from the age that produced them, while leaving us in no doubt that no other age could have done so, is breathtaking.  Moreover - this is the true miracle - both the colours and the black-and-white shades reinforce each other, each making the other look lovelier.Even at the successful conclusion, though, I found it hard not to think that Tarkovsky was being obscure for the sake of being obscure.  What on EARTH was that final colour shot of the horses meant to mean?  Surely it was a mistake, whatever it meant - although not a mistake that matters very much, seeing as it follows such an amazing visual crescendo.  The story of the casting of the bell (which feels as though it's the bulk of the film, and leads us into the colour images) is fascinating.  We watch another artwork arise out of the dirt, this time literally so - even as we think, \"All that, for a bell?\", we're impressed.",

            "content": "First of all, let's clear something up now: THE version of this film to watch is the original 205-minute cut. This is one instance when you can't trust the director's own words, and you must instead go with your gut feeling, especially comparing it with the director's other works. Tarkovsky may have gone on record as \"preferring\" the shorter version, but 1) he was still under Soviet support when he made that statement and it would've been politically damaging if he endorsed an uncensored version, and 2) the uncut Andrei Rublev simply feels much more like a Tarkovsky movie. Watch Solaris, Stalker and Sacrifice, then compare the two versions of Andrei Rublev. It becomes very apparent that the 205 minute cut is a true Tarkovsky film, with its meditative pace, long takes, and unflinching view of the world. Tarkovsky, if he had it his way, would never have cut out the jester's arse; he would never have edited out nudity, violence, even the infamous animal cruelty. He wouldn't have broken up the ebb and flow of his long takes. The worst offense of the shorter version is that, in many instances, scenes which were originally one unbroken shot is hacked by editing. The result is that the pacing might seem smoother and swifter, but now it doesn't have that style and feel of a Tarkovsky movie. Because of this contrast, the uncut version seems to contain significantly more long takes, plus a darker perspective, and it makes all the difference. This adds to the cumulative effect and power of the uncut version.Now on to the film itself: in hindsight, this is one of the most ambitious second features in the history of cinema. Ivan's Childhood already had impressive scope for a debut, but a young Tarkovsky followed it up with an abstract, philosophical biopic which created an epic, immersive, gritty depiction of 15th century Russia. Every time I watch this, I'm struck by just how BIG the movie feels, like it easily holds its own against the scope of other epics such as Lawrence of Arabie or The English Patient. Yet it's also uncompromisingly experimental, weird, challenging. We must remember, this period is considered the \"Golden Age\" of Russian cinema, and part of that has to do with the big studios' willingness to throw money at artistic, personal projects such as this.Not much is known of Rublev's real life, so Tarkovsky didn't even attempt to make a factual, standard biopic. Instead he paints a fictional tableau of medieval Russia and places a hypothetical Andrei Rublev character within it. Using this interesting foundation, Tarkovsky paints his own picture of Russian society, politics, existentialism, humanism, and the philosophies of art and creativity. Tarkovsky ponders on the meaning and role of an artist in the face of the bleakness of the real world and the darkness of humanity. He does all this with arresting visuals, grand battle scenes, poetic cinematography, and a very unorthodox script. With one massive sophomore feature, Tarkovsky already proved himself a genius with an incredibly unique perspective and style.",

The vignettes of Russian life are very thought-provoking, the cinematography the best I've seen, and the result is a film that moves me every time I watch it.There's this one bit where the pagans are all naked and you get to see, like, maybe 20 naked women, but they're sort of in the distance so you don't really get a proper look, but if you rewind and pause there's some frames that are pretty good and none of them are all that old or anything so it's pretty awesome. Then there's this bit where some guy is tied up and the leader of the women comes in and she strips off and you can totally see her boobs and theyre really nice and then she wants to make love to the man but he's not into it so she unties him and lets him go.Approach it with an open mind, and be prepared for a slowly unfolding story. Do this, and you'll be deeply rewarded and satisfied in a way that few films will ever match. There are no cliches here, no stereotypes and no sucking up to the audience. A brutally honest and yet very moving, touching and optimistic film. And it is not about the nature of a genius. Rather, it is about a man's ability and duty to preserve and be true to his humanity, his freedom, his soul, his heart and his gift, no matter what century it is or what the circumstances are. Watch it to remind yourself of what it really means to be human.10 Stars.",

Within every single frame is a unique painting by itself. The imagery is simply stunning, capturing every moment, and every emotion of Andrey Rublyov's historically medieval journey filled with existential angst, spiritual depth, pain, love, and a never ending search for the meaning in the lives we live. This film does require extreme patience though, for it is very slow, (three hours long) especially by Hollywood standards, and quite complicated, but is none the less extraordinary and is definitely worth the watch or watches. You can not judge this film by seeing it once, for their is to much depth and understanding and thinking for one individual to take in. It has to be viewed multiple times to get the complete complexity of this unique story. But is so worth the viewings, and is such a rewarding experience. I claim this film to be possibly the greatest cinematic achievement in the history of art.",

THe film is filled with really crude realism, darkness, religiousity that just makes you understand the times the film is set. Note that this kind of dark medievality is similar to the one appearingin the rest of Europe, so it helps picture the 1300s.The Famous iconographer I've never heard of before watching this movie, Andrei Rublev, is a very religious person living in a really dark time. While it doesn't show as much constant brutal violence as for example Schindler's list has, the minimal violence shown is still really shocking and brutal. As I stated above I didn't know much about this iconographer, so I searched, but found really little information about the character, maybe I'll learn something when we get to that form of art in school.I wouldn't say that this movie was \"Beautiful\" or that it had \"great visuals\". It wasn't a movie that gave you positive feelings in the end, because it wasn't meant to. It wasn't a movie with the sort of great visuals Stalker or The Mirror had. But nonetheless, Andrei Rublev is on of my favourite Tarkovskij films, together with the other two aforementioned films.",

            "content": "\"Rus, dear Rus. She can bear everything. Everything. How long will it be like that?\"It's a little astonishing to me that in 1966, at the height of the cold war, space race, and the worldwide hippie movement, Andrei Tarkovsky chose to make a film about a 15th century religious icon painter, even one who is well known and highly regarded in Russia. However, I think it's pretty clear he uses it to reference themes in the present - suppression and violence by those in power, the striving for authenticity in a world of pettiness and cruelty, and only art transcending an existence that is nasty, brutish, and short. True geniuses, those who wish to rise above the masses mired in mud and ignorance, are like that balloon attempt in the prologue, and the film seems to speak to artists and creative freedom in any time. Along with the film's religious content, it's no wonder this film was banned in the Soviet Union for five years.This is a film that seems to be more about the life and times of Andrei Rublev than it does about the man or his artwork itself, because we see so very little of it. There is a level of indirection here though, and one of the points of the film is to show the influences on the artist and the world surrounding him, so that when seeing or recalling his work, you get a deeper appreciation given the context in which it was made. It thus immerses us into the early 15th century, showing us things like the horsemanship of the Tatars, a witch's Sabbath, and a great deal of senseless violence, including slaughter, rape, and the most brutal of tortures. I think it was very successful in doing that, but I found it was not a place I particularly wanted to be for three hours, even if it also gives us lots of lovely details, including the wide open vistas, forests, and the early town of Vladimir. Be forewarned too, that in one scene a horse was intentionally killed during filming, something that was completely unnecessary and Tarkovsky should have been ashamed of himself, regardless of how great a director he was.The film also immerses us into the religion of the day, and as honest as that was to the time period, the concepts of striving for less knowledge and women subordinating themselves to men were not all that interesting or enlightened to me. I loved the scene of the boy digging a pit and trying to pull up a very long tree root, then looking over to the tree it comes from, and Tarkovsky first panning up to show it towering majestically over him, and then giving us a tree's-eye view, looking down on the little humans, as if ants, digging in the dirt below. There is a sense of wonder there, and in him having Rublev question things like painting the Day of Judgement because he doesn't want to frighten people away, but there wasn't enough real introspection, even if, again, it was accurate.Medieval religious art is not very interesting to me, but the greatest exceptions I have ever seen to this are in the Tretyakov in Moscow, Rublev's work included, so I do wish more of that, and his techniques, had been shown. There is very brief glimpse at an icon at the 75 minute point, and then nothing until the very end, when we see beautiful close ups to haunting, ethereal music. There is something lovely to this part, and the images resonate especially as we've just seen three hours of the barbaric world the man was living in (side note, gee, what will our own look like to people 600 years from now, if we're still around?). Still though, I would have preferred more, and interspersed throughout the film.Final quote:\n\"The praise you today and vilify tomorrow. The next day they'll forget why they praised you. They'll forget you and me - everything. Everything is vanity and decay. All follies and vile deeds were committed in the past and men are only repeating them now. If Jesus came again, they would crucify him again.\"",

            "content": "It's sort of a biopic of Andrei Rublev, the icon painter from early 15th century Russia, but focuses more on vignettes of ordinary life in the medieval era. The version I watched was the shorter three-hour film publicly released in France, not the longer 3 1/2 hour version that Soviet authorities forced Tarkovsky to edit.The prologue shows an early attempt to fly a hot air balloon. Some of the imagery is repeated in the eighth vignette.The eight vignettes primarily feature Andrei Rublev (Anatoly Solonitsyn), often with his associate monks or apprentices. The two other monks are Kirill (Ivan Lapikov) and Daniil Chyomy (Nikolai Grinko). Rublev's mentor, Theophanes the Greek (Nikolai Sergeyev), also appears in three vignettes. A jester (Rolan Bykov) appears in the first and last vignettes, and a female holy fool, Durochka (Irma Raush), appears in the last several vignettes.There is no coherent storyline, and the film covers 25 years, beginning in 1400 C. E. It starts with the three monks leaving the Andronikov Monastery and sheltering with some peasants in a storm. Then we meet Theophanes, who invites Rublev to work with him, to the dismay of Kirill and Daniil. Next, there is a discussion between Rublev and Theophanes and glimpses of a Passion Play, followed by an encounter with pagan forest people.We then see Rublev's struggles with the point of his craft, the destruction of much of his work, and his vow of silence after killing a man to protect Durochka.The last and most extended vignette (40 minutes) focuses on the construction of a bell by the son of a bellmaker. Boriska (Nikolai Burlyayev) crucially intersects with Rublev at the end, but this vignette is the most coherent in the film.An epilogue shows some of Rublev's icons in color, though the rest of the film is black and white.There were interesting scenes and a good introduction to Soviet-era cinematography, but I found much of the story disjointed and hard to follow. In truth, I had to watch it twice to get through it. It strikes me as a period piece without long-term merit.",

            "content": "A huge leap in ambition, creativity & execution when compared to his debut feature, Andrei Rublev presents the famous Soviet filmmaker taking on a colossal project in what's his sophomore directorial effort as he charts the life n times of the great icon painter and, through his afflictions, paints an interesting portrait of medieval Russia in order to examine themes of art, religion, freedom, political oppression & personal expression.Co-written & directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, the film employs an episodic structure to chronicle the life of its titular figure, and is told in eight chapters that are bookended by a prologue & an epilogue. The biopic aspect is only utilised as a framework here as Tarkovsky is more interested in dissecting the sociopolitical & religious elements of 15th-century Russia. All the depicted segments nonetheless contribute to Rublev's art & life by challenging his worldview.Adding to the experience is the rich, dreamlike imagery that's photographed in crisp black-n-white and is furthermore elevated by fluid movements & lingering shots. But at 186 mins, all of which unfolds at a glacial pace, this film is going to be a daunting task for some viewers. Anatoli Solonitsyn plays the eponymous iconographer and is brilliant throughout. And although the story is more ruminative in presentation, it holds nothing back when portraying the gruesome acts of war, carnage & cruelty.Overall, Andrei Rublev brings a turbulent time in Russian history to cinematic life in broad brushstrokes, and succeeds in telling a simple story on an expansive canvas. Despite treading through most of the journey with a straight face, in addition to falling asleep in the middle, almost all its events do make sense in retrospect. The film's technical mastery is undeniable yet this is one of those films that I can only admire but not love, for my experience with it wasn't as eye-opening or earth-shattering as it has been for others.",

            "content": "I first saw this film several years ago, and found it very hard going. I definitely appreciated it more upon a second viewing. Tarkovsky's film is like a great piece of literature. This film isn't immediately accessible, like 'Ivan's Childhood', but it is full of hidden meanings which perhaps become clearer upon repeated viewings. Whatever its faults \u2013 it is overlong and at times hard-going, it is a film that lingers in the mind and makes you wonder both about the film-maker's objectives and about the life and work of the icon painter Rublev himself.I liked the idea of the figure of the artist attempting to transcend the human world and to find a higher meaning. As many here have already pointed out, there are parallels between Rublev and Tarkovsky. I particularly enjoyed the scene where Andrei refuses to paint the Last Judgment, a scene designed to intimidate the ignorant mass of peasants into obedience; similarly, Tarkovsky refused to make films which were nothing more than just Marxist propaganda.The film depicts a terrible period of Russian history, but against this violent backdrop, it shows how Rublev created beautiful, transcendental art. As the episode of the casting of the bell shows, great art can emerge from the most desperate of situations. The scene is almost a key to the Russian mentality; one capable of both extreme cruelty & suffering, but also of great faith and compassion.Some of the episodes are oblique; I enjoyed the pagan episode and I think Tarkovsky treats it with a hint of ambiguity; when the girl kisses Rublev, he does momentarily appear tempted. He tells her that people should practice brotherly love not lust. This comment becomes grimly ironic in the following scenes as one Prince betrays his brother in a battle for power. I was enlightened by others' comments here about the contrast between Rublev and his fellow artists. Beside them, he comes across as pure, perhaps rather too much of the saint. I liked the figure of Kirill, an all too human man riven by his jealousy of Rublev and by his own inadequacy; but, he is able to transcend this ego in order to urge Rublev to paint again.",

Well...I think it is second Tarkovsky movie that I've seen, first is Stalker. Stalker is about Soviet Russia yet everything about this movie is abstract that's why it can be appreciated worldwide.Andrey Rublyov on other hand is very Russian film, about Russia and for Russians. That's why they, and people from post-Soviet countries will understand it better than average European or American movie lover.You can see a lot of praise in the comments but also a lot of confusion. And that I'd the reason.The movie shows the essence of Russia. The purest form of Russian mentality. As one of the characters said in the movie (loosely cited): Russia will always suffer because of its own stupidity.And it is very true about 15th century and it is true about 21 century. Times are changing, Russia stays the same. The fool, so called Skomorokh, that was singing anti-governmental songs got imprisoned for 10 years, one of the monks rat him out to the government for his songs. People are cruel to themselves and to each other. Not only Tatars to Russians, but one Russian to another.The movie shows Moscovy in 15th century but the depiction is so very true about any century since then.The movie is important for anyone who wants to understand \"mysterious Russian soul\". There is no mystery, Russian soul is cruel and the movie shows it.Tarkovsky does a lot of long dialogues in his movies. In Stalker the conversations were philosophical, here they are religious. Well most of the characters are clergy, so the themes are obvious. And the dialogues are amazing both on them on and to solidify my point about representing true nature of Russian people.The cinematography is beautiful. The camera shots and movements, the direction... Masterful. The music was unexpected positive discovery to me too.Those 3 hours go through you leaving you hollow yet somehow full. You feel sorrowful, sad, yet you end up to understand things better. Even if you understood the themes of the movie prior to watching it, after doing so, you solidify that notion.The movie is not about painter, his biography, or his best pieces. It is about constant struggle of being a good person in the middle of mayhem that Russia is. Regardless time period or the name of this country.",

So it is wrong to consider the movie as a historic one, it is an allegory of Russian reality what it was, is and will be.I have seen most of Tarkovsky's movies and this is the easiest one to understand.

Andrei's face when the pagan girl swims by him in the river, the confrontation between Andrei and Kirill about Andrei wasting his gift, Andrei reading \"Love is patient, love is kind...\", and of course the full color epilogue, which after viewing misery and desperation for 3 hours seems something of a miracle. This scene puts the viewer in the position of the Russian peasant - living with suffering and destruction, surrounded by bleakness and desperation, black and white... and then to behold an icon - a glimpse of God's beauty and of His love... there are no words.This film is pure beauty.

The film follows the travails of a monk by the name of Andrei Rublev in 16th century Russia. Andrei and his fellow religious practitioners face every kind of trial and tribulation known to man - sexual temptation, war, sorcery, starvation, and corruption. The film ends, after 3 hours of black and white,  in an explosion of color. They are icons, pictures of saints, long outlasting the destructions of sin and despair. The film's last shots are of horses in a field, seen through rain-drenched lens. I don't know what that last shot means, but it's beautiful. The film is suffused with beautiful shot after beautiful shot. Director Tarkovsky was born to make movies (see My Name is Ivan and Stalker). The film also makes no concessions to the viewer; I found that the best way to keep track of what was going on was the follow intently the character of Andre Rublev. Ask what is he doing in that scene, and what is he going through. Overall, a moving, spiritual experience.",

The only island of stability and culture in that ocean of darkness is a Church institution.This movie is a set of episodes from around a life of famous icon painter, a monk Andrey Rublev. Yes, it is not exactly his life stories; these stories about a life of that time, about hideosity, about severity. There is much naturalism in it; but there's no \"too much\" naturalism feeling which leads to a poor style. You understand it while watching: this is the way that it was then, nothing more.It is a masterpiece of photography and scenery. A visual image settles firmly into my memory. It is a genius acting; even a small role of Yuri Nikulin is a diamond between other diamonds. Crowd scenes are really massive. Altogether, there is a complete diving into the atmosphere of the movie.I don't much connected with faith nor religion internally. It's not close to my feelings. But I don't think that the movie is about religious feelings. Also I do not know much about details of that period of time in Russia; but it's not really matters too, methinks. But I consider this movie as a genuine art, and I'm very proud that my homeland is a homeland for a such genius person as film director Andrey Tarkovsky.I heard that Tarkovsky was a kind of fanatic. I heard that for achieving maximum realism he allowed horses to break their legs due a filming process; or even some people accuse him in burning a cow alive during the battle scene of Golden Horde's warriors raid. I do not know how much truth are in that statements, and I wouldn't comment these no more. All I know that his fanaticism was well transformed into a great result which couldn't be achieved by anyone but him.My rate: 10/10",

I still liked it, but thought that it was overrated.But then I couldn't get it out of my head. I kept thinking about the symbolism, the beautiful black and white cinematography, the somber performances, the haunting soundtrack, and the brilliant direction.I realized that to view this film, one must be prepared to watch three and a half emotionally taxing hours of pure, unadulterated genius.

I would say that \"it's more like an experience\", but that seems too trite and meaningless. It's uncanny.I went ahead and gave it a 9 because Tarkovsky did the same thing he did with Stalker with the ending, and that was give away enough information to lessen the ambiguity a bit... Somehow, I was getting hypnotized by the fact that I was watching a movie about an iconographer in which the icons weren't ever being shown... the ending ruined that a bit.But still... Whereas it's easy to say that this movie is about faith, or devotion, contemplation, or existential dread, or anything like that, it didn't even FEEL that way. When Andrei Rublev is on screen, it feels very self aware and confined. Time stretches out, everything feels over emphasized and weighted. When Rublev isn't on screen, it feels detached, dreamlike, even sometimes absurd. Movements feel light, like clouds, and even warfare and orgies (especially with the score playing) feel like you've been hit by some weird detachment from reality... and it becomes more graceful and gorgeous for it. It all culminates in a weirdly introspective experience... this may be the one film where the movie is more about what you feel while watching it than it is about the character or the director.That said, there's a lot to say about the comparisons between Andrei the director and Andrei the character. The conversations about craft, form, meaning, feeling, faith, and power all seem to apply both to director to character; a lot of the tasks met feel like parables for the film industry, like for instance the conversation about \"I've washed paintbrushes for three years... I must build my way up\"; even similar things happen, like the fact that both Andrei's had their work burned up a structural fire. I'm not entirely sure those comparisons are intentional (and the burned work definitely wasn't, as Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker was burned AFTER Andrei Rublev came out), but still, the original title was, \"The Passion According to Andrei\". Some ambiguity was intended, for sure.--PolarisDiB",

What is known is that he lived in 15th-century Russia and that he is considered to be the greatest Russian iconographer. I think I can start already from here by telling that the movie Andrey Rublyov is (among other things) the story about artist and his position in the world, pictured through the regime of the middle-age Russia in this particular case but the story has universal character.You can be very famous (Rublyov surely is!) but yet history might not know anything about you. An artist is often (so to say) a product of his/her time because no one is isolated from the historical events in one way or another. This movie (to quote Tarkovsky) will tell you of the impossibility of creating art outside of the nation's aspirations, of the artist's attempts to express its soul and character, and of the way that an artist's character depends upon his historical situation. As an artist, I was deeply moved by this movie. There is also some hardness that lasts long after the movie ended\u0085 Although the movie is named by Andrey Rublyov, he appears to be just one of the characters, often passive as he is merely observing the situation but deeply affected by the events.All main characters are different and interesting. All of them have their own tales, personal philosophy and approach to art and events. For example, Theophanes the Greek is already an established iconographer, old enough to live without illusions. For him, art is but a craft. I liked some of his lines very much, like when he said: Yes, I'm going to die. The other day, I saw an angel in my dream. \"Come with me,\" he says. And I answer: \"I'm going to die soon anyway, without your help.\" Or when he said (referring to people): Today they praise, tomorrow they'll abuse what they praised only yesterday, and after that they'll forget both you and me. They'll forget everything! The script is written by Andrei Konchalovsky and Tarkovsky. The particular historical background is not bright but has history ever been?! Religion and the regime are in the center of the story but there is much more than that.The entire movie is black and white except the very end, where we can see the actual Rublyov's iconography and that almost gives a sense of the miracle.The movie won three awards. Not enough I would say! Tarkovsky's cinematography is simply beautiful! I think this is a must see movie.",

            "content": "Madiana RyskulovaThis movie illustrates how Andrei Rublev gets through challenging times in medieval Russia and, more importantly, overcomes his own psychological dilemma. Still, it is not just an autobiography of an artist, but it is an art itself. It shows the complex relationship between religion and art, their intertwining, and at the same time, the distinctive features that make art to be of a religious kind. In my review, I am going to argue that iconodulism as a religious art aims not only to strengthen and glorify one's faith, but also to test the artist about their own faith that should serve as a main motivation for creating their work of art.There are several reasons that could serve as one's motivation to be a religious artist. For one, as for Kirill, it can be the recognition in a society. The main character Andrei with his fellow monks, Kirill and Daniil, from Andronikov Monastery were wandering in search of some work as icon painters, but only Andrei received an offer from Theophanes the Greek. That was a critical moment to test Kirill's intentions for this position. Although he was first invited by Theophanes, he asked him to do it again in an official form in front of all his fraternity, which he probably did for the sake of fame. It was confirmed by his emotions like anger and envy about Andrei's success, and his spontaneous decision to quit the monastery accompanied by slandering it. \"The monastery has become like a bazaar!\" - he yelled. When he violently killed the dog that wanted to go with him, it could also be an ill omen of a future disaster. For other people, as for Foma, Andrei's apprentice, painting icons is a production of art as a practical job. Every work connected with religious art was only another opportunity to improve his painting in the first place, so he was not really concerned with spiritual aspect of icons. That is why he readily agreed to work in another church of a smaller status. For those people, who are attached to both church and art, as Andrei, religious art has a deeper meaning than simply something people can honor in church. A true religious work of art cannot be done by instructions on the main theme, style, and deadline from above, that is why Andrei did not want to paint the Last Judgement. The situation was only aggravated when he knewabout the violent act ordered by the Grand Prince towards the rest of his party that refused to follow his instructions. Only artist's own ideas and experience (in that case, the appearance of a Yurodivy girl) can help them to develop a better work, that apparently was a feast instead of the Last Judgement.Even though we could see how sincere motivation behind Andrei's religious art was, there were many cases that could utterly destroy someone's faith, but not Andrei's one. In the second episode of the film, when he was talking to Theophanes, we can observe how truly he believed in humanity and goodness of human beings. In contrast, Theophanes was very cynical about human beings' true nature, because they allowed Jesus Christ to be crucified and Judas was able to betray him, so \"evil is all around.\" During his life, Andrei had to face situations that were challenging his faith. For example, the cruel order of the Grand Prince when he raged against innocent stone carvers, or persecutions of pagans. The most difficult time for Andrei's faith was during Tatars' invasion. Firstly, the invasion was not just Tatars' war against Russians, but it was a conflict between Russian and Russian as brothers, because the Grand Prince's own brother helped Tatars. Before the invasion, Andrei told Theophanes that people have to be reminded that they are people, they are Russians and they share one blood and one land. In the fifth episode, however, this belief could be easily broken by the brother's betrayal, which reminds us the act of Judas. Secondly, the invasion itself was very savage, because Tatars were killing everyone and demolishing the entire city. Even praying of the rest of the Vladimir residents in the temple did not help, Tatars were able to beat out its doors and kill the prayers. Andrei was witnessing how the icons he just finished painting were being destroyed, and, of course, it was painful for him to question if people really need the icons. Thirdly, he had to act against his principles of not to kill in order to save the life of the Yurodivy girl. He finally decided to stop painting and take a vow of silence. In my opinion, it was not just to atone for killing, but since he was very disappointed about people: \"I have nothing to talk about with people.\"The final scene is probably the most intriguing part of the movie, because it connects all the seven episodes and helps us eventually to build the whole picture in our mind. The success of a boy, Boriska, who never had any idea of how to cast a bell, finally returns Rublev faith in people, because he could witness people's happiness when the bell ringed. Yes, there are hardships everywhere, but as long as there is a meaning in religious acts for people, Andrei is motivated to resume his art. Ability of Boriska, who was also full of doubts about his craft, to bring happiness to people turns to be a sign for Andrei. The moment of Andrei giving a hug to Boriska and supporting him is so powerful that it can pass on this enormous power to viewers.Briefly commenting on the cinematography, I should note the small budget allocated to the film that did not make it any worse. I am surprised how the filmmakers could animate the picture the way Hollywood movies with much greater budget and advanced technology rarely can. We could hear the true sounds of nature (fire, birds), and see its beauty (animals, woods) through black and white filming. This movie has a soul that we can feel through its atmosphere, emotions, honest acting that required many efforts, and thought-provoking, very interesting dialogs that involve philosophical and religious doubts.I would like to conclude my review with the citation of the movie's director Tarkovsky: \"Whether one wishes to fly before it has become possible, or cast a bell without having learned how to do it, or paint an icon - all these acts demand that, for the price of his creation, man should die, dissolve himself in his work, give himself entirely.\" In the case of Andrei Rublev, the test of his faith only reinforced it and, therefore, contributed to his later work.",

Well, it was good but still flawed.One of the main problems of this film is pacing and editing. Yes, it is a bit too slow, not that it made it unwatchable, but simply because very slow is not always the best way to go. Sometimes a bit faster can help it. I mean, if they had edited out a bit 15 minutes of fat from this 205 minute film it would have been more powerful. Yes, the ending is very powerful, but not as powerful as I was expecting.Overall a very good film and everybody that calls himself or herself a film buff should see it, but don't expect that it is \"the greatest film ever\", it is \"only\" a great but flawed historical film.

His Stalker is the highest form of art I can think of, but that's not to say I have to love all his films. Andrei Rublev undoubtedly carries a very specific feeling along with it. The monologue of the old monk was very touching, the confusion of Russians as the Tatars entered was shown greatly through the perspective of their art as if, and the collapse of young Boris, whose father died a bit too early.One thing I did not like about Andrei Rublev was its lack of organization. There were chapters, sure, but sometimes I failed to feel the dynamic of the film. While with Stalker, for example, I was on an emotional journey along with the characters, Andrei Rublev did not manage to accomplish this because I don't think the length proved itself necessary. I would gladly cut a chapter or two.One thing I loved about this film was the texture of it. The mud that Boris touches made me feel a certain way, the feet of the people being sunk in the dirt... all this imagery felt like a painting at times.I could also see Kurosawa in this film, especially his Ran, with all the horses running and \"big budget\" shoot.

Otherwise, \"Andrey Rublyov\" was quite a chore to sit through. The viewer really needs to have some interest in the Byzantine to appreciate it. And that part of human history prior to about the sixteenth century has never appealed to me.I found it impossible to get interested in any of the characters or their dramas, so remote from us in time. Characters mouth little pearls of wisdom, like: \"It's never too late to repent\", and \"Learn to do good, seek justice, rebuke the oppressor, defend the fatherless, plead for the widow\", and \"Humanity has already committed every stupidity and baseness, and now it only repeats them\". Characters walk in heavy snow. And it rains a lot. The film's overall tone is medieval and somber.The protagonist, Rublyov, a Russian painter, is only intermittently present in the various episodes. As a result, the narrative seems disjointed and fragmented. Evidently, a major theme is that trying to pass along one's experience to others, or to learn from others, is next to impossible. I have no idea on what grounds this apparent theme is based.The B&W visuals are presented in wide screen format. That, together with lots of panoramic shots of Russian landscape, suggests an epic, though the film's episodic structure belies an epic story. I suppose the film is less about Rublyov than about Russian culture prior to the sixteenth century, with its anti-intellectual and highly religious predilections.I don't wish to pass judgment on this film as a result of my lack of interest in the subject matter. My only judgment pertains to the film's run time. The version I watched exceeded three hours.

            "content": "Tarkovskii's second and yet the most controversial movie in the history of Soviet cinematography \"Andrei Rublev\" defies the concepts of the historical and religious views of medieval Rus through the perception of the main hero. Religious icon-painter Andrei Rublev, the author of the world widely known \"Trinity\", who is full of the energy and talent goes through the series of compelling and crucial events in the beginning of XV century presented via the film- narration genre. Every scene of the movie is filled with religious context the summary of each aims to question the spiritual perception of the sacrifice of Russian folks via the deep tragical symbols through Rublev's eyes and his reaction. For a person emotionally not ready to see the pure cruelness and extreme violence the movie challenges to have hard and tough thoughts. The understanding of the truthfulness of the events puts an additional pressure in sensitive aspect for the audience. However, historically, in the 15th century Russian empire was precisely described and there is no other honest way to show this. Firstly, after the change of the authorities there was a civil strife that lead to the point when people were constantly under the pressure and constant stress. Secondly, the attacks of Tatar troops played a vital role to the formation of the atmosphere among Russian people that time. The film consists of eight parts where the audience is able to see the different situations and outcomes that reflect the entire picture about the religious sphere of Russians as well as the poor structure of the society. The first part shows the disgusting ways in which people betray each other, particularly the scene where someone inform about the buffoon. It covers the aspects of how people can be afraid and evil at the same time and is without a doubt that the cruelness and violence presented at this period of time terrifies. For a young student who is not fully prepared to the ugly truth of the movie, the most scaring scene is presented in the celebration of Ivan Kupala which actually was indigenous. There is not only the imperator or his army that are presented unfair, but the way people were persecuted and the high level of horribleness of the escape ways. At that moment Rublev feels in such a deep level that he isn't even able express it through words. The scene where people were deprived the eyesight illustrates that creative people did not have right to perceive this world and express it the way they wanted to because of the strictness and pressure of the powers. The scene of massacre of people is truly shocking, the icons are on fire, and that empties Rublev's heart and soul leaving him with the disappointment in faith and everything that mattered to him before. That difficult and hurtful way was an apogee of the Rublev's moral devastation. Despite the fact that he had his mentor Feofan, who sincerely tries to support Rublev and encourages him for writing icons, Rublev is very weak and has nothing more to say, that leads him to give a vow of silence. \n Besides the brilliant influence on the emotions of the audience it is significant to say more about the work itself. The moment that is quite remarkable is that the actor Anatoliy Salonicin who was playing the character, indeed was silent for four months in order to have an appopriate voice like a person who didn't speak for a long time. The sound effects in the movie is also a masterpiece as even such a little and seamlessly non-important details such as the fire noises are easily followed to listen. The cinematography of the nature is stunningly presented as another alive character that has its own purpose in the movie as it makes it more realistic and helps to feel the atmosphere in a deeper level. Even though the movie is criticized over and over again for misrepresentation of the light side of the religion and distortion of it to the ugly violence, the idea that director is forming through eight parts by the end of the film is quite beautiful. The path that takes every worried mind that comes with going through the difficulties and the high possibility to lose faith during the darkest hours are common problems for any religious or non-religious person searching for the meaning of life. However, the movie succeeds in giving the deep understanding of how hard it is - to believe and keep the faith, but what is the most brilliant is that Tarkovskii's clearly presents that it worth it. The final episode of Andrei Rublev's breaking the silence and returning to the art represent the great themes of fighting for the peace and the willingness to change and find the hope and inspiration and finally coming out to the light after a hard straying. Andrey Tarkovskii ingeniously creates a difficult metaphorical microcosm of the interconnectedness of human nature, sacrifice and the relativeness of the religion to the set of the events that a man can go through one's spiritual way of finding the truth.",

Apparently all Russian novels show this when compared to the quick and explicit writing in the West. If you don't take this fact to heart Ivan Rublev will just be tedious and boring.This is the story of an artist, a painter of icons, and you will see the original icons in all their glory at the end of the film in a full color coda to the story. The artist lives in Russia, which is a vast, often swampy, land with bitter weather. The people, in this film, are clustered in islands of human society where people seem to have made a stand against the land and the weather. Between these islands there is very little and you can see what I mean in the second sequence of the film in which an obviously drafty barn serves as a shelter for dozens of peasants, monks, and entertainers. Outside there is nothing much until a handful of soldiers shows up to drag away one of the entertainers for no obvious reason, disappearing again into the winter pausing only to smash the jester's psaltery.We then meet and actually start to get to know the protagonist, Rublev in the third sequence, some twenty minutes into the story. We meet him at a monastery, which is another island in the landscape. At this monastery we also meet a Greek painter of icons who is also ah historical figure who will show up with his paintings on a Google search. At this point the story settles down and begins to unfold over the next three hours.Toward the end the film becomes a project film about the casting of a great bell, not in a factory but in the open with the work taking place with make shift equipment and a terrified overseer. He is afraid because, as is made perfectly clear in the film, he really knows very little about bell making and bragged his way into the job claiming to have inherited secrets from his father. The film ends with one of those long tracking shots for which Tarkovsky is justly famous.One might mention parenthetically that it appears that Tarkovsky's reputation for tracking shots made such shots a part of Russian films and culminated in a film called The Russian Ark, which is one long uninterrupted tracking (and wandering) shot of the Hermitage museum in Saint Petersburg (Leningrad) where we have a tale woven of the palace and the residents as seen by an unidentified time traveler.At the end the screen floods with color and the icons themselves appear, not as a part of the story so much as an instructive historical footnote. The rest of the film is in black and white with, it seems to me, a sort of film noir approach to fifteenth century Russia.",

            "content": "This is the second of Tarkovsky's films that I've seen, and on first viewing I can detect deep and very individual stylistic similarities with \"Stalker.\" But \"Andrey Rublev\" is a still broader and deeper film, and I can also tell on first viewing that I will want to watch it again, and that the opportunity to do so will uncover worlds more. In fact, this is a difficult comment to write because it seems like any attempt to encapsulate the experience of this film in less that it's slow, still, and sometimes turbulent full length would be in vain. This is ostensibly a film about the medieval Russian painter Andrey Rublev, but Tarkovsky has taken the opportunity to make it a film that is really simultaneously a stunningly full portrait of the both loft and low Russia of his day, and a meditation on the nature of power, art, and religious faith.It moves at a deliberately very slow pace, but in every long, still shot where life is allowed to play out without the boundaries imposed by quick cuts, something subtly and revealingly fascinating goes on. We follow a half-nonsense peasant dance, for example, for longer than we would ever expect in a film, and that length is at once uncomfortable an very revealing. It's beautifully photographed, and must have had lavish resources behind its simple-looking recreation of a rural Russia of centuries ago. It's easy to see why the Soviet government was divided and eventually changed its mind on the release of such a beautiful film, honoring a national hero, but showing Christianity favorably in contrast to the invaders and questioning art's subservience to authority. I know I'll be rewarded again by letting the scope of this film wash over me, and letting the various elements making up the conversations on its thematic elements work against each other in my mind in new ways each time. In that way, it is, though much more laconic, reminiscent as some have observed of Dostoevsky.",

It does not yet contain the subtelty and \"glowness\" of tarkovsky's later films (Mirror. Nostalghia) but it contains memorable visuals, with Tarkovsky's infamous slow pace already intact.If you do not like to think while (or after) watching films, you will not like this film (or any of Tarkovsky's films for that matter). In other words it is not Hollywood, nor action, etc. though it does have violence.Plot Synopsis: An infamous Russian Icon painter (true character) is invited to paint a cathedral for one of Russia's \"knyazs\" (lord). As Rublyov and his companions travle through war ridden medieval Russia, his faith in God and the goodness of men deteriorates. He witmesses murder, war, rape, tortue etc. In one of the most disturbing scenes, the Lord for whom Rublyov is working has some stone cutters do a job on the same cathedral. They finish the job and decide to move to the Lord's brother, to carve the cathedral for him, remarking that the brother has even a better type of stone (cathedral walls). As the Lord overhears that he sends out his men to blind the stone carvers so that they cannot do the same service for his brother, with whom he has rivarly over control of Russia. The blinding of the carvers in the forest is one of the most horrifying film episodes I saw. The cinematogrpahy, in black and white with some colour at the end, is stunning. The acting is slightly theatrical, with some Kurosawa influence notable. Pay attention to the expressive music. Highly advisable for film lovers and thinking men. Vlad",

            "content": "An epic that succeeds in all of its three hours (I say this because several versions exist), Tarkovsky's preferred vision stands as one of the greatest Russian movies ever made. Because only little is known of Andrei Rublev's life, a heavier focus is made on the hardships and violence of medieval Russia. In doing so the film can approach themes such as artistic freedom, religion and (Ironically) repressive authority (As the film was banned in the Soviet Union, until a few years later when they released a censored version).Though it strangely begins with an unexpected hot air balloon ride, surprisingly in these few short minutes the film has featured many of the themes that will be present throughout the picture, such as life and creative hopes dashed. Religious icon painter Andrei Rublev (Anatoly Solonitsyn, in the first of many Tarkovsky productions), and other wandering monks seek work as they travel across the fields and treacherous landscapes of 15th century Russia. Ever the observer, Rublev is forced to hear the arrogance and shortcomings of his companions, as well as the locals whose lifestyles can be seen as sinful to others, and will eventually fall to the wrath of Prince's and Tartars. It's a long narrative where more hopes are crushed than realised, but ultimately depicts the violence and hardships of the time effortlessly.I've come to respect that the film's focus switches from Rublev and his surroundings, as the cinematography and shots that Andrei Tarkovsky and Vadim Yusov employ just blend the multiple narratives seamlessly. As for music I can only really remember the last 6 or so minutes of the film, but the hundreds of extra's, set pieces and moments I don't want to spoil has its own kind of musical rhythm. The recurring themes are ever present, and the early moments of Tarkovsky's references to classic paintings start here (Such as \"A detail of The Hunters in the Snow\" (1565) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, though it features much more prominently in \"Solaris\", 1972). Of course there is the small amount of infamous animal abuse of a cow and a horse, but I also sternly believe that it was kept to a minimum and handled very well given that the cow was covered in asbestos, and the horse was heading to the slaughterhouse regardless (Trust me, it really isn't all that terrible considering some other movies).Final Verdict: Actions speak louder than words in \"Andrei Rublev\". Whilst not deeply ambiguous, it certainly fulfils an artistic purpose that never comes off as arrogant. It is as epic and grand as the paintings themselves, and whilst not my favourite of his works it could most definitely be Tarkovsky's masterpiece. 9/10.",

            "content": "What becomes most apparent during the watching of 'Andrei Rublev', is that director Andrei Tarkovsky seems to be in love with himself. Rarely have i seen such pretentiousness and pseudo intellectuality in a major motion picture, but Andrei Rublev is definitely up there as one of the highest in that regard.As usual in a Tarkovsky film, there is no conventional narrative in Andrei Rublev, thus making sure it is not personally accessible in any way. The film starts with a guy escaping in a hot air balloon while being chased by an angry mob of people. What does this scene mean? Nobody knows. But we can't understand it, so it must be art, right?? I reckon this is how many of these pretentious fanboys of this film view this matter. What Tarkovsky is doing in this entire film does not require any kind of imagination or creativity. He loosely creates short stories which have no cohesive connection with eachother, and he implements a lot of random dialogue or events that make it seem like it is actually a very clever film, while in reality it is devoid of all substance. A film that is not decipherable does not automatically make it 'art'. It just makes it meaningless, devoid of life & empty. Of course, all Tarkovsky films have this narcissistic kind of pretentiousness ( Even a good movie like Solaris ), but it is in this case painfully obvious that is is purely there to cover up the creative and emotional emptiness that this motion picture is full off.Having seen the full 205 minute version of Andrei Rublev, it also became quite clear that there were numerous scenes and shots that simply held no value at all. The intro as stated before is an example, but there was also a shot of a horse tripping ( Which made no sense whatsoever ), the actual stabbing of an actual horse during one of the Tartar invasion scenes ( Which also made no sense ), and the fact that the final hour of the film suddenly brings forth a character nobody has seen before building a bell ( Again, there is very little structure at work here ). It is true that some of the shots during this final hour are phenomenally choreographed and created, also featuring a lot of dynamic crane camera movements which truly do make me wonder about how that was shot, but again, in substance, it is lacking severely. Not to mention the weird 15 minute outro by showing colorized iconographs. There's no doubt that pseudo intellectuals and self proclaimed 'film buffs' will find some hidden meaning there, but there really isn't any.Tarkovsky uses a lot of biblical quotations and uninspired pseudo intelligent dialogue to make sure people are fooled into thinking this empty lifeless exercise in his narcissistic nature can be considered 'art'. With people today claiming that everything can be art according to the person in question, this is something that's not very hard to do. The truth is, not everything can be art, and Andrei Rublev is one of them, as it is the equivalent to a modern painting with 2 lines on it being called 'innovative', 'daring' & 'genius'. Both have no meaning.Even though Tarkovsky is not necessarily a bad director, it's obvious that his self indulgent and narcissistic nature got the better of him for most of his films, thus creating 'Andrei Rublev', a pure exercise in subjective self-indulgence and wannabe art, which holds no actual value in quality apart from some technical brilliances.",

If you find their reasons compelling, then nothing I say should stop you from seeing it. It's a tour de force of film-making. But I will present another viewpoint. ;-) I found both the photography and the development to be excessively murky. Grand scenery at times but you can't see much. (This is watching the DVD on a high-resolution computer monitor. I also saw it in a theater in 1984 and had the same impression.) Apparently to figure out how the parts fit together, you need to delve into Tarkovsky's philosophy of art, and pick up a lot of symbolism, and it helps to have much more than the average American's knowledge of medieval Russia.I don't mind that it's slow, or that it has no clear plot line. Slow? One of my favorite movies is Stranger Than Paradise. I just watched Once Upon A Time In The West, which is almost as long as Andrei Rublev and even slower (and made within a couple of years of AR). AR depends greatly on symbolism, which it seems to substitute for facial expression. Facial expression is almost totally lacking, especially in extended facial shots; I find extended shots of several expressionless faces to be more than a little on the pretentious side. OUATITW also uses extended shots of faces, but the faces reveal their characters through the expressions. OUATITW builds a story with facial expression; AR builds a story with symbols represented by people. The latter fits very well with icon painting and so is another symbol in itself -- a good example of how the film builds on symbolism.(********* minor spoiler follows -- description of the end of the film *********).So if a lot of symbolism appeals to you and you enjoy working out symbolism in a movie, and no realistic human characters or facial expression and a lot of medieval war violence don't bother you, then by all means see Andrei Rublev. Otherwise watch the last 15 minutes or so, the color part, which is a stupendous presentation of one of Rublev's most famous frescoes.",

            "review_title": "A Cinematographic Legend",
            "content": "Andrey Rublev is considered to be the greatest work of Andrey Tarkovsky. Just like with his older films like Ivan's Childhood and the Steamroller, Tarkovsky really managed to demonstrate his expertise in the field of cinematography. However, what was so unique about this film in particular - it touched on a completely different time period and on completely different themes. Because of this, the film had to undergo various \"cut-downs\" in which many of the scenes that did not fit the societal norms and beliefs of the time period had to be cut out. Fortunately, today we have the full length version of the film and are able to not only appreciate its beauty and its grandiosity as a piece of art, but also its influence as a political and religious work.Nevertheless, the cinematographics are a very important element of the film and I would like to pay extra attention to them. First of all - the mass action scenes of grand landscapes. Despite the technical possibilities of the time when the film was created, it managed to do a phenomenal job of creating the \"epic\" that it is meant to be. The object-following camera shots and the depth of focus elements that began to gain popularity only closer to the end of the twentieth century, already were present in Tarkovsky's films. Luckily for us, the film was reconstructed and renovated for the modern audience, and we have a much cleaner quality; but even so - it was tremendous work, and it is impressive for that time period.\nWhilst on the topic of aesthetics, it is important to highlight the costumes and the landscapes of the film. All that was not created by technology was created in real life, by people. Every detail of the dresses of the tartars and the monk is astonishing; the landscapes really do reflect the Russia of the 15th century and I, honestly, cannot even imagine how hard it must have been to transform various settings into the appropriate time period.\nOne thing that I do not necessarily love about the movie, on the other hand, is the casting. Yuriy Nikulin, for example, is a very popular comedy actor of the time period, and many of his \"techniques\" were transferred into this genre too. It was a little hard seeing him in the new role and not carrying his previous characters with him into this movie. I sincerely believe that the Soviet acting school is one of the best ones to ever exist, but even so - the acting in this film, as I would consider, is mediocre. Perhaps, it is because the movie is considered \"epic\" many of the emotions are over-exaggerated, but at some points in the film it gets absurd, and it is very hard for this reason to be fully immersed. However, I do not think that this is a severe disadvantage and that it takes away anything from the power of the movie.Themes wise - the movie works in a great manner. It tells a personal story of an icon-drawer; and it is exactly this individual story that reflects the greater picture of the time. It tells the story of what happened in Russia during the Mongol-Tartar invasion and it shows how they affected religion. It shows how a political instability can shake up not only the national identity of the citizens, but also the religious and the personal. Throughout the whole film, Rublev contemplates his actions and his morals - he tries to find an answer to what is right and wrong for him, and symbolically enough, comes to find the key in his belief. It reflects the radical emphasis on religion of the time period, and it shows how the Orthodox Church was influenced, and at some points even had to co-exist with Paganism. It shows the values of the Christians and their strict approach towards the rules and what is socially accepted. It shows the importance of nature and the importance of spirit. The film does a great job of reflecting the true values of the 15 century Russia.\nSymbolism in the movie also plays an important role. From what an untrained eye can see - the fire and the water were the obvious metaphor to the dichotomy of life and death. The suffering animals, especially birds, I believe symbolized the broken wings of Russia and the suffering that the nation was undergoing. Despite being very progressive for its time period, the cinema school still did not adapt the naturalizing of the symbols, and for this reason, whenever the viewer needed to \"understand\" a symbol - a close-up shot was drawn to the object. Despite seeming a little unprofessional and superficial in today's cinema, I think that this is a great element, because it helps the modern audience understand this hard-to-interpret film a little better.I will not lie if I say that at moments the film was a little overwhelming. When there were cries, screams and chants, when there was blood and fighting, I had to look away from the screen for a couple of moments or close my eyes. It is very overpowering in terms of senses. However, despite seeming as \"a little too much\" for some people, I think that it is exactly this which makes the films one of the greatest works of that time. It is definitely a must watch, and perhaps, a must re-watch, because to be honest, I highly doubt that a person can understand even 50% of the film by watching it just once.",

It is a historical drama about Medieval Christianity in Russia between 1400 and 1423 which was screened in 1966. The dark and grey setting suggests about historical instability and hostility such as Mongol-Tatar raids and the princely internecine which play a role of background. The scope of the film, decorations and shooting quality is impressive as well as the fact that the film covers a large number of people and different settings. The decision to make a film about Medieval Russia and a research that has been made to depict mentality of people also suggests about a huge work that has been done. The plot of the film starts when three monks Andrei, Danila and Kirill enter the house full of peasants in order to wait the end of rain. Their attention is drawn by skomorokh who entertains them. This is the moment when the historical conflict between secular and church cultures opens up where the secular power personified by a skomorokh and the villagers practicing paganism, and Medieval Christian culture represented by monks and painters of Orthodox icons. Historically icons were considered as the tools for idolatry and icon painters religious belief were questioned because of which a group of people began to be engaged in iconoclasm. Even though there were who were convinced that iconography led to idolatry, this paper will argue that the evolution and changing image of Andrei Rublev shows that his faith in God and in purity did not worsen as he evolved as an icon painter.\nRublev's purity can be argued because of him spending time with woman during paganist holiday. The organizers of the holiday caught Andrei while he became curious about mythical atmosphere and lights around the river. The paganist woman saves him, makes him free and they left alone for a while which suggests about intimacy happened between them. It can be assumed from monk Danila's phrase \"Your sin.Your conscience. Your prayers.\" It is not the only case that can be considered as sin of Rublev, another one is him killing the rapist of holy fool girl (yurodivaya) when tatars destroying the church along with his paintings. This is the moment when the viewer could start to question Rublev's purity as monk and realize that he begins to drown in sins. However, he says to Theophanes the Greek that \"God is merciful, he will forgive. I will give the Lord a vow of silence\", which suggests about the presence of his faith in one God. All of these can be considered as challenge through which Rublev had to go in order to strengthen his religious belief but not as the argument to question his religious belief.\nIt is quite wrong to judge him in a negative way, because Andrei Rublev's image as a person with pure intentions can be seen from his meeting with Theophanes the Greek. He gets a message from the Great Prince that he is invited to Moscow with Theophanes the Greek for painting the Church of the Holy Annunciation. Rublev accepts the invitation and goes to Moscow with his assistant Foma and they meet Theophanes the Greek in the strange circumstances, in the forest. From their conversation, it can be seen that Andrei is ready to sacrifice his life as Jesus Christ for the sake of people. While, Theophanes thinks that people do anything because of fear, everybody does it for oneself. Andrei makes arguments against him by saying that \"It is important to believe in people, as Christ did\", because he gave up his life in order to make people to be aware of unfair treatment of Jesus Christ. He innocently believes that people are not that bad as Theophanes thinks of them. Rublev claims that even though people betrayed Jesus Christ, they repented later because they understood their fault. He concludes that \"People endured everything, and they deserved forgiveness from the Almighty.\" It shows the innocent and pure nature of Rublev and his belief in true religion, in one God by the will of which Jesus Christ was crucified.\nThe film also does not show any facts to question Rublev's monotheistic belief, contrary he was the figure who worked to enhance Christianity. For monks and idol painters as Andrei and Danila, the veneration of honor for icons was expressed towards people and events which were depicted not for the icons themselves. Similarly, icon-defender St. John Damascus in 7-8th centuries explained that \"I do not worship matter...Never will I cease honoring the matter which wrought my salvation! I honor it, but not as God. ... Do not despise matter, for it is not despicable. God has made nothing despicable\" (lecture). It shows that iconography was used to made sacred works of art to inspire people and connect them with the spiritual world but not to practice polytheism.\nThe iconography was used not only for cathedrals but also to paint separate icons. One of them is the icon Trinity which can be also used to doubt Rublev's monotheistic belief. It is important to include Holy Trinity Icon which was shown in the end of the film because it is related to one God's presence in three persons depicted by three angels. There are different interpretations of the icon, but it can be referred to the Patriarch Timothy of Baghdad's explanation of trinity in connection with God. He said that the plural form is used as a mark of Divine power and majesty and they speak of one God in terms of trinity (Apology of Patriarch Timothy of Baghdad before the Caliph Mahdi, p.235). Similar interpretation of icons would be used by Rublev because his icons were not used for idolatry based on the film, on the contrary villagers who practiced paganism and whose faith could be judged were the ones who destroyed the icons. It means that iconoclasm in the film could not be justified and iconography of Rublev did not mean to promote polytheism.\nIn conclusion, the given analysis of the film Andrei Rublev shows that him being icon painter does not mean that his faith in one God is questionable. Even though Rublev made sinful actions, he continued to believe in God and worked in himself by having vow of silence in order to be forgiven by God. It means that iconoclasm in 14-15th century Eastern orthodoxy could be criticized because of lack of basis to persecute icon painters.\nReferences:\nApology of Patriarch Timothy of Baghdad before the Caliph Mahdi.

            "review_title": "A true masterpiece",
            "content": "The movie Andrey Rublev is considered as one of the most impressive movies in Russian cinematography. Taking into account that in 1960s the technology in the sphere of cinematography was not advanced, Andrei Tarakovsky could create the real image of Russia in 15th century with its decorations, clothes and emotions of really suffering people. The movie covers different heartbreaking themes and really challenges the emotions of people, because it is impossible to see the cruelty, violence, rape, assault, torture, treachery and treason without any empathy. The movie is not only about the life of one of greatest medieval painters of icons, but also about the formation of Russian nation and its religious belief to the God.\nI was truly impressed by three moments in the movie. First one, even if I have watched movie few days ago, I still can not forget the smirk and mockery of Tatar's leader. The smile in his face appeared after his understanding that the brother of Vasliyi did not just show them the road to the city, but also was ready to kill and rape his own nation to achieve the power. The smirk illustrates the treason of Vasiliyi's brother and the victory of Tatars not only in the city of Vladimir, but also in most parts of the Russia, because the city Vladimir opens the direct road to Moscow, which, in my opinion, was the real aim of Tatars. This moment shows the political and military situation of Russian nation of that time. The second moment that I liked in the movie was when Andrey sits in the middle of corpses and tries to understand everything that happened. He looks to his own work that was destroyed by the soldiers of mix troops. He looks to the Cathedral from inside and can not understand why human beings committed such cruelty in such religious place under his frescos. For the person, who find his purpose of life to serve God and all people in the world, it was difficult to accept the reality. However, the violence in the Cathedral made him question his purpose of life. In this moment, I would like to mention an outstanding role Anatoly Alekseyevich Solonitsyn, who played Andrey Rublev, who was able to fully convey the emotions of a person whose psyche was slightly shaken after all he went through. Third moment that I have found really interesting in the movie was the moment in the end when people started to seek a person who could cast and forge a bell. Young boy Boris begged to help them to cast the bell, he said them that he knows the secret of casting the bell that his father left him. Boris helped them to construct the bell, however, in the end he admits that knows nothing, he did not know any secret before. This moment I find very interesting, and it is still, I think not just for me, mystic for me. How young unexperienced person who did not know anything could manage all workers to construct such huge bell. Ringing a bell makes people happy, they start to smile and congratulate each other. I think it was the first moment in the second part of movie, where Andrei Tarakovsky showed people without suffering. This moment illustrates that in such tragic and dark times people in Russia find their consolation in religion and in faith in God. This moment also shows the reaction of Andrey Rublev to everything that happened. He again started to talk with people. The actions of Boris, who in his young age was able to take the initiative in his own hand and make a masterpiece bell for Russian nation of that time, made Andrey Rublev think that he shouldn't stop believing in people and God. Boris's heroic and mystical action made Andrey Rublev draw again.\nThe sound effects were another masterpiece. The sounds of burning fire, splashing water, the movement of wood details of bell, and the sound of wind made me feel like it is reality, not a movie. I think that Andrei Tarakovsky could perfectly convey the movement of nature and animals: the movement of wounded horse, flying birds (I think they were geese), the movement of tree leaves and trees in the middle of fire.\nAndrei Tarakovsky did magnificent job with just only 900 000 rubles. I think it is really small amount of budget even for his time, because he could recreate the image of XV century with remarkable clothes, nature, and sound effects. To be honest, when I have read the name of the movie, the first thing that came to my mind was that it would be another ordinary movie about the life and work of artist. However, actually Tarakovsky was able to convey the reality of XVI century, the emotions and tragedy of ordinary people. Movie allows us to understand that we should not lose our faith in God and people. That is why my rating for this movie is 10/10.",

            "review_title": "The Journey that is Andrei Rublev (1966)",
            "content": "Andrei Rublev (1966) - [10/10]I typically take notes when viewing films that I will review or analyze, but for this film I did not. I did not take notes so that I could experience this film. Experience Andrei Rublev (1966) like it was meant to be experienced. No distractions, complete patience, and an open mind. After viewing the film, I realized something... I did not need to take notes to write this review. I know exactly what this film did well, and what exactly it didn't do well: it did everything perfectly. I am so glad that I viewed this film with complete and utter focus because it was a jaw-dropping experience. It is a cinematic masterpiece on all fronts. From cinematography to acting. From set decorating to directing. From writing to sound design. Everything is and was perfect. If you can't tell, I'm absolutely astounded by this film. Hopefully I can portray exactly how I felt viewing this masterpiece in the following review and, that being said, let's start with the Writer/Director himself, Andrei Tarkovsky. Ivan's Childhood (1962) was his first feature film. It was bold, ambitious, and very good. Andrei Rublev (1966) was his second feature film. It was bold, ambitious, and amazing. He excelled in everything that he had set out to do. The things that weren't as well developed in Ivan's Childhood (1962) were mastered in this film. Every little thing is masterful. It isn't pretentious (which I feared going into watching this for the first time) but it is art. Tarkovsky converts life into art. Because after all, art mimics life. He takes one man's life story - his triumphs, struggles in faith, and the destruction of the world around him, and makes it something personal and universal. It's amazing. He splits this man's life (Andrei Rublev) into eight significant parts. Each spanning a variety of years apart from each other. We see the beginning, the middle, and the end of Andrei Rublev's life. It is a character study of extreme proportions. Some of the eight parts only feature Rublev for a small amount of time, yet it all contributes to his story and development. Alongside Rublev, there are other interweaving characters. Each have their own character studies that are extremely important to the plot. To accomplish multiple character studies that contribute to the main character's (and title of the film's) own development is amazing. This is only a portion of the film's complexity. The amount of direction that went into this production is jaw-dropping. Tarkovsky converted 20th century Russia into 15th century Russia. There are 360 degree pans in this film, showcasing how much work went into designing a real, functioning, 15th century Russia. There is a sequence that features hundreds upon hundreds of extras (as well as horses) and each extra is acting to the best of their abilities. I actually rewound this part to see if an extra was off or not doing something, and not a single one wasn't a part of the scene. Not a single one. Each extra contributed to the greater whole of that sequence. Everything in frame is purposeful and expertly directed and, most importantly, crafted with care. The cinematography keeps getting better. With each film, Tarkovsky and Yusov improve, this film featuring tons of beautiful one shot takes, complex camera movements, and shots that leave you wondering, \"How did they do that?\" There is a lot of meaning behind every frame of this film, and that subtlety adds to the overall experience of Andrei Rublev (1966). One of the main examples of the meaning behind each shot is the choice to film in black and white. At the very end of the film, it switches (similar to The Wizard of Oz (1939) ) from black and white to color. It's absolutely beautiful and has so much purpose and meaning - it is an excellent ending to this masterpiece. (The film is so well done and when I could feel the ending coming, I was really scared that the ending was going to be terrible and ruin the film. It wasn't. It was perfect.) The majority of each frame also features our main characters: Anatoliy Solonitsyn as Andrei Rublev, Ivan Lapikov as Kirill, and Nikolay Grinko as Danil. Each performance is spectacular and way before its time, but most notably from Anatoliy Solonitsyn. Andrei Tarkovsky discovered him, so this was his first feature film. Watching his performance, you would never think that. He was born to play this role - and to become an actor. From the moment we are introduced to our main character (Solonitsyn) we become attached to him. He caries himself with such soul and emotion, you can't help but sympathize with him. For some portion of the film, he does not talk. Andrei Rublev enacts a vow of silence for the sin(s) he has committed. Solonitsyn is able to portray exactly what Rublev is thinking, feeling, and dreaming without uttering a single word. In the rest of the film (when Rublev talks), each line of dialogue is perfectly executed. Solonitsyn has become one of my favorite actors with this performance. Andrei Tarkovsky brought Anatoliy Solonitsyn's potential to the screen, and pushed his talents to where they needed to be to carry the film. Andrei Tarkovsky and Andrey Konchalovskiy co-wrote this epic film. They wrote the other films I have reviewed as well (The Steamroller and the Violin (1961) and Ivan's Childhood (1962) ). This is a humongous step up from those previous films. Andrei Rublev (1966) has such a complex story and such meaning, perfectly encapsulating the \"show don't tell\" methodology. As a writer, I cherish this film. Each line of dialogue is purposeful, but not at the surface. Only after 5-10 minutes of each line of dialogue (or even the end of the film) do you realize the purpose of particular lines. A lot of this film is like that: you don't realize the significance of what you're watching until it hits you. It hits you like a slap in the face, but at that point there are so many more significant parts of the film that you're still trying to process that you can't help but keep watching, to decode even more. I absolutely love the complexity and meaning of this film. I cried a total of three times during this 3 hour and 25 minute epic. All three times for different reasons. The first, because of the emotion and depth of one particular sequence. The second, because of the sadness and struggle our characters are put through. And the third, because of the beauty this film is - I didn't want it to end. If you're looking for an entertaining film, you can still watch this film and have a good time. But if you're looking for a complex film, you can watch this film and it can change your life. In my opinion, this is cinema. The balance between art and entertainment. A film that can be watched multiple times and feel like it is the first time. A film that can change your perspective, open your mind to new ideas, cultures, and people, and become apart of you. Tarkovsky takes you on a journey. A journey of faith, destruction, and hope. That journey is Andrei Rublev (1966).",

            "content": "Andrei Rublev (1966) :\nBrief Review -A pure Art Exhibition of an Artist's Life by Russian Cinema. Among all the biographicals I have seen till date, Andrei Rublev will remain a special one because of the artistic portrait. An artist's life can best be shown in his own portrait format which makes this biographical less cinematic but quite different and impressive. Although the film is only loosely based on the life of Andrei Rublev, it seeks to depict a realistic portrait of medieval Russia. Though, i didn't like the overdone cultural thing but my personal thoughts wouldn't take anything away from thier honest efforts. Another different thing about Andrei Rublev is, it might have been known as loosely based on life of Rublev but the film's themes also include artistic freedom, religion, political ambiguity, autodidacticism, and the making of art under a repressive regime. This additional things are essential parts of this film hence it is just not a biographical drama based on one man's life but it is a great feature of that entire society in that era. Now coming to the problematic terms, Andrei Rublev is very slow paced and joyless film. You might feel bored many times during this long journey of about 3 hours but one thing i can guarantee is that the film is not soulless. You may not feel like watching this film in one Take without checking runtime bar but if you understand The Art then you won't feel disappointed when the show is over. The film is divided into 8 Parts, each one showing different passages of Rublev's life. The last 8-10 minutes takes you through an art gallery as if you're watching an art exhibition. I haven't been familiar with the names connected to the film so i won't take names just for the sake of this short review but it won't Stop me from praising them. All the actors in the film have brought out their natural bests. Background score is mild but pretty sounding. Cinematography is fantastic, watch out for the pan angles on people and zoomed in clicks on paintings. Director Andrei Tarkovsky does an excellent job as he moulds a controversial script and terrible reality of Russian culture into an uncompromised presentation. He knew the subtle thoughts and he spilt them out in artistic form. Andrei Rublev literally tests your patience because you know the Art always takes time to build itself therefore this one is strongly recommended to Art Lovers.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "Most viewers should think twice before trying to watch this film. It is not a story so much as a series of scenes recalled by memory- i.e. fuzzy, disjointed, and sentimentalised while still being personal. To say the film has a plot or story- per se- would be misguiding. Asking what purpose it does have is probably fairly misguided, as well. Like scenes from our own life, the scenes in this film just happen to us and we are the higher intelligence responsible for imposing order and specifying why they have happened or what they signify.Like impressionism in painting, Tarkovski's objective is to create works that directly interact with the human mind's tendency to convert symbols into emotion. The experiences and environment of Andrei Rublev's life is crafted for us by Tarkovski. The cruelty, hardship, and frank confusion of his life is patiently rendered by Tarkovski in his impressionistic style that seems oblique to \"conventional\" cinematic sensibilities but which is remarkably direct about evoking the desired emotional response. The film is replete with remarkable scenes- the balloon flight that opens the movie and the casting of the great church bell being two of the most memorable. The latter could be construed as either the power of an individual's vision or as what anyone can do when God wills it. Either interpretation would have inspired the creative efforts of any artist.Obviously, some cross-comparison with his other films should be in order. Solyaris (1972), his cult Science Fiction masterpiece is a marginally inferior film that still manages to be, for me, more satisfying because of my sentimental romantic tendencies that allow me to overlook the disjointed plot, poor editing in a few scenes, and the occasionally wooden or otherwise unconvincing dialogue. Andrei Rublev is better in most of these respects and is well photographed on a fairly consistent stock of Black-and-White film. Black and white definitely suit the movie, too- colour would have given the scenes too much \"presence\" and made them seem more mundane- black and white help preserve a sense of reverie. In both films, there is not great sense of urgency and scenes play out in their own (occasionally tedious) pace. Both films feel much more spontaneous to me than Tarkovski's last work- \"Sacrifice\" starring the great Erland Josephson and this seeming artlessness gives them a vitality that this last film lacks.In conclusion- this is a fine Tarkovski film. It is as good a film as any of his for introducing new viewers. Viewers should approach it with the proper mindset, however. Their objective should be to experience the film and their reaction to it. Obviously, interest in Russia around the 13th century will probably not hurt appreciation. While the film is, in its totality, different from most films, the individual scenes are not weird- no strange camera work, no sudden introduction of esoteric symbols, just fairly honest attempts to record an individual person's impression of what viewers today might find to be unusual experiences.",

Is it only a distraction for the powerful or does it have the power to create enduring transcendence?The questions asked by the film also relate to the film\u00a1\u00afs production. Tarkovsky, the enigmatic and ambitious Russian director wanted to create a film about the spiritual dimension of the creative process.  The Russian government of the time only wanted Marxist propaganda.  The parallel could not be clearer Andrei a Russian Icon painter wants to create art but is prevented by the political chaos of the fifteenth century.  Tarkovsky wants to create authentic cinematic art but is prevented by the communist regime in power in the twentieth century.  Both men are dedicated to living in harmony with values outside or the times that they live in.The film is mostly in black and white, but switch to color at the end when we are treated to a splendid display of the paintings that Andrei went on to create despite his hardships.  Up until then the film has been little more then a disconnected series of episodes, each with a precise but obscure meaning, the overall point being that Andrei cannot create in a world so full of suffering.In the films final sequence, Andrei encounters a young boy who is trying to get a group of laborers to build a church bell.  In this act he is trying to follow in his father\u00a1\u00afs footsteps.  After much bullying and cajoling they build the bell and it works perfectly.  The boy breaks down in tears.  He confesses that his father in fact did not teach him the secret of building the bell, he was merely \u00a1\u00b0winging it\u00a1\u00b1 out of a shear desperate desire to create.This description, however only scratches the movie\u00a1\u00afs surface.  Lovingly photographed, each frame looks like it could be a painting by itself. There are cold barren Russian landscapes, ecstatic pagan orgies, and elaborate church interiors.  This is a film unafraid to deal with big difficult themes.  In intellectual content and shear artfulness Andrei Rublyov is unmatched. 10/10",

            "content": "I have now seen most of Andrei Tarkovsky's fine films including Ivan's Childhood and Nostalghia. The sci-fi masterpiece Solaris was surprisingly my least favourite and I enjoyed Steven Soderbergh's take on the famous Plish noel better. The fact that I didn't quite enjoy Tarkovsky's original film as much at first viewing may also mean I need to revisit it like Villeneuve's Arrival I appreciated much more the second time. In any case, as it stands Stalker and The Mirror were my favourite Tarkovsky movies until I finally got through the long 205 minutes if Andrei Rublev.Andrei Rublev is not the best painter biopic ever made, Frida (2002), Mr Tuner (2014), Lust for Life (1956) or the 210min Edvard Munch (1974) would be better.Andrei Rublev is however much more than a movie about a painter or painting. Instead, it paints a painful and powerful portrait of life of the fifteenth-century, Middle Ages or medieval period in Europe, which we now sometimes refer to as the Dark Ages. Russians were fighting with Tatar (Turko-Mongol) raiders and invaders and with their religious Orthodox Christianity dogmas cemented since the 10th century. Rublev was a religious iconography painter with undoubted artistic skills, yet he serves to also represent the power of institutional organized religion over the unconvinced and terrorized population as we see eloquently when a non-believing woman is chased by menacing men near a river. Atheism came into vogue in Russia during the Soviet era when this movie was made and released in 1966 so we can wonder what the reactions of the audience to a lot of the religious focus of the film were.Beyond religion, Tarkovsky touches human themes of purpose and passion. He questions the human condition with loyalties and the vagaries of war, rape, plunder, and pillage. What does it that to raise a kid? A village? What does it take to murder nearly everyone in a village?Maybe not so much. I am also thinking of Elim Klimov's soviet WWII masterpiece Come and See (1985) where villagers in the \"Enlightened\" Modern Ages suffer a similar fate in different times and context. Are we doomed to repeat this savagery today in different ways? Will 2022 be different than 1422?Technically Tarkovsky manages exquisite visual scenes with trusted DOP, Vadim Yusov from Ivan's Childhood. This time he manages even more poignant composition, wide lens, motion and a mix of beautiful slow contemplative shots and actions sequences including invasion, fire, fighting, and horse falling, among highlights. The images are seriously superb and carry the story with immersive sensibility.The images are stunning and stay with me, the questions too. A haunting reminder of humanity's penchant for masked or overt savagery with self-appointed superiority and rationalization of control of ideas, people and property.",

This means among other things that the mood of the film is philisophical and somewhat pessimistic. Because in the meantime the relatively liberal Chroesjtsjov years where over and the Brezjnev years were begun, it took a couple of years before the film was released abroad (and a couple of more years before the film could be seen in the Soviet Union itself).Just like with \"Ivan the terrible\" (1944 and 1958, Sergeij Eisenstein) situating the story in the Middle ages ultimately did not help to confuse the censors. They understood that the implied message was applicable to the present as well.The story is about an artist (icon painter) with a \"writers block\". In this respect it is comparable with \"Otto e mezzo\" (1963, Federico Fellini) and \"Persona\" (1966, Ingmar Bergman). In \"Otto e mezzo\" it is a film director who is suffering from a writers block and in \"Persona\" it is an actress.The artist in \"Persona\" is fictional, the artist in \"Otto e mezzo\" is autobiographical and the artist in \"Andrei Rublev\" is an historical person. However not much is known about the historical person of Andrei Rublev, so autobiographical elements could penetrate into the movie. It is telling that the Russian title of the film is \"The passion of Andrei\". Does \"Andrei\" maybe stands partially also for Andrei Tarkovsky?The similarity with \"Persona\" is striking in this respect that the origin for the writers block in both films lies in the cruelty of the world. Remarkable enough, despite the low spirited mood of most of the fim, Tarkovsky ends the film with a scene that comes close to an happy ending.",

Everyone was having a good time until three Christian monks enter their hut and ask a permission to wait out the rain. It felt like they were not welcome, that people were forced to let them in. After some time, men of Knyaz come and arrest the funny guy. This scene is the first example of Knyaz being brutal to his people and this movie has lots of examples like this. It does not shy away from the harshness of its time and shows it as it is.Then we switch to 1405. Where someone named Feofan The Greek is talking with one of the subordinates of Andrey Rublyov - Kirill. Feofan tries to persuade Kirill to come to Moscow and help him paint icons. What I have got from this scene is that Feofan does not actually need Kirill. It seemed like he was trying to get Andrey through Kirill.The next scene is proof of that. Kirill is sitting in his room and looks upset. Perhaps he understood that he is being used. In rage he badmouths other monks, compares the monastery to a bazaar and reminds them of the story from Bible where Jesus is doing the similar thing. Both the funny guy that was arrested and Kirill are important in this movie. They are going to come back in the future, and we would be able to see how they changed. This is always welcome in movies. It shows director's attention to details and that he is not using characters as fillers, but treating them as living, breathing human beings.1406. Andrey has arrived in Moscow and met Feofan. They are discussing the state of humans. Are they sinful or are they pious? We see how Andrey believes in human potential. He is very optimistic. This is very important as we would be able to observe his shift in this matter throughout the movie.1408. Here we are shown rituals of polytheists running naked and making love. Andrey is caught by them and rescued by a girl among them. They discuss their beliefs and it looks like they part at a definition of love. Andrey tells her that love should not be crazy and uncontrollable, that it should be responsible and conscious. Then the next day those polytheists are caught by men of Knyaz. When given a chance Andrey did not help her escape those men. What should we think? Should we think that Andrey is not brave enough to go against men of Knyaz? Should we think that he could have saved her but did not because of her beliefs?Then Andrey starts painting. But not really. His disciples readied everything, but Andrey is not starting. Andrey's helpers leave the Knyaz and are heading to work under his brother. It seems that Knyaz is jealous of his brother's riches. He commands to blind disciples of Andrey, so they won't be able to go further. Knyaz's brother teams up with Tatars and destroys Moscow. Along with the Chruch Andrey was painting. Andrey kills one of the attackers to save the mute girl who was helping him paint all these years. He is shocked as this was his first major sin he committed.Andrey has lost all the hope for people. He takes an oath to never speak again. 1412. Mute girl is tired of her life and marries one of Tatars. Andrey is getting more upset. His friends are dead, Russian brothers are killing each other, Russian sisters are marrying Tatars.1423. Men of Knyaz are searching for someone who could forge a large bell for a Church. Kid Boris uses this opportunity to climb the ranks and become closer to Knyaz. He tells those men that he knows a secret that his father has left before his death. Boris is overseeing the construction of the Church and seems nervous and lost. When he found that clay, he looked very relieved. Andrey is watching him and is suspicious?Kirill tries to persuade Andrey to go work under Troitsa, but Andrey does not speak. Knyaz with foreigners come to celebrate the opening of the Church. Boris is hallucinating as only he knows that he does not know how to forge a bell. Movie reaches its climax when bell ring is heard. We find Boris lying near a tree and crying as he understands that he was nearly executed. Andrey comes to cheer him up and speaks for the first time in years. He takes Boris under his wing and is planning to go work in Troitsa.Overall, this movie was very calm paced and relaxing. It was refreshing to see characters take their time in their speech and pause when they wanted to pause. Also, the Edige's lack of understanding of Mary's virginity seemed very interesting to me. I do not have any thoughts on that, just wanted to point out that I like director's decision to have this scene in the movie. As for that funny guy, he was released from prison and wanted to kill Andrey for \"selling him out\". In the end, guy forgives Andrey and continues being himself. Movie ends by presenting Andrey's well-known arts.",

But no, this flick is gripping, stark, visually mesmerizing from start to finish due to director Tarkovsky's ingenious eye, and full of unsettling, intense scenes of intellectual as well as spiritual action, man. Got it! And, yes, there's plenty of atrocities, as well. You can't film over 5,000 extras and not expect some excitement, especially when the subject covered is the wasteland that was 15th century Russia. And the damn thing even has rampaging Tartars in it, with only a sadly absent soundtrack of decent metal making the experience a real head-trip. Not convinced? It was banned in Russia. Lots of powerful contemplation on hand here, as the subject is really creativity; what motivates it, what sustains it, and, most importantly, how can man justify being creative and producing art in an evil, uncomprehending world? Of course other equally light, philosophical issues are explored as well, like religion and war, etc. Film's final chapter, depicting the trial of a teenage bell-maker and his comeuppance at the hands of an evil Zsar, is by far one of the most poetic episodes I've ever seen on film. Well worth the time. Additionally, the only film I've seen to document 15th century Russia and include the popular Rudy Ray Moore epithet: \"motherf---er!\". Powerful.",

The story has a confusing point of view and will be a different journey for different viewers. There are strong topics like faith in God, what is a sin? doing sin is right or wrong in different societies and thinkings? \". This is a movie that a viewer may see with a confused point of view and may get bored because of its slow pace.There are so many possibilities in this movie and its difficult to describe this one-sidedly.Although its a black and white feature, excluding that actual artwork by Andrei Rublev at the end of the movie. Even in black and white, we will see some beautiful landscapes and a glance of old Russian architecture which still can be experienced in there culture and living.

            "review_title": "Becoming an Andrei Rublev",
            "content": "Andrei Rublev is a solid work which is not just an autobiography of the great monk and icon painter, but also a picture of the life, troubles and believes of a Russian folk in a 15th century. Andrei Tarkovsky, author of the picture, structures the movie into eight novellas trying to open the life of the rabbles though the Rublev's formation. We can see how the nature of protagonist develops from the blind believer to the na\u00efve monk and finally, experiencing the \"live and death\", he reaches understanding and admission of himself and of what he can and must do for the humanity. By this movie review I want to reflect my perception of how the crisis of believe in a combination with the existential crisis of the folk helped Andrei Rublev find his own way in expressing his talent.\nTo start with let me divide the movie into tree parts: way to the church, raid of the Tatars and building of the bell. From the first stories the picture is fulfilled with the poverty, dirt and humility of the Russian lower-class people. We see how they are living, resting, and even making a pagan religious rite. The life of a common peasant is not that one which a proper religious Christian man should live like. This is what Andei Rublev see when he first starts his way to the painting of the monarch's church. Being motivated in the beginning, going out from the monastery where he was living, he faces harsh reality and this reality makes him understand that people do need help. Looking at all this sins, he does not tern aside, vice versa, he tries to understand why these happening. This is well illustrated in the part \"Andrei's passions\" when he starts the dialog with Theophanies the Greek; here Andrei tries to prove the folk's religious ignorance: \"And new troubles are pouring on the peasant: then the Tatars three times in the fall, then hunger, then pestilence, but he still works, he works ... He carries his cross humbly, does not despair, but is silent and suffers, only God prays so that he has enough strength. May not the Almighty forgive them for such darkness?\" If Theophanies states that people were and will stay ignorant and evil, considering the events of the Jesus \"Last Supper\" and stating that today the storyline would be the same, Andrei prefer to emphasize the repentance, for him: \"If only one evil is remembered, then before God you will never be happy\". The main source of the battles between them is that Theophanies wants Andrei just to use his talent and create because this gift was given to him by God, when Andrei himself want to create only in order to help people and promote right religion.\nRublev's ideology creates first troubles when they start the work on the church. Looking at the lost and cruel nation, he does not want to create \"Last Judgment\", considering that people need something light and easy in order to become inspired, but not something that will frighten them even more. Finally, he follows his path, and creates a beautiful and light peace. Nevertheless, that become unimportant when the brother of the monarch and the Tatars occupy the city. This is when Andrei losing his passion and in another bottle with Theophanies (his ghost), they are changing places. \"It snows, nothing is worse when it snows in the temple\" - with these words we see that Theophanies again lose the bottle. Allegory with snow, for me, is the cool off of Rublev's passion; temple which Andrei tried to fulfill with light, now is snowing. This could be the reason why Andrei is killing one of the brigands in order to protect a woman who will further betray him. That become a reason why Andrei stops painting and takes a vow of silence.\nThe last part is fully dedicated to the boy Boriska, whose story brings Andrei back to life. A boy, who lost his family, clings his chance for better life and risking everything builds a bell. Boldly, stubbornly, passionately Boriska takes a lead, bluffing with the special secret which he never knew. Nevertheless, the fortune and God's gift let Boriska indeed create a masterpiece. When it works, a boy just becomes devastated, yet his deed fulfills Rublev and he breaks his vow with compassionate words to Boriska: \"You see how it turned out well, stop it you ... Here we go with you together. You pour bells, I write icons ...such a holiday for people ... \". Here we should again underline \"for people\", because now we can see that his faith is back.\nTo sum up, the movie rightfully called a masterpiece, which managed to not only to tell the biography of a great icon painter, but to call for the thoughts of how the religion should be approached and presented and to explain how Christianity can reflect on the common people's sins. Andrei Rublev is a picture of religious player who felt peoples' troubles, lived his own, managed to overcome them, and revive it in his works.",

            "content": "Although Tarkovsky's \"Andrei Rublev\" is considered to be a masterpiece of Soviet cinema (as well as all Tarkovsky's works), in the 1960s the movie created a wave of criticism and was opposed by the Soviet state. The reasons for those censorships and rejections lie on many factors, including misrepresentation (according to State authorities) of Russian people and their history. However, the more interesting possible reason is the figure of Andrei Rublev himself and his role in the Eastern Church. The importance of icons, as well as their painters' for Orthodox Christianity, is immense. As noted in the lecture, there were periods of iconoclasm or rejection and destruction of icons, and \"the fact that they live through this period of iconoclasm made icons all the more important. And so icons are very characteristic of Eastern Church today\" (Lecture on \"Eastern Orthodoxy). Indeed, icons are still an essential part of the Eastern Church and, thus, the painters of icons are valued highly in Russia. Rublev's style as an iconographer, moreover, was made a model for later church paintings while he was even canonized as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church. Thus, the importance of Rublev to the Russian religion and national identity cannot be exaggerated. Tarkovsky, however, created a piece of art reconsidering Rublev's life with artistic freedom and risks. In his \"Andrei Rublev\", the audience can see Christianity in the 15th century from a new angle, as a combination of violent and yet \"faith-giving\" spiritual religion.\nFirst, the obvious pattern presented in the movie is common people's judgmental attitude towards the Church, or, in other words, the general (but moderate) criticism of the Church as an institution. The time that Tarkovsky depicts is deeply religious, and the ones who oppose Christianity or do not belong to traditional Christian beliefs are being chased and jailed. It is similar to early campaigns launched against pagans tribes such as of Teutonic Knights' though on a lesser scale (Lecture on \"Eastern Orthodoxy\"). The first episode where the audience encounters this type of campaign (now in the 15th century) is in Part 1, Jester. A jester or \"skomorokh\" mocks and criticizes the rulers and church through his art, dancing, and singing. Later, he is beaten and prisoned by soldiers for his mockery. Next, Rublev meets the pagans who, in their shameless nudity, are celebrating Kupala night. One of the girls who, Andrei meets responses to his prejudice that her people are being chased and tortured because of different religious views. Interestingly, it is as if Andrei's every journey is accompanied by the violence of the Church.\nThe later analysis needs separation of artist from his art since it is difficult to assume Tarkovsky's religious beliefs only from his works. Therefore, as it is not certain whether Tarkovsky put his views into Rublev, I will refer to whoever possesses the depicted views as Andrei (either Tarkovsky or Rublev). Andrei's religious perception diverges from Christian tradition since, in a way, he humanizes Jesus. Andrei sees Jesus, not as a God but as a more human, a more \"person\", and the scene of Jesus's crucifixion shows this point quite clearly. He likens Jesus to Russian peasant by combining a Jesus bearing a cross with Rublev's monologue on Russian men: \"They keep working and working, bearing his cross with humility\" (44:02). This contradicts dogmatic Christian tradition where a God is nothing like humanity but divine. For example, Patriarch Timothy says, \"I drew a comparison concerning Him who in reality has no comparison with the created beings at all\" (Apology of Patriarch Timothy of Baghdad). In other words, God cannot be compared or likened to mere human beings as he is divine and above others.\nYet, this does not necessarily mean that Tarkovsky opposed religion. Rather, he shows a paradoxical combination of Church brutality and human beliefs and faith. The latter is done through Andrei Rublev's discussion with Theophanes the Greek when the audience witnesses the clash of religious views between followers of the same religion. The main disagreement between them comes from their perception of God and humanity. Theophanes is quite cynical in his views as he sees humans as being consumed by sins and evil. Thus, he believes, in the Day of Judgment, they are all going to burn. He claims that if God came back to Earth, people would crucify him again. God, says Theophanes, should not be merciful but vindictive since all evil and betrayal come from humans. Therefore, he sees people as low and dirty, while God is the one who should punish them.\nIn contrast to Theophanes, Andrei Rublev represents the typical Christian view of God and humanity. He has trust and belief in humans and sees in them only good. When Theophanes asks Andrei whether humans are \"dark\", Andrei agrees and yet, he notes, \"But whose fault is it?\" He advocates for the better in human nature and admires how people endure the harshness of life and still can do good deeds and feel love. His sincere beliefs in human acted as an inspiration for viewers of that time and strengthened to some extent spirituality.\nIn conclusion, though Tarkovsky's work is not an biography or documentary, he managed to create a critical and yet inspiring film. Through his characters he analyses the religion and its place in people's lives. Tarkovsky, then, created a piece of art that depicts art as a religious experience and journey.",

            "content": "When the world was immeasurable, when your place was fixed, when a mile was distance, in the rain and mud and when life meant even less than it usually does. When cruelty and lack of any purpose were not just the asset of the most evil of men or, respectively, the discussion of philosophers, but the very routine of each and every day. When knowledge was not much, when there were few ways to go and there was no middle way, no finesse, no considering the options. When disaster was disaster and a calling was a calling. In this setting, also heavily impregnated with religion, art and artist struggle to come of age and fulfill themselves. This is no redefinition of a style, it is not a matter of taste, it's to be or not to be. Can art exist in such a world? Can the artist find a reason to go on and can he find the conditions in which his inner talent will spark and he'll start creating? Nobody seems to need it; nobody seems to want it, not the poor and not the rich or the powerful. Andrei Rublev first and then the young Boris struggle to find reason to all the madness. They don't find, but they create it. One single, but spectacular advantage can be attributed to art in such a context: it is essential; it is the way to set apart man from beast and that it does. Not so convincing for Andrei but very for Boris. But, of course, Andrei fails and Boris doesn't. Boris is the prototype of the artist: desperate, he will go for the prize and gamble all on it, and he will be walking in the dark making gut decision after gut decision all to way to the end. And he will get there, and of course be overwhelmed and feeling really like coming out of a trance. The moment when he cries by the pole and Andrei comes to comfort him, that moment, what he lives there is the single greatest weakness of man and the single greatest feeling on this planet, 5 minutes for which I'd give the rest of my life. But, of course, it is a weakness. This kind of art, this kind of humanization by art, this is not a real thing in the 21st century. None will buy this now. When turning from animal to man, that might have done the trick. We now know in our century that science is really the mother of them all. And art, grand as it might be, it's much more complicated. Even though, each true artist, even today, would give an arm and a leg to be in the place of Boris building his bell. It is not that Boris it's talented at something, he's just a skilled blue collar worker as far as talent is concerned. It's his beauty; his youth; how he believes and how he goes for all or nothing and how out of his vision the final, significant, triumphant, inspiring product comes. It is pure creation. It is not a coincidence that the best scene in the entire movie is him mastering and harnessing his own creational inferno, him almost delirious with concentration and emotion in the middle of the flowing rivers of melted bronze falling to fill the clay mold. The movie is well done but the first part is kind of fragmented and slow paced. Many of the supporting actors do a very poor job of their parts and though not void of merit or even majestic scenes, I'd say that the first 2 hours or so fall into the category of flawed genius. It all picks up and starts to really be spectacular with Boris's story. Of course, this part benefits greatly from the background and the mood set by the first one. More could be said about this great film. Will it convince with its message? No, our world has nothing to do with that. Will it inspire? Yeah, it will make you throw away your TV set and start writing that novel or something. It is not a perfect movie, because of the lesser first part. It is, never the less, a genuine masterpiece.",

            "content": "This movie is a narrative of XV century Russian monk Andrei Rublev's life. XV century Rus' is torn by internal feuds of knyazs, constant raids of Tatars and famine. Nevertheless, life goes on, and despite of this tough period icon painter Rublev is able to live his life and make art. Andrei Rublev, who is full of faith and love for people, leaves the monastery. He has all the knowledge that he received during his monastery teaching. Andrei is faced with harshness and roughness of world outside monastery, with reality, horror, pain, betrayal and all the sins that fill the world. His worldview and his faith are regularly tested throughout the whole movie.\nThe film's idea is centered around the dispute between Andrei Rublev and Theophanes the Greek. Theophanes, though is not a monk, is a wise and kind person. Nevertheless, he is cynical towards people and art, which is reflected in his claim:\"I serve the Lord, not the people. And what about praise? Today they praise you, tomorrow they will criticize you for the same reason they praised you yesterday. Then the day after tomorrow they'll forget about you. They will forget about you, and they will forget about me. Everything is vanity and dust! Even those things greater than these had been forgotten. The human race has already committed all stupidity and meanness possible, and now it only repeats them. Whatever goes around comes around! It all keeps spinning and spinning! If Jesus came back to Earth, he would be crucified again!\"In making this comment Theophanes means that as time passes by, people are prone to change their vision and opinion on what is right and appropriate, and those whom they glorify today are condemned and forgotten by them tomorrow. He is highly skeptical about humanity claiming that people are ungrateful beings that do not learn from their mistakes and keep repeating them.\nAndrei, on the other hand, is full of love and faith in God and people. He tries to justify all the atrocities that people commit:\"People need to be reminded that they are human beings more often. That they are Russians. One blood and one Earth. There is evil everywhere. There always will be hunters, eager to sell you for thirty pieces of silver. And more troubles keep pouring on the peasant: Tatars' raids three times in the fall, then hunger, then pestilence. But peasant keeps working and working. Keeps carrying his cross humbly. He does not despair, he is silent and patient. He only prays to God for strength. How can the Almighty not forgive such peasant for his ignorance?\"In other words, Andrei is optimistic of humanity and believes that it is possible to appeal to people's conscience by reminding them of their nature. In his view, despite of all the sins and evils of this world people keep working and keep hoping for the best and therefore deserve forgiveness from the Almighty God. But later, after Andrei goes through a difficult life path, their roles change. Andrei is disappointed and wants to painting icons, Theophanes from the height of his knowledge, is trying to change his mind:\"-You know what, I will never paint icons again.\nWhy?No one needs this. That's it.So they burned the iconostasis, big deal. Do you know how many times they burned mine? In Pskov, in Novgorod, in Galich! You are taking a great sin upon yourself!\"The essence of this dialogue is that Theophanes thinks that being as gifted painter as Andrei is and not using it for good is a sin. Later Andrei understands that the more evils there is in the world the more kindness and beauty there should be. Therefore, he should be ready to devote his life and talent to art.\nThrough the final episode with the bell, film director Tarkovsky demonstrates the victory of Andrei Rublev in a dispute with Theophanes. The episode reveals everything that Rublev could not express in words in his dispute about the human nature. Kindness and love that Andrei was looking for, he found in himself, realized his ability to create and spread it, even after his death, because art is permanent.\nDirector Tarkovsky definitely coped with the task of narrating episodes of Rublev's life. Not only he successfully conveyed famous icon painter's feelings and emotions through his movie, but he also was able to immerse viewers in that atmosphere of crisis in XV century Rus'. The lesson I got from this film is to never give up your hopes, believe in yourself and keep doing your best, because despite of all roughness and hardship of our lives we are able to create and spread love, kindness and happiness which help us during our lifetimes. This film despite of all violent and cruel scenes conveys a very kind message, 10/10.",

            "content": "Russians must be really proud to own one of the greatest director, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alexander Sokurov, his unique successor. Well, I'm proud for them.Knowing nothing about this film but its director, I bought this DVD and set out watching it. Its vigour and beauty really overwhelmed me to the core. Even in black and white, Tarkovsky's cinematic language is surprisingly daring and comprehensive. Getting used to the tranquility in his later works, now I'm convinced he's capable of dealing with other uproarious themes like violence and comedy.As Tarkovsky showed me this grandiose historic event, I unconsciously related it to Sokurov's \"Russian Ark\". I found that living in a country of great amplitude really endows people with special talents. Russia becomes a magic country since the first time the two directors captured my heart.This film contains many subtle, symbolic elements both in dialogues and camera, keeping you observing and thinking. It's a panorama of the medieval Russia in a episodic style. Each story directly or indirectly affects the life of Rublyov. With all the characters not associated in a classical way, its cinematic style is itself a memorable attempt to portray a helpless individual in a historical fate.I wonder whether it is just a coincidence that the great painter in the film and the great director out of the film share the name Andrei. Maybe like what Tarkovsky said in an interview, all the artists share the same fate to go through the unpleasant darkness of the world to create genuine artworks.He told us to learn to enjoy loneliness. I did for long. He loves horses. I'd occasionally stop my footstep, trying to hear a horse running by.I'm not superstitiously worshiping him. I'm just trying to dig some of his feelings --- the inspirations that have enlightened a great director.",

            "content": "Probably visually the best movie Tarkovsky ever made, but sadly the story doesn't really have theme, there are little developed themes through the episodes, but they feel too short, after the pagans we don't see more religious persecution, something I really feel ashamed they left behind, the expiation is only showed in the last chapter, and the talent is only barely mention with that greek man and when Ciril scolds Andrei.Also the begining and the end are bad, the begining is meaningless, \"daring\", what? Andrei never dares to do anything other than killing a tatar to protect that girl, that may be enough for some but the fact that he never struggles to make his icons and actually we never see him painting icons, makes me seriously question if the movie is about painting, the only daring I bealive is worthy was that young boy with the bell, interentings yeah, but the begining still feeling meaningless, especially with that horse rolling, I mean, why? It's super random, something bad for a serious movie, and the ending, almost 9 minutes straight of just paintings?, that not ok because I'm watching a movie, its ending must be meaningful and important to the plot, how would you feels if you go to see an opera and they only show you sculptures for 9 minutes straight as the ending?,Despite the movie having not really a plot, it's an episode movie and I can forgive it for that, but the episodes don't really share a theme and that a shame because the faith, art and hope are never developed, we never learn something about the importance of faith, about the role of art, about the hope of the people for a better world, nothing, and that's trutly a shame.As I remember, when a random scene without purpose is thrown, is called \"filler\", but aparently, if Tarkovsky does it is \"art\", examples of these: the begining, the juglar scene, Ciril acusing monks of being commerciants (we never saw clues of this), the snake in the mud, Andrei playing with a girl we never met before, the boy reading the bible, that other girl crying to some paint in the wall, thay guy searching for clay (maybe a hint that he doesn't actually know the secret for making bells, but too long, could've been done shorter), the ending with the paintings.The quotes of the crucifixion and the 1Corinthians 13 are interesting, but they just pop out of nowhere, especially the second one, feel unnatural and seems that Tarkovsky wanted the scenes just to appear \"deep\", \"meaningful\" and \"artistic\" so he just throwed some random wisdom there, something we will witness again in his later movies.Despite that, I enjoyed the movie, specially the second part, when the random filling is less abundant, overall a bit pretentious and full of missed oportunities but still good.",

The closest analogy I can offer is that watching the film is like viewing fine paintings in an art gallery or savoring the taste and aroma of vintage wines.(SPOILER) Visually the scenes are striking with many panoramic views.

I could only bear it until just after the invasion, I've read that there was colour afterwards and maybe my experience would have changed, but i believe that whilst you cannot intend to summarise any piece of Beethoven's work in a two minute radio version, this film could have been shorter because the viewer deserves respect and his time is valuable.",

Tarkovsky shows us the life and times of Russian painter Andrei Rublev (\u00b11365-1430) in a way that only Tarkovsky can, his trademark meandering camera hypnotizing the viewer, enabling an almost meditative state that allows us to gain deep insights into art, religion and the human condition. Parts 4, 6 and 8 in particular are fantastic, revealing the chaos and trials of medieval Europe in haunting fashion. The payoff comes in the form of the gorgeous, timeless finale - so well executed.Still, this is not as perfect a work as Stalker or Solaris. I found parts 5 and 7 to be outright boring, perhaps because some orthodox religious themes were lost on me. But these are minor quibbles - take your time to absorb this movie, even if you don't consider yourself the type to enjoy 3 hour allegories about obscure Russian icon painters.

            "content": "Andrey Rublyov is a Soviet biographical movie directed in 1966 by Andrei Tarkovsky- one of the prominent and most influential directors in the history of cinema. This movie is about the 15th-century Russian icon painter- Andrey Rublyov, the role of whom was played by Anatoly Solonitsyn. It consists of 8 parts, each describing a certain period of his life. From my perspective, by shooting this film Andrey Tarkovsky wanted to introduce us to the extraordinary person, a medieval painter Andrey Rublyov, since his personality is being unknown for many people due to lack of information about him. And Tarkovsky chooses to introduce exactly Andrey Rublyov to show the connection of art and religion because in Andrey Rublyov's life both religion and art helped him to survive despite political and social difficulties of his time. This movie review will focus on Andrey Rublyov's personality and show the way religion and art helped him to survive.\nFirstly, the mission of the director was to introduce an extraordinary artist, who is unfortunately not so known among people. From the plot of the movie, the viewer learns some facts about Andrey Rublyov. From the episode \"Jester\" we get to know that Andrey was a monk and the part of a Trinity. From the episode \"Theophanes the Greek\" it seems clear for us that Andrey was a pupil of Theophanes the Greek- Byzantine Greek artist and one of the most popular icon painters of Muscovite Russia. From further episodes, we see that Andrey had decorated several churches of the country such as the Cathedral church in Vladimir. The episode \"Silence\" shows that at one point in his life Andrey took a vow of silence.\nSecondly, the idea of the director was to show the importance of religion and art in people's life. This is shown by one of the key moments of Andrey's life. This all starts with the episode \"The Passion\" when Andrei and Theophanes argued about religion in the forest. Theophanes claimed that people are stupid and evil. He proves it by saying that if Jesus would be alive people would anyway crucify him. Andrey, however, disagrees and says that people crucified Christ to obey God. This Andrey's point is supported by a reenactment of Christ's crucifixion, where on the snow-covered hillside Christ is crucified, however, people nearby were acting against their will just to obey God, because they loved him. However, the whole movie is set in the 15th century and further episodes of the film perfectly illustrate the whole cruelty of that century such as Tatar invasion, sibling betrayal. Andrey sees the cruelty and deception of people and disappoints in them. By seeing how Russian people cut themselves, their evilness, he recognizes the truth of his Greek teacher's point and he loses his belief and takes the vow of silence. Only by meeting Boriska- a boy who had no skills, however, agrees to cast the bell returns Rublev's faith in people, faith in God. He breaks his vow of silence and suggests the boy carry on their work together.\nThe scene with the bell symbolizes Andrey's finding of God. This scene is emphasized by the director's device. The whole film was shot in black and white and the scene when the bell rings is shown in colors, symbolizing Andrey's belief's reborn.\nThis movie differs from other religious movies in a sense that it is not strictly religious, because many church rules are darkened there, such as skirmishes of church brothers. This movie is about the essence of Christian teaching: repentance, forgiveness, and humanity.\nDespite how hard the times were, art such as a religion gave people belief in a better life and improved their lives. Art and religion gave people hope and strength. Tarkovsky chose to direct Andrey Rublyov's life because he was a prominent icon painter and a faithful believer, thus he was able to survive and gave people hope and strength through his works in these hard times of the 15th century.\nTo sum up, a film of Andrey Tarkovsky in 1966 narrates the life of Andrey Rublev- a famous icon painter of the 15th century. Even though Andrei Rublyov was an artist lived in the 15th century his personality was very close and appealing for people of the 70th. That is because Andrey Rublyov was a person who showed that with the help of religion and art people come through different struggles, deal with any kind of problems and difficulties. Difficulties surrounded people at all times we just should always have strength and hope and should not forget about humanity and forgiveness that religion gives us. After the film was directed a lot of people started to be religious meaning that Tarkovsky reached his main aim- he showed people the essence of Christianity.",

            "review_title": "Review: Andrey Rublyov",
            "content": "The movie \"Andrey Rublyov\" by Tarkovsky is based on the background of Russia during the early 15th century, times when Russian people experienced difficult situations. The film demonstrates the different stages of the life of well-known icon painter Andrey Rublyov, his talent, his relationship with other people and the outside world, and his faith. Besides this, three hours of the film shows different ideas such as reflections on sins, faith in God, a difficult period in people's lives due to the Mongol Tatar invasion, and the relationship of political and religious forces. The main character, Andrey, is being invited for decorations of several cathedrals and monasteries, such as Andronikov Monastery, Cathedral of the Annunciation, and Assumption Cathedral, however, at some point, he decides to quit painting. His talent is described as the gift of God, and he spends several years to understand the truth of his talent and to find himself. However, the main idea of the film is not centered on the life path of the talented iconographer, Tarkovsky used the character of the iconographer as a symbol to illustrate the changes like the increasing influence of Byzantine Christianity and Mongol -Tatar invasions, that were happening and affecting people' life at that time.The growing influence of Byzantine Christianity on the religious faith and beliefs of Russian people is depicted in the scenes of the life path of Andrey Rublyov, by showing his main work and talent. After the Great Schism in 1045, two different churches of Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches were separated. Byzantine Empire played an important role in the development of Eastern Church. One of the patriarchates of the Eastern Church was in Russian land, which emerged after the baptism of St.Vladimir in 988. After violent conversions, one of the main events happened was the arrival of educated churchman and painters from Byzantine. So, the arrival of these people should have affected architecture and art. These kinds of changes can be seen in the movie, which is presented by the character of Theophanes the Greek, who was the master like Andrey. However, from the conversation between him and Andrey, two different points of view and style can be seen. Theophanes was disappointed by people, thinking that they were sinners who make mistakes every time, and in his illustrations, God was not merciful. However, Andrey believed that it was acceptable to make sins if people repent about it. Moreover, he thought that people of Russia should not forget that they were \"one faith, one land and one blood\". His view highlights the concepts of Jesus's Teachings, such as compassion, peace, forgiveness.\nAnother example of the effect of Byzantine Christianity is the interaction between the Grand Prince and bishops or priests. In the movie, the religious cathedrals and monasteries were decorated or built by the order of the Grand Prince, and it can be seen that bishops and Grand Prince had political interactions. This is the same with the political and religious situation in Byzantine Empire since there also popes and priests had political influence. In the case with the bell construction, the Grand Prince was the one who ordered the bell and controlled its construction. These examples illustrate the concept that religion in Russia in the 15th century was under the influence of Eastern or Byzantine Christianity.During the period of Tatar-Mongol invasions, people in Russian land experienced a very harsh time. The character of the iconographer is used here as an example of one who experienced and witnessed all of the cruelties which had left its imprints on his talent and work. These invasions make him lose trust in people and be disappointed about them. The one whom he thought to be his people, allied with invaders, and destroyed everything. He had to kill the enemy in order to save the woman, which should not be considered as a wrong thing to do. However, he is strongly affected by this situation and started to have inner conflicts with himself which eventually led him to make a vow of silence and quit his job as a painter. At this point, his Tarkovsky tries to explain that there might be situations that even can influence the religious person with a strong belief. However, here the concept of forgiveness and pity in Jesus's teaching again highlighted. During their conversation, Theophanes mentioned the concept from Scripture: \"Learn to do good, seek the truth, save the oppressed, protect an orphan, ... and if the sins are scarlet, I shall whiten them\". This idea is the same as the one which Andrey believed, that people could do sins but they should eventually repent. However, he decided not to forgive himself. The Tatar-Mongol invasions affected many people, but in this movie a character with Andrey Rublyov is used as a symbol, as an example, how devastating effects had these situations in people's faith.The final moment is the time when the iconographer witnesses the success of a young boy on bell construction. Relying on God and asking for help from God, the boy could finish and make the good bell without any secret way of construction. After this, Andrey broke his vow of silence and with the boy they moved to start their art work again . Here, the movie is trying to explain that Rublyov realized the iconography, or the talent for the art was the gift of God and the best way to illustrate the will of God.\nOverall, the movie \"Andrey Rublyov\" possesses both simple and complex ideas about the religious concepts, beliefs that were influenced by the circumstances happening at that period of time. Living under harsh situations, people in Russia had to face a lot of cruelties which might eventually cause disbelief or wrong perception of main religious concepts. The character of the iconographer is used to a key point to reveal all of these situations, doubts, and true belief.",

            "review_title": "The Bell - the light at the end of the tunnel.",
            "content": "The Bell - the light at the end of the tunnel.Andrei Rublev, film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky in 1966, is a drama describing the life of 15-century Russia through the main character, an icon painter Andrei Rublev starred by Anatoly Solonitsyn. An eight-episode film depicts different stages of internal state of the main character and his attitudes towards his artworks within the medieval Russia experiencing political instabilities, Tatar raids, persecution of pagans, and famine. This black and white film with live background sounds could make the spectators to feel the nature, atmosphere of that Russian land. During the whole three-hour film, it is showing the hopelessness of the peoples' life at that time that are tortured by hardships. In addition to scenes of tortured people, the film is also full of dead or suffering animals. However, the last episode of Rublev's comeback to icon art is the ray of hope that is like a final reward for sufferings shown in the film. Thus, although the film has depressive realistic character, the ending of the film shows the sign of the hope both for Andrei and Russian people of that time.\nFor all episodes of the film, the viewer can see the death, torture, persecution faced by characters, therefore, to watch the film it is necessary to be prepared for the deep thinking. The Prologue shows the death of the Yefim in his attempt to fly on air-balloon. I think, this scene is the premise to the atmosphere of the whole film, describing the sadness the viewer will feel the following episodes. The first episode shows the lack of the freedom of speech through the skomorokh's arrest for his songs about boyars and monks, who turns out in last episodes will half of his tongue cut for this. In the next episodes, when Andrei and his teacher Theophanes discuss about the religion, we see the scene of the Crucifixion of Christ accompanied by touching and sad music .Also, the next episode called \"Holiday\" introduces very different from other episodes scene with naked pagans ritual which shows the world of temptation and pleasure and dialogue of Andrei with Marfa, one of pagan girls about love. This episode ends with the arrest of one of the pagans by soldiers, showing their lack of freedom in the expression of their faith and their truth of life.\nThe next episodes include more cruelty and torture faced by ordinary people from those who possess power. For instance, in the episode \"The Last Judgment\" artisans that refused to work on the Grand Duke's order and decide to work on his brother's order, get attacked and had eyes cut off. Or in the next episode of the Tatars' raid of Vladimir, when Grand Duke's brother helps to Tatars wishing for more power. I think, unlike all episodes, this raid particularly shows the hardships the commoners in Russia are facing, when they are betrayed by their Russian brothers headed by Grand Duke's brother, raped and killed by invaders. Also, this episode includes one of the most brutal scenes when invaders torture Patrikei the messenger, by pouring boiling mixture into his mouse, and tie his legs to a running horse. It is not an easy to watch fragment, however for this film this part was not accompanied by the emotional emphasis or other attributes, as if it was an ordinary action. Moreover, this episode shows how Rublev takes person's life in order to save the holy fool (Durochka). And this episode plays important role as Andrei's life as he loses things he appreciates: his helpers who get killed, and his innocence by killing a man, which in turn result in losing of his will to paint. The episode \"Silence\" shows the next phase of Rublev's life who lives more ascetic life keeping silence. Also, this episode informs about the famine people are facing. This way almost every episode of the film includes moments of torture and killing of people or animals, and while watching these scenes it can be seen the director did not put emphasis in most of these torture fragments. Probably, this way the director wanted to show that these sufferings were ordinary to the 15th century Russia.\nHowever, despite all episodes showing this hardships and despair of Russians, by the last episode it is likely that the director wanted to show the light at the end of the tunnel both for Rublev and for Russian people through the bell construction. Boriska, son of the bellmaker who lost his family after the plague and stayed all alone, convinces the prince's people that his father told him the secret of making bells for church. After, he leads the group of workers and does his job without listening to others advices and feels very stressful and frightened. At the end of the work, the spectators of the film as well as the people in the film also are intrigued weather the bell will ring or not. Finally, when the bell rings, we can hear the sound of peoples' joy, and Boriska's relief. I think, this moment was one of the most powerful moments for the whole film; after all these sufferings, Boriska can let his tears out, while people could hear the voice of the bell reuniting all people in the ceremony. When Boriska was crying, Rublev who was observing how Boriska was struggling all this time, breaks his silence to calm Boriska down and decides to paint again. In this way, the talent of Boriska who casted a bell even when his father did not tell him its secret, had a strong impact on Andrei motivating him to return into art. Also, Andrei seeing Durochka in a veil with a horse also plays symbolic role in the film. Even though Andrei was worrying about her and his desire to protect her, other people convinced him that nobody will abuse God's fool in earlier episodes. And the fact that last scene of the episode was her face smiling proves those peoples' words. I think, because hurting God's fool is counted as a big sin, she was protected and lived in this world of suffering for all other people. This way director wanted to show this power of \"holliness\".\nMoreover, the Epilogue of the film ends with Rublev's colorful paintings, the only colorful scenes in the film. I think, knowing the importance of iconic paintings in Orthodox Christianity after facing iconoclasm, this part shows the great legacy of these Christians showing the positive ending of the film resulting in Rublev's return to the art, leaving these works for generations.\nIn conclusion, although the start episodes of the film show the inner conflicts and seems like a sign of the unhopeful sadness, the end episode and Epilogue shows the power of the true talent and art that never dies.",

            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky makes a very good job depicting the life of monks and the political, cultural, and social environment surrounding them. His job shows that despite the process of the historical development of the society various facets of the Church's life tend to have features that can endure the centuries of change and historical development of the world. At first glance, it appears as a demonstration of the cruel and dirty nitty-gritty in Medieval Russia. However, the situation is more complex. Through the demonstration of monks' life, particularly Andrei Rublev, the author shows different facets of Christianity which can be seen through the actions of the main characters.\nThe work of Andrei Tarkovsky reflects numerous features of Christianity. Even the beginning of the film reflects one of the major characteristics of the Church, namely strictness and conservatism. At the beginning of the film, a couple of men are trying to launch a flying device from the top of the Church and their efforts are being stopped by the intervention of some unidentified men (possibly monks or warriors). However, they successfully launch the flying device into the air. It may seem to just only reflect the conservatism of the Church that hindered technological and scientific progress. The true meaning is much deeper than it may seem. Unidentified men (probably monks or warriors), who unsuccessfully try to prevent the launch of the flying device symbolize the Church which tries to make religion more rigid, ordered, and codified. It tolerates no deviation. The men who are trying to launch the flying bulb, in turn, symbolize the various heretics (Arians, Nestorians, Monophysites). This scene shows the repressive role of the Church which using ecumenical councils repressed the various deviations from Orthodox Christianity. For example, the first ecumenical council condemned Arianism, the third ecumenical council resulted in a schism with Nestorian Church and the fourth ecumenical council condemned monophysite heresy (\"Christian Schisms\"). The persecution of those who want to launch the flying bulb is analogous to the persecution of heretics in the previous centuries and this scene reflects Christianity's tendency to show zero tolerance to those who don't accept mainstream beliefs. To sum up, we analyzed the similarity between the persecution of men launching the flying device with the persecution of various heresies by the Church.\nAnother interesting aspect of Tarkovsky's work is the argument between different attitudes towards Christianity and its social implications. Humans are a very important subject of discussion in every religion including Christianity. In the film, Theophanes the Greek (the famous icon painter) and Andrei Rublev have different perspectives on the nature of evil and humanity. According to Theophanes the Greek, humans are innately bad, driven by fear, and humans and the world do not change. At the same time, Andrei Rublev questions the point of view of Theophanes and claims that humans are victims of ignorance. What can be the reason for such different views on the natures of humans and sin? They both have different backgrounds and origins. Theophanes the Greek grow up in the Byzantine Empire and studied there. Andrei Rublev grow up and studied in Moscow principality. Their different background resulted in different attitudes. This is similar to the controversy between the Greek Orthodox Church and the Coptic Church. Greek Orthodox Church had support in urban areas and Greek upper class (\"Christian Schisms\"). Whilst the Coptic Church dominated the area along the Nile river (\"Christian Schisms\"). This different social background resulted in differences in certain religious questions in the case of Orthodox Christians and Copts too. To summarize, this film reflects how a difference in the social background shapes the differences in religious views.\nThe controversy between Churches can exist on a deeper level resulted from schism. This schism can be reflected by the relationships between monks in the film. These monks are Kirill and Andrei. Kirill was not so talented and tried to become assistant of Theophanes the Greek using sycophancy. He envied Andrei Rublev's talent and tried to give bad feedback on him. Finally, after some time messenger arrives at the monastery and tells that Andrei Rublev, not Kirill is invited. Kirill initiates a scandal and accuses everyone of greed. However, his envy was not the only reason for conflict between him and Andrei. Another source of conflict is his dissatisfaction with himself, with his lack of talent. These numerous factors resulting in conflict between Kirill and Andrei show the similarity between Great Schism and conflict between Andrei and Kirill. There also were numerous reasons, like changes in the Nicene Creed, the question of Papal supremacy, the question of celibate versus married priesthood, the question of what bread should be eaten during the communion leavened or unleavened that resulted in Great Schism (\"Christian Schisms\"). Similarly to the envy and dissatisfaction of Kirill, they finally culminated in a Schism in 1054. So, Andrei Tarkovsky artfully shows break up between Kirill and Andrei symbolizing the Great Schism.\nIn his genius work, Andrei Tarkovsky demonstrates various aspects of the Christian religion. He shows the rigid and repressive character of the Church which tolerates no deviation from mainstream religion. Another aspect of Christianity that is shown is the influence of different backgrounds on the religious views of different people. Andrei Tarkovsky also successfully demonstrates how a complex of controversies results in break-up or Schism. To conclude, Andrei Tarkovsky successfully shows different aspects of Christianity in his film.",

            "content": "To me, this movie wasn't really boring at all. Some scenes seemed to misguided, but overall the movie had a pretty good flow. Solaris was boring as hell, with shots that just hang there forever. Why? Rublev has some amazing camera wizardry that kept the story interesting. The disconnected structure was good to paint an overall portrait of an age. The movie brilliantly captures and creates a despairing mural of a time and place that seems to have been amazingly cruel and harsh. This is one of those movies, like the Godfather, that creates its own little universe. We rarely question the authenticity of the settings or characters because it all feels so real. The main charcter could have been explored or externalized a bit more, i thought. There are many scenes where we're not really sure what he's thinking. Not sure why he's doing what he's doing. This gives the movie a kind of floating dreamlike quality that kind of mesmerizes you.      But the film has its share of awesome violence, like during the Tartar raid. How some of these scenes where directed I don't know, but they are amazing examples of Tarkovsky's versatility in handling material. He navigates between thunderous attack and quiet reflection so smoothly the movie is rarely jarring in the usual way. A hollywood movie would be edited for maximum dramatic impact, whereas the terror in these scenes builds up gradually. For me, the singular image of the movie is the young squire being shot in the back with an arrow and slowly collapsing into the stream. That scene is one the most disturbing things i've seen in a movie. It's rendered beautifully, quiet and solemn.",

The film focuses more on his dedication to Eastern Orthodoxy, as well as its role in his evolution as an artist. There are certain characters that each represent different philosophical outlooks under a single unanimous religious belief. In particular, Theophanes is an interesting take on someone being God-loving yet simultaneously overly cynical in his repulsion by His man's vile nature. Outside of characters, the story is alright. The second half is mostly boring in my opinion. Being shot in black and white to emphasize the colorful ending - no doubt to add \"life\" to the conclusion - is kind of gimmicky, but otherwise a decent film.",

            "content": "It is difficult to begin even describing the impact and beauty of this film. It is the only film I would ever want to review, and it is my first and only review on imdb for a reason. Having seen Andrei Rublev and closely studied it, shot by shot, scene for scene after 7 years, I can only come to the conclusion this is without a doubt, the greatest film ever made... I could go on for hours on end to describe why each scene is perfect, sublime, how no director has managed to block a film like this where every composition, every frame, is more engrossing than the previous-to orchestrate such scenes of grandeur and also ones of divine simplicity... So great is this film's impact, that if one takes the time to truly feel and know this film, any other cinematic experience pales in comparison. Tarkovsky here, is treating cinema as a means to spiritual and religious enlightenment, an epiphany, one might dare say even a gospel. He should be treated as a Michelangelo, a Tolstoy or a Dostoyevsky. Andrei Rublev is to cinema, what War & Peace or the Brothers Karamazov is to literature, what Beethoven's 9th is to music-to compare it to cinema in the traditional sense (e.g. Hitchcock) doesn't make any sense. If any one film, could bring you closer to God, closer to realising the futility of all human pettiness and ambition, this is it.Never have I seen greater performances by an entire ensemble perfectly cast and in complete control of their craft completely lost in their roles, no other filmmaker has shown such technical and narrative skill and inspiration in every turn, eons beyond their years, perfectly complementing his story and actors, elevating the film to divinity with every minor stroke-the \"lone tree scene\" alone has to be the most beautifully realised and executed scene put on celluloid, revealing the passage of time and decay, the very notion of remembrance and love itself, like no other-exalted with a few simple notes on the Glockenspiel-the only sign of modernity in the film besides the ending, as if Tarkovsky is pleading with us to comprehend the timelessness of our lives, when life draws to a close. This scene, crucial to the entire film, which might be missed by many in a first viewing, besides being cinema at its truest and sublimest form, encompasses the essence of what Tarkovsky is trying to say in this film... That when all is said and done, we can at least try to remember with love, the people who we crossed paths with and the life we had... that we forgave and were forgiven and only love remains in our remembrance (as per the hymn of love).Or the lingering shot of Cyril, as he looks at Andrei Rublev for the last time, having confessed his life-long envy, you can see in the mans eyes, acknowledgement that Andrei will make it, he will succeed in making his mark in time, that they have both forgiven one another, and can now meet again in better terms in eternity, that he is even proud of him-without a single word exchanged by Andrei. I can't think of a more genius way, of saying so much with so little. Never have such feelings been better portrayed in any art form. No artist has ever better encapsulated the human struggle with jealousy, cruelty, hatred, war and the futility of all human endeavours outside love and God's word (it is no coincidence we find Paul's hymn of love before the true war and cruelty begins, right in the middle of the film with the only scene including children-royal children by no coincidence)... The entire film, plays as Andrei Tarkovsky has directed it, as a grande testament, a pleading, for us to see through the profane, to plod through it in search of the sacred. This is a film, where every scene, every small detail, will remain with you for the rest of your life, if only you give it the attention and respect it deserves. Like a few other reviewers have commented, this film could very easily nearly destroy cinema for you. Nothing, can simply compare.What is truly sad, though, is that so few filmmakers have tried to follow a spiritual calling through film and treat it as a pure art-form, beyond entertainment and prestige and red-carpets (which Tarkovsky hated), this is a film of true humility in an art-form that seems to have lost any sense of it, if it every fully grasped for an extended period of time in the first place... Many contemporary attempts have been made, but they fail to realise the humility required, the very sacrifice of ones self (as Tarkovsky advocated in \"Voyage in Time\") to their art, and what one has to go through if they want to receive grace... This film is the most moving love letter to ones fellow man...And to those who have criticised this film and its director, for being self-indulgent and pretentious, I wonder if they would think the same of Tolstoy or Dostoyevsky for not writing popular literature. Tarkovsky strived, to treat film and the cinematic language as it truly is, an art form not a means of mass consumption, and in a sense with hindsight one can see that he was and still is somewhat hated for this. He didn't make a political cinema, or follow the zeitgeist of his time and its agendas, and thus he was an exile, figuratively and literally...As a filmmaker myself, there are so many films I adore and so many filmmakers who changed my life, first and foremost Kurosawa, as well as Bresson, Fellini, Visconti, Bergman, Kieslowski, Truffaut and so many others... and I am no stranger to other cinematic approaches and languages, and I think cinema requires great diversity, but this film truly, in my humble opinion beats them all... it reaches the realm of the divine.",

            "content": "Russian state at the beginning of the XV century. The country is torn apart by different ruling elites of regions. Tatars' raids, famine and epidemy are pursuing the people. In this tragic period, a great icon painter appears in Russia, the plot of the picture is fully dedicated to the life and fate of the legendary Andrei Rubilov. He is an itinerant monk, traveling around Russia and observing life and human morals. Information about him is scarce and sketchy. Nevertheless, the filmmakers sought to recreate the spiritual world of Andrei Rubilov. \nThe film carries a lot of deep meaning and gives the atmosphere to everything that happens. At the early beginning of the picture simple Russian men think of a flight. Despite the obscurity in the country, oppression of free thinking, people are living a creative life. One interesting point, on the boat to the place where ball is built in a hurry the man Yefim sails. His first words: \"Come quickly, hurry up!\" In my point of view, these guys clearly know that what they do is strictly persecuted and forbidden. Nevertheless, they do their job, and the ball, despite the sailing archers, flies quite well. Yefim flies over the fields, rivers. He opens the boundless landscape of the Russian land. Yefim laughs, laughs like a child - he is embraced by joy, a sense of freedom. \nThe filmmaker beautifully depicts the image and transmission of the life of the peasants, where at any moment the scene can be joyful, and it can be sad. The movie is divided into five chapters, first of them entitled \"Skomoroh\" or in other words \"holiday\" and introduces us into the joyful life of the peasants with their songs with traditional dances and humor. At that time moment Andrei Rubilov confronted the Tatar raid on the city of Vladimir, they severely destroy the facilities and oppress the Russian people. Experiencing the true tragedy and deep moral crisis in XV century Russia Andrei Rubilov fell into deep concern how to withstand all this kind of turmoil and how to turn the people's mind and make them a little more moral. \nThat scene and moral sufferings of Andrei Rubilov is beautifully shown in the chapter entitled \"Passion according to Andrei.\" For certain time of moment legendary painter could not find his true passion, and frequently questioning his true talent - is this God gift or this is illusion? Generally asserting, this chapter includes all the main ideas that are important for understanding the work and aspiration of Andrei Rubilov, why he is striving to attain his life goals and what is the price of his all these sufferings for moral virtue. Eternal thoughts about good and evil, sin and God, disgusting qualities of humankind such as cruelty and immorality are all the part of this section of the movie. Despite these all turmoil situation in Russia, Andrei Rubilov shows his true love toward a Russian people and land, which in its he shows his consent to endure all confusions just in order to preserve the Russian identity. Indeed, the filmmaker by this passage delivers to us the true moral of a successful human existence which only could become possible through true love and enduring all the hardships in the name of maintaining your nations identity and land. \nDuring such hardship times Russian people seek to help from God, as I mentioned before in order to sustain their national identity and land. However, the scene with the invasion of Tatars is the apogee of showing godlessness, cruelty and greediness of Russian people, and it shows why Russian people seek help from God only when they had experienced turmoil. Andrei Rubilov does not stand aside during this hardship period of Russian history, he helps people to turn their faith toward God and morality through his works such as icon painting. \nAt the last section of the movie, the cast bell plays significant symbolic importance. The joy of his ringing in people symbolizes, even a temporary, but still true connection of Russian people with God during the hardships. In my perspective, by the construction of huge bell want to show the greatness and unity of man with God. From the movie director's perspective, it seems to me that regardless of how hard it would be, no matter what awaits a person on his life's journey, human's faith to God would definitely help him to overcome trails at any moment and therefore, the unity of person with God is the meaning of life. \nTo conclude, this movie in religious perspectives very simple and at the same time complex, meaningful picture, imbued with humanism and love towards your nation and your motherland. The film accurately conveying the spirit of the age and the spirit of Andrei Rubilov, and his quest for moral virtue. Moreover, the picture amazingly portrayed the controversial world called as unity with God and humankind's own destiny.",

            "content": "\"Andrei Rublev\" is a great philosophical and historical piece of cinematography that not only depicts the events and mentality of that time but also touches upon the theme of the inner fight of a human in regards to faith and his place in the world.\nOne of the strengths of the movie is the fact that it is full of meaningful symbolism, which intertwines with the tragic history of medieval Russia to create multi-layered conflict. An example of that symbolism can be the opening scene of the movie that allows us to fully view the sacred space of Russian Christianity - the Orthodox Church. According to well-known philosopher Eliade, sacred space is a space that was endowed with a special purpose in religion, the place that represents it. This way, the Orthodox Church in \"Andrei Rublev\" becomes the symbol of the abated faith when we see the inability of the church as a space to protect parishioners from the attacks of Tatar-Mongol Yoke.\nAnother strength of the movie is the beauty of the cinematic picture that can express the atmosphere and identity of Russian medieval culture. Dark and long shots create a unique feeling to the events and dialogues that are demonstrated on the screen. However, these two main strengths of Tarkovsky's \"Andrei Rublev\" can push away some of the audience since a high level of symbolism and long shots can be considered as unnecessary and unrelieved in terms of the plot. This is also a reason for a movie to be considered as a piece of such genre as \"arthouse\" which usually consists of the pictures created for a limited audience.\nThe writing is another strong component of the movie since we can witness thoroughly written character development that Andrey undergoes during twenty-four years. This character development from a conflicted sufferer to a strong and magnanimous artist that brings a bright message to people through his art of interpretations of religious concepts - the art of iconography.\nThe direction and acting in the movie are also of high quality. The scenes and their order in the plot are designed to create a sense of immersion with the atmosphere of the movie and the feelings of the characters among the audience. Tarkovsky's unique and audacious methods of narration were able to capture my attention from the beginning to the ending of the movie despite the long shots.\nTo conclude, it can be said that \"Andrei Rublev\" by Tarkovsky is a unique piece of cinematography that emerged from the convergence of Soviet and medieval Russian mentalities to raise philosophical questions of fate and religion. Despite the fact that the movie can be considered unbearable and unnecessarily pretentious because of the peculiarities of the style of its director, Tarkovsky was able to reach the minds of people in many ways, including historical and religiously existential.",

            "review_title": "Rublyov",
            "content": "The film illustrates not only about the life of the famous icon painter, but more about the sorrow of a man, who went through all the suffering in the name of a goal, in the name of his faith. Despite the popularity of the artist, his biography remains mysterious, which gave almost limitless space for the imagination of the Producer. Before moving on to the personality of Andrey Rublyov himself, at the beginning it is worth noting the bravery of the Director: the film contains plenty scenes of nudity, illustration of the paganism with ceremonies, and in general, it was probably the first film about the Orthodox faith and religion in the censored and atheistic USSR. First of all, the film is sad, filled with pain and suffering, and this is not only the pain of the main character, it is the pain of the entire population, the pain of that time. Hunger, dirt, fear and the invasion of the Tatars do not allow the ordinary population to simply live as a human, it ruins also the souls of people who are greedily looking for peace. And the black and white footage only adds to the film only sorrow.\nThe main thesis of the film is that faith plays the most important role in people's lives: it leads people to success, to a good life, and those who do not have it continue to live in suffering.\nAndrey Rublyov from immature man turns into a real thinker, trying to comprehend the tormenting questions of existence. He sees completely unpleasant people, sees that evil has spread around. He is disappointed, broken. He is concerned about what is happening to people. And besides, he has big internal problems. He understands that he cannot create because he does not believe in the sincerity of the people who come to pray, nor in his own sincerity. He cannot touch the sacred, because in his soul there is a struggle and a doubt.\nAt times, Andrey Rublyov is tormented by a choice: on the one hand, Church laws, on the other - social justice. He understands that the dumb fool is a sinner and violates the laws, but can she be punished? He saves her by committing a terrible crime - murder. Andrey makes his choice, he feels that he can't get away from people, get away from them. And this is a big step towards the true faith that he will find later.\nProbably the most powerful, but at the same time the most understandable novel of the film is \"the Bell\". Boriska, in order not to be alone, in order not to starve to death without food, lies, mentioning that he knows the secret of casting the bell and began to work. However, what does he have in his soul and mind? Only faith and nothing more. The novel illustrates the power of the strong faith. Boriska has put his whole life on it: he constructs the bell, or he will be punished or die. When the bell is cast, when it rings, there is powerful moral, spiritual, and religious revolution takes place with both Andrey and Boriska. Boriska is crying and sobbing. He truly felt God. How could a young guy who didn't know anything about the art of bell casting made a perfect bell? He had laid down his life on one faith and gained far more than he could have imagined.\nFor Andrey, this is also moment of change in his soul and mind. He sees that the people who blaspheme and sin, now, at the sight of a miracle are in a wonderful, joy mood. Smiles on their faces, and joy fills their souls, and they remember what love is. Andrew understands that no matter how angry the people are, they must be believed in, because if a person like Andrew must believe in them. It is necessary to create for the benefit of people, for the happiness and joy of people, so that they feel love. Andrey understands that his vocation is icon painting. He must perform this moral, spiritual, and religious actions. \"Here we go with you, Boriska. You cast the bell; I draw the icons\".\nThrough the life of the main character Andrey, or Boriska, or even the entire population of Medieval Rus, it proves that faith played the most important role in their lives. \"Art exists only because this world is poorly organized.\" With these words, the Producer tried to convey to viewers that artists (painters), similar to any other creators, work on their labor in order to bring at least a drop of beauty to this imperfect, filled with gray (like the movie itself) colors of the world. Art exists because people need hope and faith. The belief that not everything in this world is colored with gray. The confidence that one day everything in life, like the final picture, will spill out in color.",

(Insert whatever adverb you like here) enough, these are the first and last scenes. I suppose by \"scene\" I really mean the whole situation or...that's why i called it a scene. I imagine the scene at the monastery comes close as well. it's a brilliant film, really, for the same reason gary mentioned, it can be frustrating. it is very typically \"the greatest film of all time\". I am wont to say \"in a Schindler's List sort of way\" but don't hate me, i mean this is an extremely vague sense, and i would never actually say this since it would take away so much of the film's philosophical wonder, something i can't imagine seeing in the other film. so i would have meant it in a merely \"greatest film\" fashion though perhaps a stipulation would be that i don't think one who thought that of one or the other would think it of both. the icons are amazing.  the wonderful comic peasant certainly made it all worth it. there are no other acceptable andrei tarkovsky films. don't bother.",

(or any other work)beautiful pictures, philosophies on life (Tarkovsky being quit russian), finalized with some good story lines on the 15th century.Though the film might be a bit long, and don't expect a proper story.",

            "content": "I first saw Andrei Rublyov when I was a teenager in a late night TV showing of one of the longer versions.  I was transported, and those three hours gave me a deeper understanding of medieval life than all my school history lessons.Tarkovsky manages to mix tiny details of everyday life, desperate tragedies, deep theological arguments and huge historical events into one epic story. The film remains one of my all-time favourites.",
