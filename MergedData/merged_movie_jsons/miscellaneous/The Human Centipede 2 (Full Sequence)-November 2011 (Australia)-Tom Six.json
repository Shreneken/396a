            "content": "Human Centipede 2 is like watching a crime scene. Besides our nasty, degenerate villain in Martin, there is no character development at all. What is on the screen is just violent act after violent act, culminating in a slightly open ending. I was expecting to see some really horrible acts of violence against bodies, and that's exactly what I got. I didn't enjoy it one bit. However, I cannot deny the effect it had upon me. I had to watch the Simpsons for an hour following this film so I could feel normal again. Physically, this is the most disturbing film I've seen. I have seen worse in extreme cinema when you are actually invested in the characters, but that is impossible here. This movie is not for the squeamish at all, in fact a scene or two forced me to turn away and gag slightly. It sucks to admit that as I consider myself a seasoned genre fan, but yeah, certain parts were really freaking gross. Was there any tension? Well the first one elicited a few genuine scares but here, the fear is for what your eyes are going to be subjected to next. Watch at your own risk.",

            "content": "It's not often that you get the original film featured as part of the sequel, i.e. the film within the sequel to the film, but this is what happened with this one to the very controversial original, and I heard that this one was much worse (taste wise), it sounded worth watching, from director Tom Six, who apparently worked on the Dutch version of Big Brother, where it first began. Basically Martin Lomax (Laurence R. Harvey) is a mentally disturbed lonely weirdo who lives with his Mother (Vivien Bridson), he loves and is obsessed by the cult horror film The Human Centipede (First Sequence). Martin works as a security guard during the night shift in a grim underground parking complex, to escape his dreary and almost worthless existence he watches the film with delight, he even masturbates to it, and also has his own pet centipede. Martin fetishes to have the same surgical skill as the film's leading antagonist Dr. Josef Heiter (Dieter Laser), with his knowledge for the human gastrointestinal system, of course Martin has no surgical knowledge whatsoever. But his obsession for the film has become increasingly extreme, to the point where he dreams of making his own Human Centipede, but not with three people like what he has seen, but with more. Martin's mother sees this obsession, in anger she rips up his scrapbook full of photos and articles about the film, in retaliation Martin smashes her skull in until dead, he puts the corpse in a chair and props it up at the dinner table. So Martin starts finding and kidnapping random people to start the process of his sick dream, stripping them all of their clothing, tying them up and gagging them with duct tape, he hopes to create \"the full sequence\" of twelve people. Martin even manages to get his hands on one of the actors who became part of the film Centipede, the leading actress Ashlynn Yennie, after pretending to be Quentin Tarantino's casting agent, she is to become his head of his creation. In an abandoned warehouse, Martin begins his building of his own Human Centipede, but instead of using surgical tools and medical expertise, he is having to rely on more duct tape, dodgy DIY tool skills and hideous mutilation, like knocking teeth out with a hammer. One of the twelve victims dies in agony, and the other, a pregnant woman, seems to be dead but is actually unconscious, so Martin has to settle with ten people taped together with their mouths stapled to the previous person's anus, and the leg tendons cut to stop them getting away. Of course part of the process of having the victims connected is having the head eat, passing excrement through from person to person, but to speed this process he gives each victim a sip of laxative, causing them each to have their bowels explode. After seeing a victim or two die from choking on excrement or their own vomit, the pregnant woman wakes up and runs out of the warehouse to the nearest car, in the process of escaping she gives birth to her child, but it dies when she crushes it's skull, she drives away. Martin is extremely angry, and the Human Centipede have managed to split in half, but the psychopath takes a gun and shoots each victim in the head, until Miss Yennie is the last left alive. But she manages to grab hold of the funnel Martin used to force feed her, she shoves it up his anus and throws his pet centipede down it, and he is screaming in agony. The film ends however with Martin waking up while watching his favourite film, leaving you to question whether the events seen were real, just his imagination, or him dreaming. Also starring Bill Hutchens as Dr. Sebring, Maddi Black as Candy, Kandace Caine as Karrie, Dominic Borrelli as Paul, Lucas Hansen as Ian, Lee Nicholas Harris as Dick, Dan Burman as Greg, Daniel Jude Gennis as Tim, Georgia Goodrick as Valerie, Emma Lock as Kim, Katherine Templar as Rachel and Peter Blankenstein as Alan. Harvey gives a most exceptional performance as the non- speaking obese severely disgusting character with the sick fantasy to create something he has seen in his treasured film, it almost mirrors concerns parents have about life imitating fiction. This sequel is certainly much more violent than the first film, so much so that it was banned entirely by the BBFC (British Board of Film Classifiction), who refused to touch it, as it was \"revolting\", but eventually it was released as an 18 certificate with thirty two compulsory cuts totalling two minutes and thirty seven seconds. From what I have read, this material is very extreme and was right to be taken out, including Martin masturbating with sandpaper around his penis, and Martin with barbed wire wrapped around his penis violently raping a woman, you could almost tell where these moments were meant to happen, from what was left in, it is still a highly violent, and a most interesting to watch horror.

            "content": "Actually I should be grateful to Tom Six\u0085 Thanks to him and his demented movie, I finally know where to draw my own personal line when it comes to tolerating cinematic smut! The ideal way to describe this movie is to simply write down as many synonyms for the word \"repulsive\" you can think of! So here goes: \"The Human Centipede II: Full sequence\" is revolting, sickening, disgusting, loathsome, degrading, nauseating, appalling, despicable, vile, heinous, nefarious and absolutely positively depraved! The first film already caused quite a bit of commotion and controversy because of its plot and a handful of shocking sequences, but I swear the original looks like a politically correct Disney family flick compared to the totally messed up sequel! Not only does the concept of creating a human centipede gets enlarged and illustrated a lot more graphically, also the characters and sub plots are much more perverted and insane than in \"First Sequence\". I realize this will sound as a recommendation to all the sick puppies amongst you, but this is truly one of the most repugnant movies ever made. In spite of the emphasis more than obviously lying on gore and shock-factor, I nevertheless have to admit that the film features a number of ingenious story lines and creative twists. The whole basic plot and set up, for example, is surprisingly inventive. The sequel considers the original film in fact as a purely fictional \"film\" and thus the events and unorthodox medical experiments of Dr. Heiter were never real. However, the protagonist of part two \u2013 the obese and mentally handicapped midget named Martin \u2013 is addicted to watching this crazy movie and becomes obsessed with the idea of creating his very own (and bigger) human centipede. I can't deny that I find this idea intriguing as a starting point for a sequel. Writer/director Tom Six also generates a suitably grim and disturbing surrounding around pivot character Martin. He lives with his mother but she hates Martin with a passion. Why? Because her husband is in prison as Martin couldn't keep his pedophilic nightly visits secret. Martin works as a concierge in an underground parking lot where he captures his victims, but also bashes people's heads in with a crowbar and masturbates using sandpaper! He brings his centipede victims - all 12 of them, including a very pregnant woman \u2013 to a raunchy hangar and accomplishes his dream, which leads to many gross tableaux, I assure you. Multiple images that I can't even begin to describe truly give a whole new meaning to the words tasteless and immoral. When approaching the grand finale, you may expect scenes featuring excrement, rape, miscarriage and gratuitous torture/mutilation. Don't even consider watching \"The Human Centipede II\" \u2013 not even out of curiosity \u2013 if you have a bit of virtue left inside yourself. Laurence R. Harvey gives away a peculiar and remarkable performance as Martin. He is so convincingly perverted and deviant that I sincerely doubt if he's even a normal person in real life... I don't want to know him at least, that's for sure. The film is entirely shot in black and white, which perhaps makes the gruesomeness and on screen filth slightly more digestible, but primarily it increases the sober and grim atmosphere of it all. Other elements that contribute to this are the minimal use of dialogs and/or soundtrack and the nihilistic narrative tone. It maybe feels weird to admit, but technically speaking \"The Human Centipede II\" is actually a competent effort. Apparently there's already a third installment in the making, but I might just spare myself the hideous aftertaste in my mouth and stomach.",

            "review_title": "Why Do They Make Movies Like This?",
            "content": "I detested \"The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence),\" and yet I'm well aware that it was made with me in mind \u2013 me and anyone else who thought that last year's \"The Human Centipede (First Sequence)\" was a disgusting, pointless, morally bankrupt pile of garbage. Writer/director Tom Six made a promise as he was promoting the original film, namely that the sequel would \"go full force in graphic details, making part 1 look like My Little Pony\"; by living up to that promise in spades, he has given his harshest critics the cinematic equivalent of the one-fingered salute. If you're reading this, Mr. Six, let me be the first to congratulate you on telling me off with such incredible flair. Let me also reassure you that you're absolutely right about people like me. We're not persuaded by the \"artistry\" or \"entertainment value\" of torture porn.I've just been made aware that Six is currently working on a third chapter, which, according to an interview with Empire.com, he promises will \"make the last one look like a Disney film.\" That's a pretty tall order considering the imagery he subjects us to in this film, including (but not limited to) a man masturbating with sandpaper, people defecating into other people's mouths, and the head of a just-born fetus being crushed under the gas pedal of a car. Incidentally, are these supposed to be symbolic of something? I'm asking this because I tend to overlook symbolism when I'm actively trying to keep myself from vomiting in sheer revulsion. Earlier this year, when I had to endure the wretched \"A Serbian Film,\" a reader happily explained to me the meaning behind a newborn baby being raped, which, I admit, went completely over my head. I expect that same person will tell me how I've failed to see the genius in \"The Human Centipede 2.\"What a sick, depraved, repugnant movie this is. Why do producers, writers, and directors believe such films need to be made? How is it that they actually gain a following? I'm greatly disturbed by the fact that there's a demand for them. We don't need movies like this in our lives, not even for the purposes of entertainment \u2013 which is a funny word to use, because it's inconceivable to me how anyone could possibly find this kind of trash entertaining. If stories like this appeal to you, if you get some kind of dizzy thrill at the sight of degrading, pointless exploitation, you inhabit a world I officially want no part of. There are enough screwed up people in the world without their sadistic perversions being gleefully celebrated in a movie theater.The film is not a sequel in the strictest sense. Six adopts a metafictional approach, telling the story of a British security guard obsessed with the first \"Human Centipede\" film. His name is Martin (Laurence R. Harvey). He's short, overweight, asthmatic, and by all accounts, mentally ill. Apart from some groans and a good deal of maniacal laughter, he says not a single word throughout the entire film. He lives with his mother (Vivien Bridson), who verbally berates him at every available opportunity. She blames him for putting her husband in prison, apparently in denial or completely unmindful of the fact that he sexually abused Martin on a regular basis. A psychologist (Bill Hutchens) has frequent sessions with Martin in his living room. Are we supposed to find it funny that this doctor is a pervert who lusts after Martin?When he's not at home, he's either brooding in his parking garage toll booth or targeting victims. You see, he wants make his own human centipede, only he wants to outdo the Dr. Heiter character and increase the chain from three people to twelve. And so he beats unsuspecting people senseless with a crowbar (how they survive this is anyone's guess), piles them in a van, drives them to a secluded (and conveniently abandoned) warehouse, and leaves them to lie naked in filth and darkness. He lures in Ashlynn Yennie, who played Jenny in \"The Human Centipede,\" by pretending to be Quentin Tarantino's casting agent. We eventually have to endure Martin surgically joining his victims mouth to anus, which in this case involves such needlessly graphic imagery as knives slicing through flesh and vital parts being attached with a staple gun. We then have to bear witness to an ambiguous ending that cheats.Six's cinematographer, David Meadows, photographs all this in black and white, arguably in the least artistic way possible. Did anyone making this movie honestly believe that, by employing a cinematic device as dreamlike as black and white, the material would somehow be elevated? No amount of technique would have made this movie work. Like the film that preceded it, it shouldn't have been made at all. \"The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)\" is not only one of the year's worst films, nor is it merely one of the worst movies ever made; it represents all that we as human beings should strive to evolve against. Under no circumstances should we be amused by cruelty, suffering, and exploitation. The sooner we realize this, the sooner we can make that next step.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",

            "content": "First of all, I think Tom Six, the director of this film is apparently not a mentally well individual and probably needs help. Please don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a good horror movie. Devil's Rejects, A Serbian Film, Saw, Hostel, etc. Those kind of movies are a cakewalk (except maybe 'A Serbian Film') compared to this. As hard as I try, I can't even think of a film to compare this to. I have seen the first Human Centipede and was appalled. When Human Centipede 2 came out, I suppose I was curious and wanted to see how Tom could utilize feces for his next 'masterpiece'. This is a film has very little plot. It is all about feces. Do we really need a movie with feces involved? I know people have fetishes, and Tom Six seems to have a feces fetish (which is fine, I suppose), but why share it with the world? Sure, I could sit here and bash the director, Tom Six, but after researching his background, he seems to get a thrill over peoples reaction to this kind of subject matter, and he isn't afraid to say so. This also confirms his his need of therapy or confinement to a mental institution. If you enjoy watching people forced to consume feces, this film may be right up your alley.So I ask myself...... Who would finance this kind of vile? What kind of company would distribute this? Who would pull out their checkbook and pay for movie props, actors, camera equipment and rent movie locations for this kind of film? Who is in charge of making the fake fecal matter in the film? That must be a rewarding job. What kind of actor would look at this script and say \"Oh yes - I really wan't to be a star in this movie.\"? How can you look at yourself in the mirror after being an actor/actress in this movie? I have more respect for actors in porno movies. Think carefully before watching this movie. Because once you watch it, you can't unwatch it.",

            "content": "In my review of the first, umm, segment of Tom Six's \"Human Centipede\" series, I stated that it was a very difficult film to review as it's inherently meant to alienate and disgust \u2013 so how to judge it evenly? I had no such problem with The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) as not only does it retain (and amplify) the revoltingness of the original, but strips away any twisted charm, tension, good performances and frequent tongue-in-cheek execution that made \"First Sequence\" better than it had any right to be.Many haphazardly brand films they dislike as \"worthless,\" but some movies are genuinely without any merit. \"Full Sequence\" is such a rarity. This sequel is artless, humorless, boring, without style (well, it is in black and white, so it must be high-class), purpose, or cleverness, and is generally off-putting, but never haunting or lasting. The only purpose seems to be in Tom Six's mind, in that he wanted to one-up himself. He succeeded in scope, but failed in every other aspect.The opening scene reveals to us that the entire first movie was just that: a cinematic endeavour. Cut to Martin, a lonely and infinitely unhinged parking lot attendant who becomes obsessed with the film and further obsesses over creating his own humanoid monstrosity with twelve victims \u2013 an addition of nine. You see, these unlucky folks will be surgically attached mouth to anus, thereby connecting the gastric system, giving birth to a human centipede. His plan involves shooting his targets in the leg, bludgeoning them with a crowbar, tossing them into the back of his van and driving them to a grungy warehouse to await their fate. This drawn-out portion of the movie slogs along as Martin collects his subjects in a rythmic, monotonous pace with no sense of impending dread or sympathy for his victims. The camera seemingly just rolls for the hell of it.While the original benefited from a deliciously deranged performance from Dieter Laser as the mad doctor, Laurence B. Harvey's Martin never speaks, is grotesque in his appearance and mannerisms and has no interesting motives or backstory except that he was apparently sexually abused by his father. In fact the entire second half of the film contains no dialogue, as by this point all the characters' mouths are otherwise full (I apologize for that imagery). When the poop did flow, I was both bored and otherwise desensitized from the previous grotesque events and simply wanted the experience to end. A backhanded aim of Six may have been to craft a movie that nobody could sit through, and he did succeed, but not in the way he likely intended. I felt my time was being wasted, not that I was being shocked to new extremes.The only people I could recommend this movie to would be those like myself who enjoyed the first and are curious about the follow-up, but I would have to tack on the disclaimer that they will be disappointed and viewing could even diminish the bizarre appeal of the first. But I suppose if you truly love fecal matter, back-room surgery, blood, torture, infanticide, profanity, child abuse and (of course) centipedes, you will be in cinematic bliss. Six already plans to finish his vision with a third movie entitled Human Centipede (Final Sequence) and after fulfilling the worries I had that he would one-up himself to a fault with this movie, I quiver at the load of dung he has in store for us to cap the trilogy.Read my review of the original: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1467304/reviews-40",

            "content": "What this singular piece of nastiness has going for it in the main is brevity, no film of 88 minutes really ever outstays its welcome. Tom Six feels like a guy who knows what buttons to push, he introduces a minor character who is a kind of cartoon of the UK doctor / serial killer Harold Shipman, whose educated, imperturbable, casually degraded outlook is like acid in your face. There's also an incredibly disturbing line that evokes the main character's messed up childhood, \"Crying will only make daddy's willy harder\".Martin is an obese middle-aged nighttime security guard, who lives with his mother, who blames him for having his father sent to jail (i.e. being there for him to abuse). He is fantastically ugly, a stigma which in Western society leads to ostracisation. Martin is looking at these cards he's been dealt, which ain't great, and decides it's time for the proverbial to hit the fan, which is to say he'd like to try and re-enact his favourite DVD, The Human Centipede.The British censors (and no doubt those of other countries will follow suit), have spared us a scene of a mother brutally killing her own newborn by mistake, of a coil of barbed wire being used as a marital aid, and like their forebears, the censors of Witchfinder General, had to ponder on just how many bludgeons with an axe, or in this case teeth removed by hammer blow, are acceptable, and decided on a lower number than the director.The film is not quite squared away in terms of plot plausibility, but does what it can.I actually found the movie implausibly human, what Martin ends up doing seems, on the face of it, entirely logical (which is not to say that everyone who is abused becomes an abuser). The film seems to have a message that people are marginalised and forgotten about at our peril, that society is judged by the people who behave the worst.Two of Six's gambles that pay off extremely well are shooting the movie in black and white, and having Martin remain dialogue-less throughout. His implacability and remorselessness say all that needs to be said about someone who has been kept as an animal and poked one too many times. The black and white shooting literally portrays a miserable world drained of any colour.",

He carries the film with his amazing performance. There are plenty of little twists to keep you occupied, some of which are actually humorous in a grotesque way. The odd thing, though, is that the film really isn't scary. Maybe because Martin is so divorced from reality that he seems incapable of true evil. Rather, he is just driven by a single-minded vision to complete his project. Probably the first real success he's had in his sad, sad life. The effects are spot-on, and the pacing generally good, although I found it dragged a bit about 2/3 of the way through.

Not for it to be the sickfest that Tom Six promised in the early teaser trailer, but for Tom Six to actually create something lasting with the infamy he gained through the previous film. The Human Centipede itself wasn't all that bad I thought personally. Twisted sure, outlandish definitely. However, aside from the poor show of acting from the American student girls early on in the film, the standard of acting was good. The plot was linear, shocking, and kept you gripped to your seat, or the toilet bowl for as long as the movie was running. The film itself also came in under the radar. My friend came home once and said he had just watched a movie called 'The Human Centipede.' He then asked me to imagine what comes to mind when I think of those words. Of course I was way off, but by this point I just had to watch it out of intrigue alone.The second film is none of the above. Indeed, it is sick, twisted, and outlandish; and then some. But it just isn't original, clever, or even remotely logical. I don't want to go into the plot and explain who does what, aside to say that there is no real protagonist, and pretty much everybody in the film is either an antagonist, or deserves to die. There is a moment where you think that one woman will come through as some sort of hero, but then she does the most insane thing I have ever seen in a film. You'll know it when you see it: if you see the uncut version. Tom Six is taking his audience for a ride, and not a good one. He's laughing at the people paying the ticket price and stupid they were to trust him and his film making ability. The majority of the movie is shot entirely in black and white except for one part of the movie that has touchings of brown, in a similar fashion to the way blood is portrayed in Frank Millar's Sin City: have a quick guess which part that is. Note: that same scene that lasted a minute in the original lasts for ten whole minutes in this laughable sequel. I said to my housemate after the credits rolled that watching this movie was like eating an insanely hot curry, or camping out at a festival; neither are particularly enjoyable by the end, but at least you can tell all of your friends you did it.",

            "content": "You might be taken aback by my comedic summary regarding my vote to \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\". I guess it's my way of dealing with this horrifying and utterly bleak film, which must be at least partly related to why black comedy exists; people need to amuse themselves and others to cope when it comes to something like this film. It could easily be why the first one is parodied on \"South Park\" in the enjoyable episode \"HUMANCENTiPAD\". In the New York Times interview \"A More Perfect Union\", writer and director Tom Six himself indicated this film has humour, like maybe when there's thunder and lightning when Martin, the main character, gives an angry facial expression to someone. I admit I kind of laughed at that, but I don't think I laughed at anything else. However, I did say things out loud a few times, like probably \"Oh God\" in a dismaying manner. More appropriate, I think.Martin is a demented, obese, and non-speaking man, played very well by newcomer Laurence R. Harvey. Martin works as a security guard in an underground parking garage and has a sexual obsession with the first film. Yup, the first film, which Tom Six also wrote and directed. However, whereas that one has three people sewn together ass to mouth, Martin sets out to have *twelve* for his human centipede. Why? For his own entertainment and sexual pleasure. Talk about an unusual sequel. He violently kidnaps some people in the parking garage. There's not a single bystander around, for whatever reason. I'm not sure if I buy that, but then again, I don't know how much realism Tom Six was going for. Martin keeps his centipede victims in a warehouse and eventually combines ten of them together, which makes my summary even more suitable.\"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\" is in black and white. If it was in colour, especially with little or even no altering, the film would've still been bleak, of course, but as it is, boy, is it bleak. In a good way, nonetheless. It *sort of* reminds me of \"Eraserhead\", a David Lynch film I really admire. Both are eerie, weird, in black and white, don't have much dialogue, involve an infant or two, and have each main character living in an apartment. \"Eraserhead\" is weirder and definitely not as violent, though. If David Lynch saw this film, I wonder what he would think about it.If I look away when watching a film, it's usually because the film doesn't have me interested and not because there's something way too repulsive happening on the screen for me to even look at. With \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\", I never looked away, though I almost did because it did get a bit too boring. Nonetheless, it's mostly effective with its unorthodox storytelling, grungy and downbeat look, and the acting. (I had a bit of trouble believing the couple at the beginning, but that's a nitpick.)There's a lot of human suffering and it largely comes from the victims in the warehouse. Even though they seriously lack characterization, I did care about them, at least somewhat. No sane person wants to go through their ordeal. I should mention I really enjoyed the first film. Even though the victims also lack characterization, they have more going for them and I strangely felt more sorry and supportive for them. It's probably because their pain wasn't overwhelming, they're main characters, and there's more focus on them potentially escaping. Here, the story is told mostly from Martin's perspective. He's definitely not somebody to root for. Why is he twisted? What's wrong with his sexuality? His sexual abuse by his father, whom we don't see in person, probably has something to do with those questions. Probably abuse by his mother, as well, whom he lives with. Yeah, this film hardly explores his past.How come we never see Martin talk? I don't know. I actually don't consider it a flaw, however. I'm so used to main characters talking in films and with the different way it's done here, I didn't mind. He's implicitly characterized, but at the same time, his behaviour is pretty unsurprising. I don't think main characters necessarily have to be likable as if they're a close friend, but they should be interesting, one way or another. It actually seems like we're suppose to feel sorry for him at times, like when his mother lays blame on him to an angry neighbour over something *she* did. I guess Martin deserves some pity there, but when it comes to the film as a whole, you'd probably be wishing him death or having him locked away in a mental institution. I pick the latter. Maybe it'd be interesting if his past was explored and if he used to normally talk, what his dialogue was like, but as the film is, I'm okay with him *as a character*.I didn't like or dislike \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\". It's well shot, even though shots are depressing as hell, especially in black and white. I doubt the film is trying to say anything about someone who's inspired by violence in films to use violence in real life. I don't think the film absolutely should, either. In the aforementioned New York Times interview, Tom Six said that such a person is already insane. He's probably right. In an interesting way, this film ends ambiguously, which I won't spoil how, but the third and final film that's in the works will apparently begin with this film's ending, just like how this one begins with the ending of the first. This trilogy is Mr. Six's film centipede. What the heck is he gonna do with the last one? Maybe it should be a musical.",

            "content": "Human Centipede II (Full Sequence), The (2011)*** (out of 4) Martin (Laurence R. Harvey), a deranged man who was sexually abused by his father, lives his life with his abusive mother who blames him for the father being in prison. Martin, a fan of the film THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE, finally reaches his breaking point and begins to pick victims so that he can create his own 12-person centipede. When THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE was released in 2009 it hit with a storm of controversy and it appeared that the film gained a cult following even before it was released. I found the movie to be well-made but found most of the so-called \"shock value\" to just be hype. I thought the film wasn't nearly as graphic as the filmmakers would like you to believe and the word around the campfire started to build early for this sequel. All sorts of rumors were leaked onto the net about how shocking this film was going to be so does it succeed or was it just more hype? I'd have to say a little bit of both but there's no question that this here is a much better movie than the first. With that said, if you're offended by the subject matter or graphic violence then there's no purpose to see this thing as no matter how well-made it is you're not going to make it through. The first portion of the film is going to remind people of ERASERHEAD as we spend most of the time getting to know this Martin character. On one hand you can't help but feel sorry for the guy due to him being raped by his father and abused by everyone in his life but then again you really can't forgive anything he's going to do on his quest. I really thought the first hour of the movie did a great job at building a sick atmosphere and a very surreal one without having to use any gore or violence. I think the sickening atmosphere created was exceptionally strong and it's do to the visual style and the performance by Harvey. Harvey doesn't get any dialogue so he's just acting his gestures, his eyes and his body movement but he certainly reminded me of Peter Lorre and delivered that same type of creepy performance that you'd expect to see from Lorre. I'm not sure if Fritz Lang's M had any impact on the performance or if the director had it in mind but they are quite similar. The supporting players are fit their parts nicely and that includes Ashlynn Yennie, the actress from the first film who plays herself here. Those wanting the gore and violence won't be disappointed but this here is pretty much saved for the final half hour of the picture. We get some pretty graphic stuff that I won't spoil here but if you're familiar with the original film then it's pretty much the same stuff only much more brutal. I think the smart thing director Tom Six did with this sequel is that he filmed it in B&W. This is the perfect example of why B&W is such a beautiful format and it shows what you can do with it. The shadows, the perfect lighting and just what it adds to the atmosphere. This film would never have worked in color and I'd even say the mostly silent nature of the picture was another very big benefit. THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE II (FULL SEQUENCE) is bound to have many curious viewers checking it out and if your stomach can handle the content then you shouldn't be disappointed.",

I knew of the film and it's reputation and watched it on the basis that i'd really run out of things to watch. It's pretty much what I expected, lots of gruesome and very sick scenes and little plot. The first and by far less grisly half was halfway entertaining but the second half was pure 'torture porn' which isn't my thing. As a result I found it pretty hard to get through, in fact it's as close as i've come to ever being sick as a result of a film. Unfortunately it was hard to care for any of the victims as there was little back story. Due to the subject matter I'm not really sure if it's possible to actually enjoy this film. I certainly didn't enjoy it and won't be watching it again. For what it's worth I thought it was decently filmed and was far from the worst film I've ever seen though it's probably the most repulsive. It's main aim seems to be to shock and it didn't really do this for me other than make me feel sick.

It was also very well-made, and not some crappy and weak thriller. I liked that about it, but at the same time it got a little dull at times. Which is why I was completely excited for the sequel. I wanted it to come in a different style and vain and for it to be so much more gross. Does that say something about my mental health? Anyways, it didn't disappoint.Like the original, the sequel is well-made. The use of black and white gives it a tone of its own, and the cinematography is pretty damn excellent, making use of its textures very well. The script doesn't have much depth in it, but how can it? Many people as opposed to how well made a film is also ask what's the importance of it. What's the importance of this? I'm not sure Tom Six was trying to say anything here... not even sure he was trying to in the original. The thing is, he has complete control of this film and the type of film he wants to make. This is shock cinema at its finest. People go watch horror films, well how about a really horrifying film? It is a question to be asked about films like this. How far do people go to see films like this, and why do we? Michael Haneke pointed out this very question in his film Funny Games, and this film is exactly the type of film he would be pointing at and criticizing. But in fact, he would criticize us... and our reason for watching this. For me, I love me a really gross film. A Serbian Film is still the nastiest film I have ever seen, but that film's second half while nasty left me sorta bored. To me this type of film doing this is the ultimate disgrace it can do- to get you bored. This didn't. It's riveting cinematography, along with the performances, kept me entertained. Kudos not only to Laurence R. Harvey (who manages to be even better than the infamous performance of Deiter Laser) but also to his lunatic mom played by Vivien Bridson. They both manage to give the film a very dark humor tone during many scenes. Then the last 30 minutes, which are definitely too damn disgusting. Many scenes in this film are still in my head, and not just the gross scenes, but also many of the moments of the lead character and his weird mannerisms. I do want to note that I most likely saw the edited version. The unrated is nowhere to be found, so I do want to give the unrated a visit on DVD hopefully. The sequel is better than the original for these simple reasons- it is more disgusting while also being more entertaining and definitely more funny in a twisted way.

            "content": "There's really no way to describe writer/director Tom Six's \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\" on IMDb. It's so grotesque, violent, over-sexualized and exploitive that it's near impossible to describe it in general, let alone here, where reviews should be \"PG\" rated. So I will try my best.\"Human Centipede II\" is a strange hybrid of meta-fiction and satire of itself and of the first film (and is, to its credit, quite funny in a very \"gallows\" humor kind of way), while also being an extraordinarily grotesque and depraved \"body horror film\" at the same time. It's one of those movies that is borderline parody of its own concept (again, in a meta-fiction way), in the same vain as \"Gremlins 2\" or \"The Princess Bride.\"Essentially the plot is as follows- \"Martin\", a mentally handicapped man whom has suffered from rampant abused his whole life, becomes fascinated by the original \"Human Centipede\" film (which is a movie-within-a-movie in this sequel), and begins to kidnap various people in order to re- create the grotesque experiment from the original film.I will not spoil anything else, but the film in its second half, is essentially a much more grotesque remake of the first film, albeit with different characters and different motivations.I really must give credit where it is due. Tom Six has crafted a beautiful film, at least in terms of visuals. The black and white photography has a fantastic contrast and despite being stylized, has an iconic look to it. I also found his direction in terms of camera placement and movement, though a bit over-reliant on the \"shaky cam syndrome\", to be vibrant, kinetic and clear. The film is also well- edited and the atmosphere just reeks of tension and humor.Like the first film, the acting is a mixed bag. Laurence Harvey, whom portrays the villainous \"Martin\" is actually a revelation, delivering a character that so far as I can remember, doesn't speak one work, yet manages to garner a lot of sympathy and horror. He's clearly unable to comprehend (or just unwilling to) the dramatic extent of what he does in this film, and his troubled past, which is alluded to, makes you feel sorry for him despite his sins. Ashlynne Yennie, one of the stars of the first film, returns, this time playing herself, as she is kidnapped by Martin due to her connection to the original film. Other centipede members (12 in all) are played by newcomers, and though I won't go into all of them, they are all adequate, though some sore thumbs bring the score down.The script, as I said, is an extreme and bizarre example of meta-fiction with elements of satire, parody, body-horror, family drama and many other genres thrown in. It's a compilation of differing (and sometimes conflicting) ideas. And it is interesting, though the script suffers at times due to disjointed pacing, clunky dialog and an over-reliance on shocks.All of that being said- I will address the one thing this movie does extremely well, and at times perhaps too well. The gore. This movie is one of the few films I've seen that made me have to look away. I'm a huge gore-hound, and I love my gory movies (I was able to sit through \"August Underground\", \"Cannibal Holocaust\", \"Salo\" and other extreme films), but this film took it to a disturbing new high... or low, depending on how you look at it. Featuring everything from realistic portrayals of teeth being tapped out with hammers, to skin being flayed and stapled, to depictions of graphic sexual violence, this movie will make your skin crawl, and may prove to be too much for even seasoned veterans. Be warned going in.That all being said, I think fans of horror should see this film at least once. I've seen it twice, and I still don't know whether I love it or hate it. It's one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen, but it also has a highly enjoyable self-awareness and sense of humor, and I think that's what sets it apart from other extreme films. I'm giving this a 5 out of 10, because I don't know what else to give it.(EDIT: Upon two more viewings, my affections have grown for this film, and I updated my score to suit its entertainment value and satirical hilarity!)",

Throw in the fact that he randomly likes to soil himself and is sexually obsessed with the original \"Human Centipede\" film and you have an original concept for a sequel that I do not believe has ever been done before. Martin's obsession leads him to create his own 'Human Centipede' this time with not just 3 but 12 segments! The plot takes some absurd twists and turns ignoring the fact that, as a security guard, Martin should be a little more conscientious of all of the security cameras filming his every move and abductions! Logic is thrown completely out of the window in exchange for pure shock value in this one. Consider the fact that, as a security guard who is mentally challenged, it is impossible for Martin to have the medical knowledge required to undergo such a surgical endeavor. Nearly all of the characters in this film are deplorable human beings from the insensitive mother who taunts Martin incessantly throughout the film to their belligerent neighbor who goes on a rampage simply because someone complains about his loud music. Martin even tricks one of the film's original stars, Ashlynn Yennie, into believing that she is auditioning for a Quinten Tarentino film and makes her the head piece of his centipede.

He bathes this lowly story in tons of grime, gore, filth, and excrement. One has to give him some credit: he goes to absurd lengths to make his audience feel as sick as possible. The story takes place in \"reality\", as a supremely twisted loner named Martin (Laurence R. Harvey), the product of a sexually abusive childhood, fixates on the film \"The Human Centipede\", and determines to outdo the maniacal Dr. Heiter. He finds brutalizing and abducting various unfortunate schmucks to be very easy, as he sets about assembling a centipede four times the length of the original. And as Martin sets out to go Dr. Heiter one better, so too does Six set the bar higher than his first film in terms of its dark, unrelenting, disgusting outrageousness. He earns some points for his audacity; often viewers may not be able to believe what they're seeing. And, as mentioned, Martin isn't the only cretin to be found in this story; there was dear old dad, but there's also the depraved Dr. Sebring (Bill Hutchens), who has a yen for the diminutive, corpulent Martin. This is mostly filmed in a stark black & white, and what little burst of colour, I must warn prospective viewers, is of the brown variety. Still, it's hard not to laugh at how ridiculous this gets - there is a definite black humour to be found in the material at times. The expressive but nearly mute Harvey is uncomfortably effective as Martin, and he truly makes the skin crawl. It's amusing to see Ashlynn Yennie, star of the first film, returning to play \"herself\", lured to London under the pretense that she's getting an audition for a new Tarantino film. She and all of the various victims deserve good sport awards for being put through these kinds of paces. Foregoing any sort of opening credits, Six has this sequel just dive head first into the action. And while things do admittedly get a little draggy at times, the climactic money shots do make it worthwhile. This may not appeal to very many tastes - some viewers may find it utterly pointless, or calculated and cynical - but for others, it may be just what a seriously demented doctor would order.

Having literally just finished The Human Centipede before leaving to see this I was quite excited to see what Tom Six would do with this sequel (considering I stayed away from any reviews and spoilers). Well, I must say, Six has produced one of the best genre pieces in quite some time. It's a strange little movie, black and white, with a silent villain and an intense final half hour. It is well known that part of this film is Six responded to the negativity from horror fans of the first film, which was berated for not being extreme or sick enough. Now, I didn't LOVE the first film (I gave it a 6/10), but this was for different reasons. I though Six did a fantastic job with The Human Centipede, the direction and setting were fantastic, and the concept was just so screwed up! Where the first one fell short was the writing and acting from the three victims, which seriously detracted from the horror of the movie. With The Human Centipede II I think there has been a big improvement in writing and acting, but more importantly for Six, an increased amount of depravity.Martin is a parking garage attendant. A loner, with mother issues and who was abused by his father. Already mentally unstable, his fixation with The Human Centipede inspires him to create his own, by knocking people out in the garage, dragging them to an abandoned shed and using kitchen appliances to perform the surgery. The first fifty minutes aren't exactly violent, but still quite good. The scenes in Martin's apartment reek of David Lynch, and are darkly comic. Once Six gets into making the centipede there is a kind of joyfulness about it all that is disturbing, yet still enjoyable. Teeth are knocked out, tendons are cut, flesh is stripped and staple guns are used instead of stitches. The assembly of the centipede isn't the end, and what follows blends very dark humour with some very disturbing imagery.I won't go into anymore detail, needless to say, the uncut version is MUCH better than the cut version. Having read the descriptions of certain scenes in other versions, let me say, they are FAR worse here! So for those waiting for the uncut version you are in for a pleasant surprise. Lawrence R. Harvey, for a debut performance, is fantastic. He is easily one of the best horror villains to grace our screens in years. Meeting him afterwards was a pleasure, he is an incredibly friendly, well-spoken man. The cinematography is fantastic, the whole film has a dirty, grungy atmosphere.On a sad note, the film just got banned in Australia, a disappointing choice by the OFLC. Will this film ever see the light of day in Australia uncensored? Not in the near future. Much like A Serbian Film, an incredible viewing experience has been denied to adults who are able to consent to the films they want to see. I don't want to get into a censorship essay though! 8/10",

Basically a gory, graphic sequel.Laurence Harvey put on a hell of a performance as Martin. This man is so creepy and disturbing; his mannerisms and little gestures he makes when watching The Human Centipede are so awkward, as well as his relationship with his mother make him a very interesting villain character. I watched an interview with some of the cast of the movie which included Laurence Harvey and he is such a genuinely friendly guy with a lot of life in his personality; to see him portray this character impressed the hell out of me, which speaks to his acting abilities.",

            "content": "I saw the original Human Centipede (please don't ask me why). It was okay, for a slightly weird and depraved horror movie. So I guess I felt compelled to watch the sequel.It's a sequel in the same way the Blair Witch Project 2 is a sequel to the first. The Human Centipede 2 starts off showing that the first part was a film and focuses on the creepiest man in London, aka Martin, obsessing about it and wanting to re-enact it.The film's first half is like a London-based version of David Lynch's Eraserhead - full of weird (and horrible) characters all shot in black and white (I don't know why the film is shot in black and white, but it is). The second half gives you what you came for - assuming you came for the gore and general distaste.Now, I'm well aware that horror is meant to scare/disgust/disturb etc, so I don't normally mention the acting ability, but, during those rare moments of dialogue (and there aren't many - it could practically be a silent film) the actors really are pretty bad. Perhaps it's best that they spend most of their time screaming? What's it like? It's hard to say. If you want to be disturbed, the film succeeds. However, if you want a story - forget it. The third act is pretty hard to watch and I found myself looking away a couple of times (but then I did have a knee operation myself - you'll have to watch the film to understand).Fair play to the filmmakers for finding the creepiest leading man in the world and putting him in the sickest film, but don't expect much of a plot. There are numerous plot holes that don't make much sense or aren't too realistic. I hear the censors made the filmmakers make 32 cuts - perhaps that would explain why a few things don't add up? I'm not off to watch something nice and cuddly like a Disney movie to remind me there's more to life than slicing people apart and stapling them to each other.",

            "content": "I just don't get what's the big deal about the original \"The Human Centipede\" movie. Sure, it had a very disgusting premise, but other than that, it was a pretty generic horror movie, with dumb victims that are unable to do anything and a cartoonish villain (Personally, I found Dieter Laser performance in the first film so cheesy and over the top that I wasn't able to take it seriously)While this sequel tries to improve the flaws from the first film giving it some kind of \"arthouse\"/David Lynch wannabe treatment, the final result still leaves too much to be desired, mostly because of the absolutely terrible script and the bland and one-dimensional characters. \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\" starts with a shameless act of self-promotion from Tom Six, who makes the main character of this sequel a fanboy of the original \"The Human Centipede\" film. Why somebody would be so obsessed with such a forgettable and generic horror movie is a mystery to me, but to each his own, I guess.So this guy wants to be like the villain of the first movie, and then he tries to make his own Human Centipede capturing a random group of people, and all of them are easily captured by the fanboy (Seriously, why so many horror movies make the victim characters so dumb and incompetent? I mean, all the people who are captured to make the new human centipede are so unbelievably dumb and unable to have any kind of proper reaction when they are in trouble. Also, there are no cops in this world, or at least somebody able to realize that there is an abandoned baby inside one car) and then we have some glimpses of the pathetic life of this fanboy in order to understand why somebody would be obsessed with such a lame movie as The Human Centipede in first place. Those glimpses of the pathetic life of the fanboy are the best parts of the movie, because at least in those scenes he doesn't act as the generic invincible villain clich\u00e9 that could be found in almost every horror film from the recent times. Other than that, there is nothing of interest here.Stupid. This movie is stupid. It tries too hard to be \"shocking\" and \"edgy\" that it ends failing in every other aspect. It is boring, uninteresting and lame, but at least it tried to be better than its predecessor. And I appreciate that.",

In just two movies, Six has managed to encompass two grand extremes of the horror genre.In The Human Centipede (First Sequence), Six gave us a disturbing yet comedic film, very cleanly shot with a campy, madman of a villain. The film progressed in a very Hollywood style, with an easy-to-follow story arc, plot turns along the way, and just enough implied to disturb the audience.Now, with The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence), Six throws the audience to the far end of the spectrum. HC2 is a dark, twisted and entirely disturbing film of obsession and psychosis. The filming style is extraordinarily gritty and feels more like the video-diary of a deranged psychopath. Every gory and nasty detail is presented in full to the audience, bringing all the implied horrors of the first film to the forefront. There is no clear-cut story arc here, only a driving motivation that the Full Sequence will be realized.Those seeking the laughs of HC1 will instead be treated to gasps, gags and fright. Six has managed to shock even those who saw HC1 by created an expectation in the first film and completely shattering it. Bravo.",

            "content": "I think what really killed the original Human Centipede film was publicity. Normally, publicity for a film is good because if it's causing controversy or causing a debacle, chances are, its box office revenue will be larger. The Human Centipede (First Sequence) would've been a lot better if it was a little cult thing, rather than a big mainstream film. If it had been more subtly introduced to the public rather than boasting its twisted set up maybe I would've felt more excited to see it.Now I'm faced with the sequel. A sequel that we all know would happen. The Human Centipede II comes branded with another gimmicky \"Sequence\" title, this time referring to it as \"Full Sequence.\" It definitely is full of itself, and it definitely is a full dose of shock value and gore. This sequel is so depraved, grotesque, and ugly that any horror fan should feel obligated to watch it.But is it good? That is the question. It truly isn't, but it definitely keeps one thing the same; the elegant way of filming. With a camera in hand, Tom Six can do wonders. He can make the most disgusting concept appealing just by the way he puts it on film. One person I feel for is David Meadows, the cinematographer on the film. If this film wasn't so deranged and twisted, he probably would've been handed some sort of award. The cinematography in this film was truly a great aspect to such an already atrocious concept.The story follows Martin (Harvey), an overweight, asthmatic, clammy-skinned, mentally ill parking garage attendant who becomes obsessed with the original Human Centipede film. Yes, the original film exists in the film as a regular movie. A true paradox. Martin begins to brutally beat people with a crowbar, and soon gets the idea to create a human centipede of twelve people.He lives with his mother, has had one checkered childhood, and suffers verbal abuse from everyone he encounters. Martin believes that since he has garnered so much material from the film and compiled it in a scrapbook, he can make an effective centipede. The result is explicit, and since Martin isn't the sharpest tool in the box, a staple gun, duck tape, and a hammer work more in his favor than a heavy sleeping drug and some stitches.Martin is played Laurence R. Harvey, who does a decent job of putting himself in the role a crazed, mentally unstable human being. Martin doesn't have any lines of dialog in the entire film except for excessive wheezing, coughing, and sobbing. That's an interesting element, but it makes the film easy to drift away from.This also serves as one of the most beautifully done black and white films I've ever seen. The color is greatly saturated, and the tonality of the contrast is exquisite. But, after all, I did rate this film low so instead of praising the minor qualities that made some of the film watchable I should be discussing what made the film bad.Here we go. To begin with, the concept is never going to catch on. It's a sick, idiotic concept that may be medically accurate, but sure isn't sufficient enough for film. Just like my prime complaint with the first film, once you get past the fact that this depraved human being is sewing people from mouth to anus the film becomes incredibly old and uninspired. It's sleepily, if at all, written and combines artless shock in hopes of making a good film.What kind of shock do we get, lovely injections of centipedes where the sun don't shine, extremely bloody torture scenes that could put Saw to shame, a very ghastly scene involving the emptying of bodily waste, and a sick masturbation scene. We also see some more things of great shock, but I dare not spoil them. After all, isn't the gag reflex one gets from seeing these films the only reason why people keep coming back? I have no problem with horror films, but The Human Centipede II is solely created from the ground up on shocking elements. This is more a competition for the most grotesque scenes rather than a feature length film. Yes, Harvey, the cinematography, and the black and white tonality complement the film in a very minor way, but still, it's hard to appreciate a film that is mean-spirited for the point of being mean-spirited.Tom Six says that his next installment will be the final entry in the saga of The Human Centipede. Hopefully after this we'll get to see some more of Six's true talent behind the camera when he is not busy directing one of the world's most sickest creations. He does have talent with a camera, why would he want to waste it on such effortless, artless, and joyless content? Starring: Laurence R. Harvey, Ashley Yennie, and Vivien Bridson.

How is one to find anything of worth in this humorless, continually sadistic, moral-less, repetitive, uncreative piece of something? In a nutshell, a very odd looking, obese character (with a sweating problem just to make him more distasteful than he already is) is infatuated with this director's previous film, taking copious notes on it. He is inspired to emulate the doctor of the previous movie by repeatedly clubbing innocents over the head with a crowbar and/or shooting them and then holding them all captive in a dank garage. Why these characters do not aid each other in the many hours that he is not around is puzzling. They are bound with a few pieces of duct tape. It would take a minimal effort to release the person next to you. Instead, these characters just squirm around on the floor until the wheezing, asthmatic can return to do something else sadistic to them. But, this \"film\" is not about thinking. It's about seeing how many disturbing images can be stuffed into 90 mins of space. Apparently, this director is striving for some sort of title by seeing just how worthless a product he can put out and still get others to pay for it.

The only thing that people actually see in this movie is a psycho stitching together peoples b***holes to other peoples mouths. But this is just what the uneducated splatter-fan sees. Once you take a deep look into the movie you will find just how brilliant it actually is.It is the sequel to the first movie which is flat out trash, but it is trash on purpose! The second movie is a lot more creditable through taking this movie as an actual movie. Through this action the 4th wall is broken, making the movie even more realistic. The uncomfortable and forced proximity towards the disgusting protagonist makes the viewer really uncomfortable, again, on purpose. Through it's black and white look this movie starts to become a lot more up to imagination, splatter effects are enhanced through that.Something a lot of people have not noticed as well is the fact that this movie is an accurate psychological analysis of the mind of a serial killer. Everything, from the protagonist being sexually abused by his father to him being an outcast of society is accurately pictured with the proper consequences these actions have on an individual on a psychological level. His urge to play the divine creator for once, his non-physical love for children and babies, as well as his insecurity in his love and sex-life, his masochistic tendencies and his apotheosis for the original movie just seal the deal. This is such an incredible movie, yet you have to not only watch part 1 and 2 in a sequel in order to understand just why this movie is so great, but you also need some psychological background knowledge. The only shame about this movie is that it had to force a third part, there was no necessity for that, this movie sequel was closed within itself.",

            "content": "I recognised The Human Centipede for the outrageously absurd and blackly humorous piece of OTT exploitation that it was, but not everyone got the joke: there were those who even called for the film to be banned. Quite how anyone could take a film about a mad surgeon creating a living chain of people seriously, I just don't understand, but then people get their knickers in a twist over all sorts of silly things, don't they?For his sequel, director Tom Six tries to make his intentions even clearer, by ramping the violence and depravity to such extreme levels that no-one could possibly take it seriously\u2014or so you might think. As is always the way with this kind of entertainment, there are going to be those who simply have no sense of humour, who cannot see the fun to be had with brutal murder, amateur surgery, and masturbation with sandpaper, and call for the film to be severely cut (as it has been in the UK) or banned outright (as it has been in Australia).Even the unrated US version that I managed to see was bereft of one of the film's most infamous scenes, the 'barbed wire rape' of the rear segment of the 'centipede', but at least the rest was intact, meaning I got to enjoy the majority of the film as Six intended.And boy, it's a doozy!I haven't a clue where Six found the film's star Laurence R. Harvey, who plays Martin, a mentally messed up maniac totally obsessed with the first film, but I doubt a creepier guy even exists. Short of stature, sweaty, slimy, asthmatic, obese, with a look of utter madness in his bug eyes, Harvey simply oozes evil from every pore\u2014I wouldn't want to bump into this guy down a dark alley, that's for sure (especially if he was clutching a crowbar!).Martin is such a fan of Tom Six's infamous movie that he takes it upon himself to create a real-life 'ass to mouth' human chain, even though he has no medical experience whatsoever. Abducting twelve people unlucky enough to stray into his path (including the star of the first film, who he unbelievably dupes into flying to the UK to meet him), the drooling freak proceeds to messily construct his own human centipede, following the methods detailed by Dr. Heiter, the nutter from his favourite film. This set-up allows for plenty of incredibly bonkers gore and general nastiness, as Martin uses extreme force and shoddy surgery techniques to achieve his goal.Of course, simply making a centipede isn't enough for a sicko of Martin's calibre: he really wants to revel in the experience, and in one of the film's most disgusting moments, forces his victims to recreate a key scene from the first film by making them defecate into each others mouths. Other revolting highlights (or lowlights, if you're one of the morally outraged who dislike this kind of thing): Martin bashing his mother's head in with his crowbar; the removal of one victim's teeth using a hammer and chisel; graphic ligament cutting, buttock slicing and mouth stapling; and a pregnant woman giving birth in a car, accidentally crushing the newborn child when she stamps on the accelerator!!!!!!!!!! (there's not enough exclamation marks in the world to do this bit justice).For deliberately going well beyond the bounds of good taste in a shameless attempt to offend, this film is undoubtedly worth a 10/10 in my eyes, but I'm still only going to give it a 9. Why? Because Six has The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence) in the works, and if that should be an even more inappropriate slice of odious debauchery than Part II, as I fully expect it to be, I need to leave myself the opportunity to rate it higher.",

Harvey, again Tom dis well in typecasting, like Dieter Laser (Dr. Heiter)the face of Laurence is really perverted. The movie itself is shot in black and white what gives a more arty look toward the film but I must say that it worked very well with the bloody and gory shots. I even had a big laugh in the beginning were Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) is looking on DVD to the film The Human Centipede. He got ideas from that flick and wants to imitate Dr. Heiter. Naturally he has to capture victims and has to do surgery on the victims. It all starts slowly but after capturing a few victims it becomes bloodier and even creepier because he even has a pregnant one in his maze. The sound do adds the horror to it, it sounded like an ice cream car with bad sound. Once he's trying to make the human centipede the gore comes in. But before that we see his deranged mother and how he solves the conflict he's having with her. More and more the movie goes towards a sickie and the last part is gory as hell.

However, the concept is nowhere near as the original, and not only does it have the same mistakes as the original but it makes more along the way. It still has the stock characters, the bad, cheesy dialogue, the dull acting and the medical errors the original had. I had no problem that this film was perhaps more disturbing than the first, the problem was there is no subtlety to it and it is low on the suspense meter. The amplified flaws come from two primary things. I do have to agree that the ending is one of the most rushed endings recently in any film. The other is the villain, in the original the villain did have many moments where he was genuinely chilling, this villain is so cartoony and over-the-top it is hard to feel any pity or such for him.

            "content": "Hands down, The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) is the most vile and unsettling film I've ever seen, and I am by no means a prude. You can't say I wasn't warned - its predecessor, The Human Centipede (First Sequence), upped the ante in the torture porn genre with a premise involving a mad scientist who abducts three people and surgically sews them mouth-to-anus with each other, leaving the trio with just one digestive tract. Where the hell do you go from there? Apparently, a lot further. Despite my normal disinterest in these Saw-types of movies (and horrors in general), the first Human Centipede had a twisted, novel concept that made for an interesting movie, but not a terribly well-done one. Still, there was just enough there to plant the seeds of interest as to where Dutch filmmaker Tom Six would take its followup. Ohhh, that my scarred eyes could now unsee what perverse sickness Six hath cinematically wrought.The only good thing I can say about The Human Centipede 2 is the on-the-nose casting of screen newcomer Laurence R. Harvey, a 50ish British performance artist. Both Harvey and his \"Martin\" character are the epitome of creepiness, with bulging eyes, greasy hair, bad teeth, and obese body. And as if his physical repugnance wasn't enough, Martin is also saddled with an asthmatic wheeze, some sort of mental handicap stemming from every kind of abuse from his now-incarcerated father, and a lifetime of emotional abuse from his constantly nagging mother, who he still lives with in a dingy London flat. It's the sort of character background composition that feels right off a \"damaged movie character 101\" checklist. Harvey has zero heavy lifting to do as far as remembering dialogue - he speaks no words, only grunting, whimpering, and occasionally cackling maniacally. Martin works as a security guard at a parking garage, where he occupies his time by watching The Human Centipede over and over on his laptop. Yes, that first time around was apparently just a movie; Six's meta concept isn't nearly as clever as he'd probably like to think it is, though. Eventually, Martin snaps and actually starts implementing the movie's ideas, which he's been studiously detailing in a scrapbook. The goal? To \"Frankenstein\" together a human centipede made up of four times as many people as was seen in the inspirational source. The parking garage acts as a victim supply pipeline - a handful of the guinea pigs are just in the wrong place at the wrong time, but most of them are unpleasant people who rub Martin the wrong way. As an extension of the meta concept, one of the victims includes actress Ashlynn Yennie, who appeared in the first film and plays herself here. I genuinely felt sorry for her, as she once again ends up naked on screen with her mouth sewn to someone else's butthole. Ms. Yennie, please fire your agent.The Human Centipede 2 made headlines upon its theatrical release last year when it was banned in Australia and the UK (one of only 11 films ever to be banned by British film censors in the last 100 years). Six must have been ecstatic at the free marketing boost the controversy generated for the movie, which was always intended to primarily be a home video release. 32 cuts totalling 2:37 eventually allowed it to be released on DVD, Blu-ray, and video-on-demand in the U.K. The version I saw had all the gore included, including highly disturbing scenes involving a character pleasuring himself with sandpaper, teeth being knocked out with a hammer, scatological trauma, and a birth scene that goes for a payoff so unbelievably wretched you won't believe it. Six is unable to rein in his button- pushing instincts, leaving The Human Centipede 2 as little more than an orgy of sadism that can't disguise the fact it's also really just a super-sized copy of the original. The filmmaker also makes the questionable decision to present the movie in black and white, presumably aiming for a measure of artistic credibility. And God help us all - The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence) is now in pre-production.",

            "content": "\"The Human Centipede\" is really more of a social experiment rather than an actual film franchise. I mean, why are we so keen on seeing something we know is going to be vile and disturbing? Why did I personally see all these movies, even though they always fill me with disgust and shame (see also: \"Police Academy\")? I'll probably never get it, but with that said: the second one is clearly the best of this epic trilogy. The first one does virtually nothing with its unique premise, the third one is essentially one long in-joke...but this one actually seems close to what director Tom Six was trying to do all along: entertaining an audience through nausea. This is mainly because of new lead Lawrence Harvey, who genuinely puts in a great performance and is just incredibly unpleasant to look at. Dieter Laser looked creepy as well in the first one, but he performed like he could barely remember his lines (which makes sense, because the man barely speaks English). Harvey doesn't have any lines, so that's an improvement I guess. Martin is actually a compelling character, which I thought was far beyond Six' capabilities. If you have to watch a \"Human Centipede\"-entry make it this one, because the franchise won't get any better than this. Which is kind of depressing, but that's the effect these movies have.",

            "content": "Martin (Harvey) lives with his mother in a grim housing estate where he becomes infatuated with the first Human Centipede film. Mentally disturbed, he obsesses over the fictional Dr. Heiter \u2013 from the first movie. Martin soon decides to make his dream of creating a twelve person centipede a reality.Tom Six wrote and directed this sequel to his surprise shock cinema hit of 2009, The Human Centipede. In June 2011, the BBFC refused the film a certificate in the UK, in effect banning it from cinema or DVD release. Eventually realising that banning films in today's information sharing society is a futile endeavour together with a hefty amount of anti censorship pressure, the BBFC granted the film certificate in October with 2 minutes and 37 seconds of cuts.Increasingly popular Shock Cinema combines pornography with ultra-violence and is the today's equivalent of the famed 70's and 80's Video Nasties. The Human Centipede II joins this sub genre, alongside films such as A Serbian film and Antichrist, pushing the moral and ethical boundaries of modern cinema.Harvey does an outstanding job in his debut acting role as the pitiful and twisted Martin, executing an unsettling and terrifying performance, despite not having any dialogue throughout the film. Still, Overall, The Human Centipede II lacks the dark humour and originality of its predecessor and for the most part, feels like a tedious labour through depravity and perversion. The movie should succeed in making most viewers, at the very least uncomfortable, but it fails to surprise or build suspense between shocks. The pacing is painfully slow at times, although it does redeem itself somewhat in the last twenty minutes or so. Die-hard fans of shock cinema will no doubt enjoy it, however, on the whole it is essentially drawn out torture porn without a climax.",

            "content": "Of course they were going to make a sequel to the 'Human Centipede' and of course they were going to try to out do it in every single way. Did Tom Six and crew succeed? Yeah they did. 'The Human Centipede II' is much more gruesome and vile and it puts it's predecessor to shame in a great many ways. Is it a better film than the first one? No not really.A big problem with this movie which really makes me lose a lot of interest in someways is it's \"hero\" Martin. I liked the Dr. Heiter character in 'Human Centipede' a lot better. I really think Deiter Laser gave really one of the better horror performances in recent years as the mad doctor. There was something about his tongue in cheekiness that made that performance fun. He was out there and you couldn't help but both laugh and scream at him. Martin plays like the Marquis De Sade in a mute Fatty Arbuckle. This guy doesn't have any dialogue other than maybe some creepy laughs and fart raspberry noises(I'm sure you can imagine when these might occur). This Martin is like a man child and it's creepy and has some humor of the blackest sort to it. I liked Laser's villain more simply because he was like a James Bond mad scientist on crack. Martin's making his centipede out of stuff you could get at the Home Depot for under $100 bucks and aesthetically it is pretty horrible and so the character has that going for him to a degree.Heiter's lab looks like a day spa compared to Martin's lair. Overall though this general sense of dirtiness is creepy. After a while though it gets kind of silly seeing people kept to floor with mere duct tape. Martin's lack of anesthetic and use of a crowbar get awful annoying fast. You have to suspend your disbelief with Martin pretty far, fine but this semi-real tone just isn't as interesting as Laser and his scene chewing. People going into 'Human Centipede II' have probably already seen and have enjoyed part one on at least some level. 'Human Centipede II' doesn't have any surprises in store for you. It's the same story rehashed to the tee. It leaves much less to the imagination and is certainly dirtier but it is the same film more or less. If you could stomach part one I see you having no problem stomaching two. It's got a lot of disgusting moments to be sure but I suppose that's what you want when you pay to see 'Human Centipede II'. Have these disgusting moments been blown out of proportion by the rumor mill? Yeah they have but that's part of the appeal. Tom Six is a very competent filmmaker pure and simple. This is a vastly well shot and paced movie. I doubt anyone would be talking about these films if we couldn't acknowledge Tom Six has some level of talent. The Black and White cinematography is impressive and is full of presence. There is some color and it is glorious diarrhea brown in the climax of the film. It is to Six's credit that the gross out moments really are effective. Are some parts way too much? Yeah for sure but for what it's worth Six usually hits his targets here with an occasional strike out when he tries hitting a homer. Human Centipede' and it's sequel here are freak shows. I had the pleasure of seeing this film with an audience in a theater managed by movie goers trying to reestablish the grind house feel, around me were posters for Tommy Wiseau's The Room and The Evil Dead, the theater manager introduced the film by saying someone passed out during the previous screening and he explicitly told us where the restrooms were. That's the kind of film 'Human Centipede II' is. There were shrieks and groans and ewwws from the audience. I can't imagine this film would be of any worth without an audience. The film is extreme enough where I don't think I'd like watching it alone very much. It's a midnight movie plain and simple. Will it offend people? Yes but these people probably aren't going to see it. I appreciate Tom Six in a weird way. These films aren't masterpieces but they are fun in that they troll the hell out of Roger Ebert and would be cinema-intellectuals. You're either in Tom Six's audience or so far out of it you'll want to make sure he doesn't have one so nothing I can say will do anything. It's here and you know what it is. If you want to \"swallow\" it go ahead...",

There was a genuine morbid curiosity that drew a lot of people to the original (and they got exactly what they wanted). What separates the normal people from the rest of us is the fact that some of us, knowing exactly what to expect, came back to this franchise for a second helping.\nPicking up with the ending of the first film, this one follows a sick-minded man who, after seeing the Human Centipede film, decides to replicate it in his own life. The resulting product is perhaps even more shocking and revolting than the original because, without access to the medical tools and technologies Dieter Laser's evil doctor did in the predecessor, the results are spotty at best. And there's something just satisfying about seeing black and white excrement come flinging its way toward the camera, and knowing that Tom Six was able to not only get away with shooting it, but with releasing it to the public. What a beautiful accomplishment.\nThis movie is a little more slow-moving than the first one, seeking to try to create a continuity between them and deepening the plot. The mute main character was a little hard to invest in as a viewer and it did take a little bit too long to get to the \"action\" (so to speak), hence the lower rating compared to the original.",

            "content": "First, let me start off by saying that there's virtually no point in seeing this movie if you don't want to be disturbed, violated, and disgusted. Let's just be clear. If you're complaining about the gore and the epic gross factor, well, you shouldn't have even turned it on to begin with. It's called the Human Centipede, for crying out loud.The first Human Centipede was a film that I found mildly entertaining. The premise was certainly unique, but it dragged slightly at times and after the initial shock wore off, I was pretty bored. With that being said, the premise of HC2 makes HC1 worthwhile.Martin is a mentally disturbed sexual sadist, who gets his rocks off by watching and fantasizing about HC1. His dream is to recreate the human centipede (with no medical training...interesting!) with not three unlucky victims, but twelve. Martin's development was compelling to watch, but then again, I'm a behavioral analyst. His relationship with his mother, father, and therapist all lead you to understand and at some points near the beginning, actually sympathize with this demonic character. Let me be clear, though, this is one disturbed son of a b*tch. Without ruining some of the plot, you'll be waiting for the climax of the relationship between Martin and his mother and it does not disappoint.In terms of Martin's victims, you really aren't meant to grasp their personalities. Attachment to these people really isn't recommended, especially considering what they're about to endure. It's almost better that you watch the film and consider them strangers. The torture they endure is...inexplicable. As I said earlier, you better be prepared for a gruesome, gory, horrific film. If you aren't, please heed my warning and DO NOT WATCH.I gave this film 8 out of 10. I enjoyed the development of Martin's psychosis as the movie went on. We discover he had all the makings of a sadist, and he really didn't stand a chance. When I tune into a horror movie, particularly one with shock value, I'm not looking for tame. I have never been more disturbed by a film. That's the reason I appreciate this film more than HC1. Watch with an empty stomach and an open mind, or don't watch at all.",

            "content": "Sequels are a tough commodity nowadays, with the majority of them being cash-ins just so the makers can make some extra bread. That's not a bad thing mind you, as everyone needs to make a living, but on an artistic front it sucks balls. You could argue that Human Centipede 2 was also made to deepen the pockets of Mr. Tom Six. But where his sequel differs from most of the other sequels out there is that, he actually did try improving on his second effort. He listened to his critics and his fans and put his thinking cap on to deliver a film that exceeded the original in every way possible \u2013 and I believe he did just that.With the original, we witnessed a Mad Scientist torture and mutate a trio of humans into a weeping, crawling, pooping machine. I thought it worked, as the doctor delivered a good enough performance to carry the film. So how can you improve upon a Mad Scientist? You don't get much cooler than a raving scientist. Just ask Professor Farnsworth. One way to work things out is to think in the absolute opposite direction. And in this case, taking the polar opposite route worked brilliantly. Instead of a handsome, fit, and fiercely intelligent German scientist, we're delivered\u0085.well, I don't wanna be mean, but we're delivered the opposite\u0085in the shape of a small rotund British man named, Martin.Martin lives at home with his Mum, and works as an overnight security guard for a building's parking lot. The overnight gig not only puts food in his belly, but also gives him the opportunity to watch movies. I mean, movie. Martin, like any dedicated fanboy, watches his favorite movie, The Human Centipede nonstop. He's put together a collage book. He obsesses over the pretty girls in the movie. He has a pet centipede. He is quite simply fixated with all things Centipede. So much so in fact, that he's already initiated the process of creating his own Human Centipede \u2013 but this time with a dozen people. Martin thinks he can do it. He's got the passion, he's got the plan, and now he just needs the bodies.With basically the whole story revolving around Martin's Centipede escapades, the film obviously has to deliver in other areas besides finding ways to attach faces to butts. Martin, psycho serial killer In the making, must surely have some type of back-story, right? He's not just an obsessed fan, right? Right. A much smaller secondary story resides in Martin's living situation with his dear ole Mum. I'm not going to ruin anything here for you, but let's just say Martin's past and present has been riddled with misfortune. So much so, that there are moments where you may be sympathetic towards the guy. Not sympathetic towards his goals, but towards his mental state. The Mother Son story delivered for me. It's been there done that stuff, but it was handled well, and of course, with Six's atypical touch.To clear things up, the cut version of HC2 is no slouch. As a movie that is supposed to up the ante, it most certainly does. It improves upon the story, the lead character, the violence and everything that entails, and it also shows that Tom Six has improved as a director. Credit must be owed to Six in some way for helping the first-time actor, Laurence R. Harvey (Martin) deliver the performance he did. He didn't speak a single line, and still managed to convey a deeply troubled soul. Big ups to both you guys.The Human Centipede, title alone, is reason enough for many to scoff, but that's fair, as it's pretty easy to judge this book by its cover or title. Assuming critics and disappointed detractors of the first will probably be overly judgmental and harsh, but not I, and not you! We both personally applaud the ideas, and willingness to push cinematic envelopes. The movie isn't perfect, and anyone with a clue can realize that, but as a sequel (and a horror film), it's legit, and tries to be a true sequel \u2013 succeeding at becoming a movie unto itself. A horrid, ugly tale of mental psychosis that's spliced with nightmarish fanboy heresy all sewn together to create an altogether abnormal horror film that will have you seeing brown.I look forward to checking out the uncut verison as I hear it may be a bit different. One thing is for certain and that's I can definitely see myself rewatching this film, rewinding it, and rewatching it again\u0085and again\u0085and again\u0085and again\u0085Now - I pretty much stand by this review and have since seen the uncut version with sandpaper and barbwire intact, and it's all just extra good fun.",

I only mentioned that because over half of the negative reviews of this film only say that this movie is sick. Lawrence R Harvey played his role so well.

I think it being banned in a few countries was the best way to advertise this film, as otherwise it would be a very quickly forgotten sequel to an awful original film.In truth, this is better than the first one, there's actually some sort of storyline, and the mood of the film is very 'clockwork orange' like.Don't get me wrong, it's not a good film, not by a long shot. But it's OK, I like the storyline, of a socially retarded man, who doesn't speak throughout the film, taking revenge on all that do him wrong and putting them in the centipede.The actual centipede sequence, although the climax of the film, doesn't last long and is actually not the main focus of the film.

And you might be fooled if you do partake in this; like most movies, it does start off a tad bit gross, but then not only gets progressively more rancid, it becomes downright immoral towards the end. (SPOILER(!) \u2013 just two words: Newborn Baby. AHHHH!)So, why 5/10 stars? Sadly, I still had to account for a well-made feature. Sure, it's black & white, but I doubt anyone could take a color version. Beyond that \"novelty\" it contains a SuperVillain, someone that pulled off the everyday man (with no six-pack, though he looks as if he drinks six of those a day) and never spoke in the movie. Nicely, they make sure you know he's not mute \u2013 other characters speak of what he had previously talked about and he makes calls on his cell all the time. This Laurence R. Harvey, aka \"Martin\" (there's a creepy momma's boy name) did a fantastic job of being that horrible person next door that \"could never do (what he did).\"Also, though some of the movie is entirely improbable, most of it is sadly possible. What this character did to torture the movie's victims unfortunately can happen. (Jumping ahead) And I never thought I would ever mutter these words: When someone has uncontrollable diarrhea in your mouth and you have absolutely no choice but to swallow the bulk of it\u0085that's the VERY LEAST of these innocent humans had to endure.Further, as much as I appreciated the \"original\" idea of the first one, and the acting and creativity of that film's villain, this movie is actually a step up in regards to giving the audience what it wants \u2013 more gore and more of a, well, human centipede. This one was not the cheesy B-Movie the first one glorified. This was a real creeper, and looks more like the more serious horror movies of the 70s/80s than the B-horror-movie of the week back then.Finally, in regards to the 5/10 decision\u0085I feared that this movie stole from the horrible Blair Witch 2 idea \u2013 which at the time (before the movie opened, that is) I thought was one of the most original ideas I'd ever heard of. They made a sequel that acknowledges the first is a real, albeit fictional, movie and new characters react to that movie. This film certainly took that idea hundreds of feet further \u2013 lonely parking lot attendant Martin watches The Human Centipede DVD REPEATEDLY and wants to finish the job the mad doctor, who died in the first one's finale, started by means of a 12-person Human Centipede VS the original's piddily little three-person one. I sincerely hope writer/director Tom Six (of both features) wasn't trying for a Natural Born Killers theory of people taking entertainment media too far \u2013 for, Six created both movies!That all said\u0085DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Aside from the minor details I've given away that won't make much sense unless you do, and you've been warned, see this\u0085I've given you all you need to know. I've seen a lot of disgusting movies; some good, most awful and a few just gory for the singular sake of gore.

I personally like it more than the other two films of the trilogy, it seems grittier and darker, in part due to being shot in black and white. The acting for this type of film is actually not bad, better than what I expected it to be. Now what I don't understand are all the negative reviews about this film, mainly accusing it of being extremely gory, violent, disgusting, etc. It seems as if the people who wrote such reviews thought they were going to watch another sequel to Lion King or something... The title alone should be a good indicator, along with the trailer (!) I mean, if you hate gory violent films, then watched the trailer for this film and still decided to go see it, you must have been either drunk or are a masochist. It's like a vegan who goes to a steakhouse and then writes a bad review about it because they eat meat there - what a surprise, right?... But for those who like horror and don't find this sort of material offensive, this is an entertaining, grotesque movie with lots of dark humor. I gave it 7 stars since it's not a great film really but, for what it is, it's fun and, very importantly, not pretentious, like so many horror films nowadays with directors who take themselves way too seriously.",

            "content": "WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING!!!! Will Ferrel playing mad scientist? Maybe a Disney production where Love triumphs regardless of everything thrown at it? This is not 1931, where in order for your mind to be at piece, the scene of Frankenstein's monster killing the little girl has to be cut and forever lost. Yes, the film in question, definitely is sick and disturbing, but is just that, a make believe on a movie screen, and it must be evaluated on itself. Regardless, it seems that every one that reviewed it as a bad movie was trying to protect others from this nightmare because that's what it is! It's disgusting yet masterfully created, to every conceivable detail on Tom Six's sick mind.I tried to respect your perspective, but being fair I have hardly ever found another monster as \"Martin\" portrayed not just as the \"Norman Bates\" of this decade or \"Willard Stiles\" and the acting and direction is near perfection (except for the mom). One of the reasons that makes this a good movie is that we found someone so disconnected with reality, without a single speck of remorse, and still capable of \"Loving Sympathy\" towards a child, that makes us wonder for how long will still be a civilization. Maybe you would have preferred a lot of CGI, and scarlet blood, but if you dislike it in B&W, probably you would have had a heart attack if this movie has been made in full color. Let's mention that \"The Elephant Man\" was filmed in Black and white to protect the makeup and give to the film the feeling of time, (particularly I love black and white films). And I believe the making on B&W of the centipede II, serves, to protect not just the lack of FX, but the viewers at the same time. As I read some of the reviews I felt like some people expected to see immediately the \"Human Centipede\". instead the filmmaker build for us in the first part the main characters, slowly and precisely enough to give us their reasons and motives, and this is what I call the process of filmmaking, as I say if you do not understand a truly Horror movie, stick yourself to Ghostbusters and feel at ease, or if your daring is not that limited watch \"Dexter\" every week, but don't step into unknown world where your sensibility will affect your judgment,and as proof of bad, there's truly abominations as \" August Underground\" that lacks everything that could be considered as a movie. So for me, \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\" is better than the original and unfortunately for me, I can't wait for the next install of it, and probably with Hollywood involved on it, it is going to suck big time,! If you saw the first film, you knew what could be in store for this sequel! If not, you were blindsided by whoever recommend or drag you to see it. Still you do not have an excuse The movie opens with a WARNING of what you are about to see, so don't cry foul and blame the concept for it! Certainly I felt compelled to look away, certainly I needed to pause it and go away for a minute to breathe fresh air, still this movie is not sicker than \"Martyrs\", or \"Inside\", but I can't turn away just because I feel offended, nowadays, TV, shows, some of the things we saw and heard on it, and many of you take it with a laugh, c'mon, grow up, I felt more offended and horrified with Miley Cyrus' MTV VMAs performance, why? Because no one warned me about the twerking of such tweaker!",

First off I am a lover of films that push boundaries and appreciate titles such as a Serbian film, martyrs, irreversible, etc. This movie has absolutely no plot except for the obvious: a mentally disturbed man is obsessed with the first film and decides to make his own human centipede. The movie essentially consists of him capturing/killing people, creating a sloppy human centipede, and then killing them all after he is satisfied that the 12 person digestive track works. I enjoy the sensation of being genuinely disturbed by a film or laughing at over-the-top gore but this movie didn't really fulfill either. I attribute this mainly to the pointlessness of the movie in itself, but also just the general look and feel of the movie was not to my taste. There is nothing original or ground breaking about this movie, I feel like there wasn't even any thought put into it except with the goal to disgust people. The first film had an original idea, was executed well, and stayed true to the horror genre. None of these things can be said about the sequel. The only satisfaction I got out of the movie was laughing at how ridiculous it was.",

I have no idea who did the cinematography or if the director is to praise for it, but it's really well done. While some people call the BLACK AND WHITE effect \"pretentiously artsy,\" I disagree. It adds to the film and even makes it seem sort of like a demented dream combined with the great cinematography. Laurence R. Harvey... he pulls off an exceptional performance as the psychotic fan of the first film who wishes to put together a \"real\" human centipede. And who NEVER SPEAKS A WORD, a decision I compliment. Really adds to the creep factor.The movie succeeds in it's goal of being really GROSS. It really pushes it with disturbing imagery like a man cutting several people open, staple-gunning them each other mouth to anus, him beating his mother's head in, the famous crapping into each other's mouths scene, and a pregnant lady squishing her just born child to death. Jesus, that last one still gives me the creeps.BADThe few seconds the girl from the first movie ACTS... it's just bad. She was good in the first one because it seemed like it was trying to be a crappy b-movie... this one it's just out of place with the talent of Laurence R. Harvey stealing the show. Either way, doesn't really matter, just a nit-pick. There has to always be one, right?VERDICTGreat movie, not for everyone.

There was never really a chance to connect with the characters so there was no tension during their torture /surgery scenes. All you had to do was sit back and watch the gore.

Not only that but Martin is also obsessed over the DVD of \"The Human Centipede\", which he watches repeatedly and endlessly on his laptop at work; and at home he keeps a collection of cuttings and screen shots of the movie in his scrapbook. Even taking to the extremes of.. using sandpaper and getting off while watching it. Using sandpaper while getting off is just.. something else. He must have been sore.. anyway. It also becomes clear during the movie, that Martin has suffered some form of serious sexual abuse from his father which indeed has played a large part in his psychological state of torment. Martin's obsession soon turns into reality, when he drastically decides to re-create the events from the original movie. Only this time, he is no doctor, there's no surgical procedure with Martin, he mutilates and butchers his victims to attach them anus to mouth with simple tools: hammers, stapler, pliers, cutting tools and the rest! Oh, did I mention he does use a screen shot of the original movie's procedure to help him on a bit? Yeah. The guy who plays the role as Martin? Just perfect. His acting in this role was simply amazing.The Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence is definitely a very grim and dark movie. It is in black and white, which seems to fit in perfectly with the grim and dark tone. When I first heard it was black and white, I wasn't going to actually watch it, but Tom Six definitely made the right choice, although apparently having been shot in colour. It works very well. With the first movie, very little of the detail was actually shown. The actual procedure wasn't graphic at all, with just a few bits shown here and there, and then kaboom! A human centipede is before your eyes. In this sequel, there's nothing really left to your imagination. It's like part 1 all over again (Well with a mad man wanting to create a human centipede!), except a lot more extreme and sadistic. No punches are pulled in its depiction of showing barbaric, cruel violence. Not only that, but Martin takes a lot of pleasure in seeing his work of... art maybe? Well let's just say Martin sees it as art anyway.In saying all that, the movie's not to be taken serious. If you're going to watch this movie, knowingly what it's about, who are you to complain about it? You watched it - deal with it. I mean, sure it's graphic and there's literally sh*t in your face all the time... but hey, that's what you get when you try creating a human centipede like Marty boy! If you decide to watch it, my advice? Watch part 1 first, and if you think it's obscene, nasty, and vulgar, then you definitely avoid this part at all costs. If you loved part 1, and didn't take the movie serious, but just a good horror movie, then you'll be happy to view Martin's idea of his Human Centipede! Watch with caution, though, and not with a plate of food with you.I must say, The Human Centipede 2 is a refreshing piece of film-making! I give it 8/10. Truly grim, and kept me watching to the end.",

People can look at a film like Cannibal Holocaust or Salo and say the same thing, but they'd be wrong, as those movies had a purpose behind them, no matter what your personal opinion might be; there was an aim to those films instead of simple shock, and terror. However, The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) is just a terrible film with only shock value, and it doesn't really work on that level either. For many horror fans, a feeling of desensitization has come over them, and even though this is definitely a sick film, it isn't as shocking as it would like to believe, or as its fans would have you believe. What truly terrifies me are moments that mix some shock value with a legitimate scare, and not something to just stimulate your visual repulsion; the way David Cronenberg uses body horror to embody themes comes to mind, but is certainly not present here. We get none of those types of moments, but simply just more people defecating in mouths, chained from rear end to throat, and it's pure shock with no substance whatsoever.I can't recommend not seeing this movie more than with a 1 out of 10 stars rating. As a cinephile, I'm willing to watch anything simply for the possibility I might find hidden gold. Here you will find no treasure, and I'm not able to give this a zero rating, but it deserves it.

I was appalled at the original film and I am appalled at this sequel just the same. I love horror films, I really admire the effect they have on the viewer and (usually) their creativeness. This film definitely has an effect on the viewer and is arguably creative, to a certain extent, but lacks any inspiration or quality purpose whatsoever. It's only goal is to torture the viewer and if that's what you're looking for than this may be the movie for you but I can't give it any credit for that. This second installment treats the original film as just a movie and revolves around an obsessed fan of it. Laurence R. Harvey stars as Martin Lomax, a 'man child' who still lives with his mother (Vivien Bridson) and works at a parking garage where he spends a lot of his time watching the original film over and over again. Martin was sexually abused by his father and is now verbally abused by his mother and that's all the reason were given for Martin's sick and demented ways. We watch in terror as Martin begins making his fantasy of imitating his favorite film a reality (this time involving a twelve person centipede). The movie is about as painful and sickening a film-going experience as I've ever had and was honestly, arguably one of the worst experiences of my life. So if you enjoy life and are not a sadomasochist I'd recommend staying away from this film. Of course if that sounds more like a recommendation than a deterrent than this might be the movie for you. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that will love it. Writer/director Tom Six obviously has some talent and originality he just hasn't found a good way to show it yet, I hope some day he does.Watch our review show 'Movie Talk' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhQaTxuL7SQ",

I am relinquished with this quandary: what has this world come to? What has happened to the world when a film like the Human Centipede plaques the cinema. This is disgusting and everyone who likes this movie should be ashamed of themselves. I don't understand how a film like this can be released with the terrors going on in the world and the atrocities that are far too similar to this film. I honestly believe that these movies should be banned. Horror films have become nothing but putrid freak shows that only appeal to sick disturbed minds. Ironically the film brings up a point.

Part two, well it is a step back.Sure I will give it that it is more bizarre, extreme, gritty and messed up than the first movie was. But where as the first part was actually driven by a story, part two is just driven by a compulsion to be as extreme as possible and to surpass the previous movie in bizarreness.\"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\" is about Martin, a disturbed man who is obsessed about the movie \"The Human Centipede\", and wants to create one himself, nay, better yet, outdo the work of doctor Heiter in the movie and make a twelve-person centipede. It requires some heinous work, but Martin is so far beyond sanity that it is not a matter of if he gets the victim, but a mere matter of how.Right, well there is something that resembles a storyline, however it was drowned out in the outrageous attempt to be as sickening, perverted and twisted as possible - in the terms of what was shown on the screen. And that was a shame, because a better storyline would really have helped the movie better along. Everything in this movie was basically seen in part one, it was just taken a couple of steps further beyond what was seen in part one.And one thing I don't personally understand is why Tom Six opted to shoot the movie in Black & White. It just doesn't make sense. He said the movie would be much scarier in black and white. Hardly so. There were so many gory and ghastly details that were lost in the lack of color. Had the movie been in color, then the impact from the bizarre and disturbing scenes in the movie would have been that much more impressive.I will say that actor Laurence R. Harvey (playing Martin) really did an excellent job in portraying this depraved and psychotic character.Entertainmentwise, then \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\" was a step back compared to the first movie.

Martin never speaks throughout the film he coughs and cries he lives for his obsession to The Human Centipede film, he has a scrap book which he keeps as his favourite item until his mother tears it up in anger. His rage at this ends in him caving her face in with his crowbar which he uses to knock out his victims in the car park. His job as a car park attendant gives him choices to pick his victims to make his version of the human centipede, once he dumps them in a empty warehouse all bound up with duct tape when he gets his 12 people he then tries to copy what he has seen on the film, here it's a bit different as in the human centipede 1 the doctor actually medically joined digestive systems to each one but Martin lets say joins them up using staples to join mouth to anus so the only way to make them defecate is an injection of laxative to each one and then he found this most entertaining but surely the ones that had to swallow this foulness could have choked.",

I'm a fan of old and new, and I will give any of them an optimistic viewing. Over the past couple years, I have become very intrigued by disturbing movies. I love a good \"gore-fest\" occasionally, but the ones that leave you thinking \"What the #@?! did I just watch?!\" are the ones that really get my attention.Anyway, I was online researching my next \"brain-scarring\" flick, and I came across this article with the headline \"Most disturbing movie ever made?\". It instantly got my attention! I read about \"The Human Centipede: First Sequence.\" I had to check it out, so I found it online and gave it a watch. My wife walked by and was like \"what are you watching?\" I gave her a quick description of what it was about, and she literally gagged a little! Lol! Eventually, I convinced her to watch it, and she actually made it through in one sitting. I can handle anything, and the first movie was clearly made to mess with your head and not to scar you visually.I actually met director Tom Six (VERY nice and approachable guy, by the way) at the \"Texas Frightmare Weekend\" convention this past spring, and he described the upcoming sequel as one that \"will make the first one look like 'My Little Pony'\". He wasn't kidding! After meeting Tom Six and Dieter Laser at the convention, I was SO anxious to see this sequel. When I caught wind of its midnight screening in Dallas, TX, I told my wife that we HAD to make the hour trip and see it! I was DEFINITELY not disappointed! It made the first one look VERY tame. A couple times I had to turn to my wife and remind her that \"it's only a movie.\" Kinda like the tag-line for \"The Last House on the Left.\"Now...on to the review...In this movie, we meet a man named Martin, a late night parking garage attendant. We quickly learn that he is a VERY disturbed man, living at home with his somewhat neglectful mother and constantly haunted by recurring memories of his childhood trauma caused by his molesting father. His mother actually scolds Martin daily for his father being locked up. All of that alone is enough to twist anyone's mind. The only comfort Martin can find is watching his DVD copy of the first \"Human Centipede\" movie in the privacy of his parking garage booth. He becomes so obsessed with it, that he decides that he wants to up the ante and create his own \"centipede\" constructed of 12 people. So, he waits in his booth nightly and attacks and kidnaps random people, taking them to an abandoned warehouse. Once he has them gathered, his twisted dream becomes a reality in VERY VISUALLY GRAPHIC form! For example, Dr. Heiter was a very skilled surgeon who used the proper medical procedures to create the first human centipede. In this movie, Martin is CLEARLY no surgeon and performs the demented construction using NO anesthesia and only household items, such as a hammer and a staple gun. That's just the tip of the iceberg...it gets worse! In my personal opinion, this movie is more disgusting than disturbing. (A Serbian Film is #1 on my list of DISTURBING films.) Even so, this movie is definitely not for the faint of heart, or the squeamish, but if you think you can handle it and loved the first one, then check it out! I can't wait for the third installment: \"The Human Centipede: Final Sequence\"! In the words of Tom Six, THAT movie will make THIS one \"look like a Disney film\"! Gives you something to look forward to, huh?",

            "content": "Anyone who finds either of the human centipede movies entertaining probably has something not quite right about them, but I don't think that 'entertainment' is Six's intention; he's rather attempting to explore the depths and potential of human depravity in the most realistic and stripped down way possible.The acting in No.1 isn't exceptional so it misses the mark a little, but No.2 is right on target in this regard, it's like being present at a crime scene; having a camera's eye view of the daily life of a genuine product of extreme abuse, a twisted deviant homicidal psychopath, and yet Six still manages to elicit a little sympathy (through gritted teeth) for the main character, and humour (of the darkest kind) from his largely unwilling but powerfully compelled audience.The movie is irredeemable in many ways because of what it is so it's never going to get a particularly positive reception or review from any relatively sane and balanced person, but you do have to take your hat off the Tom Six for the masterful execution of his craft, dark and twisted though it's context is.Keep an eye out for Tom Six as a possible next big thing. Peter Jackson was a rough equivalent of his time; a master of the darkly humoured shock horror genre who eventually worked his way into the mainstream and has since produced (some) exceptional material. I think Tom Six is potentially a better director than Jackson if he can live in the mainstream (or if the mainstream can live with him).",

In fact, nearly every character in this film is disgusting.But the ultimate goal of this film is to shock, and believe me when I say, it does. It's filmed in Black and White, and makes the film feel cold and dirty, thus making you feel bad.I'm not a squeamish person, but this really did take it's toll on me, and I don't just mean the parts that have been cut. but characters, and the scenes with the victims are just sometimes too hard to watch.It's a good concept movie, done by Craven already, but everything Six has meant to, he has achieved.I can't recommend this film, despite my score, it's the kind of film that needs to be seen, but I wouldn't lend the Blu Ray to anyone.Gaurenteed to offend, and anger people, but Six will be laughing I guess.",

            "content": "So I made the fun mistake of buying not only the first Human Centipede, as I was expecting something good, but with that I bought the sequel. I decided to give the sequel a chance as the director said this time that he was just going for good fun and the film was \"100% inaccurate\". At least being honest this time, I figured I should check it out still. Well, given Six some credit, he definitely went all out for this one and really \"upped\" the gore factor. While the first film I did not get grossed out at all, I have to admit that there are some cringe worthy moments in this one.In the tollbooth of a parking garage in rainy London, Martin Lomax \u2013 a short, obese, asthmatic man is watching The Human Centipede on his laptop computer. Martin is obsessed with the film and he keeps a centipede in a glass terrarium and maintains a detailed scrapbook of the film. Martin is intent on recreating the fictional experiment of connecting people mouth-to-anus but desires to connect 12 people. Martin acquires a dingy, dimly-lit warehouse. He begins abducting people from the car park to use as \"segments\" by knocking them unconscious with a crowbar, then binding their hands and feet with tape and driving them to the warehouse. Once Martin has his twelve victims, he begins assembling his centipede. But how far will he go to make the ultimate centipede? Well, if you've seen the first film, at least Six isn't claiming this one to be \"medically accurate\".The good parts of this film is the performance by Laurence R. Harvey who plays Martin, the villain behind this centipede. Just like the first one, the villain is who we really get into. He's despicable, horrifying and just plain dirty and unforgiving. He tortures his victims horrifically and does not let go of your nerves. He's scary to look at and just makes you uncomfortable the whole way through. Also I give much credit on the black and white, it was more disturbing in that factor. I don't know, but black and white always seemed creepier to me because it's much darker. This film has a very dirty feeling to it as the first one has a more surgical clean cut to it.The bad, where do I start? First off, I think the director really is full of himself. I totally get what he was going for in this film where he is telling his critics not to take him seriously, but it's almost like he doesn't want you to like his movies and is just plain going out to tick people off. I don't mind if you want to gross people out, but that doesn't make it a good film or unforgettable, it just makes it stupid at times. Also I'm happy the gore factor was lifted big time with this sequel, but there were some things that were not necessary and makes you wonder how much love Tom Six got as a baby since he has a man raping a woman with barbed wire wrapped around his penis. He has people not just defecating in each other's mouths, but actually putting diarrhea into it. Then to top it off, he has a mother give birth to a baby and she crushes the baby's skull. Then at the end, we're left with a \"was it real or not?\" conclusion which to me was a cop out with this movie. Like the first film, there are good points and there are bad one's. Now if you hated the first film, you're going to hate this one too. If you liked the first movie, you might get a kick out of the sequel. Tough call, but I'm going to go take a couple showers.4/10",

            "content": "The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) (2011) - The Good, the Bad and the Sweaty Synopsis: A dull-witted, maniacal misfit named Martin becomes enamored with Tom Six's \"The Human Centipede (First Sequence)\" and decides that he is going to construct his own twelve-person version. What Martin is lacking is any medical experience... and sanity.The Good: Tom Six knows how to push the right buttons, I'll give him that. I believe most will hate this movie because of the content, but I personally think this film is of very good quality from a cinematic standpoint. The decision to shoot in black and white is a good one as it captures the lack of human compassion and humanity very well. Martin's mind is bereft of color, so it is only fitting the film match his mood. The camera work is excellent as well. From a purely cinematic view, this is a very well constructed film and it looks exactly as Six wants it to... grimy and degraded. The film is all about the lowest common denominator and many just don't want to see that... and that is perfectly fine. But if you are standing there with a movie titled \"The Human Centipede\" in your hand and you don't think you are going to see something disgusting and controversial, I think you are misguided from the very start. Especially when you are viewing a sequel... because that means you already saw the first. What were you expecting? So for me, you have to take the film at face value. The old clich\u00e9 \"it is what it is\" is certainly applicable here. This film delights in the character of Martin and pushes the boundaries of depravity and what the human mind can sink to when the right cocktail of abuse and mental illness is shaken and stirred. Never has an actor been so well cast as Laurence R. Harvey as Martin. The fish-eyed, potbellied Harvey is absolutely brilliant in his role. He not only disgusts you with his filthy, seething personality, but he effectively baits you into feeling sorry for his insipid life at times. He reminded me of a real-life Gollum. He is a villain, no doubt, but he is also a very stained and misguided person who has lost part of his humanity through experience. That can be a powerful mix if played right and Harvey succeeds.The Bad: As with all shock-based horror, you feel a bit guilty after watching it. Is it just torture porn (a moniker I personally hate... because almost all horror is violent)? Is it time-worthy to watch something so dark and twisted? The film does what it sets out to do and that is make you feel like you need a shower. That is success in this particular niche of horror, but the question still remains on whether or not it's a tale that needs to be told. Do people really want to see this? Even though I liked the movie in general, I found myself asking if I really should have watched it and why I had a desire to watch it. I watched it with my wife and she was far more disgusted than I was and was morally convicted - even though she saw the first and was fair-warned that I had heard this one was worse. At the end, she swore she would never tell anyone she actually watched it. While I won't go that far, I understand her opinion. It's offensive, plain and simple. As for the acting and all that, I thought it was fine. The concept of the movie was well-thought out and well translated to film. The question still remains whether or not it ever should have been made in the first place. I would still answer yes, although I suspect I am in the minority and honestly, you can ask that same question of any horror film out there.The Sweaty: This movie had my skin crawling more than any movie in recent memory. From the constantly sweating and out of breath Martin, to his dingy apartment and dank, dark warehouse, everything is just alive with squalor. It is meant to enhance the depravity of the character involved and be a visual symbol of the personal and mental torture he has endured. There are parts of the film that I found went a little too far, but as a whole, this film is about making you feel uncomfortable. It definitely does that. Everything in this movie reeks of decay and foulness. One look at Martin's sweat-soaked head did it for me. Okay, time to take another shower.....",

This is one of those movies where you wait in anticipation for months and months and are filled with joy when you are finally able to watch it (yes, I love my horror films lol).To start off my review I wanted to point out that this movie to me was very tame compared to many, many others I have seen. Sure, this movie would probably be way over the top to someone who doesn't watch these types of things but I'm guessing its mostly people like me who would actually see this movie and as I said before\u0085 this movie was mighty tame for me.I did like that there was a storyline. I think that maybe they could have done much more with the movie by focusing on the storyline if they were taking out the gore. If a movie doesn't succeed in achieving the one thing its advertising its going to do\u0085 and that's provide gore and make the audience sick\u0085 well then I think it failed in some sense.I also wanted to add that I did see the cut version (2+ min cut out of the movie) so this may have something to do with the tameness of the movie. I did see a listing of what was deleted and it does sound pretty bad. I have a serious problem with censorship as most of us decent people who are mature adult are. If you're of age you should be able to make the choice for yourself of what you want to view. I always thought how lucky I am that I live in a world where there is freedom of speech, freedom of choice and just freedom overall\u0085. But I guess we really don't, do we.Overall OK movie. Considering that I LOVED the first one and think of it as one of my top ten all time favourites I was extremely disappointed. I believe it was because of all of the hype (and I've been through this before) you think your going to watch something crazy and it turns out to be just like all the other movies with just a touch more nastiness.I don't want to rag on the movie too much but that's what happens when you advertise the extremeness of a movie that doesn't quite fit the bill. As I said I enjoyed that it actually had a story and without writing about any spoilers I also enjoyed some of the things they added that connected to the first movie.",

However, there is another fact - this film is not able to keep the tension of the already tepid first part. There are small crafts that hold the attention, there are scenes that trigger stomach, but the whole point of the film is reduced to the psycho succeed in its intent, which is likely to represent the first and only success in his life.

Now it turns out the first \"The Human Centipede\" didn't happen but it was actually a movie. Yeah it's really a movie but in this movie it turns out it was just a movie with actors and actresses. So it's a movie within a movie. This time around though it lacks tension and isn't really a scary movie, gross yes but it lacks the scare factor. There really isn't a story in this, basically a mentally handicapped,deluded guy that is messed up in the head and works at a parking garage that is obsessed with the movie \"The Human Centipede\". And wants to complete what the villain in the first movie experimented with. I don't know if it's trying to send a message of how some idiots reenact parts in movies that cause people harm. Or something but my guess is, Six tried to shock the audience with the gratuitous and gross factor. This movie is all in black and white, maybe it's trying to be artistic or something but it fails.2.5/10",

THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE II (FULL SEQUENCE) sees a depraved security guard reenacting the events of the first film in his bid to build a longer and better human centipede.It's gross-out stuff throughout, purely designed to shock and revolt, and it's one of the worst things I've seen ever - and that's the cut UK version too (I have no interest in seeing the full uncut edition). Thankfully the film has been converted into black and white so that the gruesome stuff isn't too gruesome, but it's the ideas and the gross surrealism that makes this so sickening.Although this is a US-financed film, it was shot in England with some terrible actors, not least the lead. But there's no semblance of a script, Tom Six instead just goes out of his way to offend with one bad taste or explicit scene after another. The ending is particularly repulsive, but incredibly a third part of the trilogy still follows.",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying that I actually did really like the first one. I thought it was an original, twisted idea that was really well executed. I loved Dieter Laser as the mad scientist, and the film had emotion and suspense. It wasn't just trying to shock (there's actually very little gore in it at all) it was trying to take you on an experience and I felt quite drained afterwards. I do think it's a good film. I do not think that its sequel is a good film. In fact I think it's one of the worst films I've seen and is an insult to us horror hounds and fans of the first film.Of course I had heard a lot about this film before seeing it. It was the most disturbing film ever and the most twisted, apparently. Why would anyone want to see that? You might ask yourselves, and it's a good question. I was expecting The Human Centipede II to be bad, but I suppose curiosity got the better of me, and as I said, I did really like the first one. To be quite honest with you I don't think it's as disturbing as everyone makes out. The whole film is completely ridiculous and it's quite obvious that Tom Six is trying to shock the audience and in the end it just feels desperate and tedious.I must admit that I do like the idea of the first film being completely medically accurate and the second film not, even though it is supposedly set in reality. Lawrence R Harvey is also very good as our cuddly hero, Martin. I believed that he was insane and he really does put his all into the role. It's just too bad that the role is incredibly weak. Martin says nothing, instantly making it very difficult for the audience to give one iota about the man. I'm also not keen on the message that most horror fans are all perverted lunatics.The majority of the film is incredibly tedious and not very shocking. The first hour is made up of Martin whacking people on the head with a crowbar and taking them to an abandoned warehouse. What I found much more interesting was Martin's background and home life, even if the woman playing his Mum (and every other actor) couldn't act for a toffee apple. However Tom Six completely blows his opportunities to exploit this and is clearly more interested in trying to shock. However, the film only really gets shocking in the last half hour or so which is when Martin starts creating the centipede.I should point out that I saw the version which the BBFC patronisingly cut, so I was thankfully saved from seeing barbwire and an accelerator pedal. The film gets very nasty towards the end, but it's all done in a rather boring and desperate way. There's only so much stapling and knee-slicing you can see until it becomes tiresome and just plain mean-spirited. Seeing the actual centipede isn't that shocking either because we've seen it all before! The poo scene (which Tom Six calls the highlight) is when the film just tries too hard to be noticed.The Human Centipede II is the film equivalent of Jonah from Summer Heights High. It's the obnoxious kid at the back of the class trying to piddle off the teacher. But what happens with all these kids? They just get kicked out the classroom and ignored. Films like this give horror a bad name. Horror isn't about gore and shocking scenes, it's supposed to have a point and a story. The story here is complete tripe and stripped of any entertainment value. It also fails in being the most disturbing film ever. I find Martyrs much more disturbing, but that could also be because Martyrs is a profound and moving experience with a point.I shall look forward to the third instalment like a fly looks forward to the next swatter.Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com",

The only people allowed to ascertain a firearm are certain sects of the police and the other authoritative figures of the upper echelon. This parking lot attendant has a firearm, all the videos are on closed circuit which goes right to the company and monitored by the UK gov.The main character alone is physically incapable of what he was doing anyway. Honestly. There is no way physically he could have performed 80% of what he did.Also, the worst part and why I hate Tom Six for all of his self indulgence, he didn't even come up with a new storyline. Its all a rehash. Its an homage to his original. What kind of unimaginative garbage is that.This is just a waste of time to be perfectly honest. It is not any more grotesque than the original and IMO just simply unimaginative.Long story short, Tom Six has an ego the size of Kim Jong Ill and a lot less entertaining.",

Harvey) was fantastic, I will admit there was some parts where I covered my eyes, but that's a good thing!

There is no logical explanation about why the deranged, unhinged Martin want to implement the same sick idea of creating a human centipede given in the first movie he had his aspirations from. Film's black and white photography makes his actions even sicker than the sickest can think of. He is a sick and abused and totally secluded from the society due to his years of child abuse conducted by his own father and his mom's restless accusations of his sending his dad to the jail. None of these really make a person emulate what was done in a sick movie. When I watched the first movie I did not really feel that disgusted but the second one tore my appetite for scary movies upside down cause of the disgust and implacability, nastiness and remorselessness of the main character who wants to appease his sick cravings by torturing people. There are hundreds of plot holes and none of these holes really cover the ugliness of this movie. I felt like i was eating in the landfill due to starvation throughout this movie. It is drawn out around a sick minded screenplay which gives nothing but disgust in the end. I loathed this movie from the beginning to the end. I watched it to the end just to see some clemency in the end . If there are still some people who like this kind of sick movies no brainer the need for more shrinks.",

Eventually, he decides to build his own centipede, albeit with lesser surgical skills than part I's Nazi doctor. Hilarity ensues.Or not.Made in \"arty\" black in white, this very meta little piece of cinematic nastiness is actually, visually speaking, a vast improvement over the trashy party I. It's hard to appreciate that at times, given what an inane hand Tom Six is at either writing a scene or directing actors, and the result is what Eraserhead might be if written and run by complete amateurs. Common Lynchian themes of sexual distress and physical deformity are used rather clumsily here with no nerve or ability to create sustained tension, so every stalking scene has to end with Martin clubbing his victims with a wrench. You'd think after a few hits it would numb the pain of what is to follow. In any case, the audience isn't so lucky.On seeing the trailer you might think this makes for risqu\u00e9, or shocking material. The only shocking thing about this whole sorry exercise is how few ideas you could come up with about a sequel would actually make for a worse film than this.Like all poor \"horror\" films, HCII resorts to gross comedy or shock value (including what really wants to be the mother of all disgusting birth scenes) because it lacks the courage of its own convictions. If Six had put some humanity in Martin (Laurence R. Harvey, the film's one redeeming feature), even dared to make him a hero, then we'd have something worthwhile on our hands. Instead, we get a half-naked Humpty-Dumpty clubbing unlikable characters - who could easily have escaped - and the answer to what would happened if someone wanted to say, \"do\" the centipede, or if the centipede got a bad case of spray diarrhea...Next time, just withdraw the budget as cash and set it on fire.

            "content": "This is \"The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)\", an American English-language movie from 4 years ago that runs for slightly under 90 minutes. It is the second installment from a series of (so far) 3 movies. All of these were made by Dutch filmmaker Tom Six and basically deal with sewing human anuses and lips together so that a human being can be nurtured by the digestion of the one in front of him/her. This is obviously a very perverted plot, but you should never judge a book by its cover. I must say I truly enjoyed the first \"Human Centipede\" film. The action was absurd, the girls were hot and Dieter Laser was simply brilliant. Sadly, the ending of this film did not really offer much room for a sequel.But Six did it nonetheless and the way he constructed thing was actually pretty smart. In this second movie, the action revolves around the first being an actual movie and the protagonist being obsessed with that movie. Six really tried all he could to make this one worth a watch. He turned it into a black-and-white movie. He made the main character totally different from the one in the first film. (Harvey did a good job with what he was given and taking into account he never speaks in here.) He introduced us to the theory of sexual abuse as a reason for this perverted idea. And the inclusion of Ashlyn Yennie's character was pretty smart and well-done as well in the face of her being one of the protagonists from the first film.Still, as a whole, I was slightly disappointed with this movie. There are several plot references that just did not make any sense. He keep hitting the members of his centipede with heavy items to the head that I thought each time they must be dead, but somehow they all lived. In addition, I did not like the penis shots of the protagonist. I'm glad we did not see him ejaculate graphically, but the strength of this franchise is for me about how messed-up the protagonists are and not about how graphic the sexuality and violence is. The latter is obviously unavoidable, but I never watch this film from a sexual perspective. It's nothing wrong with the protagonist feeling sexual pleasure from his centipede and the anal sex scene was truly shocking, but yeah, the penis shots took it on a course that stands contradictory to the idea.Finally, this film is really only worth watching thanks to many great references to the first movie I think. One minor thing would be for example how Heiter wished he had cut the people's vocal chords in the first film and in this one here we have the small fat protagonist actually cut out somebody's tongue. I will probably watch the 3rd film at some point, but it's nothing I cannot wait seeing anymore after watching this pretty mediocre second film. It's probably easier to make a 3rd film than to make this second movie as Martin lived and left here in the end and I see the actor also reappear in the (so far) last installment. We'll see how that one goes. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend movie number 2 though. thumbs down.",

There is enough mayhem to go around. And depending on what version you bought, you might even be able to see it in full color. Whether that is something you want to seek is up to you. Overall the story of a copycat, who's also a psycho is not really new, the jokes are rare (as is the meat I guess) and this might be the weakest of the trilogy.

I am not here to pass moral judgment. I do not blame the director, Tom Six, for making the film any more than I blame myself for viewing the film he made. Does the film classify as obscenity? Does it contain any value, any artistic merit? Perhaps, in that it has affected me deeply enough to compel me write a review--or rather, a warning--something I rarely do. I feel the need to cleanse my soul, as though warning others will somehow provide me with some form of ethical catharsis. Regardless of what I write, however, I still feel hollow inside, knowing that this film was created with great deliberation and forethought by thinking, breathing human beings--people who chose to participate in its creation just as I chose to watch it.",

For Martin, he's going to do what other people are not capable of doing.This is my first review on a film on IMDb, and the reason I picked this film is due to one word; controversy. I ordered it on demand last night, and calmed my nerves because I knew what i was heading into. All threw my head, I was thinking about how Tom Six wants this to be art, and he really went all out with the B&W (With a little funny twist). Right from the start, the film had more blood than the first Human Centipede had, and from there on, everyone will know you're in for a long ride. I've seen A Serbian Film, and the hype for it did not shock me, shock value is pretty much the only rule horror directors want to go by, and only few have great shock value. The story revolves around a mental Security Guard, named Martin, who lives with his suicidal mother, and is secretly obsessed with The Human Centipede film, it's his sexual fantasy to create his own, but not with three, but 12 people. Martin is a creepy man, and the first half hour of the film really created amazing atmosphere and sympathy towards Martin. Now, is this Art? Not by a long shot, Six wanted to create Art by making this film black and white, trying to categorize this film with classics. In my opinion, art is something beautiful, something that can touch is by visual, and Martin believes the Human Centipede is Art, he thinks it's beautiful. But to a lot more people, it seemed like a desperate try to create something original, which it did, but in the end, didn't create the hype it was needed. Does this have great shock value for the sensitive nerves? Yes, and it achieved it, but that's all it is. You can barely tell if anyone had good performances, the only one I found believable was Martin, and Laurence Harvey nailed his part. But for everyone else, you can't really judge since they all had a minute of screen time. The film has more plot holes than swish cheese, and it bothered the heck out of me, I understand that you need disbelief but this was ridiculous, anyone with a brain could get this guy caught, but I think if the movie ended the way it seemed, then the plot holes don't matter. My overall opinion, it's an okay horror film, if you want to be disgusted, then this is you're exact cup of tea, but looking for something beautiful, stay away. 5/10",

            "content": "Shortly after enjoying the trashy first film (also reviewed) I began to search online for any details at all about the second Human Centipede film. To my surprise,I discovered that the UK ratings board had decided to cut out over 2 and a half minutes from the upcoming follow-up,due to them feeling that there was a risk of someone trying to copy the film, (especially since there are dozens of street gangs in England who threaten to reenact the operation thanks to them all running round with mobile sowing machines!)Having enjoyed how the first film depicted a situation which would be anyone's idea of a living hell,I decided to leave the BBFC's cut in the bin,and to instead get hold of the uncut US edition of the film,so that I could have the chance to see the full Centipede for myself.View on the film:For the screenplay of the film,writer/director Tom Six interestingly takes the series into the same post-modern/meta-Horror area that Dario Argento badly misfired in,with the 30 years too late film Giallo (2009-also reviewed). Unlike Giallo,Six put out his attempt whilst the current era of extreme torture Horror was still pretty hot,which give the scenes of someone becoming obsessed with a gore-filled Horror movie a modern edge.Along with the structure of the film,Six has also changed the \"Look\" of the films,thanks to Martin's world being filmed in a very rough,grittyblack and white style,which gives the title a numb atmosphere.Sadly for this follow up,Six moves away from the snappy pulpy pace of the first,and makes the first 50 minutes move at a snails pace,which despite the best attempts from lead actor Laurence R. Harvey leaves the film just feeling dull.As the last 30 minutes of the film enter \"gore mode\" and feature a nasty scene involving a hammer and someone's teeth,the rest of the gore moments feel just too little too late for what what started out as a interesting genre-bending Horror film.Final view on the film:An interesting experiment,that's let down by terrible pacing.",

For this reason, as a horror movie, I think more highly of it.The movie is shot in black and white, due to the \"grittier\" feel Six was looking for. In my opinion this could have been done equally as well if the movie had been shot in colour. The lack of colour made the movie hard to concentrate on and I occasionally found myself becoming bored with looking at a very bland screen.The audio in the movie is brilliant. One particular scene made me gag, not because of what happened on screen, but the noise which accompanied said scene. I feel that the dialogue in the movie came second to the sounds, a lot of which were cringe-inducing.The acting was fairly average, not having the same spark as the original, however this is generally the case in this type of movie and can be overlooked.

Harvey) is a mentally disturbed loner who works as a late night car park attendant and watches a down loaded version of the original Human Centipede film on his lap top. With memories of his sexually abusive father swirling around in his mind, and loathed by his mother, he sees no motivation in his life greater than to try to attempt and copy his hero Dr. Leiter's idea in the first HC film, only this time try and fix twelve people together as opposed to Heiter's three. And so he rents an abandoned warehouse and sets about gathering victims for his diabolical plan.Nothing like a film designed just to shock. And nothing like the great publicity such a film gets when the people in charge of awarding it a classification decide it's too unpleasant to be released and try and ban it. And so such a film will get the wind knocked out of it's sails a little when it only gets released after thirty two cuts are made to it, especially when the result is something as apathetic and none eventful as this. And when that film appears to get released straight to DVD. Sure, there's the odd moment that will make the stomach spin a bit, but mostly this is a story without any sting in it's tail. And there sure ain't anything else to raise it above the bar.Probably the only thing that gives the film any credos is the performance, or rather the appearance of the central character. Martin is revolting to look at, feels revolting to be around and certainly has revolting thoughts going around in his head, a grossly overweight, bug eyed, bespectacled pervert who never speaks and has an alarming lack of manners and self regard. The murky, rain sodden world he inhabits further dampens his presence and adds to the mood and atmosphere around him. But beneath the surface, there's nothing to lift the film above the superficial, just a bleak, voyeuristic, seedy and thoroughly unpleasant piece of exploitation cinema that just goes to show how much publicity cheap shock can get you, and how you can even get let down if that's what you wanted to watch it for. *",

True, there's some updating here: the use of staple guns, crowbars & duct tape as opposed to axes & plain old zombie brute strength. And more focus on the pain we inflict (or dream of inflicting, even if metaphorically) on one another as opposed to the (hopeless?) dream of escape from terror.I think HC2 (paired with HC1 before it) is a real work of art: Brilliantly executed technically, a wonderful adjustment of perspective from the previous film & hugely adept at peeling back the social politesse to reveal what lurks underneath the surface for many of us.I'm not saying we're all Martin, but if we don't try to understand Martin for what he is & why he is what he is, then more of us will be Martn's victims.Can't wait to see HC3.",

Its ridiculous. Well done to Mr Six for creating something which has got so many people talking - I mean just when was the last time that happened with a horror movie? Shouldn't horror be....well...horrific lol? To be honest I thought the first one was much more grim, I got a few laughs watching it but nowhere near as much as this. My only annoyance is why they released it in black and white. I reckon it would have been much more gross in colour (hence just 8 stars). Seems Mr Six thought the black and white gave it a more grim feeling but it reminded me (very slightly) of Man Bites Dog by doing that, but again, this to me was a COMEDY. True, a pretty sick one, but I relished every minute. And yes, I did see the uncut directors version, so stuff you Mr BBFC. Who gives you the right to police what we watch eh? I cant wait for the final chapter. I really don't know what will come next, but to all of you so appalled by this kind of thing, go back to watching movies like Scream, or the Sixth Sense or something.

But once I began watching it, hoping for a laugh, a cheap gross-out, I became somewhat interested. The fact that it was in black-and-white was a very good factor indeed; if it had been in colour, it would have lost its effect. But the colourless, consistently dark atmosphere gave this film a much more compelling effect. And the fact that the central character never speaks, or never has to speak, is another interesting feature. I think that one small subtlety topples most of the lack of subtleties in this film.I did watch the cut version, and, though I will never say this about most cut films, I would recommend it more. The violence is dumbly graphic and disgusting, but what more do you expect? That was the sole reason this film was made: to be disgustingly awful. Yes, it does lack any kind of meaning or moral, and the violence is all blatant, full on-screen trying to make you uneasy, but that's the point, and for a cheesy gross-out b-movie video nasty, I think they did a half-decent job.Appalling acting and dialogue, and terribly disgusting (I VERY highly recommend the cut version), but it's interesting, well-paced, disturbing and sticks with you. We get a bit of an emotional bond with the highly disgusting protagonist, which is the beauty of it: the filmmakers have got us on the side of a sexually disturbed maniac.7/10 - not a bad job, certainly for its expectations.",

(Incidentally the word \"art\" is often banded about when a film, or book, is so obscure within its genre, it is assumed there must be a loftier interpretation possible, but many times it becomes a substitute for the word \"bad\").This is a scatological fantasy committed to celluloid by the writer and director - Tom Six. It is a work of private pornography. A scatological fantasy would, by any psychological definition, be a par-aphelia - i.e. a mental sexual aberration whereby the subject derives sexual stimulation from objects or concepts, rather than from people. It is not in itself, in all cases, a bad thing. But in this particular variant, mixed in with torture and humiliation, it is a very bad thing.So, one can say Tom Six suffers from this particular perversity, and has attempted to follow it through via three \"Human Centipede\" movies. In each one he has pushed the logic of his predilection through to new heights (or lows). This is neither laudable nor to be encouraged.Why? Well, if anyone else truly gets off on the concept of forcing people under pain and duress to eat faecal matter to the point of death, finds this in the slightest bit enticing, or even interesting, then they should, in my humble opinion, immediately seek help from a qualified psychiatrist.I do enjoy shock cinema and I have had dreams which contain a content far worse than Human Centipede 2, but there is no way I would ever publish them for human consumption.The simple reason is such vile and evil images can damage the mind, particularly of young people, and, as a film maker I would not want this on my conscience.No, Mr Six, your film didn't shock me.

Even worse, it makes the same mistakes as the first film and makes entirely new mistakes to add them. The plot is simple: a lunatic named Martin watched the first film and got even crazier, proposing himself to make the same \"centipede experience\" with a higher number of people. That is. Deep down, there is no plot. What is given to us is a motive, a cause for us to be able to watch what we have already seen in the first film, but on a much larger scale and dimension.I've never been a fan of gore movies, despite being an admirer of horror. Blood and fluids don't scare me, and I honestly do not feel like watching a movie if I suspect it's going to make me throw up my lunch. But my will decreases when I check that the film is absolutely crazy and was made by a probably even more crazy director (in this case it's Tom Six). So why did I watch this movie? Because I thought it might be a bit better than the first. I was wrong, of course. Again, we have no decent actors or interpretations. In fact, we don't even have characters! The only character that deserves, minimally, that name, is Martin, because it is the unique one that has been minimally developed.

            "content": "Once the media circus died down following the emerging release of The Human Centipede (First Sequence) back in 2009, people actually sat down to watch it. Behind the reports of a macabre, utterly depraved film in which people were sown together ass-to-mouth and forced to s**t through each other as one huge digestive system, the movie itself was actually pretty tame. This was the main gripe a lot of people had with it, and it became a victim of its own hype (although I'm sure the film benefited from it financially). Director Tom Six's reaction to this was to make First Sequence seem like 'My Little Pony' compared to it's follow-up.And Part II does exactly that. Six has created an experience so utterly deplorable that even the most die-hard of gore-hounds will undoubtedly cringe at the horror on show. Every aspect of the film is designed to repulse it's viewers, causing critics of the first film to question whether this was the kind of debauchery they were hoping for in 2009. This approach may have been affective had Six demonstrated any hint of subtlety or artistic flair, but instead he delivers shock after shock like a cinematic endurance test and points and laughs at us like a giddy teenager showing someone 2 Girls 1 Cup for the first time. The idea came to him when he was asked if he thought a deranged fan could actually try and create their own human centipede, and his new antagonist was born.Overweight car park attendant Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) spends his days watching The Human Centipede on his laptop in his toll booth, and is such a huge fan of the film that he keeps a scrapbook containing movie stills, photographs of its actors, and hastily drawn diagrams of the grisly, yet '100% medically accurate' surgical procedure. Asthmatic and mentally retarded, he lives with his abusive and overbearing mother and was sexually abused as a child by his father. Tired of his miserable, repetitive existence, Martin decides to turn his fantasies into reality and create his own centipede. Not content with the work of Dr. Heitler in the first film, Martin plans a 12-strong centipede and starts to mutilate and kidnap his victims, storing them in a warehouse while he awaits the arrival of actress Ashlynn Yennie, who he has conned into coming to London on the promise of an audition for the next Tarantino movie.Six makes a point of showing Martin's lack of surgical skills. While First Sequence was crisp, clinical and in colour, Full Sequence is grimy, messy, and filmed in a depressing black-and-white. Rather than drugging his victims, Martin bashes them over his head with a crowbar, and unlike the surgical precision of Heitler, Martin duct tapes his victims and staples them together. It makes for a brutal experience, but its effects are dulled by some lazy writing - we are expected to believe the victims wouldn't struggle while their teeth are being knocked out one by one with a hammer or having the ligament in their knees removed. While I can certainly appreciate Six's desire to create something different to its predecessor, this is simply an unpleasant experience. I could appreciate disturbing, but Six opts for disgusting, and this exists simply to push your buttons.",

The first Human Centipede had not been done before and was original... very disturbing storyline but hey thats what the films supposed to do right?OK on to this one. Well wow if you thought the first one was disturbing then your in for a wake up call with this. Human Centipede 2 makes number 1 seem like a 15 certificate mild movie in comparison. Remember all the things you did not see in Human Centipede 1? Detail wise, feeling uncomfortable with knowing what was going on but not really seeing it to much degree. Part 1 left a lot to the imagination whilst part 2 up's the ante giving you full on exposure leaving nothing to the imagination. The hype associated with this film is that it was banned and had a very hard time trying to get released, i read somewhere that it is the most cut film in history so far. Now i have heard hype like this many times, the original Texas chainsaw massacre for example and i was left with the feeling of 'it wasn't THAT bad.' This however meets the anticipated expectation of bing a full on disturbing and visually vile film. It achieves it's goals and does exactly what it sets out to do.I know put this in my top 5 disturbing films list and i have seen a lot of movies of this nature as i have comedy & action etc (im a film buff remember?) I remember when i first heard this was all shot in black and white. I was totally gutted thinking it would ruin everything for me. How wrong was i. Being shot in black and white it somehow totally works for this movie. I do not want to talk about the most disturbing parts etc as i feel it would ruin the shock value for you but i would say if your looking for something to make your top 5 disturbing films list and your in the frame of mind and mood for a film of the shock value genre then your in the right place with this.I hear there is going to be a part 3 that is even worse... how thats possible i have no idea.",

The concept of the Human Centipede itself remains basically the same (although increasing from three to twelve people), but the villain is far more insane (didn't think I'd be saying that going in) and some of the surrounding events are nothing short of horrific. The final half hour was not an easy watch, even for someone who loves gory horror.The film is not without flaws. The acting it must be said is pretty average throughout. Laurence R. Harvey couldn't really be criticised for the way he played his role as Martin, but he couldn't really be praised for it either. He doesn't speak a single audible line in the film and carries the movie more on his unique looks than anything. We are never given a chance to care for any of the victims like we are in the first. There are two reasons for this: 1) there are so many of them, 2) almost every one of them is portrayed as being pretty despicable before they are captured. It's very easy to say there wasn't a single likable character in the entire movie.The concept of having a sequel based in the real world, where the first is actually a film itself is reasonably original (as far as I know) and I actually quite like the way it worked. Six clearly knew that the second time around he couldn't simply get away with the shocking originality of The Human Centipede and therefore had to take it up a notch in other departments. I can't even bring myself to type some of the shocking acts that take place in this film, suffice to say you'll need a strong stomach.",

Of course, cashing in on the success this sequel, shot in black and white, that does give it more interesting and hungry appeal, for lovers of the first one, could be one imaginative sick fantasy of a forties loner, Martin (Lawrence Harvey) a car parking attendant, who still lives with his mommy. Also a fan of the first, our repulsive loner, (just check out the cover) has built his own scenario that includes 12 unfortunates, where he masquerades as a fake assistant to the director of a film that was never meant to be. Have a guess who the director is? This will score a couple of laughs. He hires out one of the actresses from the first Centipede film, but it's a whole different scene when she arrives, as she unwittingly becomes another victim, part of the twelve person chain, this centipede, coming apart, which has you of course knowing why this s 100 percent inaccurate. I did like this scenario, that can't compensate one iota, for the trashiness of this movie. This time around, Six has really let loose in the violence department. The most graphic scene is the bashing of the mother, until her head is reduced but skull and gross yucky matter. I picked out the thirty second cut scene, much earlier in the film, the films first violent scene I think, involving the real estate agent, who's knifed standing up, but is suddenly flat on the ground, with the psychopathic Martin, (a terrible Harvey, a rank amateur up, against he wonderful Laser from the last Centipede) hovering over her. This is a much guiltier pleasure for Centipede lovers, where again, the script hasn't had much thought to it, where it seems this movie was made faster than the first, if just after completion of it's predecessor, in a rush to get this one out. But being base, which this film is, one can take enjoyment from it's rank standard, and it's offering of ugliness and violence. Even Martin's psychiatrist, is a scummy ill bred sort, if stereotypical of the movie, it's total disregard for being truly offensive to one's humanity, unlike the first, to a much smaller extent, where ranked up against the first Centipede, that predecessor seems many a far stretch, as being a fine feature film, when matched against this dreck.

Martin is the looser type who sees the first Human Centipede movie and geeks out to the point were he attempts to finish what the doctor in the movie wanted to do by creating a dozen manned centipede. I'm sure in Martin's mind his objective was no different than the guys who make Star Wars fan fiction for you tube, but that's what makes his plan so disturbing, just like the doctor in the original.The issue with this amazing plot is that it only last for five to ten minutes. The rest of the movie is pretty much a horror clich\u00e9 with Martian hunting down the dozen he needs to man his fan art. The movie seems over gory and violent and I don't think it needed to be. Even though the original human centipede felt more \"scientifically accurate\" than what was stapled together here, the visual of a human centipede is still disturbing enough that it does not need to be over done with over the top effects that the filmmakers have access to I'm sure because they have more money now.Yeah, it was a good idea, but when your dealing with sequels plot sometimes gets lost in an attempt to go better and bigger, and that's what happen here.",

If you ever needed a reason to go to the gym just look at this guy in his pants.I find it unbelievable that a guy who is so unhealthy manages to chase down, capture and drag around endless people without been caught/dying from exhaustion with over half the film him just shaking an inhaler about.Nothing in the film is suspenseful or scary, there is just pointless graphic violence. You are not given any back ground on the victims other that one listens to music and another is pregnant (who later is in such a rush crushes her new born baby to death!?) so you a left not really caring about their fate.The victims are constantly been shot or smashed in the head by a crow bar but don't die unless they a stabbed in the backside.What I find most bizarre is the main guy beats his own mum to death with a crow bar but when he kills some victims acts upset and distressed almost like he doesn't want to hurt anyone.I think the BBFC banned this film for being sh1t and it should have stayed that way, the sad thing is now it has been band more people are going to watch it (Myself being one of them).To sum up I wasted an hour and a half on arguably the worst film I have ever seen.

I was really anxious beginning this movie. He did say it would make the first look like My Little Pony (it kind of does because MLP is so good) and it did actually got banned for a bit. The quotes I'd read from it suggested to me that this movie pulls zero punches.But when you actually watch it, I can almost say objectively that it is not well made. The dialogue is laughable, the characters are one dimensional, the plot is only in two acts (he wants to do a thing; he does it. And I like the 3 act structure dang it!), and the plot barely makes any sense at all.Let's focus on some things I did like for a moment. It's very different from the first movie, not just in its look: moving away from the sleek, clinical yet stylish modernity of the first movie to this brilliantly sordid vision of London where you can feel the filth and the isolation. Martin is really the only really good thing in the movie. Meaning no disrespect to the actor but he was pretty terrifying to watch in the way he manages to look like an infant and a lecherous old man all at once. He alone brings a sense of professionalism to the movie and almost with no lines. Tom Six is really not great at dialogue but scenarios. I wonder if the movie had been edited to maybe about 30 minutes it really could have been something. Take out the risible dialogue and acting and we really would have a movie that is frightening in the old fashioned way: an unlovely, uncompromising descent into the depths of human misery and sadism with no sense of hope for anyone. You see flashes of this once in a while, certainly in the ending and also in the pathos of Martin wearing his doctor's jacket.And of course, yes it is physically repugnant. It takes it to a point where it just loses all the mystique of the human of the human body and just becomes a slightly squeamish bore by the end.I have this fantasy that a bunch of teens with a new friend, some shy kid who isn't good with horror but wants to fit in, watch this movie together. Everyone is vomiting by the end or has nightmares for weeks but the new kid realizes they were anxious for nothing since the movie is trash. It is an exercise in how you can generate such a hype for a movie even when it has actually very little to offer beyond the most superficial kind of terror.And as for the idea of people doing the experiment in real life: it doesn't explore that at all beyond maybe reminding us of it through two lines of dialogue. The first movie (even though it's a work of fiction in this movie) felt far more real than this. it's not a covert remake, it's not self parody, it's self plagiarism.Six clearly did not make the first movie to get people used to the idea. That WAS the movie and this is a desperate cash in by a film make that finally had an original idea.As I often say for these kinds of movies it's...an experience but I cannot give this movie more than 4 out of 10. Even watching it ironically. It could be a laugh I guess.",

While in the case of Dr. Hieter; he was just a deranged, sadistic surgeon in the first part with bare minimum character development. Whereas here, in this Sequel, Martin with a much better-rounded arc, seems to carry himself in a comparatively more intimidating posture, his appearance alone was petrifying to say the very least.Not only has he been portrayed as an individual with a sick, perverted mindset but he has also got a tangible backstory shoved under his conscience.Even if there cannot be any justifications for the multitude of wrongs he commits but at least we get a proper insight into his erratic personality and could make some sense of what he is doing and for what reasons exactly.From a presentation standpoint, this is far beyond the degrees of my imagination, never in my wildest dreams did I think a film like this would mercilessly challenge my moral compass, or that it would test my band of tolerance in such a cruel fashion. FYI, I'm someone who doesn't get frightened so easily or get mentally affected by gore & violence. But this film down here kinda coerced me to change my viewpoint.

One where he knocks a man's teeth , slowly with a hammer , really springs to mind.

The problem is, the first film was the true novelty. And even then, once you get used to the repulsive-and stupid-premise, it's pretty standard, mad scientist fare. All this flick gives you is a more graphic version of how a person with no surgical \"knowledge\" would put together the so-called centipede. And frankly, so what? Since there are no real characters, and no narrative, what's at stake? Nothing. When Martin begins to knock his victim's teeth out with a hammer, I wondered, \"Hm. It's black white, I wonder if that's chocolate syrup they're using for blood? I hope it was Hershey's.\" It's one fake atrocity after another, and you can just HEAR director Tom Six going, \"Oh! Wait, and when the pregnant woman escapes and has the baby in the car, what if she SQUISHES the new born trying to hit the gas pedal! Oh my God, that will make people CRAZY!\" \"Oh, let's show the feces dripping off their faces, cool huh? I'll bet people will vomit!\" Yeah, yeah. Not really. When it's all so blatantly meaningless, when you really couldn't care less what happens to anybody, it doesn't matter what kind of weirdness you get up to, Mr. Six. It makes no damn difference. What you've got is a visual catalog of depraved stuff that isn't really all that convincing. This movie is so empty it is practically transparent. If your aim was to throw a bone to those \"fans\" of HC1 who complained it wasn't graphic enough, I think you've mainly failed. Maybe you shook up the the censors in England, and the people whose idea of violence is a Chuck Norris or Stallone flick, but a lot of us are over here are wondering why we sat through this. Go to a writing class, and get back to us.There are many funny aspects in this thing, to be sure. Or maybe the word I'm searching for is silly. Evidently, the garage where Martin works and collects his victims is like the roach motel -- people drive in but they don't drive out, and NOBODY seems to notice. Each one of his victims is shot, and beat over the head with a crowbar multiple times, and yet they survive to be stitched together. For some reason Martin likes applying sandpaper to his penis, but hey! It's all understandable because daddy raped him when he was a kid. I'm surprised Six bothered with that clich\u00e9 at all, since he doesn't bother to explain anything else. This movie is like an amateur effort at writing porn--you make SOME pretense at a story so it doesn't read like, \"This guy comes into the room and starts ****ing the woman tied up on the bed,\" but you know, you kinda rush through the details to get to the sex. Six's whole motivation was the grisly creation of the human centipede, and it shows.Epic fail. Take off the cowboy hat, stop smirking, make a decent movie, and try to hide your contempt for your audience. Jeez.",

This film is about a man who becomes sexually obsessed with the first movie, which we have all seen. This means that we know what the film he is obsessed about contains.Now consider if we had never seen the first movie. The nature of the film changes entirely. Now we have a film about a man who lives a bleak and disturbing existence after an abused childhood. He happens across a film containing images we never see, all we know is that it depicts a group of people sewn together in a human centipede. We can only imagine what level of horror this film contains and thus his obsession is all the more vile and mysterious. Is it a snuff film? Is it a depraved porn film? We can't be sure, and that makes it frightening. So inspired by this film of unknown horror the character decides he will recreate the human centipede to live his fantasy and escape his miserable, bleak existence. Ultimately he gets his wish and achieves this object of his desire, shortly before his own creation becomes his end. The film becomes a harrowing story about a man who lives a tortured and hopelessly barren life, inspired by some unknown film to create the object of his fantasy which ultimately descends into a nightmare which well be his undoing.The film could have been a modern day Eraserhead, in fact I saw many parallels between the two.Sadly however, since the first film exists, we have all seen it and thus the film is simply about a man who watches what we know to be a mediocre horror flick and seeks to recreate something we have already seen, just more graphically, and so it comes off as just gratuitous.Had the first film never existed, and had there been no footage from the film Martin was watching shown, this film could have been a horrific masterpiece.It could have been a mysterious and dark trip into a sexual, violent nightmare.If only Tom Six had made this instead of the first I would recognise it as a masterpiece of modern extreme horror/drama.Instead it became a gratuitous, self indulgent mess that could have been something great.",

I saw the first film with a friend at the After Dark film festival simply because there was so much hype and the concept had me laughing with excitement at the ridiculousness of it all. I was a tad let down by it because it didn't push the boundaries as much as it claimed too. So it appears that Tom Six, the writer and director, has heard the complaints about the first film and decided to go all out with his sequel. This film is more twisted, sick and perverse than his original, so reader beware. Human Centipede 2: Full Sequence takes liberties with the storyline of the original, it openly admit that the first film is, well, a movie. This takes away some of the fun. That might have been Six's intention though, as he also takes away a lot of the comedic elements that the first film had and instead, makes the film more gritty, dirty and depressing. There is no hope in this flick and it ranks as one of the nastiest films I've seen. Take what you expected and hoped the first film would be in terms of grossness and multiply that by ten here. Being in black and white adds a bit of dirtiness to the film and it was a good decision on the director's part to do this as it might not have worked as well in colour. There were a few scenes that had me closing my eyes in shock and disgust. At times it feels like it's tying too hard to push the envelope, but never falls into the area that \"A Serbian Film\" did, even though both films deal with infant endangerment. The lead actor is really good in his role as the mentally ill Martin, and he never speaks a word. He plays the role of deviant very well and makes you wish to never run into someone as sick as he is. His obsession with the film leads him to make his own version of the human centipede, leaving the medical aspect back home and making it a more \"do it yourself\" version, using a staple gun. There is no plot here, it's simple a sick individual kidnapping people and performing this act. The last act of the film is him actually making this sick twisted fantasy happen, this is where the majority of the disturbing content happens. To explain the film anymore would rob those wanting to experience the crudeness of it. To sum up my experience I would have to say that despite the first film being a disappointment, I had more fun watching it than I did with this one. The sequel out squirms it by miles and if you're looking for something sick and twisted, check this out. It's a one time only \"watch it\" experience and those wanting to see it, should already know what to expect.",

This sequel treats the previous movie as a work of fiction, and the main character is a fat, grotesque slob who is obsessed with it to the point of wanting to recreate the titular \"human centipede\" with 12 people this time instead of three. Although there are some brief moments where you get a glimpse into this man's life, most of the movie is concerned with him rounding up his victims, which gets tedious after a while. He has a job in a London parking garage, so when he sees somebody stranded he leaves his post and incapacitates them, usually with a gun and a crowbar. Very (not) interesting. Even though his character is almost completely unsympathetic, the way the actor plays him is rather interesting. Not only is he a fat slob, but he's also got some mommy and daddy issues as well as severe asthma. He also has a tendency to lick his fingers. These tics make for some of the more entertaining parts of the movie, because he's pretty inept when it comes to everything else. When it gets to the finale where he finally puts his \"creation\" together, it's as gross as you'd expect. At this point, I should mention that the movie is in black and white...mostly. There's a few splotches of a certain color once he gives all 11 members of his \"centipede\" a laxative. The reason there's only 11 is because the 12th, a pregnant woman, is knocked unconscious for a while. This woman manages to escape, resulting in one of the more graphic abortions I've seen on film (probably the only one). The movie ends shortly thereafter, but with one twist which I won't give away (maybe you can guess...). Anyway, the movie is probably trying to say something about society's violent tendencies, or maybe about the ridiculousness of taking some violent horror films seriously (like Tom Six's own HUMAN CENTIPEDE). Whatever the \"message\", it gets lost among the filth and the gore. My recommendation would be to skip it, unless you're absolutely into this type of movie.",

The first big block of the film is about Martin's acquisition of enough live bodies. There is a parallel sideshow about his being sexually abused by his father, verbally abused by his mother (since father is in jail for the abuse), and his shrink's desire to bring him new abuse. Sigh. His mother tries to kill him herself. She also sets the psychotic neighbor (biker with loud music, lives above them) on him; he beats the daylights out of Martin with boots and fists. The list goes on well past these points.A bit over halfway through the film, Martin meets Miss Yennie (the actress, not the character) from the first film. There is a clash of worlds. She expects to discuss a role in a new film. She gets to see Martin's handiwork instead.Does anyone get out alive?As a film about crushing the marginalised, this is fairly effective.

And they are right to do so. But, I normally watch a movie with the intention of actually watching it, so I was very UN-fortunate to watch it without actually wanting to see it. Although I had complained for months about wanting to see it - I even had a Human Centipede II poster in my room once - and damned the local distributors for banning the film from our country (New Zealand). But the film caught me when I was totally unprepared. I read the synopsis on a few websites so I knew who lived and died and the ending and so forth, but that didn't make it any easier to digest.(No pun intended there...) Heed the warning above, this review will contain spoilers.We have our lead character, Martin, who we firstly see as having a profound obsession for 'The Human Centipede: First Sequence' - a rather interesting and marvelous trick used by writer/director Tom Six. (who wrote and directed the first film, that 'started it all') This technique was because he wanted to make the Human Centipede even more real- more real than the first film. So, he treated the film like what it was - a film - and gave it to the lead character to use. Speaking of which, Martin is played by the odd-looking Laurence Harvey. He does well in doing what was maybe overdone- being creepy. There's no character development, only him. He has no dialog, either, which is rather interesting, and a fine acting challenge, you ask me. He only makes utterly disturbing squeals, and shrieks. He channels his love for centipedes and the film, to make his very own twelve-person centipede.Martin is the child of a very emotionally abusive mother - who even at one point says, 'I've decided to kill us today' to her son at the dinner table. Overall, this family atmosphere almost seems to be the very uncanny work of David Firth, the creator of 'Salad Fingers', and my personal favorite, 'Spoilsbury Toast-boy'. Throughout the movie, we also see Martin hit people with crow-bars and performs (more like butcher) experiments upon them.To the actual review, Tom Six can only walk away from this project having only accomplished one thing in the making and presenting of this movie, proving what a sick puppy he is. And because there's zero character development, only mindless gore, and perverted scenery - there's not much to gain from this. There's no moral or even a simple story-line. Failure to embrace the audience's heart, can only lead to you watching a sick porno - an extremely perverted, revolting porno. Tom Six answers the question, 'sickest movie ever made'? But he doesn't seem to redeem that question. Yes, you will be talking about this film after wards, whether you liked it or you hated it, or whether you're just muttering on about how sick this movie is, you'll still be talking about a time where you lost eighty minutes - depending on which version, though you won't complain about the theatrical version, I'm sure- to this rather abortion of a film.",

The only plus point I can give is that the villain is pretty fitting , however, he doesn't speak at all throughout the movie. Pretty much every single torturous method you can think of revolving around a human centipede , it's there.

Second off it's a first for seeing a woman give birth in a car and then accidentally smashing the newborn to no recovery trying to flee from the warehouse she was being held in. Third of all I can only imagine how much better the film would have been without BBC making cuts to it 32 times. I absolutely love the way Tom threw in Martin pleasuring himself with sand paper as well as him injecting everyone whom was apart of the centipede with laxatives at the same time. Overall my opinion of it is as simple as just saying it's brilliant and much more appealing than the first.",

And she's blaming him for her husband going to prison. He works in this parking garage in which he kills most of his victims. It's a pretty serene environment is why. He's obsessed with the very fist Human Centipede movie, and his goal is to create a Human centipede in which he captures 12 people and brutally tortures them. I've never seen the first one, but I tell you it's way worse.All in all, the story is pretty interesting, but there's really no value whatsoever. It's kind of scary but more disturbing than anything.

This movie is solely meant to scare the living hell out of people and literally shock them. And for me, it did all of that. I pride myself on loving horror movies, the gore, the torture, the blood, the guts...this movie messed me up in the head so bad. I literally almost threw up 2-3 times, and had to leave my family room twice and almost gave up. I was lucky I got to rent this on demand early IFC movies (even tho it cost my mom 7.99 for this DISGUSTING MOVIE! Sorry mom) So this movie has it all, it is unbelievable the way it made me physically and mentally feel. I swear, I have never had so much anxiety. And I promised myself I would give up thinking about this movie, but here I am 3 days later on IMDb writing a review.

The movies tone is ugly and watching this movie from start till finish is the worst movie experience I ever had. The main character of the film or the main villain of the story is obsess with the The human Centipede film, and straight away you can see that this guy has no life at all or any good taste when it comes to films. He dose many messed up, grizzly and gruesome stuff that even a movie lover can't stand.Who enjoys a movie with scenes of: rape, torture, shocking and under use gore, and if you enjoy all that then you're f**ked up!. Now I'm not that kind of person that goes and says \"It's too gory and I'm very angry at that\", My favorite thriller all time that has a lots of gory scenes in it and it doesn't bother me that much and that's the movie Seven, at least that movie give me and us the picture of what this serial killer was doing and how shocking it was that nobody on the face of earth would think of, but the reason it really doesn't work here because the gory is under use to the point were I was about to turn it off because this movie is just torture porn from start till finish.I didn't like a single thing in this dreadful film making it the worst horror film and the worst movie of 2011.",

He does so by kidnapping patrons out of the garage he works in. Instead of using an elaborate mix of anesthesia, surgery (the German guy in the first movie was a surgeon), etc.. he clinks his victims constantly on the head with a cro-bar, and uses a staple gun to singe them all together! He even lures the actress who was the tail in the first movie, to his abandoned warehouse to be the head by telling her she's auditioning for a Quentin Tarantino film! LOLI noticed this movie was shot in black and white, and wondered if the director (Tom Six) did this to create an alternate reality from the first movie. I wondered too if he may have used the B/W to disguise the mix of blood and s**t colors-?? This movie sorta gives us what was left out of the first movie by elaborating on the disgusting factor. What sick mind from the bows of hell concocted this-??? LOL Oh well, it actually is quite humorous at times- just watching this fat little man go about his business clumsily doing what that surgeon guy in the first movie did so precisely. And now I see there is actually a third movie called \"Final Sequence\" with Eric Roberts..?? Will I watch it??? Eh, yeah, I kinda have to now!

It's like if George Lucas was making porno. Sad thing is if George Lucas made porno they'd never trust him to do a legit movie after that and that's true for Tom Six as well.

Let me say right off the bat, that if you're someone who couldn't stomach the first Human Centipede film, then don't look into watching this one at all. This movie is way more disturbing and disgusting than its predecessor.In this movie, our main character is a security guard, who in his spare time, re-watches the first Human Centipede film over and over. Basically, the next fifty minutes is the security guard, Martin killing and kidnapping people, until the last thirty minutes of the film, he starts his surgery.I will say, this one is better in terms of gore and gross scenes. In the first one, we don't see much poop. In this one, there is a five minute sequence we he gives each part of his \"Human Centipede\" laxatives which make them crap into the other persons mouth and so on, and so forth.Basically, In terms of how much I liked the film, it was ok. The first one I quite enjoyed, but I feel that this one was purely make to shock you and compile every disturbing act in the history of man into one film.Lemme just say, this is not a film for everyone, especially mainstream audiences, but if you're into horror/ exploitation like I am, then I recommend you check this out. 6/10.",

However it does make the movie have an interesting IT COULD HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE feel to it. I am sure there are a lot of messed up people who have thought of doing this. That is pretty scary. So the story is pretty unique in that regards and I can not think of another movie quite like this.Also I found it interesting how one of the actresses from the first movie plays herself in this movie. Her character gets kidnapped to get made into a centipede after she had been in a movie where she played a girl getting made into a centipede.As far as disturbing goes..........this movie has a lot of disturbing scenes that are very detailed. I would not watch this unless you can handle anything, and I mean ANYTHING! There is a lot of stuff that happens that i think goes way too far.

Disgusting, wrong and sadistic are only a few of the nicer words critics have called it. Director Tom Six is quite the showman of shock, having the audacity to create two of the most sickest \"mainstream\" films in recent history.Of course with any sequel it needs to be bigger, bolder, and shockier (yeah, I made that word up). Since the great Dr. Heiter was killed at the end of the first film, we get a new protagonist in the form of Martin, a short and very rotund man who has lived a very disturbing life. He is mentally handicapped and was severely abused by his father, his therapist has dreams of raping him and his mother even tries to kill him. Martin seems to get by with an obsession with the original Human Centipede film. He plans to create a centipede of his own but with twelve people instead of the original three. Martin works as an overnight parking garage attendant and knocks out a bunch of people and keeps them in a warehouse. While Dr. Heiter was a skilled surgeon, Martin is quite crude in his methods.Every aspect of this film has been designed to shock and disgust to the highest degree and some scenes are just so outrageous you might find yourself chuckling. Martin is spectacularly realized by actor Laurence R. Harvey, his name could be an alias since anything about him is hard to find, and there was another somewhat famous actor named Laurence Harvey in the 1950s and 60s. I don't remember Martin ever saying a word, but his character and mannerisms are just so perfect for this role. He is creepy, disgusting, dirty and utterly insane. In a very interesting twist Martin is able to get one of the actresses from the first film to show up at his warehouse with the promise of auditioning for a Quentin Tarantino film. I pretty sure Quentin would love this movie but he is probably to busy playing Online Bingo.Director Tom Six also had the grapes to present everything in black and white. He knows how to push peoples buttons and everything is planned out to give a certain effect. This movie is quite hard to watch even when you know what you're in for, and for people to pay money to see it, I sure brings a huge smile to Six's face.",

However with this film, i will say that i was genuinely terrified, this movie is obviously a hell of a lot more realistic than the first as the main character is pretty much the viewer and the actual horror element is amped up to the top.I appreciate the fact that these movies are gross and silly but this movie was just a piece of garbage, the guy in the movie almost gave me nightmares he gave such a creepy performance, no funniness coming from this guy, just sick perversions, yuck, he is just vile in so many ways.I hope people aren't going to watch this movie expecting a bit of a laugh, because you will be very disappointed.

It's like it was written by an edgy 16 year old and the tone feels like the director thought he was being really clever and provocative but it's just annoying.The acting is absolutely terrible by everyone involved, there are no likeable characters and i feel sorry for any of the actors who thought this was going to be their big break.Could maybe be a movie you could laugh at with a few friends over a few beers but it isn't worth watching other than that.Don't bother, spend your money on a sandwich instead.

There was a time (not so long ago) when people with imaginations like Six's were put into a padded cell and the key was thrown away - in fact, thinking about it, THAT story would make a better movie than this. Obviously there was a typo in the credits because it should read, \"Tom Sick\"!I watched another horror movie earlier this week and that was decidedly weird (but then isn't that what horror movies are anyway?) but this one really left me wondering how on earth the producers were able to, A) get funding for this debacle and, B) get anyone to act in it - is getting a gig THAT hard?Seriously, if I was an actor asked to play a part in this movie, I would have declined in favour of cleaning toilets (probably a lot less disgusting too!)OK, I suppose I ought to try to find something positive to write and so I will give Laurence R Harvey credit for portraying his character well. The only query I have is, what will he do next? Since this is his debut, has he already typecast himself for ever? I wonder what Laurence's next-door-neighbour thinks about when he goes to bed at night!! (Again, could be a good plot for Mr Six to explore.)If you have a terminal disease and want to make it seem better then by all means watch this film.

            "content": "This is the 3rd time I have now seen this movie and as its December ( Bah humbug ) its not the type of movie you'd expect to find someone watching...Now I loved the 1st movie and felt it was a movie of sheer Psychological power over its viewer where nothing really gross happened that you saw on screen, yet many of the viewers of the 1st film at film festivals threw up, walked out, felt faint etc...No movie in my opinion has caused so much Hysteria where nothing has really happened on screen to provoke an audience as much as the 1974 Tobe Hooper master piece \" The Texas Chainsaw Massacre \" ( Although there actually wasn't that much of a massacre!!! )Director/Writer/Producer Tom Six made one the many surprise low budget films most directors envy in the form of originality and cult success as the First Sequence did.His name is now well known more so than the god awful Uwe Boll ( Although unlike Boll, he's known for all the right reasons! ) The movie had great acting from German actor Dieter Laser and Japenese actor Akihiro Kitamura in a fun mad doctor movie, almost takes me back to the hammer horror days...Now the sequel got more advertising than most movies due to its cult status and the fact that it was banned here in the UK, Cut in America and released uncut in Australia only to be banned over there too.Dubbed as the sickest movie of all time, The Full Sequence really went all out on the gore and gross out moments that your mind created in the first film and sadly this just felt like a child's idea of humour more than an eye catching fun ride of a movie the 1st film achieved.The film has been released for around a month now here in the UK after the BBFC made 32 cuts and trimming down the film by 2 minutes and 37 seconds.The film being 100% medically INaccurate as the first was 100% medically accurate makes its over the top grossness seem more like a comedy as I could not take Six' attempt to gross me out seriously...The plot this time is on a mentally ill man named Martin who lives with his mother and suffers from issues due to him being sexually abused by his father and now mentally abused by his mother.He spends his time at work watching his favourite film \" The Human Centipede \" over and over and seeing Dr Heiter ( Dieter Laser ) as his hero, often masturbating with sand paper to the movie.The film being shot in black and white is a smart move by Six as it does take away amounts of the gore which does add a little uniqueness to it and more of an artistic direction to the film and the pace of the movie itself is an improvement over the 1st, as I thought you saw too much of the title creation in the first film and that the end dragged on a little.The movie often goes completely goofy though for starters, His Dr, Dr Sebring wants to have sex with Martin and Martin is by far the most odd looking, unattractive guy anyone would want to have sex with. Also another silly moment comes where Martin contacts Ashlynn Yennie from the first movie and sets up a fake interview with Quentin Tarantino in a warehouse?! Now if you got into a car with an odd looking man that doesn't speak who's covered in blood and stops at a warehouse, would you think an audition is being held there for a Tarantino flick? No neither did I.Ashlynn Yennie is as annoying and dull as the first film and you kinda cheer for her to become part of the 12 person Centipede just for her to shut her dam mouth.The script is often silly where it should have been more focused and driven its audience to be more fearful rather than into a giggling frenzy like it did to me.Like the one part of the film that packs the punch is the sh*t scene at the end, where Martin was trying to get them to sh*t by making fart noise's, this had me laughing to the point it took me away from the whole gross out fest that was plastered everywhere this year.All in all this is a let down and the original didn't have the grossness but worked so much better.Six' approach to go full force as he stated failed BIG TIME! To his credit, he has come out with a sequel that went another direction rather than what most sequels do and his casting of Martin ( Laurence R Harvey ) is faultless as this guy is the only actor in the movie thats performance really shines past all the blood and sh*t.Six might not be a great writer like Wes Craven or David Cronenberg but original and main lead casting he has proved to be his worth in this genre.Overall Id give this film a 6/10.The 3rd and FINAL SEQUENCE, Six has stated part 2 compared to part 1 would be my little pony and part 3 to part 2 will be like an exciting Disney film...Well Tom, if your 3rd and final centipede movie is like part 2, I think a Disney film might be on my next agenda! Ethier way good luck to you and Ill be there for the next film.",

Others can say all they want about it being the chronicle of a madman - it nonetheless fails spectacularly at such a characterization. The sheer concept alone is a sophomoric attempt to simply shock. How about using the first film as a starting point, and have it so that the doctor was actually part of a group of sick and depraved like minded fellow surgeons who perform similar vivisection experimentation. Imagine the possibilities if the girl who survived the first sequence were taken away by members of such a group before the authorities got there, to be subjected and witness to worse horrors beyond which she has already suffered . . . ? It could still be done, however, as apparently none of it really happened except in the mind of the antagonist all along, if the final scene was any indication.Bottom line - save your time and avoid this mess.",

By willingly sitting through this cacophony of feces and screams I have tacitly permitted director Tom Six to befoul my soul. I now expect to exhibit symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Thank you Mr Six for the 88 minutes it took you to dehumanize me.Simply put, this entire project is a superfluous exercise in violence with no redeeming artistic or social value at all. This was not a movie. It was a molestation. It was a quick cash-in on the popularity of Human Centipede I. I saw the first HC wondering if this one would have been any better. It was not. It would have been immeasurably easier on my humanity to have watched something more light-hearted. Sitting through a cooking show hosted by Ed Gein or watching a documentary on how to treat Perirectal Itch would have held more charm than sitting through Human Centipede II There's no detailed plot development or back-story. It is devoid of any real dialog with very little genuine character development at all. There is no noteworthy music or soundtrack. There is only one thing. Violence. Six has dehumanized the cast, reducing them to meat with grotesque levels of violence. I found it difficult to display any empathy either for the picked-on, pudgy, mentally challenged, miscreant Martin or any of his hapless victims. I simply found myself not caring at all. I was too busy cringing and reaching for the sick bag.The fact that Six believes filming this salad tossing 'Anal Fantasia' in black and white (and brown, apparently) gives it some sort of art school legitimacy or the feel of a bona fide horror movie is wrong. Black and white does mute the levels of gore. The gore would have been ramped WAY up had he released this movie in color. Ach, watching color footage of Mr Six drowning a litter of kittens in a bucket of his own urine would have been easier to sit through. Perhaps in his next movie? A word to anyone who might be thinking about choosing the theater as a career. Sit through this uncomfortable, festering boil of a movie. Notice what these actors had to do for their craft. Imagine telling your friends I found work, a movie roll! And it turns out you're credited as victim number 5 after spending countless weeks naked with your face duck taped to some other out of work actor's arse! Do these guys even get a break for lunch? When filming such stink-bomb subject matter, I'm not sure whether that would be a blessing or a curse. I applaud their professionalism for having had put up with such on screen directorial degeneracy . The only question remaining: Will Ashlynn Yennie get her salad tossed yet again for the cameras in some future Human Centipede III? I don't know and don't care. I've already sat through TWO servings of Tom Six. You'll need a guy like Martin to shove a funnel down my throat if you want me to digest any more sick from Tommy Six",

            "content": "Ahh... The Human Centipede: First Sequence (2010)\nTom Six's debut went straight for the jugular and as a result seemed to spark the level of controversy and dismissive hyperbole most commonly reserved for people mutilating small furry animals.\nThree years after its initial release it seems I belong to the minority, who believed that Tom Six's original stab at the centipede was a work of pure brilliance, as a result I was more than a little excited, not to mention anxious to see where he might take the story next.\nSo without further ado, let's take a closer look at the second chapter, shall we?Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) is an obese reclusive loner, who lives with his nagging mother (Vivien Bridson) in a ramshackle apartment building in a bleak and poverty striking London neighbourhood. He works as a night watchman at a parking garage, a job that affords him plenty of time to indulge his obsession with Tom Six's film The Human Centipede which he watches on a continues loop on his laptop while tending to his scrapbook, filled with pictures and memorabilia from the movie, including an painstakingly detailed operation chart depicting the ass-to-mouth surgery, performed by the movies mad scientist Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser)\nPushed to the brink of his already frail sense of sanity by noisy and intrusive neighbours and his perpetually exasperating mother, Martin hatches a plan to outdo his fictional idol by creating his own centipede. Soon a wide assortment of unwilling participants lie naked and battered on the concrete floor of a dilapidated warehouse as Martin commence with his fiendish plan.\nArmed with duct tape, household tools, a staple gun, razor wire and a large supply of laxative, Martin is determent to fabricated the most majestic of beings; A twelve part centipede.Part dux in the ongoing centipede-saga takes the Meta approach, which some reviews have sniffed at as a smug and pretentious move away from the established narrative, a matter of opinion I guess, personally I found the entire notion of breaking the fourth wall refreshing and quite bold for a genre film as sleazy and detestable as this one, when quite frankly the easiest thing to do would have been to simply continue onwards with the established and expected, given that it worked a charm the first time round. It clearly shows that there's some sort of intellect and out of the box mentality (albeit a highly depraved of sorts) present in driving the series forward, which ultimately leaves me all the more curious as to where the planned third chapter might take us.As is most common, the main reason people tend to tread these murky roads of discomfort seems to be that they offer the viewer a chance to test their boundaries while they emerge themselves in the pervasive exploits of utter degradation that these types of films have to offer. Well, let me tell you (if you haven't already been brought up to speed) that The Human Centipede II: Full Sequence fully lives up to and dare I say might even surpass the expectation of even the most hardened/tested gore-hounds out there.\nThe film offers up a glorious parade of atrocities including rape, mutilation, a messy delivery of a newborn and more fecal matter then even De Sade would care to be associated with (check out the sly dig at Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, no points for guessing what element have been colour corrected here)\nFor short it's a smeared love letter to the art-form of Grand Guignol and if you should find yourself wishing for an even more offensive and cruel piece of moviemaking, then might I suggest a little thing called psychotherapy instead?Anecdote time: I opted to give this film a viewing on the afternoon of Christmas Eve. That's right. In the midst of holiday carolling and a parade of plumb sugary treats, my brother-in-law (a fellow deviant) and I snug down to one of the unoccupied bedrooms in my parents abode to try and counterbalance all the\" too-all-a-good-night\" sentimentality with a wee dose of unbridled perversion. An hour and a half later we were positively craving the warmth and cuddly fell of yuletide ambience.\nUnfortunately we weren't the only ones affected by the visuals of Six's film as my unsuspecting Father caught a glimpse of the atrocities while passing the window and was left utterly mortified.\nLet me tell you... It's more than a little difficult defending film as an art form when the centipede is the subject of discussion.Technical speaking, the film represent an immaculate standard, outside A Serbian Film (Srpski Film, Srdjan Spasojevic, 2010) I can't remember a film this extreme looking so professional.\nThe Cinematography is expertly done by David Meadows whose black and white imagery brings to mind the nightmarish qualities of David Lynch's Eraserhead (1977).\nMuch like Dieter Laser in the first film, Laurence R. Harvey represents a real find as the blubbery, perspirering mass that is Martin, a tragic and largely pathetic creature that's perfectly in sync with the film's freak-show antics and while he never utters a word, his bulging eyes and childlike demeanour is never-the-less wholeheartedly effective.\nLast but certainly not least, I want to mention the spectacular job done by the make-up effects team, unpleasantries seldom looked as convincing or dear I say good as this.\nIt's quite clear that the filmmakers didn't intended for the film to be taken all that seriously but this approach also renders it fairly inconsequential, which begs the question; why should the audience even get involved?\nUltimately it's pure unbridled exploitation which means it deliberately shallow and primarily designed to titillated. Whether or not you want it as rough as this is primarily a matter of taste (or lack off).",

Many times while watching this I actually thought it was a comedy due to the cheesy acting and plot.The concepts of the gore weren't too terrible but it was very unrealistic and far too drawn out and slow. Philosophy of the Knife did this in a way as to make it more disturbing and grotesque, but Centipede 2 somehow made it more comical in most cases. The black and white added nothing and I can only imagine it was done to cheap out on special effects.As a huge horror/gore fan I am saddened that this is one of the most mainstream of the genre. Maybe it's just my opinion but gore is not enough to make a movie in and of itself. A Serbian Film and Antichrist prove that a gory movie can also be a great movie.

            "content": "When I first saw \"The Human Centipede I\" I was skeptical about how the movie would play out, you can never tell with small budget foreign horror movies. But I will say that most foreign horror movies are by far better than their American counter-parts. A majority of American Horror films still center around the \"slasher style\" theme.I did enjoy the the first Human Centiped and loved the medical and psychological aspects it was built around. It was original in my opinion. The film wasn't too gory or even that vulgar, but it was the idea and concept that made it so good to me.Now \"The Human Centipede II\" was a total surprise to me as far as sequels go. No Dr. returning from the dead, no secret assistant to carry on his plans, and no survivors taking up the experiment. Instead what you get is a brutal, gory film centered around an extremely mentally disturbed character.I've seen a lot of reviews criticizing the \"lack of character development\" and thats just BS. If anyone has ever studied film and/or Psychology in school then you can relate to the main character's personality. His character development is centered around childhood abuse from his father which leads to his current state of mental health. If you've studied psychology, psychoanalytical theory, conditioning, then you know what I mean. In a sense you almost feel sorry or sympathize with the main character and this was developed beautifully without any \"real\" dialogue from the main character.What I will say is that \"The Human Centipede II\" was a hell of a lot more gory than the original and very disturbing in some of the scenes, especially the uncut version. This film is by far not a master piece, but I thought the concept and the way the film was shot worked very well.So I would suggest that you give this film a shot and form your own opinion about it. If you're a blood and guts freak then you'll like it for that reason, if you're looking for something that could very well happen; meaning the obsession with a film and the act to carry out what was observed, then you'll like it for that reason. Or you'll just plain hate it. Anyways give it a watch and then think about what you just saw. I might also suggest having something a little \"happy\" or something to brighten up the mood after watching this.",

Very often, horror movies are presented as incredibly shocking yet they always come short of really shocking the audience (except for 12 year-old girl scouts that is). The problem being that, even though the audience expects something \"sick\", people rarely want to go the full way and see something really disgusting like a mother squashing her newborn child or a girl being anally raped by a fat midget. Yet you get all of this here. So for once, a movie presented to be the most shocking ever actually is, well OK, I'd also have to mention Salo's 120 Days Of Sodom in here since it's the only movie that comes close to this level of gruesomeness. But for fans of \"gore\" praising Cannibal Holocaust or Ichi the Killer and such, that is nothing compared to this.",

I didn't really know what to expect when I watched the first one. This one however, I had more insight into and the curiosity factor got the better of me finally after months of debating 'do i really want to watch this movie' and the sound of the mad doctor shouting 'feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed her' going around and around in my head. This film however is nothing like the first one. Very depressing mood set from the start with a truly horrific theme to the background of the lead and why he turned out to be the repulsive sick man he did. Very well played by him and the woman who played his mother however - most believable and brought the film to life. The rest of the cast were neither here nor there and you didn't really care for them, in fact some of the individuals almost deserved their fate. The shock factor... Okay I watched the cut version. However I have read the bits that were cut out and its obvious in the film where they have been cut from. They wouldn't have brought anything to the film only another instance of where you would feel the need to cover your eyes or barf. There are a few instances of this towards the end of the film. Some of the instances are actually bordering on the ridiculous - i.e the woman who gives birth in the car or the scene where the mad man is blowing raspberries at the centipede in order to get them to defecate. The latter had me in stitches laughing and the lead subsequently is laughing too. Way over the top for me. After all his efforts he decides to shoot nearly every member of his centipede anyway and his lead - well what she did to him really had me in stitches. By the time you get to this point i think you have really seen it all, but then you are left with the notion that this was all really a sick man's fantasy. For the record reckon I think the whole film is.. Didn't leave me with the feelings the first film did, I think it may have lost it's shock factor already being done once before. Human Centipede 3 on its way and I really dread to think ...Would I recommend this film? Who to exactly? Give it a go if you have watched things like Saw etc it might 'make you harder..'",

The First HC was about a Doctor, living in isolation, obsessing over his life work. Wondering Possibilities and wanting to take science into his own hand's. It was about a Bad man doing good things, to finally one day, now that his career is over, making a turn for the worst.. The first one was clean, shot in a clean house, and had an unsettling silence throughout the film, which made the viewers skin Crawl. The Execution was Not perfect, but was good enough for the viewer to feel the pain and suffering of the Centipede characters. The Second one is the exact opposite. Similar to the first, we have a crazy man, a mentally disturbed, mentally retarded, midget sporting glasses who has a problem with soiling himself. This Man lives with his mother, in a strange apartment building. His neighbors randomly walk into his home curse him and his mother, simply for asking them to turn down their loud music. Finally our Villain has had enough and decides to capture and create a 12 man centipede. Now, For shock Value, This movie Gets a 10. It's shot visually stylish within the world of black and white. I do not remember an ounce of color at all in the film. The Problem is the premise is too unrealistic. We are to believe a Mentally retarded man, can design a 12 person centipede, with only household items. Martin spends 50% of the movie breathing hard, running out of breath, throwing up at his own work, grunting and making weird faces. It's a stretch to believe this man could handle his job as security guard, let alone construct a centipede. For this simple reason, which is also a big reason, I could not take this film seriously. If a Doctor Had trouble with 3? How could a Amateur with a low level of thinking successfully build 12!!???",

So if you, like me, love sick movies, you will probably not be disappointed. It is also, like the first film, quite innovative (even though, if you think sick movies needs to justify themselves with social commentary or something like that - look elsewhere). But this one is much sicker. I must also say that the acting by Laurence R. Harvey was outstanding, which lifted the movie even more.I was a little skeptical about the black and white, but I can tell you that this movie is really worth watching anyway. But this is still an issue for me though, and the reason why I gave it an 8 instead of a 10. I could not see any direct purpose of making this movie in black and white, and it would have been even better in color. But as I said, don't let it scare you away.

Harvey) obsessed with the film The Human Centipede gradually kidnaps enough victims so he can make his own 12 person centipede.Well acted by Harvey, well made and well shot; the cinematography suits the grim, grimy surrounds and this is a vast improvement over the first with the superior acting and some characterisation. For most of the film you may ask, what is the point? You also need to suspend disbelief; are we really expected to believe that Harvey, whose intelligence is obviously below average, is really able to carry off his plan and set up one of the actresses from the first film (Ashlynn Yennie) to meet with him thinking he's involved in casting for a Tarantino film? All of this nonsense and indeed the former question, I think, are answered by a very clever twist ending which suggests that all we have seen is merely a fantasy of Harvey's. The former question is then answered with the idea that the film is suggesting that perhaps there are concerning effects on viewers of these types of films, which is, of course, highly ironic. Ultimately, the film's raison d'tre is the gore and depravity and here, thanks to laxatives forced upon his 'creation', the audience views faeces splurting out of anuses and into and out of mouths of the next link. Scenes, such as this are, of course, disgusting but at the same time amusing in their depravity and absurdity. There are genuine gore moments such as one of the victims, a bullying brute who often terrorised Harvey and his mother, having his teeth hammered out and a scene where he later tears his stapled mouth away from the anus he's attached to. Certainly recommended for gore fans.",

He puts in such a believable performance that at times is even a little scary in itself. Harvey really was that outstanding. Perhaps if this was a different film he would have been given the recognition his performance deserves.Replacing a sick doctor with seemingly no motivation for creating a human centipede, we actually have some what of a plot in this film. A simple man who has been sexually, physically and mentally abused his whole life and no longer has no any connection with reality; he becomes obsessed with recreating the human centipede having watched the original film.I thought I was prepared for what was to come, and with this in mind, I thought the first half of the film was quite okay.

As much as I like to see originality in films, THC just didn't do it for me at all - I found the fundamental concept laughable, the tone contradictory (intended to be a dark and shocking film, supported by a cast of pantomime characters and a cartoon villain...) and I just couldn't find it in myself to be frightened by the concept of being surgically forced to 'eat da poo poo'.The Human Centipede 2, on the other hand... Suffice to say I've never seen a movie director improve and mature so much in such a short period of time. THC2: Full Sequence is a gorgeously creative, unique and original film, cultured and sophisticated to the point that it's almost a shame it has to share a name with its predecessor. The first act has more than a little in common with David Lynch's 'Eraserhead', the dream-like atmosphere serving to help you to distance yourself from the rest of the film's explicit content.THC2 is a meta-sequel, set outside of the world of its namesake - think Return of the Living Dead, Wes Craven's New Nightmare or Halloween III: Season of the Witch - and revolves around a mute, asthma inhaler wielding sociopath, obsessed with the original film, attempting to recreate its \"100% medically accurate\" content for real, substituting surgical experience with brute force, a crowbar and staple gun.Here's the thing - the film is difficult to review as the 'good film checklist' doesn't apply here. THC2 can't be judged on the same scale as your typical movie because of the way it tells its story. For example, the severe lack of character development is one of the film's strongest points; the director wants you to follow one character - the antagonist (or protagonist?) - as he works on his 'project'. I can guarantee you'll find pages of reviews ridiculing the lack of any character development for any of the innocent people who meet their gory fates here, but this and the black & white presentation shift the focus away from 'nasty scary movie' and in the direction of an intriguing art film. You aren't supposed to be fearing for the lives of the innocents, but rather watching in fascination, almost seeing the world through the eyes of the 'villain', to whom these humans are no more than ingredients in his recipe.I would also expect to see many reviewers claiming this film to be 'the most explicit thing (they've) seen', and while objectionable content is probably more prevalent here than in many (or any) other mainstream movies, I risk repeating myself in stating that this really isn't the focus.I was as happy as a pig in the brown stuff to have such a stylised, almost Lynch-like film sprung on me in the middle of one of my mates' regular beer & double-feature nights which usually entail brainless horror films, but it wasn't without its share of drawbacks, particularly later on in the film when a pregnant character endures a far-too-predictable and completely implausible sequence of events.Overall an impressive and ferociously unique film, bound to anger a few prudes. Watch it just to be able to say that you've watched it, and hopefully you will appreciate this surprising leap forward for the post-Hostel gore genre as I did. I can't wait to see what comes next.",

Have you seen \"The Human Centipede\"? if so you will have a very good idea of the level of acting in this film. In favor of the film, the plot is fairly well scripted,but the dialog is cheesy at best. The violence in the film is very \"tongue in cheek.\" (pun intended.) And is pitched in a similar way as \"Texas Vibrator Massacre.\" by Rob Rotten. This I feel is the main reason both film were banned by the bbfc. Ironically porn by \"maxxx hardcore\" or a film such as \"nil by mouth\" are by far more horrific, even through they are not in the 'horror.' genre, whereas this film is in the horror genre but would be more suited to the \"soft porn \" genre. If you a looking for a torture gore fest then \"SAW\" or similar has the budget to out do this film. IF on the other hand you are looking for a intelligent satire on a serial killer then \"Henry portrait of a serial killer \" or \"Se7ven\" would be a better choice. For a satire on scat and ass to mouth porn,and the challenge that it can be morally acceptable,this is the film to tick this box.",

Director, Tom Six, captures the gruesomeness of everything very well and has a little potential to be good. Having The Human Centipede 2 in black and white really adds to the film. I think it makes little more disgusting in black and white. Tom Six is just a shock value director and that's it. Tom Six also write this film and there isn't much to the script. It's just a disgusting story to get people cringing. As far as the performances go they aren't good, except for Laurence Harvey who plays Martin. Harvey gives an unsettling performance for a disgusting character. He's really gross to watch and I found myself at times taking my eyes of the screen. The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence) is a disgusting film that is made for shock value. If you want to watch this film go for it, but I don't recommend it.",

Not a fan of the black and white theme and thought the plot was weak. How does an asthmatic, overweight, mentally challenged short man become in possession of a gun and also be able to smack people round the head with a crowbar (without killing them) managing to tie them up and load them in to the back of a van to ship them off to a warehouse? The movie relies on gore for shock value but this doesn't seem to add to the movie, it just seems wildly unnecessary. Bad acting and unbelievable happenings make this quite unbearable to watch. I definitely thought I would enjoy this more after seeing the first installment. I think the only thing that is worse than this is The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence).

Granted, if you're looking for a chick-flick, it might be more grim than usual. Or depending on your point of view, possibly not.It's The Human Centipede, and if you're going into the 2nd installment of a film like this, you know exactly what you're in for and exactly what the main gist is. I found this one to be a lot better than the first - in pacing, storyline, acting, just about everything was better. It was darker than the first, and really tried to give more of an insight into the antagonist. Being shot fully in black and white was a great touch, it made it a little different and really added to the bleakness.There were some glaringly obvious logical errors here and there, and it is by no means one of the best films ever made, but it was decent and a vast improvement on its predecessor.",

In the process of homogenizing the film, they also rendered the plot shapeless, confusing, and uninteresting. I have read multiple reviews that mention a twist, not in the cut version shown in theaters. I read reviews that mention other despicable acts never seen in a movie, not in this version. The director, Tom Six, has recently mentioned that IFC Films has the ability to cut the film however they seem fit depending on the market. He should rethink that position. This version of the film is not good, scary, overly gory, crazy, or fun. Poop is gross, but it can't carry a movie.",

The way he kidnapped everyone was also pretty funny, do you not think that hitting people over the hard fairly hard with a heavy blunt object could case some bad internal bleeding or death, whatever. The gore effects were pretty good in many scenes, to the point where you really cringe when he cuts their knee caps open. But the absolute most hilarious part was when the pregnant woman, began giving birth, she literally hobbled across the entire room they were all in, with blood pouring out if her and screaming in the most hilarious way. Despite this film being pretty terrible overall with bad editing, terrible line delivery, no characters at all and over the top gore and action, it is still a hilarious movie and definitely worth a watch to people that like this kind of film, just don't drink before watching, i started to feel nauseated about halfway through the film.",

            "content": "The human centipede II is a wonderful masterpiece composed by a gifted writer and directed by a very spectacular director. Now let me explain why the previous sentence was one of the most inaccurate sentences you'll read in your entire life.I'm not even going to judge this movie on actual qualities that I would for most movies, like acting, dialogue, or plot because there is very little to none of those qualities in this movie. We all know what this is; a gorefest meant to push the boundaries of what can be made into a feature length film. People sewn ass to mouth? Rape? Graphic infanticide? Implied pedophilia and constant gore? Child abuse? It's all here ladies and gentleman, complete with ass-spewing color towards the end.There is very little dialogue in the movie, and what dialogue there is is very poorly acted, generic, and uninspired. The editing is hack too, but not noticeable because the film in general is so poor that I didn't realize it myself until I read another comment here about it.The main character isn't even a protagonist, he's more of a.... sad, vile, pathetic little man who I just cannot relate to or sympathize for. But he has a dream, some might even call it a disturbing obsession. An obsession with the human centipede and he needs to kidnap twelve people and sew their faces to their asses like yesterday. The other characters in the movie are memorable, but not for good reasons, mind you. A pedophile psychologist who pounds hooker ass, and a psychotic mother who screams for most of the film and blames her son for her husband going to jail because you know, it's the kid's fault his dad sexually abused him. Plot development includes dreams of human centipede, preparation of human centipede, defecation of human centipede, graphic murder of human centipede. Fin.Now lets get down to why I just couldn't sit back and enjoy this god awful film. I just cannot state how poorly made this film was. You'll have to suspend your disbelief to some unknown boundary before this film seems remotely plausible.How the hell does this 4 ft 9 inch, morbidly (DISGUSTINGLY) obese, short sighted, asthmatic midget manage to kidnap people? Let alone 12 people, and make it seem so easy? Well if Martin can do it, then this movie made me confident that I could make at least a good 50 or 60 chain centipede and keep them alive for at least a good 30 minutes before shooting them all in the head and slitting their throats terrorist style. Everyone falls victim to Martin's incredible kidnapping skills. Apparently lugging a 6 ft 8 300 lb skinhead out of your building isn't too difficult when you're so fat you haven't seen your penis in years. Also I think I'll have a go at kidnapping my victims from parking garages from now on, as Martin bludgeoned about 10 people in the head in his parking garage and no one suspected a thing, despite the pools of blood everywhere, and the missing people, and the baby left crying in the car, and the gunshots going off at random, and the giant transit vehicle constantly emitting muffled screams. I'm sure there's other questionable things there, I just want to move on. Then there's the baby scene. I burst out laughing at the over the top insanity of the scene. I found it hilariously shocking that it was included in the film. Also none of the people that Martin managed to kidnap really seem to be putting up much of a fight. True, some took a bullet and they all took a crowbar to the head, but they all seem quite able bodied and capable in the warehouse. They all sort of just.... let Martin cut them up and sew them together. I mean he didn't even tie up the pregnant woman and she DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!! There's twelve of you people, come on! Someone just... for the love of god roll over on your stomach, get up on your knees, stand up, hop over to Martin and do a flying jump kick right into his fat gut. He would probably die from that alone.The filmmakers made the movie as if duct tape around your wrists and over your mouth makes you completely helpless and unable to move or do anything. With that being said it was only duct tape inhibiting these people, not chains. But apparently duct tape is just as good.Did anyone else notice that at one point our Shrek-like protagonist was watching the human centipede on DVD on his LAPTOP.... and he proceeds to rewind it like a VHS tape back to the beginning.....????? In closing, I enjoyed this film because I'm a sick, perverted, twisted person. However, it is a horrible film that has only shock value behind it, which isn't a very good value to have if there's nothing else you can bring to the table. I won't be watching it again unless I watch it with friends for a laugh. Now if you'll excuse me, I think I left my mother at the dinner table again.",

By the way, if I tell you that this film is *gasp* actually more entertaining than the first one, will you believe me? There's no point in debating: they're both trash. But while the first film was slow-mo, dusty, claustrophobic trash, with the good ole doctor giving life to his (lame) fantasies through a complicated process (for the mentally challenged) this one gets a little bit more peppered, to say so. There are some scenes that are actually close to classic! Sure, you don't have to agree with me, but as far as I can tell, there are some gems like these: 1) kitchen raid! You've got to love that at a wannabe doctor. 2) \"what's that thing between your shoulders?\" moment, a la Herschell Lewis. 3) cut that butt! Nope, you've overdone it. There is classic camp. Or trash. Like Lewis' Something Weird or the hilarious Gore-Gore Girls, but blame me for being just nostalgic, or for liking their soundtracks. Human Centipede is somehow misleading as a film title, it makes you think \"boy, there has to be some serious stuff going on here\", it makes you think of something complex. Yet the biggest pleasures exhibited by the Doc in the first sequence and Marty in the retard sequence were related to... seeing their great creations chain-pooping. That's right, folks, if the mad scientist inside you decides to abduct and get some people really close together like Marty did, it's because they look really wacky while chain-pooping with each one's mouth sewn to another one's black cherry. This is almost as awesome as having a discussion with Marie Curie or Thomas Kuhn only to interrupt her/him if you happen to see two dogs after intercourse: \" har-har, they look stupid\". Marty's attitude is rather ambiguous: does he feel something for his moronic creation, for what it symbolizes, or he just wanted a cheap laff but goes gaga and kills 'em all after he gets the razz from a woman who gives birth to a healthy baby boy/girl and escapes his circus attraction claws? Beyond this, Marty is really, really, infinitely repulsive. Congrats to Mr. Six Synapses for finding the perfect lizard boy, though I doubt that he would be any good for a non-horror movie role. His whole presence screams: \"lemme kill the normal people or at least those with no man-boobs!\". However, I couldn't shake away the satisfaction when seeing Marty deliver some crowbar delight or a lead intoxication to irritating folks like his mom or his psychiatrist, or whatever that guy was. They were every bit as loathsome as him. And while this movie isn't devoid of loathsome characters, it's quite devoid of any factor that would make you come back for another round. P.S: That's a ridiculous amount of crowbars to the heads. He has to whack them almost every time they start moaning, yet they still BREATHE! Marty is such a magnet for human beings with strong craniums.",

This may very well be the most disturbing movie ever made, visually anyways. While Cannibal Holocaust is much more disturbing psychologically(the real animal death, the 'a little too realistic' special effects, the controversy), as well as Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer and countless others, this takes the cake for the most extreme.While there is no character development whatsoever(Martin doesn't say a whole word the entire movie. He isn't cool or funny like Dr. Heiter in the first one), you don't really go into a movie like the Human Centipede 2 expecting a whole lot. I must say though, cinematically, the first one triumphs over this in every way except for the violence. I have seen Cannibal Holocaust, Men Behind the Sun and the whole lot. For those who think Martyrs is depraved, I've got news for you. This makes Martyrs, Inside, Frontiers and Irreversible all look like a Jennifer Aniston movie. You can argue all you want to but its the truth. While the aforementioned(at least martyrs, irreversible and inside) have a lot more substance and are much better films, they simply pale in comparison to this.SPOILERS: Some of the good stuff you have to look forward to include a man's teeth being hammered out, a man ripping his face from the stitching of another man's ass, graphic throat slitting, crowbar bashing, face smashing, a woman stepping on her newborn premature fetus in order to hit the gas pedal to escape and loads of other good stuff.",

Harvey, the actor playing deranged Martin, who is really clever and convincing. Anyway, if you set your expectations very low, you may even have some fun. Of course, limited.",

It is surprisingly different from the first, however, this time with less tension and fear of the idea and instead being filled with gore, gore, and more gore.That is, in fact, all this film has to offer. It has gore ranging from a person being shot in the leg all the way up to a newborn's head being smashed. There are scenes in here witch made me question why I was even watching this.There is no such thing as character development, something vital in horror films as the effect is only amplified by being attached to the protagonist or whoever else. In this movie, character development is replaced with disturbing scenes and unlovable, one-sided characters.I don't give this film a 3/10 simply because it has gore, I give it that because gore is all it has. You need something besides gore to help make it interesting. Whether that be action, romance, frolicking through daisies, or whatever, there has to be something else. Most horror movies have moments where the protagonist can catch their breath, away from whatever horrors they face. Not here, after each time you see someone being cut open and die someone else gets cut open. It's exhausting and repetitive to say the least.",

Again, that was a sick movie as well, I gave it a 5 for the interesting idea, even though it had a very high number of clich\u00e9s.Moving on to this utter crap movie. It's about a \"midget\" who is working at a car park and who sits in his booth watching the same movie all night, \"Human Centipide 1\" which is very ironic and in the same time is the only reason I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. Just because of that idea.Oh, and I forgot to tell you that this guy's face is very scary, especially in close-ups where you can see his sweat going down his face. This guy wants to recreate the events in the first movie, but this time with 12 people instead of 3 which is MENTAL. He starts randomly killing people around the car-park and putting them in his mini-van, afterward he takes them to a secluded warehouse. One of the recruits is one of the actresses who was in the first Centipide movie, who was stupid enough to accept an anonymous casting invitation for a movie which is directed by Quentin Tarantino. Yeah, right. Now who is stupid enough to think Quentin would want an unknown actress with no acting skills whatsoever to play in a Hollywood movie. After he recruits his \"army\" he starts to do all sorts of things to their body; the gore in this movie is probably the best part about this movie because it looks so real. It's disgusting. I had to watch this movie in two sittings because I couldn't cope with the amount of gore the first time. Not going to spoil the ending, but don't worry.It's probably the single movie I've ever seen which doesn't have a meaning. I mean, it's just there. After we see it we don't feel anything. I've watched more than 700 movies in my life and this was the first and single time this happened to me. I mean it's a movie about a guy who goes out and kills random people and then conducts a disgusting experiment which leads to NOTHING.To conclude this review, all I can say is that you are safe if you go out and see the first movie if you haven't already. But please, do yourself a favor, don't watch this movie. Watch another movie. Re-watch a movie which you've already seen.Don't watch this. It's utter crap.",

I was practically gleeful when I found out there was more to see.My boyfriend and I watched this and it was easily the most disturbing thing either of us had ever seen. We both got so queasy, we nearly turned it off. I get sick just thinking about it. After it was over, we didn't even want to discuss how bad it was. We just wanted to forget about it.I related this information to my parents, as they both were excited for the new installment like I was. When I explained how bad it was, they got more excited and I had to convince them that it was so awful there was no enjoyment. They would regret it, I told them.This movie is atrocious. There's nothing of substance here. The whole time, you sit there thinking, \"This can't possibly get worse.\" And then it does. That seems to be the only thing anyone was trying to accomplish in making this movie. I'm pretty sure they set out with the intent to make people throw up, and that's it.This is not bad in a fun way. It's not so gross you have to see it... it's the opposite. I regret watching this movie. I have felt like I have wasted time on movies before, but this went so far beyond that.

Or just curious? Whatever although It is sick, I just couldn't take it at all serious, granted with a bigger budget he could have improve it. But really, I was just Peeing myself laughing at some of the scenes of the centipede. So bad it's good kind of film, but really not quite that high or worth watching again.

            "content": "I give this film 7.5 out of 10. It was just in case of the IMDb not having a half point on the score.The film that I will be reviewing about is The Human Centipede 2. This is the type of movie on whether the audience will hate it; love it, no comment, or both. When I saw the predecessor The Human Centipede my reaction was surprised, no comment, etc. In other words, I saying to myself what the hell did I just watch or how did I start to watch this. This happened throughout as I was watching from the beginning to the end, but emphasizing more on the middle to the conclusion. I don't want to get into The Human Centipede but what I want to point out is the concept was original.The story begins about a man named Martin. Martin is a psychologically messed up loner working in a parking garage literally obsessed with The Human Centipede film. That's right. It turns out the predecessor was fake meaning the events never happened. It was a movie after all. The director Tom Six said that part 2 was a meta-sequel meaning more or it has to do with the fact that it is set as the same universe. Look at it as a play and we the people are watching them.The plan was for Tom explaining to the audience what would happen if there was a crazed lunatic who become so engulfed into a film that he/she actually could make a real life human centipede? That's a scary thought because inhumane experimentation did happened and is still happening.Martin lives with his verbally abuse mother who constantly tries to murder him. His father who raped his own son and is in prison for reckless crimes; for that the suicidal, crazy mother blames him and wishes to end their miseries. Right off the bat Martin's childhood got chopped and screwed and now it affected him in his adulthood.In a strange way I actually cared for Martin. Even though he has no dialog in this film he is very expressive to the point you don't need words to understand what he is trying to say or feel. I praise highly to the actor giving us a character we want to hate so much and at the same time comfort him. Martin keeps a scrapbook containing all the instructions, scenes, and the casts are all there. To get his plan started he kidnaps a wide range of victims to the total of 12. Although ironically the people he kidnapped were not very nice. They have done shameful, sinful things in their lives. There were two exceptions to the people that didn't deserve it was the husband and his pregnant wife.The actress Ashlynn Yennie makes a return as a parody of herself. She is the epitome of Hollywood standards. It's funny because when she did the predecessor she was the end of the centipede and now she is the head of the centipede. With that said she was sort of survival of the fittest this time around.The Human Centipede 2 is black and white. The only color shown was the exploding defecation scene which is brutal and downright nasty to say the least. Tom Six wasn't kidding when he said The Human Centipede was My Little Pony compared to the meta-sequel. It was a smart move when he did the entire film in black and white because this movie would never see the light of day because of BBC censors. Also, because of this it created a dark, disturbed atmosphere in which is one of the main high point.The main complaints the critics said of The Human Centipede 2 that it was boring. I disagreed with this because the main set up was getting to know the main villain. I thought it was brilliant since the predecessor focused more on the plot and the victims. Another negative reason was the pacing was slow. The pacing was good for the tension to build up. I think if the scenes were cut out just a slight then it wouldn't have drag on. It would have been nice if all the casts specifically Dieter Laser were involved instead of focusing too much on Martin. Of course the plot which critics panned it saying there is no plot. I didn't hate the plot; however, I wish there was more to it. I have to say the second half of the film is a sharp incline almost to the point for shock value. I had to cover my eyes but not fully on the surgical scene. Imagine no anesthesia, no proper equipments, and no gloves. Talk about unhygienic. There is as I mentioned an explosive diarrhea fest occurring when the victims were injected with laxatives, lots of crying and moaning (not the sexual kind), rape, and going postal deaths.The ending is based on your interpretation meaning you the audience decide whether or not if this is fiction or non-fiction. Expect dark, revolting, and serious themes in this film. I give props to Tom Six for having the guts to what he wanted to do. I thought the film was good and original. The atmosphere was great. The same goes to the almost lack of color put out. The casts for the meta-sequel did an excellent job obviously Martin stood out for me the most.If you are a fan of the first film watch the meta-sequel. It was in fact different with the same idea. Also a lot stronger so definitely not for anyone dislikes gore, torture, and experimentation. If anyone is new to the trilogy don't watch this film. If possible watch The Human Centipede then watch The Human Centipede 2 to get the concept and understand. Watch with caution.",

Judging from the trailer it seemed as if Tom Six had taken a completely different approach on this centipede film and was going to push the envelope to another level. So I began to watch the film and by the end of it I wasn't sure what to think.The film is not a sequel to the first film but rather uses the first film to develop the plot. The story tells us of how Martin (Laurence R. Harvey) becomes obsessed and aroused with the film \"The Human Centipede\" and he feels like his sole purpose on this earth is to create a twelve person centipede. So he goes on a quest to fulfil his sick fantasy of a twelve person centipede and pretty much dominates twelve people with a crowbar and locks them up in an empty warehouse. First Sequence we get a professional surgeon creating the centipede but in Full Sequence we get an overweight uneducated slob with a stapler attaching peoples mouth to their ass.Overall the film was very unique and definitely much different from the first one. I loved the feeling of dread given throughout the film and especially enjoyed Martin's relationship with his mother (Vivien Bridson). Their relationship had that awkward Erasehead family dinner feel to it. If you can stomach the violence and appreciate it for what it is than it is definitely worth a watch.",

It seems that the sole intention of the film was to just make it as sickening as possible (to which it succeeded). However, I felt that the storyline was appalling. Some parts, just seemed rushed and very unbelievable. Whilst this is supposed to be a fictional film, as a horror fan, I like to be held in the suspension of disbelief. But this film constantly had me sitting back and thinking \"That clearly wouldn't happen\", when I should have been lost in the plot like I was in the first film. Its clear that they were, very much, scraping the bottom of the barrel with regards to hiring actors. For the majority of the cast, this was probably their first 'big-time' production and this really did show. It's clear that they had trouble casting this film and I am not surprised. Most respectable actors would have taken one look at the script and torn it up. I found the acting from most performers to be very 'dry'. The only actors which were decent were the main character 'Martin' (this was mostly because of the fact that his appearance made it impossible for him to be unbelievable as a psycho) and his mother, who did a good job of selling herself as an abusive, crazy old lady. I think the director should take a long look at this film and then a long look at himself and realise that, if he wants to be regarded as a credible film-maker, he SERIOUSLY needs to up his game. If his sole intention for this film was to make it as sick as possible, then he has done well. However, if he also wanted to make it a scary film with an exciting storyline, then he has failed miserably.I hope for the next film that he puts as much time and effort into the storyline as he does for the on-screen 'sickness'.

            "content": "People watch films like this mostly due to curiosity. In this sequel, curiosity tried to kill the cat again, but this time the cat was unimpressed.What made the first film so thought provoking was the fact that someone could actually do such actions in the real world - perverse surgery on unwilling victims. The worrying thought of being put in that situation yourself is terrifying. The actors of the victims did a terrific job acting in a way that I imagine one would. I believe it is a true representation of horror, being that there are no ghosts or zombies or any other nonsense that would otherwise remind you that it's a fantasy. The film is none other than a horrifying and believable situation and is targeted mainly for the curious minded.When I heard that there was to be a sequel, I sighed. Sequels usually are by definition the same idea as the first but on a larger scale - more of the same content but no inventive ideology. Well guess what? This is no different in that respect. This is different however in believability. The realistic aspect of the first stood strong, but a few of the events in this sequel leaves you to say to yourself \"That wouldn't happen in real life.\" It's a ruiner.The main character of this film, Martin, a multi-storage car park attendant, is obsessed and inspired by the first film and wishes to imitate it on a larger scale. A huge portion of the screen time is taken up with the collecting of the victims, apparently over a couple of days whereby he simply just walks up to people and shoots them and/or hits them with a crow bar, then drives them to a building and drops them off. The fact that there's no one else around who can hear these gun shots, notice veered off cars with bullet holes in them, notice the blood on the floor, report missing persons to the police is nothing short of a miracle. It wouldn't take the police long to visit the last known locations of these victims and review the security tapes, but apparently this is all ignored.The reminders of fantasy doesn't stop there, the entire playback is in black and white, apparently to make it feel more scary (this fails). The main character being a mute, traumatised weird looking man who is seen and analysed by a perverse doctor who has secret sexual desires for him, is all rather far fetched and bordering on silly.The unrealistic nature of these aspects ruined this film for me. For it now to be unbelievable in my mind makes me totally un-phased by the portrayed horror. It's hard to feel sorry for most of the victims too, as they are characterised as generally nasty people anyway.As you may have guessed by now, I wasn't impressed. If you're a fan of sick films then this may appeal to you, especially the uncut version, which I was (un)fortunate to obtain.Tom Six has made too many mistakes in this. Without realism this time round, the novelty is worn off. My curiosity is now depleted and I shan't bother watching the third instalment.",

He couldn't have cast a creepier and more unsettling actor as the killer. Who gives a believable performance throughout. The film is shot against an oppressive rainy London backdrop and is in black & white. This gives it an industrial feel, adding to the overall griminess of the film.This is in my opinion not as shocking in subject matter as \"A Serbian Film\".

But I'm not praising it.The story was shoe-horned into reality, there were waaay to many plot holes (& I'm not one to judge generally) but I found myself constantly questioning the events taking place in the movie. The dialogue was short, but when there was dialogue it was either delivered badly or it itself was bad (The acting of the one of the first victims nearly made me stop watching). I also didn't think the black & white made any difference to the setting, I read it was to make it scarier, I think that's a stupid reason, make it B&W because it'll be dark.The positives are pacing, there is a small side story dealing with his problems interwoven in between the abductions, which stops the first half from dragging, & the effects are very realistic. it has some character development but its not worth mentioning, just a bit of fleshing out of the main character, but more than the first did.To finish, I don't recommend any one to see this movie, the scenes are horrific; literally to the extreme, with no entertainment value of any kind, & the rest of the movie doesn't balance or improve it.

For me the best part about the concept is the fact that they are 'fused' to each other. The way Martin did it made escape relatively 'easy', in comparison, and recovery possible. So in a way - the first one is far more disturbing, since you just know that even if she is found, her entire face and rear end will need to be reconstructed. These people would only have had cut up lips, teeth knocked out and severed knee tendons. Nothing a few stitches and some titanium implants couldn't fix. Then an operation to sort the knees out. I saw the cut version, so I'm guessing I missed the 'best' bits. However, the part that did actually really bother me was the part where the little baby is left in the car crying, it doesn't make it clear how long he was left for, but at least a day maybe tow. And you imagine him hungry and thirsty and needing his mother. That was the most distressing part for me. And it doesn't make it clear, but the pregnant woman appears to crush her new born baby to death. It also doesn't make it clear whether or not she meant to - it appears as if she does. But why would she? I didn't like that bit either - even if it was very fake looking. The rest was a complete anti climax. I hope in the next one Tom Six, actually has the people sewn together like the surgeon does, so they can't escape. Anyone who claims to be damaged after watching this is a complete idiot - I've seen more gore and better FX in most low budget slasher movies.",

What I loved about the first one was the clean gore, consistent yet not repeating story line, and Dr. Heiter's (Dieter Laser) cruel creation. I didn't have such high expectations from this one and good thing I didn't, this movie sucked! The first 50 to 55 minutes of the movie consists of Martin (the disturbed loner) hitting people in the head with a crowbar. If I really wanted to watch an hour of the same scene I would just go back in the movie and watch that scene over and over again. Unlike the first one in this movie you don't have a centipede of 3, but a centipede of 12, so imagine seeing 12 people hit in the head for an hour, talk about repetition. Finally in the last 30 minutes I thought the movie should pick up\u0085well the movie sure did pick up but not in a good way. Anything from knees being ripped apart, teeth being knocked out, to mouths being stapled to bums over and over again; in other words tasteless and unnecessary gore. After all that I thought I would see some centipede action like in the first one, once again I was wrong. It followed by a pregnant lady running out of the room with blood bursting out of her followed by her giving birth to a stillborn and then stepping on its head while trying to floor the gas pedal. I am all for controversial and gore movies but there are some lines that can only be crossed if it's done right. Another line that this movie crossed was after the 12 victims had laxative inserted in their system. The first human centipede had a similar scene where the head of the centipede bowled in the girl's mouth however none of the bowl was shown; in this movie you see everything. Since their \"surgery\" is not done by a professional in a clean and sanitized place and since their mouths are stapled (so there are openings around it) you see a good amount of poop and blood gushing out of ones rear end into the mouth of the other with a lot of spillage that I did not want to see. Sadly this movie didn't even have a good ending to save it from it's misery. Nothing was confirmed about the pregnant lady that ran away or Martin himself we just have to assume he died from that centipede inserted in his rear end.",

When dear old Tom shocked the world with First Sequence, I was a genuine fan. How through implication, tight direction and a truly disturbed minimalistic approach crafted a true horror classic. Then he made this... Having about the same amount of spoken words by Arnie in the original Terminator, the ENTIRE SCRIPT is based on action. And what little action there is. No. To be fair action including child abuse, matricide, eating excrement, vomiting and making baby noises are all in there. But action in terms of narrative, No, in terms of structure, No, how about character arcs... No, tension.. nope.... creative camera work... certainly not.. but surely the brief yet credible script..... alas no.... Lets look at this from a positive side, give it a marketing spin... Lets take a great horror film, now make a sister piece, a piece of work that is frankly talentless, one we could budget and shoot over a weekend, (you know the student kind) and thats what this is frankly... a students rip off of a horror film made with no talent, no vision, no scope, context, emotion or soul... a film that exists only due to cause and effect, a film that by its very existence detracts from the original source, and in that respect diminishes any credibility the director had or indeed and most importantly that The Human Centipede's ideology is lost.If you really want to see blood and feces then this is a pornographers wet dream... actually scratch that, pornography by its own definition has no merit other than to arouse... this in ALL senses fails miserably.I had such high hopes for this as a sequel... I for one feel that if Tom had only left us with that beautiful crane shot floating from the good doctor's house, with that great cliffhanger \"How is she going to survive??\" But now after The Human Centipede 2's credits role I think of only one thing... Not...

(absurd) N.B. Why Tom you didn't just kill that child too is beyond me) Not even..... Did he ever get that centipede out of his butt? No... I'll always think of one word, the same word that I wholeheartedly believe Tom Six used to scramble inspiration for this sequelThat word ladies and gentlemen.....S**T!",

This movie, without a doubt, one of the worst movies i've ever had the displeasure of watching, yeah, we get it, shocking, mentally messed up man ties 10 people together to make a sick project. But where's the character development? Where's the acting? All the characters were given no background, no way to fully understand their lives and no happy ending either. The director has decided to use Black & White to make the film seem \"Artsy\", when it's clearly just a snuff film, there is hardly any spoken word whatsoever which makes it really hard to distract from the filth during each scene and the film has now left me feeling insecure about life, I couldn't actually watch the film all the way through and only recently went back and finished it. Terrible plot, terrible premise, terrible ending, terrible acting, terrible editing. Overall, just awful.",

Throughout the film there are so many unneeded scenes of intense torture and gore, that even a seasoned horror fanatic as myself had to look away at some scenes. As a movie, you want a plot line and suspense and an end result that blows your socks off, as well as a good cast and killer camera work. This film had none. If the movie Saw only showed people cutting there hands off just to answer their phone or people diving into needle pits for a snickers, and didn't have Jigsaw, all would be in vain, and one of the greatest sets of films ever produced would have never existed. This is that movie that should have never existed. It was vile, and overly gross to the point you needed a cooldown after viewing. This is the only movie that I have seen or reviewed that truly deserved one star. If you are reading this and haven't seen it, don't waste your time. Go watch a movie that you can actually talk about with your friends and family, and don't want to vomit after seeing.",

Actually surpassing the first movie in it's level of debauchery, seemingly achieving what this abhorrence was created to do; disgust, sicken and appal its limited audience by forcing them to sit through a tirade of increasingly turgid and offensive imagery. But isn't that why people go to see these movies? Well....yes, yes it is. Isn't it? I have been a horror fan for decades and have sat through some challenging films (Martyrs, Trouble Everyday, Salo, etc) but what those films have this one does not. This leaves The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) by its inevitable conclusion coming across like the dirty protest of a teenager vying for attention. Very few positives can come from the experience I have just had watching this film, other than the knowledge that I will never have to wade through such a catastrophic mess ever again.",

The human centipede (first sequence) had an actual story behind it, we knew why the surgeon was doing it (for scientific reasons) why them people (they came to his house) and he carefully selected them (compatibility wise) but why was martin doing it in the human centipede 2? apart from a perverse reason? he didn't attach them together right, he just stapled them, he didn't have one digestional tract etc, it looked like a low budget rip off version of the first. This movie took to long to get going, i was starting to get bored half way through.This film has had so much hype surrounding it and i found it to be a big letdown. compare one and two, number one wins hands down. There are so many unanswered questions regarding number two for me, which are:*Why did no-one hear the gun shots in the car park? *why was Martin the only security guard? *why didn't the woman with the baby protect her son and just abandon him in the car? *why was the boy still in the car a day or two later? he's old enough to walk. *why didn't the hooker get out of the building instead of just sitting there? *why wasn't the doctor concerned about the story martin's mother told him about his fascination with centipedes? *Why didn't the people die from so much blood loss/bangs on the head? *why didn't they try to escape? they only had tape on them, even more so the pregnant woman, she had no tape on her hands? *why didn't the pregnant woman care about the new born and end up squishing him/her? *why was no-one reported missing? *what happened to the pregnant woman? she escaped, did she tell the police? he was still working at the car park after it happened?The film story was there but it was so under developed. I didn't like the fact it was in black and white. The gore was OK but i was disappointed, the press made it out to be so bad, hence it got rejected at first, but it isn't the worst iv seen, saw, martyrs, final destination etc were all more gory for me.The film was a big let down for me, that is why iv rated this film a 3/10.",

Overall i think this film succeeds in what it sets out to do, it is gross out and shocking involving disturbing scenes of people eating poo and a baby dieing. However if you are into exploitation cinema and you enjoyed th first watch this you'll no doubt enjoy it. The problem for me is that i thought it went a bit too over the top and the style the original had is now lost. For fans of this look forward to number 3 where the director has said \"Number 3 will be like a Disney film compared to 2\", this worries me as SPOILER the last shot of this film is the villain creeply staring at a toddler",

It just seemed unrealistic, if that's even possible? The story behind the characters was good but the characters themselves didn't blow me away par from the Mother.I think the full sequence had a lot of potential, it is what it is and you can't please everyone sadly.",

            "content": "Firstly, I feel somewhat ashamed to say that I actually watched this the whole way through, but I, like many others, felt I needed to see what all the fuss was about.It wasn't about much. The film has no point to it in the way of content. Sure, it's a gross concept (and I have no idea how they got the budget to do it - how would you propose this to potential investors??) but in more of a toe-curl and grimace kind of way rather than a permanently disturbing, vomit-worthy kind of way. Although I have not seen 'A Serbian Film', my partner assures me that 'Human Centipede 2' doesn't even come close to matching it in both storyline and shock value.The film also has multiple plot errors such as the fact that a security guard in Britain would not be allowed to carry arms. Also, Martin would have been found out way before all of this due to the fact that he would have to have been sharing his shifts, meaning someone else would have noticed either the blood stains on the wall or the fact that he was a really sick bastard.The acting throughout the film is pretty terrible, excluding Laurence R. Harvey who played the part of mentally ill sadist Martin particularly well. The victims however weren't great, but then again, you wouldn't expect commendable actors to appear in such a film.The reason I have given the film two stars is because of the cinematography, which is interesting and without which would have left the film unworthy being called anything other than 'hardcore torture pornography'. Also, I am thankful to Tom Six for releasing this in black and white. I feel that it helped to take the edge off the gore which was, as I understand, his aim. Plus, it was one of the best black and white films I've seen due to the use of contrast.Other than that, there really is nothing appealing about this film, and I found the ending particularly disappointing. It just seemed as though Six added it as a last effort to give this dull and twisted film a point or to leave the yawning, slightly ill-feeling audience with something to think about.",

I'm not quite sure if there were twelve people to his centipede cause i only counted like 10 maybe he had like 3 other people he didn't even use for the centipede for some reason. but how he got some of these people I'm really confused about so first off he's calling all these agents so he can get some of the original cast members from the first one. i don't know how he's mentally challenged and don't talk so how he able to call agents is quite dumb cause how is a agent going to understand all the gibberish that comes out of his mouth when he don't know a single word he literally talks like a baby this movie is not 100% medically accurate (well maybe the centipede aspect) but when he's going around cutting off arteries in peoples knee caps is not. they would die within minutes and also cutting off there ass cheeks and then putting tape over it is not going to stop the bleeding. Again I'm going to say this dude is mentally retarded. he's not a surgeon so he don't know what he is cutting I'm not going to spoil the ending for you but i will say the end was rushed and was kind of pointless cause it defeats the whole movie. i would not recommend this to anyone if you like Plot-less and pointless violence then go for it",

I was steeling myself for some real gore and horror and what I got was ridiculous and frankly hilarious.However, the main character Martin was very well cast and played. He encompassed all that is wrong and repulsive. The 'villan' in HC1 is smart, a doctor, clean and strangely charming in contrast Martin is dirty, fat, and creepy. Both brilliant 'villans' in their own rights. Further-more the black and white documented atmosphere was really added to by the fact that Martin never speaks. But i'm afraid that is the only positive feedback I can give.I love horror and gore and terror; the kind of film that makes you tense, repulsed, fascinated, revolted and intrigued all at the same time. I was very hopefully for HC2 after the rating it was given and the fact that it was banned for a short amount of time. The only times I was truly grossed out was when he beats his mothers head in and you can see through it at the dinner table and when the mother crushes her baby's skull with the gas pedal. The rest is laughable and we have already seen it all before... just done better with three people instead.If you're a horror connoisseur then you might want to watch it just to say that you have. Otherwise don't bother.From a seriously unimpressed 19 year old female university student.",

I mean come on, did the director even try to be original? The plot was something teenagers could make up.-ULTRA sound isolation- Wow. Just wow... In the movie Martin eliminates a person in order to obtain keys to a garage. Martin uses the garage as a home for the human centipede (he also creates the centipede in the garage). Well, the thing is, the gigantic door for the garage is about two inches thick (just a guess), and there's a couple of gaps between the door and the wall, thing is the victims screamed and moaned like HELL! HOW THE *beep* did anyone outside of the garage not hear ANYTHING? Jesus Christ COME ON!!!Things I liked about the movie:-Gore scenes- Semi good gore scenes.Conclusion: Do NOT watch this movie unless you want to be grossed out or disgusted. The plot is bad, and the main character is absolutely ridiculous... Anyways, thanks for reading my first review :P Have a nice day C=",
