            "content": "Words cannot describe Nostalghia, or, indeed, any Tarkovsky film. He is an artist who is completely unique - I can't think of any other auteur like him. I can't even think of any film that I've seen which tries to copy his style. It is inimitable. No one else is as patient. Tarkovsky's pans and zooms can take minutes. The penultimate sequence, where a man has to carry a candle for a certain distance without it going out, should be horribly boring. Any other director would have used a lot of cutting to produce suspense. Yet, with Tarkovsky's brilliant direction, without a single cut for nearly an entire reel, it becomes one of the most suspenseful and, yes, one of the very best scenes ever captured on film.In fact, the direction's almost too good. This isn't minimalist like some of his previous films such as Solaris and Stalker. It is more like Andrei Rublev: not a second goes by that is not stuffed to the brim, almost flowing over, with brilliant and poetic images. In a way, although in a good way, this distracts the viewer. I was so bowled over by the images of Nostalghia that I had to watch it twice to understand it (it was nearly as difficult the second time around not to be bowled over!). And I totally appreciate that. I was more than happy to explore this film more deeply on a second journey. Thank you Mr. Tarkovsky for making the films that you did. When you sought to fulfill your audiences' lives with your art, you came closer to succeeding than any artist could have. Of course, you couldn't have made life perfect, nor would you have wanted to. For, as you said, if life were perfect, art would be pointless. May my life always be imperfect.",

            "content": "There are very few people worthy of the accolade of \"Genius\" but the late Russian film-maker Andrei Tarkovsky was definitely one of them.  In his film-making career he is responsible for some of the most beautiful images ever to be put on a cinema screen.\"Nostalghia\" deals with a Russian poet who is in Italy to research the life of a Russian composer, who died there.  Accompanied only by his female, Italian, interpretor, who is attracted to him, the poet feels strong feelings of home-sickness for Russia and he strongly misses his wife and child who stayed behind.This was Tarkovsky's first film made outside the Soviet Union (and his first in a language other than Russian), but it is still very obviously a Tarkovsky film, complete with many haunting images of water and fire.  in fact, instead of the beautiful, sun-drenched Italy we are used to seeing on film, here the country is grey, wet and shrouded in mist.  As usual in Tarkovsky's films there are many changes between colour footage and black-and-white (or sepia).  Here, the poet's memories of Russia are presented in monochrome.As with all Tarkovsky films, \"Nostalghia\" demands a great deal from the viewer.  It is very slow moving and requires a great deal of patience and concentration.  Also, be warned that Tarkovsky did not see cinema as \"entertainment\" but as an art form.  I would advise anyone to make the effort and stick with it, though.  It is a great work of art.",

            "content": "The nostalgia, in the film's title, isn't just the physical longing for something in the past, it's the spiritual longing that so many people strive for. This shouldn't surprise an student of Tarkovsky's work since no director, possibly with the exception of Ingmar Bergman, analyzed spirituality as Tarkovsky did.NOSTALGHIA follows the trekking of a Russian traveling through Italy along with his beautiful interpreter. His purpose for being there does not come to the viewer easily. Most of the scenes in the movie are filled with a lot of silence, and even the action that does take place, is minimal. Eventually, we come to understand that he is there to find some cultural reinforcement for his Russian background. As the film progresses, we seem to take on the role of the main character in the story, as an observer to events. Throughout his travels he becomes a witness to religious processions, theological discussions, and the rituals of a God-fearing lunatic. The lunatic, played masterfully by Erland Josephson, is looked down upon by a lot of local citizens. Apparently, in the past, he locked his family in his house for a long time, anticipating the end of the World. The movie documents his effect on the Russian traveler, and the traveler's longing to recapture his spirituality.A lot has been said of the ten-minute unbroken sequence where the lead protagonist attempts to carry a lighted candle from one end of a pool to the other. Some see it as utterly boring. Personally, I was fascinated. In it, we see how the protagonist finally attempts to do something in order to recapture his spirituality. For the entire length of the movie he has been an observer, now he is an active participant. To be fair, his action does take the form of a ritual, not the building of a church, or water immersion, but then again, so much of spirituality is ritual. Tarkovsky correctly identifies how it's the continuity that helps us get through life, knowing that some things will never change our strong religious convictions. That's when the protagonist finally comes to realize that action must take place. It's no coincidence that this scene takes place after a demonstration given by the Erland Josephson character. It's an amazing scene. In it he gives an intelligent speech about the desolation of art. It also imparts an important question to the viewer about those who truly make a difference in the world: the observers, or the \"insane\", who try to take positive action on the behalf of others.No praise of any Tarkovsky film is complete without talking about the technical angle of his work. In NOSTALGHIA Tarkovsky is proven again to be a master of beauty, carving out beautiful images into the Italian landscape. Even the indoor scenes are beautiful. NOSTALGIA is further evidence of Tarkovsky's desire to elevate film as an art. He paints well...",

            "review_title": "Tarkovsky, drowning in nostalgia.",
            "content": "Nostalgia is essentially a dream play that opens with a hazy, monochromatic vision of tranquil reflection, which, not only establishes the core themes behind the film's title, but also, informs the key emotional sequences that are here revisited by the central character throughout. As a result of this, the film is as much about the feelings of loss and longing as it is about the lead character, the homesick Russian poet Andrei Gortchakov, who is exiled in Italy with his guide and translator Eugenia on a research mission into the life of a long-forgotten, 18th century composer. In the hands of any other filmmaker, this plot would give way to a series of grand adventures and curious revelations, but, as we've seen in other films, like the majestic Mirror and Andrei Rublev, Tarkovsky is a filmmaker unconcerned with the external world of the film, who, instead, turns his attentions inward, to chronicle the internal angst and emotions at the heart of these tortured, complicated souls.As is always the case with Tarkovsky's work, it could be argued that the film has further shades that somehow draw parallels with the filmmaker's own life and works; with the exiled main character here becoming the (cinematic) voice for Tarkovsky's own feelings of loss and nostalgia during the making of this film. Because of this, the cinematic depiction of the small Italian village where the film takes place is one of the gloomiest and most barren creations ever presented, especially in comparison to the kind of lush, summery vistas that we're used to seeing from this particular, geographic region. The locations used are desolate, dilapidated, over-run with moss and ivy, and swept in a constant haze of fine rain and morning fog, which allows the filmmaker to create a number of slow and haunting visual meditations that further the actual plot... but also help to visualise the inner-turmoil felt by Gortchakov at this difficult crossroad in his life. As is always the case with Tarkovsky, the visual design of the film is meticulously created and deeply hypnotic, with the production design creating an emotional labyrinth for the characters, which is then, rigorously explored by the camera.The use of cinematography is always an important factor is Tarkovsky's work, because it is so vital in creating and (then distinguishing between) these varying layers of reality, fantasy, memory and premonition - with the filmmaker employing a variety of techniques, from cross cutting between sepia-tone and defused colour, and the juxtaposition between regular speed and slow motion. The use of those slow, mesmerising zooms (bringing to mind Kubrick's masterpiece Barry Lyndon) and those complicated tracking shots only add to the lingering tension and escalating melancholy that is perfectly established throughout the film's lethargic first act. The film is deliberately slow, like the majority of this filmmaker's work, with the camera moving at it's own pace in order to linger and meditate on certain images and moments. The editing too is deliberate in it's pace, with a number of scenes unfolding with a minimum of two to three cuts per scene (Tarkovsky always allowing the slow movement of the camera to do much of the work normally covered by the editing), which can, on occasion (particularly the first viewing), become quite tiresome. It does, nonetheless, ultimately tie in with the inner feelings and emotions so synonymous with the title and, is integral to the inner pain felt by our central characters.Into the mix of things we also get a dose of the mystical, supplied here by the character of Domenico, another tortured soul who's back-story involves keeping his family hostage for a prolonged number of years under fear that the world would end. Domenico, like Gortchakov (and indeed, Tarkovsky), is another one of those haunted souls, inhabiting an earth they don't really understand, whilst questioning their place in the world and the world within the cosmos. Towards the end of the film, Domenico will rant atop a statue about all manner of deep theoretical issues, before Tarkovsky launches into two of the most astounding sequences he ever created. The first is a brutal and literally jaw-dropping act of emotional and physical catharsis (set to the strains of a distorted Beethoven), whilst the other is a long and slow meditation on fate (and probably the most iconic scene in this film), involving an empty pool, a lighted candle, and a weary, heartbroken Gortchakov.Nostalgia is a deep and thoughtful film, best suited to those viewers who are interested in spending some time with a film that takes a great deal of time to fully reveal it's self. Like the majority of Tarkovsky's films, it is bleak, dreamlike and hypnotic, in the way in which the images just linger on the screen, waiting to be decoded. Some might be frustrated by the slow pace and the reliance on character over narrative, however, if you are an admirer of Tarkovsky's best films, like Andrei Rublev, Mirror and The Sacrifice, then you'll be sure to find something of interest here.",

            "content": "Apparently even Tarkovsky described this film as 'tedious', so you can imagine what it's like to be on the receiving end. But for some reason I don't find it so, although there is the occasional longuer. It's one of the great films of cinema, although certainly rather odd. Once again it has an impossibly glamourous Russian wandering about looking moody, engrossed in the big issues. In fact, the female lead falls for him and is exasperated by his absurd interest in a local derelict. She flashes a tit in erotic frustration which is unusual for Tarkovsky, he seems unwilling to really engage in issues of sexuality, preferring them to be chaste in an almost victorian manner. Certainly there was some accusations of a reactionary attitude to women, for at the start of the film a priest tells the guide that she should sacrifice herself for the sake of raising children. She is made to look rather absurd in the film, but in truth, so do the male characters. Perhaps it was due to cultural traditions in Tarkovsky's background rather than deliberate misogyny.The Italians didn't take to this film as it did not film Italy in a vibrant manner, preferring to evocate the alienation and melancholia of it's Russian lead. Tarkovsky's brilliance as a director is well illustrated in the film where the Russian and the old man talk in a room. The camera seems to turn a full 360 degrees although you don't notice it. The way his characters and objects seem to float in and out of frame is amazing. It's strange, but nature seems to perform for Tarkovsky. Even the animals seem willing to be directed, a dog staring straight into the camera with an almost unearthly and uncanny presence and stillness. The scene where the Russian lies on his hotel bed and his nostalgia conjurs up his dog in a dream like but also tangibly real manner is powerful and haunting.The problem with this film is that the lead character was not really in exile and could go home anytime, unlike Tarkovsky himself, so why was he in so much pain? Is it mere homesickness as opposed to the real longing for one's homeland rightly belonging to the truly disenfranchised? But perhaps that is not the issue, more that when man finds himself and true wisdom, is it too late in the day for him to use what he has learned? The self sacrifice of the old man is a return to an old theme of Tarkovsky's that perhaps only shame can save mankind.There are many eccentric aspects to this film, for instance the Russian wandering around up to his waist in water. Also there is a brief and bizarre shot of an angel stomping around outside a house. As it's Tarkovsky you don't burst out laughing. Perhaps he reaches the parts other directors cannot reach.But there are also some vividly beautiful moments. The doves being released in the church, and the light filtering through a stream of water in a gutted house. Towards the end of his career, Tarkovsky began to question the rigid criteria he used in shooting a film in a way he felt won purity and aschewed the vulgar and trivial, but I think he got it right here. A marvelous film.",

            "review_title": "Architectural Poetry: the Form of Angst",
            "content": "Spoilers herein.Writing IMDB comments is a true pleasure -- there is nothing else like it. We have the freedom to assume that you, dear reader, have already seen plenty of descriptions about the story, the beauty, the meditative nature, the ambiguous metaphors, the sculpting of sound, the nature of created memory versus the myth of place. Because IMDB is such a wonderful resource, you may even already know that Eugenia found her child in `The Vampire Chronicles' -- suggested by Pitt because of her role here.We can assume all that and go off on a single tangent of interest: I am fascinated by novel uses of architecture in film. Not just use of wonderful sets like Zeffirelli's `Hamlet.' Not just buildings as metaphor (`Life as a House') but as a character (`Liebestraum') or as the camera (Welle's `Othello'). Most impressive are when the whole world of vision, the entire conception of the film is architectural, forming the fundamental basis of all the concepts.`Belly of an Architect' is one approach. It's rather explicit and conflates the life, body and environment of a man into one construction. Clever idea, and in the hands of a master. But I think it still clumsy by Greenaway standards. Here we have another solution to the problem. A whole lot less explicit. Less baggage in working to make sense. More freedom in merging dreams with `reality.' But similarly set in a ruined Italy, here rural. Similarly motivated first by space. But where Greenaway's camera has a painterly-like static stance, Tarkovsky's drifts to explore the space but is similarly static in that it runs continuously from that moving perspective. (This is similar to the approach of memory invested in form in `Last Year at Marienbad.')And what drifts! Sometimes it seems like tens of minutes. Sometimes it dwells on marvelously poetic details. Sometimes the actors seem to be slowly animated frescoes on damaged walls, with their faded colors and edges as if they were painted by Rublev. Sometimes the space contains another space, either a landscape or a dream space. Sometimes the space contains, sometimes it releases. Sometimes it contains water, sometimes excluding it sometimes both. Sometimes after you feel you have explored a space thoroughly, he languidly reveals a whole new insight. Sometimes it produces spatial impossibilities. Always the notion of space pre-exists the conceptions we receive. Always, the poet's challenge is defined in terms of the elements of built form.I only know a few others of Tarkovsky's work so far but his breadth already amazes, though they appear superficially similar. I think I would recommend `Rublev' as a first. It makes the work less for a film like this, because you already know how he projects the creative angst of the artist from the character into the folds of your mind. How he invents an architectural eye by long continuous shots anchored to the earth (even when in a balloon), but freely fluid. Always curious, always searching.This is a life-altering work. I recommend it.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 4: Every visually literate person should experience this.",

            "review_title": "Italy vs. Russia",
            "content": "Italy is a very attractive place for filmmakers, because of its art, architecture, the lighting, and also film history. Many filmmakers go to Italy and immerse themselves in the people and the culture, the light and the atmosphere. Tarkovsky goes to Italy and he makes it as dank, dark, and unpopulated as he makes Russia. And, while in Italy, he has a few things to say about Italians--to explain Russia.\"Then you can't understand Italy, because you're not Italian.\" A poet goes to Italy to research into the biography of a Russian composer who stayed there for two years, and his life parallels that of the composer. Just so, Tarkovsky's life parallels that of the main character, who is also called Andrei: left in Italy surrounded by so much \"beauty it's sickening\", he becomes haunted by flashbacks of his family in Russia. Trying unsuccessfully to communicate with his translator (get it?) and striking a metaphysical relationship with a local mystic, Andrei the character struggles with the typical Tarkovskian themes of faith, fire, personal loss, and water, among others.Tarkovsky is up to some well-rehearsed tricks here. Long takes with an impossibly smooth floating camera dedicate the viewer's eyes to the imagery. The weather is under the same amount of control. A character enters a new space (here it's Italy; in Stalker it's the Zone; in Solyaris it's the space station; in Andrei Rublev it's the society outside the church), and only through intense emotional and philosophical struggle can he prepare himself to return to where he's come from. Thresholds stand tantalizingly around, but don't often get passed (Andrei can walk through a door that leads nowhere with no problem, but can only cross a pool with a candle with immense physical struggle). Spaces are separated by black and white and sepia tones. God is always there but never for you.There's some new tricks, too. Tarkovsky plays with light a lot in this one, and frames that seem to sink into pure black suddenly illuminate hidden images and icons. A compelling sonic disturbance is created in flashbacks to Russia that sound like a table-saw grinding away at wood; \"The Music\" the mystic speaks of is warped and fragmented vinyl.Nostalghia, I feel, is not the Tarkovsky movie you want to see first. First see Stalker, or Solyaris, or Mirror. Nostalghia removes the transition from Russia to Italy and so the feeling of transition and change is a lot more dependent on the symbolic and abstract sensibilities, and previous knowledge of Tarkovsky's imagery will help to interpret it. For fans of Tarkovsky, however, Nostalghia is a sweet and personal return into his dense and foggy mind (or house, as Chris Marker calls it), the world that only he was able to fully explore.--PolarisDiB",

            "content": "Like a gallery of someone else's strong memories/obsessions, the luxurious images and painstaking movements attracted me with their clarity and disturbed me with their foreignness through the entire film.  The undeniable beauty of his visual compositions pulled me in like any flawless performance.  I felt no desire to visit his landmarks because they called to mind my own strong memories of similar grandeur.  It did not matter that these were his choices.  All that mattered was the complete realization of each spiritual personal epiphany.  The dialogues, monologues, and mini-plays, on the other hand, disturbed me by adding layers of interpretation that either had to be accepted and incorporated into a less pleasant solipsistic whole, or separately analyzed and digested for their complexities in search of a grander vision.  It was as if a famous artist began talking to you about the single meaning of each work of his as you observed them.  Does he intend to deny you the pleasure of finding your own answers, or is he simply adding a new layer to enliven your own search for meaning?  Accepting the latter explanation, has kept my mind busily turning for several days now.Regardless of whether you accept Tarkovsky as philosophically profound or wise, his work is complex and open to multiple interpretations like a well-written haiku.  Was Domenico deluded and tragicomic and the poet's torturous journey with the candle a sad joke?  Are our memories of the past so intimately woven into our perceptions of ourselves that we cannot avoid irrational acts that imperil our future?  Does strangeness or madness have a singular spiritual value all its own like an architectural ruin or a ravaged landscape?  Do we take ourselves too seriously or have we over-developed our social, political, and scientific infrastructure to the extent that we are blind to the real world and threaten its existence?   Are our poets and mystics spiritual resources or oversensitive fools, and does it matter? Perhaps Tarkovsky would disagree with every one of my questions.  I am certain that others will have different questions and answers.  However, for those that don't dismiss this film as self-indulgent and ponderous, Tarkovsky offers a rich composition that can support and survive several generations of critics and interpreters.A more traditional episodic film with a clearly defined story line and a swift movement between scenes would have less to hide behind that a film like \"Nostalghia,\" but there is no law that says a piece of art cannot be obscure. It comes down to a question of faith in the artist and whether it really matters how creative or insightful he was so long as you personally can find meaning in his work.",

            "content": "There is a strange feeling that comes over me when I watch a Tarkovsky flick, like I'm seeing a puzzle come together to for a full picture, yet it is of something I cannot fully comprehend. I'm sure this has happened to numerous others while they watch a David Lynch film, or even one of the various mind-bogglers released this past year. But Tarkovsky comes to us with a different approach-an approach that I have not seen from any other director. It is an approach that reminds me of reading a poem. You read it once-you don't comprehend it. You read it again-it seems clearer. It may not be until that third reading that it finally clicks. Tarkovsky's images are not there to keep you puzzled, they all have a meaning and a purpose-you just need to find what that meaning is. It may seem like there is much work involved, and sometimes I would rather work for a film than be bowled over by its tepid scripting and mediocre direction. The one thing you would need, above all, would be patience, because it is not the kind of film to watch half-asleep. The story, at times, is hard to grasp, number one because it is in subtitles. It follows a Russian poet who is on a research mission in Italy with an Italian interpreter. There, he is haunted by his past: memories of his wife and children. One of the most amazing things I picked up was the subtle use of symbolism. You have to pick the film apart if you wanted to fully understand it, and that is something that I enjoy doing. Tarkovsky leaves much to the mind. Such as the dialogue which is subtle as well, and attention must be paid or you'll miss small but important details. It merely is there to move the story along softly scraping the surface. Otherwise, the images must be analyzed.The camera shots consist of many slow zooms, slow pans, numerous still shots, and semi-slow motion. Many instances, the camera reveals some amazing imagery that is so perfect, so beautiful that not only the most devout romanticist could appreciate. Actually, the entire film is a series of gorgeous cinematography, I couldn't tell you one shot I didn't like. The final shot of the film is incredible. Constructed both metaphorically and physically, it shows the poet lying sideways on the ground with the top half of his body propped up with an arm. His dog lies next to him with his head on the ground. The camera pulls back steadily slowly. A house is revealed in the background. The shot pulls out further and the house seems smaller than the poet. When the zoom stops is shows everyone surrounded by tall pillars, like the ruins of a temple. Then it begins to snow, just a little; that image holds for an entire minute, before `To the memory of my mother,' appears on the screen. Puzzling, exhausting, yet beautiful and exhilarating. The film, at many points touches religion and life, mostly without answers. Attempting to find those answers is a task well worth the trouble. ****1/2 out of *****",

Aside from Orson Welles, Tarkovsky must be the king of atmosphere.Atmosphere alone does not make a great movie. This movie is unbearably pretentious and slow beyond words. In comparison to Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman is an MTV director.By this stage in his life, Tarkovsky was an acknowledged genius, and apparently nobody on this team ever dared to question his artistic decisions. He simply has no clue of when his point has been made and it's time to move on.Is he a fine poet? Yes, as great as his father in many ways. I also think he has a marvelous photographer's eye for images. But he really had a complete disdain for communication with the audience, and that aloofness makes this film so hard to watch. Of course, the fact that much of the movie exists in dim remembrances and dreams makes it even less accessible. I don't even know if this film had a script. Some of the actor's dialogue, especially Giordano's, seems unrelated to the scenes they are performing. The actors performed admirably.I watched it a second time with my fast-forward, and it was much better. He has a way of holding the camera on a still or barely-panning image for many, many seconds - with no sound either, except for his overused running or dripping water cliche. If you fast-forward all of those to the next scene, the movie flows much better.I consider this movie a disappointment. I always thought Tarkovsky would make a great movie when given Western budgets and technology, but he pretty much just remade his earlier movies on better film stock.He has a beautiful vision.

It will lead you to a hilarious forum \"discussion\" about this very comment! I'll also use this opportunity to say \"thanks\" to Cold Bishop and the other morons for taking my texts so seriously - and making me laugh very loudly!Secondly, let me explain the high 7.9 rating on IMDb. Only around 2,000+ people voted, and they're mostly film students who FORCE themselves to like movies like this, and other pretentious boredom-seekers who find thrills in watching grass grow. \"Nostalghia\" is the IDEAL film to fall asleep to. I speak from experience.I absolutely loved \"Solaris\" and \"Stalker\", two brilliant, intelligent sci-fi dramas. On the other side of the Tarkovsky spectrum, I was utterly confused by \"The Mirror\" - which had zero story to tell (though occasionally visually very nice), I was mostly bored to tears by \"Andrey Rublev\" (nearly 4 hours!), but thought \"The Sacrifice\", his last movie, was okay (in spite of being in Swedish, an unpleasant language).Tarkovsky's two sci-fi films are based on (good) novels, and this may be the crucial point. It seems that he is pretty much lost when doing his own material. He gets bogged down in his dull poetry and philosophy, not bothering to inter-connect various parts of the two in a cohesive manner, failing to focus on the essentials. Hence all his other (non-sci-fi) movies are not much better than all the other pretentious European crap from various Godards, Bunuels, Bergmans, Triers, and other overrated, lazy \"geniuses\".\"Nostalghia\" is an overly pretentious non-story that is far too self-indulgent even for a European director. If you make movies just for your own \"artistic\" pleasure then why even bother releasing them? This two-hour snooze-fest could have been EASILY cut down to half that length - and it would still not be fascinating. Watching the main character walk around endlessly without saying or doing anything is just GARBAGE film-making. Lazy, and made/written by someone who overestimated himself a tad.The positive side to this movie - apart from the fact that it made me fall asleep - are some visually stunning scenes. Especially the long shots of water, which are pleasant, if a little sleep-inducing because they may be TOO pleasant. Tarkovsky seemed to have some kind of an almost-fetish for \"aqua\", because he filmed it in all its visual and audio glory in nearly ever movie he made.My advice to those who consider this a masterpiece is to stop lying to yourselves about your own intelligence, hence to quit being in denial about how you TRULY, honestly, perceive certain movies. Writing about a movie such as this being a \"stroke of genius\" is just one of many ways some people deal with an inferiority complex.Erland Josephson, as uncharismatic as he has been in all his Bergman movies, is a poor choice for the insane man. Besides, what was the point Tarkovsky was trying to make? That he is sane and the rest of us are the insane ones? What a clich\u00e9 idea! So trite. And how about that last scene (a 250-minute scene, it seemed) of the Russian character carrying the candle for the insane man? Was this symbolic of something? Trying to save the world? The world needs saving from very pretentious, boring movies.Erland's character locked up his family for seven years. Hence he is not only insane, but should be put away for life. End of story. What can we possibly learn from Erland? His impassioned, idiotic left-wing \"back-to-the-caves\" speech was just dumb. It's something a 17 year-old manic-depressive idealist would write.Besides some nicely photographed scenes, there was a pleasant scene where the blonde actress bares one of her breasts.Tarkovsky portrays Italy as a gloomy, dark, depressing place. I have no idea why. If Italy looks like this, what should he do with Russia or Finnland??(Sick and tired of Euro-trash \"classics\", i.e. bad, overrated dramas? E-mail me if you want to read my totally altered subtitles of Ingmar Bergman's \"Autumn Sonata\", \"Cries & Whispers\", or \"Passion Of Anne\", but also the non-Bergman \"Der Untergang\".)",

This was the first feature he directed outside the Soviet Union, and its protagonist is (like Tarkovsky himself was) a Russian artist exiled in Italy. But don't expect anything remotely plot-driven; like other Tarkovsky films it's a dense, challenging exploration of faith, madness and memory: beautiful, enigmatic, intellectual, and extremely slow moving. Many of the sequences are a labor to sit through, but the final shot, in which the director transplants a Russian cottage (complete with landscape) inside the massive walls of an ruined Gothic cathedral, is by itself compelling enough to erase the aftertaste of even the most tedious passages.",

You don't engage with it as you would with a regular movie, you just sit back and let the images wash over you, frankly I could have watched with the sound off and the subtitles off.

Giuseppe Lanci's (Kaos '84, Caro Diario '94) beautiful colorful cinematography alternated with b/w footage, is reminiscent of Traffic (Soderbergh, 2000), although the content and the pace of that film is very different.  The point is, that different filming materials can emphasize different perspectives from different people or different periods in the life of the same person.  Luminous or dark.  Even a long and slow shot can tell a complete story in this film, as the actors seem to duplicate themselves or substitute others.  Miniature landscapes to create surprising visual perspectives are discovered at the ride-in and ride-out of the camera.  All those details couldn't be appreciated if the shots were any shorter or the pace any faster.  Nevertheless, there are instances where Tarkovsky doesn't seem to know what he wanted exactly and motives stay implicit unfortunately.  But that's poetry.  See the film again and discover new perspectives.  Anyway, there is a strong taste of longing for association of people in the present, in the future and even in the past throughout the film.Nostalghia is almost entirely (as far the dialogue part of the film goes) in Italian language and the music consists exclusively from legendary composers with some experimental touches here and there.  It is on the verge of being arthouse with its sometimes subtle and sometimes experimental light and sound FX.  Even the dog seems to have had acting classes.  Also I feel that what Godard tried so many times (le Mepris? Week End?) but utterly failed most consistently, Tarkovsky achieves gloriously, although the film shouldn't be much longer.10 points out of 10 :-)",

In Andrei Rublev, you can see his sheer hard work: events unfold before your eyes - the balloon, the clown, the orgy, the raid, the awesome bell - all these scenes are masterpieces. Solaris has the mood and sets done just right, which causes an overwhelming uneasiness in the viewer.Nostalghia has nothing of the sort. I actually didn't mind the last couple of scenes - the immolation and the candle. It was the rest of the movie that was - how shall I put it - duller. Tarkovsky is just being lazy here. Not only has he given up any attempt at hard work, he repeats and re-repeats himself - from his own other movies and then within this movie itself.The scenes of things under water - done in Andrei Rublev. The family life scenes (including ending) - same as Solaris. Rain inside house - cf snow inside church in Rublev. Philosophical conversations about the same old topics - done better in Rublev. Fog - done in Solaris. Unblinking closeup of painting - you get the idea. Even the immolation reminds of the cow being set on fire in Rublev. There is little that's original here - the baths, the candle scene. That's about it.If this is your first Tarkovsky you might like it better.

            "content": "Okay, here's the thing. And before judging me I encourage anyone to look at my profile to see wether my taste is poor or not.Andrei Tarkovsky made seven films, and I took the liberty to watch them all. I liked Solaris. I understood Ivan's Childhood. I was fairly bored by The Mirror and severely bored by Stalker. But they all had something this movie didn't.Nostalghia, his sixth feature film and the only one in Italy, is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Because it lacks the only thing that every other movie has: something. Nostalghia has nothing. It has no characters, it has no setting, it has no plot.It does \"have\" them in a technical sense. You can go on Wikipedia and read a summary, sure. Yet, the problem is Tarkovsky doesn't take notice of any of them. It's alledegly about a writer that tries to study a composer. It isn't about that. Not that it should, but it isn't about anything else, really. Tarkovsky just SHOWS you some images he likes and you're supposed to do all the thinking. I'm fine with some thinking, but after the first 20 minutes of nothing I started to suspect maybe it's not my fault, maybe I'm not dumb, maybe I'm not the problem.Because a film has to be balanced. It has to have some excuse, some distraction, to take you along its emotional or moral ride, it can't just be a speech about morality and a bunch of unrelated images. Nostalghia is that. Is the other end.The characters have no lines. I swear they don't. They have only monologues, only poetry. But it's not good poetry. It's that sketchy, meaningless poetry that you find on a depressed 80-year old's dusty unpublished diary. You could interchange any of the character's lines between them and you wouldn't notice the difference. In fact, you could put the whole movie backwards and it wouldn't matter either.Maybe is the fact that you could have some character interactions that are worth glancing act; maybe is the fact that you could have a sequence with multiple things happening at once to speed up the process. We are mistaking lazy with genius, and with enough steady camera anyone'll believe it. But no, the movie stuffs all of its characters with all the baggage of explaining the meaning of life every time they open their mouth, and then they stare at things for fifteen minutes. That is not what a good movie is made of.The scene with Domenico's speech is terrible, because it's again poetry, that could've been put anywhere else in the movie, or viceversa, and nobody would've noticed. The constant shots of the protagonist's wife, again, they serve no purpose, they just kind of exist, like everything in this film. They only represent a vague sense of sadness that doesn't move anything forward; it doesn't go anywhere. The scene of the candle. By God, how frustratingly unimportant that scene is, it is not an experience, it is torture, because the so-called \"build-up\" to it isn't a build-up, it's just random rambling about it as a concept, there isn't any purpose to it.He is trying too hard to depress you, make you feel like if he accomplishes it and taking credit for it as if that equals making a masterpiece.The word \"pretentious\" is thrown around a lot when it comes to a certain type of cinema. I've seen Fellini and Bergman films and they have their touches of pretention. It doesn't ruin their movies, mostly, as it coincides with their goals, how they manage to tell their stories. But there's an air of pretention to Nostalghia that I've never seen in full display quite like it. And that's the prolem with it. It is only that: every conventional clich\u00e9 about avant-garde movies rolled into one.I don't care where you're from and how much of a mental disorder you might have, nobody talks or walks that slow. Life is not that slow. A good movie has to have both fast and slow moments to achieve a momentum that it can then submit to reflection. Tarkosvky films are generally pure reflection with none of the things that make storytelling interesting. A good script, a fleshed-out character, a mystery to be solved.I've seen it before, and many of his movies do this. But here, it is disrespectful to the viewer, I feel, to a point to which I cannot cut any slack. It is one of the most disrespectful movies I've ever seen. Because under this vail of slow-moving, big-brain lies, it shames the viewer into thinking there is something to it, when there absolutely isn't. It is an impossibly boring movie, with nothing to offer, that stretches out to two hours in length.",

People will be captivated by the photography, the symbolism and direction amongst other things while others will find the slow pacing too much for them, mightn't completely understand what's going on or maybe find it repetitive. As said already, this viewer is one of those people who considers it another Tarkovsky masterpiece. It's not a Tarkovsky film without beautiful visuals and imagery and great directing and Nostalgia absolutely has both. The mix of black and white and colour are truly striking while the photography(the most interesting being the lengthy but hypnotic lighted candle sequence) like all Tarkovsky films is some of the most stunning and arresting seen for any film. Tarkovsky's direction as ever is exemplary even late in his career, despite being his first Non-Soviet film Tarkovsky's unique style is unmistakable. The symbolism is fairly straightforward and still powerful.Nostalgia's music score is hauntingly melancholic and the dialogue is thoughtful and subtle, the desolation of art speech contains some of the most thought-provoking dialogue of any Tarkovsky film. With the story, the slow pacing did not bother me at all. Quite the opposite, because a lot of parts were so dream-like and mystical it was so easy to be captivated by it. The story itself is one of Tarkovsky's most personal(second only to Mirror) and has its fair share of emotional power, if not as much as Andrei Rublev and Solaris. The characters carry the film well and the performances are fine, Oleg Yankovsky is a compelling lead and Erland Josephson is appropriately distinguished and better than he is given credit for here. Overall, not one of Tarkovsky's best but doesn't disappoint at all. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

A lot of it is in this one: the water, the garbage, strange, haunting sounds in the background, the dogs, the empty rooms with metal beds and rotten walls, the rain, the warmth of pure, shy love, the static, photography-like pictures (sometimes even filmed pictures), the poems, the philosophical discussions.The failure of \"Nostalghia\" shows the fragility by which these ingredients are held together in films like \"Solaris\" or \"Stalker\". The thin plot line is torn apart, there is no connection between the plots of exile (what a great plot for Tarkovskij this could have been!) and the plot of saving the world by sacrifying yourself. Domenico the lunatic is just not fascinating. You feel that Andrej cannot understand Eugenia, just as Andrej the director can't. The dialogues are awfully pseudo-intellectual, the fixation on Christian faith just penetrant (compare \"Stalker\" which is all about faith, but without the churches) - even God himself speaks. The story of carrying a burning candle through a pool and thereby saving the world can hardly be told without exposing it to ridiculousness. Andrej's death is hardly prepared, as young and healthy as he looks this just feels like a deus ex machina. In a word, \"Nostalghia\" is boring and self-indulgent. Maybe it is not a good idea to name your protagonist like yourself (although there was no problem in \"Andrej Rubljow\") and letting him read your brother's poems. What could have been great scenes in great films look here like mere self-plagiarisms. And there are scenes where Tarkovskij's genius rises: drinking wodka in the bath arches and talking to a child (one of the few scenes where Andrej comes to life); the final scene with the candle; the scene in Domenico's house. If you have never seen a film by Tarkovskij before, don't watch this - it might keep you from seeing his masterpieces. Three stars for a blundered film in respect of the artist.",

            "content": "Nostalghia, a film Andrei Tarkovsky directed while he was out of Russia and in Italy, is almost as personal, if not more-so, than his film the Mirror. The main character's first name is Andrei; there's mention of a poet named Tarkovsky (possibly Andrei's own father, if I'm not mistaken); the main character, while trying to do something else with his time (write a biography on a musician) is distracted by his personal turmoil over his family, who are back in his homeland, as was Tarkovsky to a degree (he might have been in exile, I'm not sure). And on top of this, we're given a substantial amount of black and white scenes, often either in slow-motion speed or directed by Tarkovsky to seem like such, from dreams and memories that call for a time and place that is specific but also ethereal, strange and probably symbolic.So why then does the film not work if the creator's soul was poured entirely into it? I think, perhaps, there is almost *too* much of a reliance on creating a mood of meditation, for there to be total concentration upon the atmosphere that Tarkovsky has created- as he has in all of his movies- upon which is a sort of world unto itself, seen through its filmmaker in a way no other can see it. This may be expected for one already familiar with the director's methods, but even still there's so many silent moments, so many long takes with the most slight of camera movements, so much contemplation in place of dialog (there's only a few scenes where we see characters communicate in that manner), that it takes a lot out of the viewer to stay with the ideal of spiritual redemption that Tarkovsky is after.Or is it redemption? Is it just simply a quest into oneself? Why does Andrei follow Domenico (brilliantly played in subtle/not-so-subtle form by Erland Josephsson), who cannot be really relied upon as a source of redemption or actual thought provocation? This is a man, after all, who yells out his speeches to bewildered crowds in a town square and then proceeds to go through a very severe act on himself (to Beethoven's 9th no less!) There's a lot of mystery to this character Andrei, and the actor portraying him, Oleg Jankovsky, is so subdued and detached at times that his female translator counterpart (possibly mad as well) can barely get a rise out of him save for the bloody nose. This strange sensation to seek in to a character that Tarkovsky leaves open to much interpretation, plus the procession of shots that seem to last for about as long as imaginable, makes it an uneasy viewing experience.But at the same time that there's this uneasiness, there's also a wonderment that is going on as well. I couldn't pull myself away even if a part of my mind screamed out \"where's the plot?\" There's such a strong sense of direction going on, the moods created in certain places (i.e. the fog over the hot springs at the Spa, the darkness in the bedrooms, the chilling sensibility to the flashbacks/dreams), almost in spite of the lack of a really solid story, as it becomes less about what happens than about what is in this character, the nature of this exile in Italy as it makes Andrei pull into his own existential finale of sorts. That finale, as some may have read, is extraordinary, maybe the whole reason, as with Sacrifice's fire finale, that Tarkovsky made the movie in the first place: the poet carries a candle, as suggested by Domenico, across a sacred pool, and when it goes out he goes back, and does this again, and again, until finally he makes it across. Never a cutaway, always intuitively shot by Tarkovsky's cameraman, and it brings on a whole other quality that crosses paths between what is fiction in the film and reality in front of the camera.While I praise the film, and recommend it, it's not the kind of work that someone who isn't familiar at all with Tarkovsky should see as an introduction. On the contrary, this might be more worthwhile as the final work in his (saddeningly) small body of work, as its pace and modus operandi can be further appreciated. Grade: A-",

The beginning was utterly mystical and strange and attracted me to the film, but halfway through I had a hard time keeping up.Of course, there are scenes that were as stunning as anything Tarkovsky has done before, if not even more stunning. The church scene in the beginning of the movie is one. Then the bath place scene and the scene where the Russian talks with THE MAN in Josephson's interpretation. Yet by the end of it, I felt more sad, disturbed and hopeless than with any other of Tarkovsky's movies or any other movies in general. What is the message, the hidden message, behind this film? Why does THE MAN set fire to himself? And did the Russian really manage to \"save the human kind\"?It all left me more depressed than I've ever been, only \"Arlington Road\" and \"Donnie Darko\" made me feel the same. And in the end, between the strange dream sequences, Josephson's metaphysic theories and Yankovsky's grim performance, I came out feeling like I was cheated for THE THING. That thing that was there in \"Andrei Rublyov\", \"Solaris\" and \"Stalker\".Anyway, this is perhaps the most existentialistic of Tarkovsky's films, which should say something about it's nature and serve as a warning to those who intend to see it. It is a haunting, deeply personal and unreserved journey to redemption and knowing this was the director's last Soviet film, it adds a symbolical value to the film. Still, together with \"Zerkalo\", this is one of the few Tarkovsky's films which is impossible to enjoy as it is too dark and painful.9/10",

A cursory glance at wikipedia tells me that the untranslatabillity of culture is an aspect though was more inclined to say it was about the desperate search for meaning in an ostensibly (and probably) meaningless world. Though that is a much easier interpretation...I don't the mainstream, quite the opposite. But it is often to brilliant to find a movie that really embraces the freedom film can give to an artist. What some people would call an \"art film\" but I don't like to say this because all movies are art. The carefully composed images, the apparently inconsequential conversations, the switch from color to black and white (I'm a real sucker for that when done well; Schindler's List handled poorly in my opinion), and the stangely stylised vision of the world where people just stand around posing as if for a painting.

            "content": "This is probably Andrei Tarkovsky's most autobiographical film, which is saying something because Mirror is about his own childhood. Mirror was really about the environment that led to the creation of Tarkovsky himself, in a way, but Nostalghia seems to be much more about Tarkovsky in the moment. His main character (also named Andrei) is a Russian national in Italy on a project, yearning for home, and the making of this film was when Tarkovsky decided to enter exile away from his motherland, the catalyst being Mosfilm pulling funding for the film right before production while he was in Italy after years and years of dealing with the Soviet bureaucracy. All of Tarkovsky's films were personal to him, but this one just has that extra something there.Considered a minor work in a filmography of seven movies, Nostalghia tells the story of Andrei Gorchakov (Oleg Yankovsky) who is in Italy researching for a book about the Russian composer Pavel Sosnovsky with his attractive and young Italian translator Eugenia (Domiziana Giordano). They head to Bologna where Sosnovsky stayed for a time. They go to a remote church where a procession of women carry a statue of the Virgin in a ritual designed to pray to her for fertility, something Andrei made them go out of their way to see but doesn't even bother to go in to witness.Outside their hotel are some famous baths, mainly a large outdoor pool that a handful of people float in for restoration. Along this pool often walks the local crazy, Domenico (Erland Josephson). He locked his family up in his house for seven years, preparing for the Apocalypse which, of course, never came. His family fled after being rescued, and Domenico has quietly led a small life in Bologna ever since. This personality fascinates Andrei, and he wants to get to know him better despite Domenico having nothing to do with his research.There's an interesting moment before Andrei actually meets Domenico when he asks Eugenia the meaning of the Italian word \"fede\". It means \"faith\", but the way it's asked and answered implies Andrei's mental state rather perfectly. He has no faith behind the physical to the point where he doesn't even know what it is. Of course, he literally does know what it is (Eugenia just offers up the Russian word instead of a definition), but the implication is strong.Andrei meets Domenico at Domenico's home, a remote building that's falling apart with open sections in the roof that allow rain to fall down generously (a repeated image of The Room from Stalker), and Domenico reveals the depth of his faith that the world is in the process of ending. He also reveals that, in order to avert the Apocalypse, he must traverse the baths with a lighted candle, but he is constantly removed from the baths every time he tries. This is crazy talk on a literal level, but that's kind of the point. It doesn't take great faith to believe in something easy to digest. It takes great faith to believe in something outlandish.The center of Tarkovsky's films are always very small, the trials and tribulations of an individual against a larger context (Russian history in Andrei Rublev and Mirror, a thinking planet in Solaris, a room that grants innermost desires in Stalker, the Second World War in Ivan's Childhood). How much can one person affect the larger context? How can one maintain faith in the face of so much allayed against them? From a man who lived his life in the Soviet Union, it's an understandable point of view.The main focus of the film ties into the film's title. Nostalgia is rampant in the film as everyone yearns for a different time. Domenico rails against the modern world, the source of his Apocalyptic concerns. These words mean something to Andrei, who also yearns for his wife and children back home while feeling lost in the modern world at the same time. Even Eugenia thinks back to her time in Moscow and the other men she met there who might have made her happier than Andrei (she's frustrated that he won't sleep with her). How can everyone go back to the happier times of their memories?These ideas, faith in a time of crisis and yearning for a happier time in the past, coalesce in Andrei. Lost in Italy with little belief, he latches onto Domenico slightly. When he returns to Rome to wait for his flight back to Moscow, he discovers that Domenico has gone to Rome as well, standing atop the statue in the Piazza Vittorio Emmanuelle II and delivering long speeches (like Castro, Eugenia describes) about the evils of the modern world. It's obvious, though, that Domenico is being manipulated, and when he self-immolates the man who handed him the gas can mocks his pain.Faith must manifest in some way for the soul to find any kind of hope, it seems. Without faith, all that there remains is the material, and Andrei can't seem to accept that, so he takes the candle Domenico gave him, goes back to Bologna, and walks across the now empty pool. This scene, all shot in one take as Andrei tries three times before successfully making it across, is the kind of thing that Tarkovsky understood. Hitchcock proved that editing is key to tension in film, but Tarkovsky found a way to pull it off without editing. The single shot is the kind of moment where the audience ends up holding its breath as we see wind knock the tiny flame back and forth as Andrei tries to shield it with his hand, arm, and even his coat.Tarkovsky's later films really rely on their endings to wrap everything up. Drawing from the Aristotelian ideal of classical unity, in particular its concept of unity of action, everything in the films was designed to come down to a single idea. Every action, character, and location was meant to further the idea at the core, and endings can end up very important to that concept as they wrap up the action and provide the resolution to everything that had come before it. So it's interesting to watch the film with this in mind, certain that it will all come together, and it does. Andrei's walk across the pool is open to some level of interpretation (Andrei succumbing to madness, finding faith, or perhaps just simply desperate for some meaning in the world), but it gives meaning to the preceding two hours. That effort on his part gives explanation to his early meanderings, solace and completion of Domenico's own madness and faith, while also helping him come to terms with the absence of his own family.Tarkovsky movies aren't exactly what one would call fun, but they are engrossing if you let them. Nostalghia reminds me a bit of Terrence Malick's To the Wonder, a seemingly smaller film coming after something so much larger (Stalker for Tarkovsky and The Tree of Life for Malick), a supposed letdown of sorts from the previous work. However, I think both are really underappreciated considering their actual artistic merits. Nostlaghia represents a further refinement of Tarkovsky's style after the chaos of the previous production, completely freed from the constraints of the Soviet bureaucracy, and still yearning for meaning.",

            "content": "Everybody who has seen some Tarkovsky movies knows that a thrilling plot is not to be expected. However with \"Nostalgia\" Tarkovsky seems to outperform himself in this respect. Maybe this is the reason that \"Nostalgia\" is the least viewed and least reviewed film of the Tarkovsky oeuvre. I saw some clips with an interpretation of the movie that had a longer running time than the film itself!The only thing that is petty clear is that \"Nostalgia\" is a film about homesickness. The film presents this in three layers. The main character Andrei (played by Oleg Yankovsky) is a Russian writer who does research in Italy about the 18th century Russian composer Pavel Sosnovksy (framed after the real composer Maksim Berezovsky) who was studying opera in Italy. Sosnovsky was homesick, as is Andrei a couple of century's later. The third layer is Tarkovsky himself. \"Nostalgia\" was his first film shot outside Russia, and he would not return to his home country. In this respect \"Nostalgia\" has a strong autobiographical element.The film has two other main characters, the translater Eugenia (Domiziana Giordana) and the eccentric Domenico (Erland Josephson). The clips I refered to above had al sorts of profound thoughts about their meaning, but for me it was not obvious at all. At one point in the dreams of Andrei Eugenia met with his Russian wife. This reminded me very much of \"Persona\" (1966, Ingmar Bergman). Domenico is the fool of the village, but is he real a fool? His character has some resemblance with the character of Johannes Borgen in \"Ordet\" (1955, Carl Theodor Dreyer). In general the function of the character of Johannes was more clear to me than that of Domenico. Nevertheless there is one wonderful scene with Domenico. Domenico has kept his family inside his house for seven years because he is expecting the end of the World. After they are freed by local police his young son runs away and Domenico runs after him. In the beginning of the scene it is obvious that Domenico is trying to catch the boy. After a while this hunt gradually evolves in accompanying the boy in his voyage of discovery. A very beautiful scene indeed.The way to appreciate \"Nostalgia\" may be to give up explaining and to start enjoying the beauty of the images. Images often with a lot of fog and certainly not the images you would find in a tourist travel guide of Tuscany, but beautiful all the same. Perhaps the most well known image is the one at the end of the film in which a wooden house Russian style turns out te be enclosed by the ruins of an Italian cathedral. An image also summing up the main theme of the film.",

It's the type of film that makes you question the notions of reality and fantasy, civilisation and chaos, and it has an effective dream-like atmosphere.

            "content": "Poetic and philosophical, but ponderous.The theme of the transplanted Russian longing to return home was obviously deeply personal to Tarkovsky, and there is a great heaviness to this film, shot in drab surroundings and craggy ruins. It's also the work of a man at a certain age in life when parents and friends are beginning to pass away, looking at life nostalgically but also with somber perspective. Throughout the film there are many doors and gateways, seeming to symbolize transitions in life, and there are also several mirrors, with the main characters sometimes surprised at the image they see reflected. Many of these shots are beautifully composed, which is not a surprise given the filmmaker's immense talent.Spoilers from here on.In the moments that stirred me most in the film, it seemed to ask, what can we do with this fragile life of ours, and symbolized it with fire. The man deemed insane has great insight when he says humanity must come together (\"We must listen to the voices that seem useless\"), chastises those who are well off (\"It is the healthy who have brought the world to the verge of ruin\"), and advocates for a simpler life (\"Just look at nature and you'll see that life is simple. We must go back to where we were, to the point where you took the wrong turn\"). He says all that, but then out of despair or perhaps as a way of trying to wake people up from their disinterest, incinerates himself.Meanwhile, the poet tries to keep his capering candlelight alive while crossing the water in the ruins of the old baths. You can see both great perseverance and ultimately great futility in this small task, attempted again and again, and there is something both triumphant and sad about it (something I also felt in the film's final image). Earlier on the poetry of Tarkovsky's father is quoted and we hear:\"I am a candle. I burned at the feast. Gather my wax when morning arrives so that this page will remind you how to be proud and how to weep, how to give away the last third of happiness, and how to die with ease - and beneath a temporary roof to burn posthumously, like a word.\"There is some really profound stuff here, and it's a film that oozes melancholy at a time that struck an emotional chord with me. It's interesting though - as in other Tarkovsky films, Pushkin is mentioned, and I only wish the director had some of that poet's talent for concision. Several scenes go on interminably, and while they're meant to increase the emotional weight, for me it had the opposite effect. I'm not sure about the translator character either; maybe she was meant to provide momentary lightness to offset all of the other heaviness, but I thought she could have been more effectively incorporated. It's a film that I'm glad I watched, but it's not one I would reach for again.",

The plot is about a Russian poet looking for traces of a Russian composer who lived in Italy some centuries before. We learn nothing specific about the poet and the composer except that they both suffer from homesickness. And of course the director projects his own longing for Russia on his protagonist and the object of his study. The only thing that saves the film is the talent of Tarkovsky to shoot beautiful scenes. There is a camera movement from an arcade to a healing pool that is absolutely breathtaking. The scene where the poet is in the house of the madman and the rain is pouring through the roof is gorgeously filmed. And I never will forget the scene where the madman is standing on the statue of a Roman emperor and his horse (sorry, I'm too lazy to look up the name of the emperor) and shouting his thoughts to an apathetic crowd. Those scenes are worth it to watch over and over again but you have to suffer all the other endless scenes with static camera where absolutely nothing happens or nothing interesting is said.One of the strangest incidents taking place is the suicide of the madman. I missed the clue why this should be in the script completely. Except for that Tarkovsky would show us how people are manipulated and used for other people's agenda. But it has nothing to do with the main theme which is the longing for your home ground. The final scenes where the poet is fulfilling a promise to the madman and finally collapse because of a failing heart are beautiful. A lot had been said about the final scenes were the poet is shown in front of his house in Russia which is placed in the ruin of an Italian cathedral. His love for both worlds are united here as he reached his heaven.Tarkovsky showed us a lot of things in this film what made him a unique director. For its screenplay (also by Tarkovsky) this movie is much less successful. I was left with the feeling that a chance of a masterpiece was missed here.",

            "content": "Andrei Tarkovsky's Nostalghia (1983) is as great an example of Fine Art as I have ever seen in any medium, cinema or otherwise.The film as a whole can be considered to be a montage of scenes and images that are only very loosely, and at times not at all, connected to each other in a \"straight\", literal sense. True enough, there is an overarching general temporal sequence in the scenes of the film, but this temporal sequence does little to aid the viewer in a strictly rational answer to the seemingly simple query: \"What Is This Film All About?\" As a work of Fine Art, I would liken Nostalghia to the work of Impressionist painters such as Monet, Renoir, Degas, and Cezanne. The artistic motivation of these painters was not in any way to portray reality in photographic accuracy, as did painters of bygone eras. Indeed, the invention of the camera made such an artistic motivation superfluous for painters. What the Impressionist painters tried to do, with varying degrees of success, was to portray reality with less than photographic, literal accuracy in favor of a portrayal that has more of a non-rational \"impact\" on the viewer, on the intellectual and/or emotional and/or visceral levels of experience. As such, the Truth of Impressionist paintings as it is conveyed to the viewer is not an \"absolute truth\" but, instead, a contextual, even an interpretive truth.So too, the portrayal of reality, and the subsequent Truth of that portrayal in the viewer's experience of Tarkovsky's Nostalghia is on a non-rational, purely subjective, contextual, interpretive, and perhaps even intuitive level. This film offers a non-obvious mixture of sometimes disjointed dramatic scenes, sometimes deep philosophical dialogue, isolated imagery, sometimes admittedly strange symbolism, innovative cinematography, & sometimes radical editing in an attempt to deliver an \"impact\", an \"Impression\" on the viewer on the intellectual, emotional, and visceral planes of his viewing experience.The exact \"meaning\" or \"truth\" of that impact is decidedly intended by Tarkovsky to be unique to the individual viewer of the film, and is incumbent on the individual viewer to decide for himself.",

The approach to this film is striking, as it basically lacks a narrative, apart from the fact that the protagonist, Andrei Gorchakov, is experiencing moments of nostalgia, in which his past intertwines with his present.It is very much a visual ride - full of beautiful images. Cinematographer Giuseppe Lanci does an incredible job here - with stunning use of different film stocks. Just like Vadim Yusov and Georgi Rerberg did before him as DPs, the imagery is fantastic - of course guided by Tarkovsky's genius vision.The editing is more dynamic in this than his other works, switching both between fast and slow takes. Some shots are less than a second - and several others upwards of five, even ten minutes. The contrasting nature of the editing really made an impression on the storytelling, when protagonist Andrei experienced his own nostalgia in his life.Tarkovsky did not perceive filmmaking as a means of entertainment, but as an artform.

            "content": "\"Nostalghia\" is a Soviet/Italian co-production from 1983, so this one is over 35 years old now and despite this age one of the final works by writer and director Andrei Tarkovsky. You can see by the onclusion of another, an Italian, writer here that this film is not as Russian/Soviet as most of his other works, even if Russian is the dominant language. But there are also large parts in Italian and if you know Tarkovsky's poetic narration style at times, the wonderful Italian language can only work in his and the film's favor. I won't/can't say too much about the cast here. The lead actor is Oleg Yankovskiy and I don't know him. As for his female counterpart I am a bit surprised she really wasn't a prolific actress and Josephson from Sweden is an actor you also would not expect in a film like this, but it kinda fits as he worked with Bergman and Bergman and Tarkovsky do have parallels. But back to this film now. At slightly over two hours it is far from Tarkovsky's longest works. But there are other parallels, like that once again he mixes color scene with black-and-white. I was missing the dwarf here though. Or another parallel that you will hardly find any funny moments. My crows badly needed them as I saw from how they burst into laughter when this father goes up with his child to listen some music after the argument between the two lead characters.Still, Russian/Italian is a rare combination in moves really. I mean with the mob from both countries, you could probably make fantastic crime movies, but obviously this is not the genre to expect here with Tarkovsky. Instead we have an artist from Russia coming to Italy to explore the past of his subject. And with him he brings the woman he desires. Or does he? Does she? It is never completely clear what the relationship between the two is like in detail. But they both have their moments with how the characters are written and with that I am also referring to the female's job in translation. Actually it was a bit funny, more subtly funny, how Tarkovsky somewhat made fun of himself with how art is impossible to be translated without the artistic component getting lost and the writer he mentions there is even called Tarkovsky too. Aside from that, fire is a big recurring aspect in this film culminating in a character being burnt alive. The rain before the clothing credits felt almost a bit soothing I must say. The character up there screaming all these phrases in Italian was among the more memorable. So was the priest early on too with his old very traditional perception of the woman's role in relationships.Freude sch\u00f6ner G\u00f6tterfunken I am always fond of certainly, but here it was obviously with how it ended used in a very destructive and sarcastic manner. It worked. I liked it. I liked this film overall thanks to individual scenes more than other stuff from Tarkovsky I have seen, probably also because it was shorter and less shallow and less pretentious. Still, story is key as always and even with good lead performances, I was just not won over in a way that U genuinely cared what would happen next. To them or in total. So this one is another thumbs-down for me. Tarkovsky is just not my thing, so it is difficult to understand the awards recognition, for this one here and in general. Watch something else instead.",

And the glacial pace at which it all unfolds only makes the journey all the more frustrating.Overall, Nostalghia turned out to be an excruciatingly slow & downright tedious experience for me, and sitting through it was no less than a chore. The film isn't going to appease every palate nor is it meant to do that, but for those who find themselves intrigued by its premise and are invested in the proceedings and can patiently connect with it, Tarkovsky's penultimate feature might just deliver the desired goods.",

The other one (The Sacrifice) is also great, but I would prefer this over The Sacrifice, which is a picture that sacrifices a bit too much of Tarkovsky trademarks such as being a picture driven by images, instead dialogue takes center stage. Here, by contrast, we have a picture that is driven mostly by images, hence, being a highly original and powerful exercise of film-making.The film also has a deeper plot than The Mirror, though it is still not a plot driven film like Solaris. It shows the influence of The Mirror on Tarkovsky films: before he made The Mirror, his films were still slightly more conventional but after they became much more avant garde and audacious.This film is essential for film buffs and I might say it is perhaps one of the top 100 greatest films ever made.",

This isn't something you can watch with half your mind on what you're going to buy at the grocery store. What I love the most about this movie, is that you can see the characters thinking. What I find lacking in most movies, is the constant action, constant talking. In Nostalghia, you find yourself immersed in the character's thoughts. Tarkovsky uses a great deal of visual metaphores as well; you have to pay close attention to what you're watching. It could turn out to be something completely different from what you thought it was to be.All in all; this isn't something to be watched \"lightheartedly\". I recommend it to everyone.

Nostalghia has a similar anti-modernism like sacrifice, various themes, and despite it's just two hours long, it's one of the slowest Tarkovskij films.

It's imperative to understand that Tarkovsky is more about mood and imagery than strong driving narrative, although it's untrue that this film lacks narrative (unlike Mirror which is simply a collection of scenes). The story is there in Nostalgia: the characters are all real and fight for their needs and wants - there is conflict. But Tarkovsky is more interested in the feeling of the story rather than clearly communicating plot information and keeping you locked into classical narrative structure.VERY few filmmakers can do this well, and countless filmmakers try to imitate Tarkovsky and miserably fail, partly because they don't understand that there is a real story happening here - it's just presented in a way that is highly allegorical. This is definitely not 'lazy' filmmaking, or style covering for a lack of technique (Tarkovsky was a highly literate man who could run circles around most Hollywood scriptwriters, and he had the services of Antonioni's screenwriter for Nostalgia). He is simply one of the very few filmmakers who can make a good film without adhering to classical narrative film structure.As is traditional for Tarkovsky, the actors are all top notch, the cinematography is divine, the sound design is intentional and the music is very judiciously chosen. Nothing is left to chance. And yes, of course there is plenty of water, as with his other films! Would I have enjoyed a more traditional narrative format for a film like this? Yes, which is why I gave this film only seven stars. Tarkovsky could have done a bit more to keep us involved in the story without compromising the mood he was building. But I still gladly accept this film for what it is - it has some absolutely magical, brilliant moments that forever stay in your mind.If you're new to Tarkovsky, it's probably a better idea to start with some of his more accessible films, such as Ivan's Childhood and Solaris.",

The film is painfully slow and self-indulgently rehashes motifs already glimpsed in Tarkovsky's previous works, yet it is packed with memorable images and breathtakingly beautiful locations. Interesting how spaces are used to express the character's alienation and loneliness - we will rarely see two people in the same shot, and even in those rare times, they will always keep an unnatural distance. While I enjoyed the visuals, the script felt like the weak link in the chain, with bloated monologues and pseudo-intellectual conversations, even though t's also true that the wooden Italian dub didn't really help in that sense.",

We spend most of our time in a small town by a spa believed to have healing powers, where they take interest in a lunatic who once kept his family locked inside for seven years. The only reason I made it to the end is because Tarkovsky has previously impressed me with Ivan's Childhood and Andrei Rublev, but where those two anchored his poetic images to interesting characters and story progression, this one leaves it all at sea, with mundane characters and empty interaction. Further, while shooting in colour was effective for differentiating between past and present, it did him no service artistically - the ugly off greens are not befitting of such a visual master.If the film is about anything, its loss and alienation. There are frequent flashbacks to his family left behind in Russia, he shows no interest in the attractive interpreter who openly courts him, and feels no comfort in Italy or God, whose presence he doesn't feel, though we are told is there (in voice over, by God himself, no less). The final shot places Gorchakov motionless in the snow, in front of his Russian home, planted inside a massive abandoned abbey. It is a stunning visual, his heart (Russia) joined together with his body (Italy), possible only in film. Unfortunately however we are given no reason to care for these bleak visual metaphors, and making it to that final shot with your eyes open is a real chore.The slow zoom is reminisce of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, released some 8 years earlier, while the cutting back and forth from present to past is reminisce of Fellini's 8 1/2, both of which are much superior.",

You can see Nostalghia as a movie about loneliness and melancholy, as Tarkovsky autobiography and personal experience, as movie about dreams, as movie against postmodern world, as movie about death and loss. At the end you will conclude that Nostalghia is movie about everything i mentioned, it is at the moments so dark and melancholic but at the end of the tunnel there is a light and hope for your personal home and for the whole humanity. I must mentioned phenomenal Domenico speech near the end of the movie, it is one of the best monologues in the history of cinema and of the best speeches ever, it is deep, moving, touching and it is totally right, fantastic acting by Ingmar Bergman's veteran Erland Josephson. This movie is a must for all who are seeking answers and real art, and not just see cinema as a popcorn fun.

The images alone, with no words, can profusely affect me, and can leave you close to tears of beauty. Isn't this Tarkovsky at his most ethereal, and transcendent? The shots move ever so slowly, like waves, pulling in from the tide, slowly lapping on the shore...this is what it reminds me of. It feels very holy, and delicate; like a forbidden fruit; something that we should not be able to see, but, alas, we have had a chance to gaze upon it. It feels as if every slow step, and movement, is a painful and melancholy step into deep, lost memories. The language here, in this, is a rare moment in life, to witness such profundity; here, maybe one of Tarkovsky's Magnum Opus, we see him elevate to the highest transcending level, of language and alike; of one who understands the world deeply, and passionately. Surely, the opening scene is one of the most beautiful humanity has witnessed. Domiziana Giordano here externalizes beauty, almost like a goddess; ethereal. On the screen, we are witnessing paintings.. There's really no other film like Nostalgia. There are so many scenes here that are extraordinary. Words can't begin to describe the fire scene, juxtaposed with Beethoven; words can't capture the essence of this scene in the way Tarkovsky's images can. The candle scene may sear itself into your subconscious; slowly, but it will be there. Tarkovsky has the gift of bringing the beauty, from ordinary things; to make them beautiful, if not more than normally considered beautiful things; it shows he sees the world in a different way, a special way; someone who is truly alive. It truly is in another dimension. The romance, and relationship in the film is pure, powerful, and melancholic; it is awe-inspiring to watch these conversations; they are truthful, and can leave you gasping, as you have never seen emotions, quite portrayed in such a way. The film also brings into question human advancement; how we have come so far from our simple years, when we were merely in nature itself; humanity has changed, and with this, comes the many problems we have now; anxiety and worry plague many; alienation creeps on our minds; because life is so quick now, and everyone must become something important; the pressure is great; a far cry from our simpler days.",

His camera-eye is marvelously free, even here where mostly it moves so geometrically to put Greena-way to shame, or then just observing, silently and without moving. This isn't like \"Andrei Rublev\" (1966), which deep down I still cherish more than anything, and where the eye moves much like Malick likes to move it nowadays: here there's apparent discipline, kind of theoretical rumination in all the eye does and perceives, but it's of such beauty I dare one to ignore it. One may see this in how he sees small, every day things either up close or far away \u2014 light paints and shadows frame the action, which usually consists of us gazing upon a scene far in the distance. Surely the poet mirrors Tarkovsky and what he does. It's Andrei (Gorchakov, the poet in the film) who carries the candle the distance but it's Andrei (Tarkovsky, the director) who carries it for us to see.The famous forced perspective shot in the end is worth its reputation, but for me the interiors are the most breathtaking shots. This is great to see before \"Offret\" (1986) but especially after \"Zerkalo\" (1975). The former has, over the years, been unable to elicit the kind of reaction Tarkovsky usually does (it's his most difficult film for me for that reason, by no means reduced in mastery) so this kindles its flame.

Cinema was their art form. They were surely not that great at producing the visual arts, better yet at the theorizing. Despite their awful communism, the Russians were so much more advanced in cinema than Americans (who were so dependent on the theatrical story). The stumbling block was the aftermath of WWII. Should that be allowed to essentially destroy all solid cultural expression? Russians should be the leaders. (The Russians trained the Chinese and look how well they did. Why can't Russia do this for their own people?)Americans see Russians as a bunch of murderous thugs. That's what happens when you kill off journalist critics. Take a lesson from America and discredit them like they did to Dan Rather and others. Don't murder the opposition. But, of course, Tarkovsky had to even defect. As far as I know, no one defects now. Is that because there's no one left? Tarkovsky gave Russia and the world something to marvel at. Tarkovsky and the great Russian writers and composers are Russia, not just the economic warriors of late. Nostalghia is not my favorite Tarkovsky film. Still, it may contain the most relevant angst- filled situations common to modern day living. The famous candle scene is unforgettable. For the visually-minded, Tarkovsky films are not slow, just like abstract expressionism is not hard to understand. There's so much to see in his films.

Or are they really sappy, pretentious and over-indulgent fools?Nostalghia has all the Tarkovsky traits: long quiet takes that may go on for minutes, shots of water, the sounds of water dripping, and sometimes painfully slow-zooms and dollies. But this is Tarkovsky showing us yet another visual poem, and when we read a poem we generally don't understand the first time around or the second. It may take the third or fourth time around for everything to click and while we don't normally think in such a literary way when it comes to film as entertainment, we are aware it is a possibility and it isn't for everyone.The beauty of what the camera captures is magnificent, and almost seems fool-proof when Tarkovsky is behind the camera. He could film a dirty puddle filled with literal crap and human fluids and we'd still be inspired and amazed.Feelings unspoken are unforgettable.Nostalghia is so far Tarkovsky's greatest effort concerning faith and broader spirituality as we find the main character so reflective in his past as he is in another country looking for a composer. His remorse and longing for what was is harrowing and comes full circle by the end. While during the entire film he has been an observer (as we are given his perspective from the camera many times throughout) and in a sequence of something on its face does not seem special, he realizes he must take action to rekindle the faith he lost.The closing minutes are as picturesque as anything I have ever seen put to film.",

The plot is, on the surface, as light and breezy as the feathers one sees falling upon lighted candles at the very beginning; yet slowly, gently, the film builds to a moving crescendo, possessing as its notes some of the most poignant, astonishingly and painfully beautiful images ever to be captured on film, that will have you experience an entire spectrum of emotions of which you never suspected yourself capable, in the course of one cinematic sitting - if ever at all.\"Nostalghia\" is pure magic, a work of true genius.

It softens your heart and sharpens your brain leaving you with a deep sensation of having spent your time well and thinking about it is time well-spent as well. As for the artistic part, the way he chooses to depict his opinion, to pose his questions, to demonstrate his doubt and his emotions of hope or loss(especially his nostalgic feelings of his motherland Russia combined with his love for Italy his exile land) is far more than moving: it's flawless.",

When I came to myself, I was looking at the menu with my mind full of Beethoven, candles, and images of water. Later I realized that I had been taken to another plane of existence, experiencing an epic journey through meditation, spirituality, and total beauty.I bought a box of emergency candles and a lighter the next day.This is exactly what would happen if you can fully appreciate Tarkovsky's masterful films. \"Nostalghia,\" however, has some elements from Hollywood movies. The most significant part, as anyone can notice, is near the end when the pool-cleaner runs across the dried pool, revealing a whole crowd of spectators. In addition, the whole plot resembles many other conventional films as well: The melancholy protagonist meets a crazy old fool and accepts him. The lunatic offers some kind of weird, spiritual redemption but the protagonist doesn't realize the significance. Naturally, some natural forces guide the tortured protagonist back to his ignored mission, ususally at the end. Such plot devices seem ubiquitous but with Tarkovsky's aestheticism, the emotional impacts are utterly unsurpassable by literally any existing filmmakers, not to mention the fascinating images like the flooded cathedral and the final showdown. Unlike other conventional films, such touching moments do not seem contrived or pretentious, and their purpose is not begging for audience's tears. The formularized plot is totally unrecognizable due to the unique sensations unforgettable scenes, and perfect acting.I try to do the same thing as Andrei, but I can't even light the candle.Please viddy this film, and you can feel the true charms of pure cinema.

Watching it is like watching one of the clearly essential, important, deeply meaningful and spiritually satisfying ritual observances of some utterly strange and alien tribe. Curiosity curdles into ennui as Tarkovsky goes on his way - a Holy hermit and devotee of a clearly demanding and all-consuming faith. We may think him misguided, even mad. But those of us who cannot follow his obscure observance - such as I admit myself to be - can only respect what we cannot grasp ourselves.I have no way of entering into any communion with such an hermetic work, and so I will not attempt to judge it - and I cannot contemplate the awarding of marks out of ten: For what? For a truth that is so evidently entirely sufficient to itself?My view would not be important, even if I did have the understanding to take the measure of this utterly enigmatic work. It leaves me unenlightened; it's strange majesty leaves me feeling abandoned and bereft, and uncomfortably inadequate. The experience felt like pretentious trickery, and yet I'm left with a sad sense of revelation withheld, and a lurking dissatisfaction and resentment.But how can you quarrel with this Holy foolishness? It seems to offer so much, and now, lacking this indefinable something I feel that something that was mine is lost. The ghost of simple wonder, perhaps? And this uneasy ghost is reminiscent of all our most sacred absences and bereavements, that are quite beyond our desire or Love.Things pass before us like phantoms, and like dreams cannot be interrogated. The only answer is the silence of the Mystery. The annhilation of the personal which Tarkovsky produces in the watching sensibility is deeply horrible and disturbingly irresistible. Such a sense of the numinous is the ultimate vertigo, the enticing fear of the Abyss that draws us to it with great and repellent love, this yearning to be empty - to pass out into a life unknown and also just like the forgotten life that was before us.Such is the irrecoverable condition of our uncertain and precarious existence; such is the hopeless Hope of Nostalgia for all this life of loss to be over, and for the grieving Peace that passeth all understanding again to embrace us and keep us forever.The film is a torment of negative capability, of the unresolvable mystery of things. What can it be conveying but our nostalgia for oblivion?",

This film, as for me, is the easiest to understand by, let's say, Non-Soviet viewer, as the symbols here are clear and easy. The film is a recollection. Tarkovsky misses his motherland (he made the film while in immigration), his family. It is an explanation of his choice to immigrate. And all this through the symbols. One of most powerful symbols that I have encountered in Nostalghia is when the main character, a writer (Oleg Yankovsky), walks through the empty pool of high-sulphur (or something like it) water, with lit candle in his hands. I would hardly ever come up with such perfect idea to symbolize hardships of creative process while he lived in USSR. Yes, Tarkovsky always denied presence of symbols in his films (or so I have heard, don't take my word on it), but this film seems to be packed by them. Good luck in discovering the Masterpiece.",

When he crosses paths with doomsayer Domenico (Erland Josephson), the course of his life is altered.  Deeply philosophical, the story does seem a bit obtuse at times, but the visuals throughout are absolutely stunning as Tarkovsky perfectly frames and executes every shot, many of them lasting several minutes, with razor-sharp clarity and creativity.

A highly introspective piece, the plot revolves around internal longing and external disconnection - characters recognizing echoes of themselves in those around them but unable to rectify more superficial distinctions. Yankovsky's Andrei is a stranger in a foreign land (much like Tarkovsky himself), seeing familiarity in the emotions that surround him in the Italian countryside but finding only longing for their more familiar equivalents that he has lost access to. And yet, life goes on in all of its strange and miraculous beauty and tragedy, independent of what we perceive our role to be or what emotions we feel. \n\nEven among Tarkovsky films, Nostalghia gives off the sensation that it is one of the more languid despite barely passing the two hour mark, largely thanks to its lack of explicit plot, chronological progression, or real conflict. Regardless, it's worth making the effort to make your way through for one of the director's slightly lesser-known but dense and ponderous masterpieces that gives plenty of room for contemplation.

Gorbachev, himself an exile, meets Domenico, a former inmate of a lunatic asylum who locked up his family for 7 years in order to avoid the apocalypse.

Andrey returns to the pool which has now been drained of water.\nThere follows one of the greatest moments in cinema.

He continues to share the most beautiful images ever put on screen, in a lovely slowed pace with long shots of dolly-cams panning and zooming. We get some amazing deep focus action here too. In every image there is so much to see and if you look around you can consume more than a quick glance give. A random still from the film would be a beautiful poster on a wall.\n\nA poetic film, like \"Zerkalo\" in many ways with it's flashes of past. This is not as dream-like, more human and straight forward.\nIt's weird too, with some weirder settings and happenings.\nWe rearly shift places, few scenes.\nThe story is pretty hard to grasp, few answers, lots of guessing. \n\nI dig the 1 + 1 = 1 stuff and the Domenico -character. We also are served the most \"shocking\" act that I have seen in his films here, spicing it up a bit - turning away from it's spiritual and soft themes.\nProbably not my favorite film from this film poet/painter.

I love Tarkovsky. \"Stalker\" and \"Ivan's Childhood\" are among my all-time favorite films. But even for me, this was way too slow, ponderous and oblique especially in the first 2/3rds of it. It felt a bit derivative of his and his screenwriter previous works. The cinematography though is breathtaking and it is a work that comes from a master filmmaker.

The film is very good, and it is engaging from start to finish. Tarkovsky always manages to convey a sense of surrealism to every one of his movies, and here we have a film that shows us an eccentric, yet brilliant plot that stands out due to Tarkovsky's impeccable filmmaking.  I've been a great admirer of his work, and he is able to craft something truly unique with each of his films and here he crafts something very good and is a must if you've enjoyed his work.

Most of the scenes in the movie are filled with a lot of silence, and even the action that does take place, is minimal. Eventually, we come to understand that he is there to find some cultural reinforcement for his Russian background. As the film progresses, we seem to take on the role of the main character in the story, as an observer to events. Throughout his travels he becomes a witness to religious processions, theological discussions, and the rituals of a God-fearing lunatic. The lunatic, played masterfully by Erland Josephson, is looked down upon by a lot of local citizens. Apparently, in the past, he locked his family in his house for a long time, anticipating the end of the World. The movie documents his effect on the Russian traveler, and the traveler's longing to recapture his spirituality.\n\nA lot has been said of the ten-minute unbroken sequence where the lead protagonist attempts to carry a lighted candle from one end of a pool to the other. Some see it as utterly boring. Personally, I was fascinated. In it, we see how the protagonist finally attempts to do something in order to recapture his spirituality. For the entire length of the movie he has been an observer, now he is an active participant. To be fair, his action does take the form of a ritual, not the building of a church, or water immersion, but then again, so much of spirituality is ritual. Tarkovsky correctly identifies how it's the continuity that helps us get through life, knowing that some things will never change our strong religious convictions. That's when the protagonist finally comes to realize that action must take place. It's no coincidence that this scene takes place after a demonstration given by the Erland Josephson character. It's an amazing scene. In it he gives an intelligent speech about the desolation of art. It also imparts an important question to the viewer about those who truly make a difference in the world: the observers, or the \"insane\", who try to take positive action on the behalf of others.",

Because this is filmed in the tiny and openly Italy instead of Tarkovsky's native Russia, which is more bigger, mystical and darker than any other countries in the world. \n\nNostalghia is set in a small town in Italy, where a russian wrier, named Andrei Gorchakov (Oleg Yankovsky) is to do some research about a Russian composer Pavel Sosnovsky who committed suicide when he returned to Russia. And one does not need much imagination to figure out what's going to happened after words. Andrei also befriends a strange inhabitant madman named Domenico (Erland Josephson) whom lives alone after all his family died.\n\nI usually liked all of Tarkovsky's films, but Nostalghia is the only exception. It's to foggy, to slow, and the plot is simply not strong enough. But there's are some  good shots I must say that. I'm also a little bit disappointed about Erland Josephson who doesn't really speak that much as he use to, with his reflecting and intelligent monologues. I also suspect that he's dubbed. My conclusion is that it's a good looking picture, but the frame is to small. Thumbs down.",

Now I watch movies by directors, and being that I am on the library of Tarkovsky, it took me forever to get around watching this.

Well, it's about as boring as the title may lead you to believe it is, because NOTHING happens.  You can blame modern movies for shaping my malleable attention span to what it is today, sure, but I really don't think I'm out of line with my assessment.

There's an eight-minute scene of our main character crossing from one side of a drained pool to the other, trying to keep a candle lit...

The camera pushes in imperceptibly, but continuously from the beginning. On the soundtrack, possibly diegetic, a sole woman sings. Meanwhile, the film credits scroll up, superimposed over the scene. The family and dog, upon reaching the area in front of a hut, stop moving. Verdi's Messa da Requiem fades in, overlapping for a brief moment with the woman singing. Once the foreground tree fully disappears, the scene freezes; the credits continue until the title appears, and the scene fades to black. The Requiem continues an audible transition to the second scene.\nThe Russian writer Andrei Gorchakov (Oleg Yankovsky) travels to Italy to research the life of 18th-century Russian composer Pavel Sosnovsky, who lived there and committed suicide after his return to Russia. He and his comely interpreter travel to a convent in the middle of the Tuscan countryside where they look at frescoes by Piero della Francesca. Back at their hotel Andrei feels displaced and longs to go back to Russia, but unnamed circumstances seem to get in the way. The interpreter is smitten with Andrei and is offended that he will not sleep with her, claiming that she has a better boyfriend waiting for her.\nAndrei meets and befriends a strange madman, who is famous in the village for his insistence in trying to walk across a drained mineral spring pool with a lit candle. He claims that when finally achieving it, he will save the world. They both share a feeling of alienation from their surroundings. The madman says, while playing Beethoven's 9th Symphony, that mathematics are wrong, that 1+1 does not equal 2 but a bigger 1, and illustrates it with two drops of olive oil. Andrei later learns that this man used to live in a lunatic asylum until the post-fascist state closed them and now lives in the street. He also learns that this man had a family and was obsessed in keeping them inside his house to save them from the end of times until they were freed by the police.\n\nDuring an abstract dream-like sequence, Andrei sees himself as the madman and has visions of his wife, the interpreter and the Madonna as being all one and the same. Andrei seems to cut his research short and plans to leave for Russia, until he gets a call from his interpreter who wishes to say goodbye and tell him that she met the madman in Rome by chance and that he wanted Andrei to walk across the pool himself. The interpreter is with her boyfriend, but he seems equally uninterested in her and appears to be involved in dubious business affairs. Andrei goes to the drained pool. His attempt to walk from one side of the pool to the other proves more difficult than he imagines. It remains unclear if the fumes, his poor heart condition or both impede him from achieving his task. Meanwhile, the madman is giving a speech in the city about the need of mankind of being true brothers and sisters and to stop polluting the water. He plays Beethoven's 9th Symphony and sets himself on fire. During this time Andrei has been unsuccessful in crossing over the pond. When he finally achieves it, he dies.\nThe closing sequence is a close up of Andrei sitting with his dog in the countryside of the opening scene. As the camera slowly pulls out, the hut and his family are shown to be inside the ruins of an Italian church.",

Even the buildings blend with water, either the rain coming through Domenico's roof or the river that flows through an abandoned house or the hot springs in the village. St. Catherine's  pool, too also reveals this overarching theme of spiritual unity (She attempted to unify the Eastern and Western branches of the catholic church). And the discussion about translation near the beginning of the film when Gorchakov comments that only once states are broken down can there ever be any understanding between people. Of course these states literally mean countries but also ultimately consciousness. The great unity he seeks arrives in death and the final scene is utopian, nostalgic and essentially melancholic.

He is a philosopher who is always questioning and, in some ways, my kindred spirit whose filmic ventures become a part of me. You can see his own soul emanating through his films, aching to grasp the immaterial. In his deliberate pacing- those long, reflective shots -he tries to capture the essence of time and space, the moments when human begins drift in and out of their own consciousness. His films, especially this one, are always trapped in the wake of a dream. Reality mixes with the surreal and the illusive quest for truth becomes a relative endeavor. The unifying theme throughout his oeuvre is that man is his own truth. Only in our memories, the definiteness of the past, can we find authenticity within the universe of our own design. For some, it means self immolating. For others, it means carrying a torch. \"Nostalghia\" reminds us how life becomes about endurance, to ask ourselves the ultimate question- Who will carry the fire?",

Most of the scenes in the movie are filled with a lot of silence, and even the action that does take place, is minimal. Eventually, we come to understand that he is there to find some cultural reinforcement for his Russian background. As the film progresses, we seem to take on the role of the main character in the story, as an observer to events. Throughout his travels he becomes a witness to religious processions, theological discussions, and the rituals of a God-fearing lunatic. The lunatic, played masterfully by Erland Josephson, is looked down upon by a lot of local citizens. Apparently, in the past, he locked his family in his house for a long time, anticipating the end of the World. The movie documents his effect on the Russian traveler, and the traveler's longing to recapture his spirituality.\n\nA lot has been said of the ten-minute unbroken sequence where the lead protagonist attempts to carry a lighted candle from one end of a pool to the other. Some see it as utterly boring. Personally, I was fascinated. In it, we see how the protagonist finally attempts to do something in order to recapture his spirituality. For the entire length of the movie he has been an observer, now he is an active participant. To be fair, his action does take the form of a ritual, not the building of a church, or water immersion, but then again, so much of spirituality is ritual. Tarkovsky correctly identifies how it's the continuity that helps us get through life, knowing that some things will never change our strong religious convictions. That's when the protagonist finally comes to realize that action must take place. It's no coincidence that this scene takes place after a demonstration given by the Erland Josephson character. It's an amazing scene. In it he gives an intelligent speech about the desolation of art. It also imparts an important question to the viewer about those who truly make a difference in the world: the observers, or the \"insane\", who try to take positive action on the behalf of others.",

This technique, which is peculiar to his ability to sculpt the time, is reminiscent of the limps of the cross as a sacred symbol that permeates the whole film. Moreover, and personally, I was astonished by the way in which he creates a sort of superimposition that is the delayed recognition of the real image, a mixture of places forgotten, but still in the back of the protagonist's    mind, and my beloved Tuscany (Bagno Vignoni Spa, San Galgano Abbey)  and Lazio (Campidoglio)!

It's I who should be afraid of you. You could shoot me. Everyone shoots in Italy. And there are too many\r\nItalian shoes! Dreadful! Why does everyone buy them? These are 10 years old (pointing at his own shoes) It's not important. All right! \r\nYou (Italians) know of great romances, no kisses, nothing at all. Very pure! Hence great. Feelings, unspoken feelings are unforgettable. Here (inside the church) it's like in Russia. I don't know why. You know I don't speak Italian well. Here's a story (starts speaking in Russian): A man saves another who was sinking into a slimy pond thereby risking his own life. Now they are both lying on the edge of the pond out of breath, exhausted. The rescued man says: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Idiot! Why did you do that? I live in there!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He (the rescued) was offended.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\nEugenia, in love with Gorchakov, frustrated that he does not seem to be aware of her advances:\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're a funk! Full of complexes. You're not free. You all seem to want freedom but when you get it you don't know what to do with it or what it is. That's enough! It must be this country, the air one breathes here. Because in Moscow I met some wonderful men.\r\nWhat are you all after? This? (exposes her breast) Not you! You're a kind of saint. You're interested in Madonnas. You're different! One \"intellectual\" tried to keep me locked up! Can't I ever meet the right man? I don't mean you, you're the worst. But I swear I'll find my kind of man! And I have, he's waiting for me in Rome. You dress badly too. And you're boring. You're the kind I'd sleep with rather than explain why I don't feel like it. Don't you see? I found myself in a most embarrassing position! I've had enough! I can't take any more! I'd like to sleep for 10 days and wipe you out. Maybe there's nothing to wipe out because you don't exist. It's my problem. Why do I like idiots? Men with no charm. I might look young but I know all about charm! You know the night I met you I dreamt that a soft worm with lots of legs fell on my head. It stung me. It was poisonous. I kept shaking my head until it fell off. I tried to squash it before it reached the wardrobe but it was no good. I kept just missing it. I just couldn't squash it. Since that night I keep touching my hair. Thank God there's been nothing between us! Just the thought makes me sick!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nGorchakov (in Russian): \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's insane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

Tarkovsky is also one of the best directors at setting a calm tone both with visuals and with the performances he gets out of his actors. Nostalghia is a bit weaker in story than others, but it more than makes up for it with its visuals. I left this movie feeling more relaxed than I went into it, and that's never a bad thing.

In fact, I recently named it my third favorite visual film; it was that good. Tarkovsky has a way of making destructive images look beautiful. Nostalghia features many shots of run down looking buildings and rubble, but he makes those destructive images look very peaceful. Tarkovsky is also one of the best directors at setting a calm tone both with visuals and with the performances he gets out of his actors. Nostalghia is a bit weaker in story than others, but it more than makes up for it with its visuals. I left this movie feeling more relaxed than I went into it, and that's never a bad thing. I don't think this is a good place to begin with Tarkovsky, but for Tark fans, it's a gem.[/color][/size][/font]",

Here you see Tarkovsky finding spiritual center, experiencing fractured identity, and embracing his path - in Sacrifice I found more Tarkovsky the magician, in a kind of nostalgic revolt, whereas here I see him more in the Now, strangely enough given the title . . .",

Tarkovsky deftly directs the depressing drama with an amazing script. Additionally, the cinematography along with the entire visual aspect is flawless. It's like viewing a piece of classic art with several layers and inches of depth. However, the film appears to go nowhere for the viewer. I can understand Tarkovsky loving the film, since the film is, in the end, made for his own viewing. I hate to use the word pretentious to describe a film, but here, it seems to make a lot of sense. By the end of the movie, after extremely tedious, however beautiful they may be, shots, things seem to become annoyingly overdone. The final sequence is beyond tiring as our protagonist continually walks back and forth in front of the screen with a candle. It's obvious that everything is symbollic, but some levity would have done the film some justice. I'd only recommend the film to die-hard Tarkovsky fans to see the master at work, but this is a weak effort as a whole, technical aspects aside.[/left]",

This is as lovely, as engaging, as amazing, as great as the original [i]Sunrise[/i], also directed by Linklater. Hawke and Delpy provide sincere, amusing performances. This feels like a Rohmer movie: after it having finished, I feel like having spent a good time with some old friends.\n[b][font=georgia]Japan Organized Crime Boss[/b][/font]: I can see Kitano being influenced by Fukaaku's directing style. This is a fun yet violent and gritty yakuza action drama concerning the fight of gangs in Yokohama. Bloody, tremendously heavy, but worthwhile and shot with style (the photography is specially cool during the conflicts). \n \nUnfortunately, RT doesn't know Fukasaku did direct this film.",
