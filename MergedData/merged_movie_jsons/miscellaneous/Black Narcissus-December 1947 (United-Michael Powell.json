            "content": "Deborah Kerr is designated to establish a convent in the Himalayas at a remote cliffside dwelling, a palace of dubious origin. She takes her assignment seriously and faces strange customs and unfamiliar peoples as well as a harsh climate. There are inner struggles as well, and Kerr is excellent at revealing these. Huge closeups reveal what her character is supposedly thinking as she peers at others, often in unspoken disapproval of their actions, particularly David Farrar, Jean Simmons (as an Indian girl), and Kathleen Byron--who gives the film's most urgent performance as the distraught nun with worldly pleasures on her mind. Kerr gives a faultless performance, the mainstay of the film, since most of the story is seen from her viewpoint.The striking color photography and set decoration were rightfully awarded Oscars. A haunting, powerful study of the effects of loneliness and isolation on a group of nuns--and what happens when one of them goes beserk. The struggle between the two nuns at the bell tower is one of the most gripping climaxes ever. A richly detailed British film with a windswept atmosphere all its own.",

            "content": "Wind is always blowing throughout the monastery the Servants of God nuns have inherited in a remote part of India. In accepting being in charge of the new place, Sister Clodagh will question her faith as she faces one of the greatest challenges of her life.Michael Powell, working with his usual collaborator, Emeric Pressburger, on the Rumer Godden's novel, created a film that stands the test of time. His achievement is even more incredible as he shot this film in an English studio. The film, brilliantly photographed by Jack Cardiff, one of the best men in the business, and a frequent ally of Mr. Powell, is one of the best pictures of the English cinema. The glorious Technicolor still looks great.\"Black Narcissus\" questions how some Christians, in this case, nuns of a religious order, can be so blind about things that deviate from what it deems is the right way. When the young General wants to be part of the school the nuns are creating, they reject him, yet, he asks about how would a God, made human in the form of Christ, would respond to his petition.Sister Clodagh is also put in a spot when she wants to get rid of the old man who day after day sits staring at the distant mountains. It's Mr. Dean who challenges her in asking how would her God deal with the old man. Sister Clodagh's past is revealed in flashbacks when she was a young woman and in love with a young man who wanted to emigrate to America and she wasn't ready to follow him.Also, Sister Ruth, who is a rebel, decides to abandon the order because she is in love with Mr. Dean. The highlight of the film is the scene in which Ruth begins applying the deep red lipstick, which makes quite a contrast with her beautiful reddish hair to the horror of Sister Clodagh, who clearly is not prepared for the desertion.There is also an undercurrent between Sister Clodagh and Mr. Dean, who one feels loves her. The nun is too loyal to the principles that made her take the vows. She realizes at the end that while she had the best intentions to transform the place, she is only a human being who suffers a defeat because of her surroundings.Deborah Kerr enjoyed one of the best triumphs of her career with the role of Sister Clodagh. She is seen as a young woman of great beauty and the austere nun she became later in her life. David Farrar is Mr. Dean, the Englishman who is now living in that remote part of India and knows the people well. Kathleen Byron makes an excellent contribution as the rebel Sister Ruth. Flora Robson plays the kind Sister Philippa. Jean Simmons appears as a cruel Indian girl, and Sabu has some interesting moments in the film.This is one of Mr. Powell's best movies in his influential film career. He was one of the most innovative film makers of his generation and it shows well in \"Black Narcissus\".",

            "content": "This spellbinding movie from that spellbinding film-making team (Powell and Pressburger) is another entry in the long line of literary and film stories that revolve around British restraint and repression unraveling under the force of mysterious foreign cultures (usually Eastern and frequently Indian), and it's one of the best.A group of nuns travel to the Himalayas to do missionary work among the natives, but instead find themselves coming under the mystical spell of the place and people around them. Deborah Kerr is stunning as the head nun, who's determined to maintain order and British civility at all costs. I still can't decide whether this or \"The Innocents\" (1961) gave her her best role. At the other extreme is Kathleen Byron's Sister Ruth, who renounces her vows, paints her lips bright red, and engages in a fierce battle of wills with Kerr. What follows is a film that is surprisingly sexual, erotic and wild.Powell and Pressburger are experts at using color. Instead of employing their Technicolor to simply make their film look pretty, the color almost becomes a character in itself, creating a feverish, hyper-realistic glow to the film. Legendary cameraman Jack Cardiff is responsible for the sterling and Oscar-winning cinematography. Equally stunning is the art direction, which created very realistic mountains out of papier-mache.A simply sensational film, one that holds up completely and could be watched again and again. This and \"Out of the Past\" vie in my esteem for best film released in 1947.Grade: A+",

            "content": "I can't get into opera - too overwrought and stilted in action for me, never mind the strained singing. But \"Black Narcissus\" connects to me the way I imagine classic opera does to its devotees - but without the vocals to distract me. This movie is high art in conception and delivery, a searing cauldron of hidden emotions, desires, even lust, the latter portrayed unforgettably in Kathleen Bryon's tortured character, riven by an impossible love for the maverick David Ferrar character, himself drawn to the self - sacrificing Deborah Kerr character as Sister Superior Clodagh. All the nuns of the order are repressing something, from maternal instincts in one, love of nature in another, culminating in the contrast from Sister Clodagh's own haunted memories of her thwarted young love to, of course, Bryon's barely controlled passion which ultimately leads to her own death and communal defeat for the sisterhood as the nuns wind their way back down the hill at the film's conclusion. Director Powell prefigures each major section of the film with scenes of changes in the seasons, with the budding of spring leading ultimately to an explosion of passion in Bryon's character which ends in disaster. The casting is unusual - Kerr & Bryon do seem too young and for want of a better term (no offence meant to nuns worldwide) attractive for their parts, while there's an early part for Jean Simmons as an errant native girl who successfully, Salome - like, ensnares the general's young son played by Sabu, in a counterpoint to Bryon's attempted seduction of Ferrar. Memorable scenes come in waves - Powell presenting scenes reminiscent of Oriental and Indian tableaux in lurid colour utilising huge angular, shadowed close ups of his leads betraying their inner feelings. Ultimately it's the justly famous arousal of Sister Ruth which lingers longest in the memory, take your pick from her scene making up her face opposite the chaste Kerr, her eerie looming before Kerr by the bell climaxing of course in their fateful struggle at the bell tower. Unreal and highly stylised it may be, but for me this as engrossing and beautiful as cinema gets.",

            "content": "Black Narcissus is one of those films that, no matter how many recommendations you get or how many plot synopses you read, probably won't make you want to rush out and buy it. After all, the story - nuns struggling to set up a convent in the Himalayas - won't grab many people. But Black Narcissus is far more than just a plot - it's one of the most vibrant, exciting and - how can I put it? - hysterical films ever made. Once again Michael Powell pushes the possibilities of cinema to their extremes to show you a story.First of all, Black Narcissus has to be the most visually beautiful film I have ever seen. The set design and shot composition hark back to both German Expressionist films and the work of Dutch painter Vermeer. Joined together with the breathtaking scenery (in actual fact carefully painted backdrops) and gorgeous Technicolor every single frame is a work of art.Michael Powell had of course made a few great colour pictures before this, but this is probably his most assured use of Technicolor. Part of this is down to the amazing cinematography of Jack Cardiff, but Powell also shows a brilliant mind for colour scheme. Like in Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, he picks fairly neutral, almost monochrome shades, which give the really bold colours a greater impact when they appear. It's no accident that this order of nuns uses white habits - white symbolising purity, like a wedding dress. In Kathleen Byron's first major scene her habit is splattered with blood, and by the end of the film she is wearing all red. The nun's peak-shaped cowls also resemble the snowy mountains that surround them on all sides, although ironically not nearly as permanent or immovable.This is also one of the earliest examples I can think of where one genre is played as another. Black Narcissus is really a drama played as a horror. Those German Expressionist films referenced with the wonky set design and artistic shot composition - Cabinet of Dr Caligari, Nosferatu, Faust etc - were horrors. Most of the film, with its whites and blues, its large cavernous halls and not to mention the wind howling through every set has a feeling of cold eeriness. This builds up to the final half-hour which has a contrastingly hot aura of hot terror, culminating in a sequence that is the equal of the last five minutes of Nosferatu.The use of music was Powell's best up to that point. Like the best silent film scoring, the imagery is often perfectly matched up to the score (by Brian Easdale). This is particularly nicely done in the wordless courtship between Sabu and Jean Simmons. There was a growing musical dimension to Powell and Pressburger's films, which would reach its peak with The Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffmann.Michael Powell's films were generally as daring in terms of their ideas as they were in style, and his collaborator Emeric Pressburger is really half the secret of his success. Black Narcissus has often been noted as being rather risqu\u00e9 and ahead of its time in portraying sexual tension, and in a convent of all places! But it is also quite bold in its statements about the British Empire, and it's perhaps no surprise that this was made one year before India gained its independence. The whole thing could be read as an allegory for the colonies biting back, but it's the smaller details that really struck me. The attitude of the nuns towards the natives is at best patronising and at worst arrogant, but they are constantly being surprised and proved wrong. For example, in one scene Deborah Kerr walks past the holy man's tree talking about him as if he wasn't there, only for David Farrar to point out that the old man once served with the British Army, and apparently speaks perfect English.There isn't a single weak link in this picture, the actors being no exception. Deborah Kerr and Flora Robson are their usual brilliant selves. The great Esmond Knight makes a all too brief appearance. Sabu, one of the most naturalistic young actors of his era, puts in perhaps the best performance of the film, with some of the playfulness of his role in Thief of Bagdad, but with an edge of maturity and an almost dangerous feel in some scenes. There's also an appearance very young Jean Simmons, who in my opinion out-does her better known adult performances. Her character is almost entirely mute, but she communicates plenty in her face and body language. Then there's David Farrar who, like another Powell regular Roger Livesy was never a star but always a great actor. But the performance that really sticks in the mind is Kathleen Byron who looks manages to look positively demonic (with the help of a little lighting and makeup, that is).A decade or so later, Fred Zinnemann would make The Nun's Story, a film with many similarities in plot but stylistically completely different. Whereas The Nun's Story has a detailed realism to it, Black Narcissus is a vibrant, clashing melodrama, with everything turned up to eleven. It's perfectly made, and the only reason I can think of for anyone not liking it is that they might find it too over-the-top - so much for the storyline sounding dull! As the tagline says, this truly is drama at the top of the world.",

            "content": "I have seen Black Narcissus in three different ways. First I saw it in a movie theater when I was 7 or 8 with my mother. I remembered it as being beautiful to look at and rather strange, and I fell in love with the idea of The Roof of The World.I next encountered Black Narcissus as an older adult. I purchased Black Narcissus in VHS format. I devoured the film scene by scene.\nThe film is ravishing, spectral and profound. The idea of someone being given a trust much heavier to bare than their abilities can handle opens the door to all sorts of possibilities. The suggestion that all the nun's had lives before they became nuns and not all of them are suited to \"The Life\" adds depth and tension. The introduction of a bare-chested, handsome man in shorts adds lust and temptation to the mix.One of the best characters in the film is one that no other poster has mentioned. The marvelous character actress who plays the role of Aiyah, the caretaker of \"The General's House of Women.\" A woman who is already slightly mad when the film begins. A woman who lives in the glorious past of the place. She conjures ghosts. She casts shadows. She has a voice as harsh as a parrot's. She is priceless and wonderful in every scene, for she is not just mad, but wise. She is the key to \"The House of Women\".In the Alfred Hitchcock film of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers, the mad housekeeper of Manderly, asks the new Mrs. DeWinter: \"Do you believe that the dead come back to watch the living?\" In Black Narcissus, the viewer gets the feeling that just around the next turn or at the top of the stairs is one of \"The General's Women\", watching these odd women who live without men.A previous poster mentioned the superb sense of \"place\" in the film and I agree. The Palace is a player. It has a personality and a mystery of its own. So is the ever-present wind. Jack Cardiff, the genius who performed miracles with light and painted backdrops to photograph a film set in the Himalayas without ever leaving England, can't be praised highly enough.The cast is splendid. Deborah Kerr's tortured Sister Clodagha registers every emotion, every longing, every doubt and every fear with her eyes and the set of her chin. Dame Flora Robson, better known as Elizabeth I in so many films, portrays Sister Philippa, the nun in spiritual crisis. Her, \"I think it is this place. You can see too far. I think you either have to give in to it, like Mr. Dean, or leave\", neatly sums up the entire film. When she can't bring herself to plant vegetables instead of the flowers she loves, she knows she MUST leave or lose herself and all she has worked for, forever. Judith Furse, the capable and sturdy Sister Brione has no such concerns. Hers is an unquestioning faith. Kathleen Byron as Sister Ruth, (the extra burden the Mother Superior foists on Sister Clodagha as a test of her dedication and skill at managing a small but dynamic group of women),is excellent in her demanding role as the nun who cracks.A beautiful young Jean Simmons is sensuous as Kanchi who seduces Sabu who is very good as the young Prince, who has set himself to learn just about everything and who thinks the nun's shunning men \"Isn't very nice. After all, Christ was a man...\" He is named Black Narcissus by Sister Ruth.David Ferrar as Mr. Dean may have \"given in to the place\" but he is still civilized enough to empathize with Sister Clodagha and resist Sister Ruth's advances. He has predicted that the nuns will last \"until the rains come...\"Black Narcissus is filled with magic images and haunting echos. The \"flowering of the snows\" scene is breathtaking. The chapel scene frightening and tense. The \"Bell\" scene horrifying. The final view of \"The House of Women\", viewed by Sister Clodagha from the valley below is heart-stopping: A mist rises slowly and inch by inch blots out the Palace, until it is only a dream in your mind's eye. Then, a large leaf is seen. One drop falls. Then another, like tears of regret. A black umbrella is opened. Mr. Dean sits on his pony and runs his hand through his thick black hair. He had said the nuns would be gone with the first rain, and he was right.\nBrian Easdale's brilliant score underlines the changing moods and the mounting terror, but never overwhelms the action.My most recent encounter with Black Narcissus is the new Criterion DVD. The commentary and behind-the-scenes photographs and the marvelous documentary, Painting with Light, is as extraordinary as the film. It is a revelation. The sharper image doesn't bother me as much as it does a previous poster, but I do, when I have friends over to watch Black Narcissus, start with the VHS film and then put on the DVD for the special features. That way I get the best of both worlds.If you love great films, great acting or just stunning cinematography, purchase Black Narcissus. It will haunt you forever.",

It's a built set, not the actual Himalayas, and the set decoration and lush design are wonderful and always intriguing. The cinematography itself is seamless, beautiful strokes of a rigid, expressive painting. Each closeup is so grand and overpowering. The lighting is moody but in such an overt manor. Each shot itself is interesting, not only because of the set but because the pure look of the film, especially for 1947, is almost alien. One hardly hears about Powell and Pressburger films, and here on IMDb, they are rated highly but never on the Top 250, yet their ratings and votes are equal to the amounts of many on that list. There is something completely offbeat about their films, and I love it. Seeing The Red Shoes caused me to admire them, but Black Narcissus makes me fascinated with them.

            "content": "The idea of one individual's inner conflicts within an organized religious group is not necessarily a new concept in story telling. Depending on the talents of the artists involved, and usually the stellar performance of one individual, the results can be quite good, and at times extraordinary.Now, take that premise and reverse it. What happens when you have an entire group of individuals, who, for some reason beyond their understanding, begin to question their faith, vows, and purpose in life? You have the film Black Narcissus.A group of Anglican nuns led by Deborah Kerr as Sister Clodah are sent to the Himalaya Mountains to create a school and hospital from an abandoned palace. The palace was once called \"The House of Women\" and is rather ornately decorated with erotic art. In the opening scenes, we are told that an order of Brothers had attempted to do the same thing as the Sisters, but failed.Sister Clodah obviously enjoys the fact that she has been chosen, and also enjoys being in charge. Not long after the nun's arrival their \"straight-laced\" behavior begins to loosen, their discipline becomes more lax, and the foundation of their self-image begins to change.Deborah Kerr is wonderful as Sister Clodah. There's more to her character than immediately meets the eye. David Farrar as Mr. Dean, Flora Robson as Sister Philippa, Sabu as The Young General, and Jean Simmons as Kanchi are a superb acting ensemble. However it is Kathleen Byron as the emotionally disturbed Sister Ruth that you will remember the most after viewing this film.The extraordinary performances in this film are complimented visually with the flawless cinematography by Jack Cardiff. This is one of the most beautifully composed color films I have ever seen. I did not know that this film was shot entirely in a studio until after I had seen it several times. Some of the matte shots are extremely realistic, and others look more like beautiful paintings. All this serves to reinforce the struggle between illusion and reality, and also passion and chastity.Brian Easdale's musical score is extremely effective, and his use of a wordless chorus is fascinating -- whether they are singing an Irish folk-like song or an Indian chant. In the climactic scene, there is over 10 minutes of film time when not a single word is spoken; just the chorus and orchestra.Black Narcissus brings home the point that we are all sometimes far too ambitious, vulnerable, obstinate, passionate, and alas, human.",

            "content": "A story about a community of nuns ... doesn't sound very exciting. But in fact, `Black Narcissus' is as erotic, spellbinding, and suspenseful as any of today's psychological thrillers.Directing team Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger manage to combine a number of unlikely and potentially sensational elements - eroticism, desire, and isolation - into the story of a company of Anglican nuns who attempt to establish a civilised community in the former bordello of the Rajah, in the untamed hills of the Himalayas.Their leader, Sister Clodagh, communicates with the indigenous leader of the land via a profligate Englishman, Mr Dean. Worn down by the hostile surroundings and the isolation, Sister Clodagh finds her nuns becoming restless and discontent. It is when one of her them, Sister Ruth, becomes infatuated with Mr Deans, that the fragile and repressed community begins to implode.Pressburger and Powell deliberately used studio exteriors and special effects rather than shooting on location in order to ensure that the characters and their story remained the focus of the film, and not its exotic setting. This lends to the movie a heightened, mesmeric atmosphere which contributes highly to its artistic success, and earned two Academy Awards.The famous wordless sequence towards the end of the film displays a particularly interesting approach. The music to this sequence was written and recorded first. Played back during the recording of the sequence, it dictated the movements and motivations of the actors.Still completely convincing today, `Black Narcissus' is one of Britain's most important and innovative films.",

            "content": "A small group of nuns, working nuns, not contemplatives, journey to the Himalayas to establish a school and dispensary in a high and remote deserted palace. It was a palace built for a ruler's women, and every wall painting, every decoration, contrasts the sensuality of this society with the chaste and energetic vocation of the nuns. Only Dean (David Farrar), the ruling General's Agent, links the steamy life of the valley with the wind-blown austerity of the nunnery above.It is the destructive power of emotions reppressed and released that is most obvious in 'Black Narcissus', but more fundamental to this beautiful film is a stronger, yet quieter, ancient and more subtle power, that of place. The Himalayan setting is established surprisingly convincingly for the period, in a series of vivid shots that disclose the fact of that landscape's power from the beginning. And the particular quality, the particular power of that place is continuously present in the wind that blows constantly, stirring every fabric, every soft thing. Only as that power of place begins to work its insidious magic on the nuns does it begin to reveal its nature. Everyone there is affected, their practical efforts diverted by poetry and passion. Somehow flowers are planted, not potatoes. The Young General (Sabu) falls in love with a dancing girl (Jean Simmons). Two of the nuns are drawn to the rough Agent, already sunk into the life of the society around him. Sister Clodagh (Deborah Kerr), the Sister Superior, initially drawn back to memories of her lover in Ireland, remains strong in her faith, yet is softened, becomes more human. Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron), on the other hand, becomes maddened by jealous passion and it is her tragedy, itself peculiarly bound up with the geography of the place, that brings the drama to an end.The testing of a few people brought together in isolation is a familiar theme, but this is an unusual example. 'Black Narcissus' has an unusual symmetry: acceptance of this tainted life, in the person of the agent, is compared with the surrender to her passions of Sister Ruth, whose irrational passion, in turn, contrasts with the gentle loves of the Sister Clodagh; the abandonment of this world by the holy contemplative who lives in the nunnery grounds contrasts with the nun's holy yet practical struggles. So, too, we see the valley richly coloured, but the Mopu Palace nunnery almost monochrome, washed out.The project at Mopu fails, the struggle against the genius of the place is abandoned. But not everything fails: Sister Clodagh has become wiser and less proud. Some struggles are too great, but we learn that there can be victories in small things: the Young General wins Kanchi, his dancing girl.This is a fine film, well acted. David Farrar, though at times uneasy in a difficult role, requiring roughness and sympathy in equal measure, generally manages to strike the right balance. Kathleen Byron grows convincingly mad with jealousy and is stupendous in her dramatic final scene. Flora Robson, as Sister Phillipa, tending her gardens, has a small part which she plays to perfection. Deborah Kerr is outstanding: that Sister Clodagh has a fundamental sympathy disguised by pride is apparent from the beginning, and the progressive disclose of the quiet, loving, passion of her character, is finely judged. The art direction and cinematography, too, is excellent: the wind tugging at every fabric, the sputtering candles, the long shots of the landscape, Sister L pausing momentarily to caress a strikingly phallic baluster. It is astonishing that this was all achieved without leaving the suburbs of London. The music is ravishing and, in the later scenes, intense. Finally, in its emphasis on the spirit of place, even set in the Himalayas, 'Black Narcissus' is a very British film.",

Quickly, the strange locale, the constant winds, and the appearances of a strapping handyman sends two of the sisters to distraction. Gripping drama from Powell and Pressburger has moments of sly humor, incredible beauty. Some of the close-ups (as when Sister Superior Deborah Kerr remembers fox-hunting in her youth, or when Sister Ruth discloses her desires of the flesh) are fascinating, almost surreal, and the finale is a wind-whipping frenzy of emotional overload. A few characters--such as Sabu's General and Jean Simmons' young tart--are not expanded upon and simply evaporate, but the film is still a stunner, depicting need and survival with colorful, melodramatic flourish. ***1/2 from ****",

            "content": "Having enjoyed the recent release of Jean Renoir's \"The River\" on the Criterion Collection DVD, I was looking forward to seeing this film adaptation of yet another exotically set Rumer Godden book. As it turns out, this 1947 classic is far more enthralling thanks to the visionary film-making team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, an intriguing plot line focused on the conflict between devotion and desire and a sterling cast headed by 26-year old Deborah Kerr as Sister Clodagh, a precursor to her similarly themed work in \"Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison\" ten years later.The beautifully photographed movie tells an unusual tale of Anglican nuns who establish a convent in an extremely remote region of the Himalayas called Mopu. Chosen in Calcutta by her Mother Superior, Sister Clodagh becomes the Sister Superior, one of the youngest ever chosen, of the convent. Her primary task is a daunting one, to convert a donated sultan's palace into a convent, transforming it from a residence for concubines to a school and a hospital. The terrain, 9,000-foot elevation and climate all prove challenging, and physical problems are compounded by ensuing health issues and the decline in overall morale, the result of the invariable conflict between the sensuality of the environment and the regimented order of the nuns' lives.Each sister reacts differently and manages their inner turmoil in different ways. Matters come to a head with the arrival of three outsiders - a cynical, agnostic Brit, Mr. Dean, who sparks unholy feelings among the sisters; the son of the General who bestowed the gift of the palace, hungry for education from the nuns; and Kanchi, an exotic native girl who is unruly and in need of male attention. The film's title refers to an exotic perfume, worn by the General's son, which clouds the air around their mission and consequently redirects the thoughts of the sisters to the world they were supposed to leave behind. All their lives collide in ways that lead to tragic consequences.The hallmark of this movie is the lush cinematography by Jack Cardiff, who did similar duties on \"The African Queen\". Amazingly, the film makes extensive use of matte paintings and large scale landscape paintings (the artwork is by Peter Ellenshaw) to suggest the mountainous environment of the Himalayas. The cast is mostly quite effective. In one of her first starring roles, Kerr is superb as Sister Clodagh, providing the right shadings to her conflict-ridden character. However, it is Kathleen Byron (who looks eerily like Cate Blanchett) as the deranged Sister Ruth and a 17-year old Jean Simmons as Kanchi, who threaten to steal the picture. The suspenseful climax will remind you a bit of Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\" made 11 years later. This is a fascinating, subtly erotic film about repression and duty, sometimes melodramatic but constantly affecting, and quite worthy of viewing.",

            "review_title": "A classic that remains more watchable than most modern films.",
            "content": "This was a film released in the U.K. just after World War 2 when those of us living there, in a rather battered and sometimes depressing post war environment, had become used to a long series of gritty B/W wartime films, and were more than ready to be blown away by the atmosphere and colour in this film. It has been a treasured memory ever since, and I watch it quite regularly; but I have never commented on it here in case this background might have distorted my artistic appreciation. Now, more than 60 years after its release, I am an octogenarian and believe I can put this concern aside.I find it sad to think that the vast majority of the people I know today were born long after this film was released and, if they have heard of it at all, they think of it as one of the old classics which are virtually never watched today - like for example \"Gone with the Wind\" or even \"Intolerance\" or \"Hypocrites\". Unfortunately many lesser 'classic films' achieved this status because they pioneered some technological innovation which was quickly accepted by the entire movie industry - the films themselves were often little better than garbage, so movie fans who hired copies from rental outlets often developed an aversion to such classics. This has seriously affected public interest in what I would term the true classics - films where the viewing experience itself was sufficiently intense and memorable to warrant their designation as a classic.If I were asked to identify one feature which alone marks a film as a true classic, it would be a visual experience that transports the viewer into the world portrayed in the film so convincingly that he or she becomes oblivious to faults, whether in the costumes, the acting, the sets, the camera work, the editing, the dialogue, or the remainder of the sound track including (if any) the score. With such films the viewer undergoes a memorable experience. Books and stage plays can occasionally provide a similar experience, but the greater realism of the cinema usually makes it much more intense. Throughout the history of movies this has remained characteristic of films that carry the mark of a true classic. Laurence Olivier's Henry V was the first film of this type which I ever saw and Black Narcissus was the second.BN is a film about an Anglican community of nuns serving in a remote area of the Himalayas in Northern India. Both the Mission building and the scenery providing the background to it were shown with a hard edged realism that quickly made one realize the enormous stresses to which the characters soon became subject. Much later, when I read that this was in fact not location filming but a very polished Pinewood Studio production, I found it almost impossible to believe. Even with today's technological advances, including such recent developments as computerised visuals, there are few if any films that can surpass the visual imagery Jack Cardiff achieved here. The photography was superb for its time, and continues to provide a lesson for modern film makers who have so many more resources to play with. But the film did not achieve it greatness from this alone. Acting is always controversial, but critics were almost united in their praise for the acting in this film - I have watched it many times and have still not experienced any sequences which seriously jar my appreciation of it. The last time I played my well used copy was just after Jean Simmon's recent death, which brought this film back to mind again and indirectly has probably led me to pen these comments. Jean was superb in a small part as Kanchi, a local girl who caught the eye of one of the local Indian Princes, played by Sabu in what was probably his finest role. It's star was Deborah Kerr who excelled in an award winning part as Sister Clodagh the leader of the mission, strongly backed up by Kathleen Byron with a superb performance as Sister Ruth whose sanity was gradually undermined by the surroundings - ultimately with disastrous results for the entire community.Films of this quality released so long ago make it is very difficult to view most modern films without a feeling of disappointment, and impossible to even watch much of the rubbish which is promoted as the latest and the best today. For me, we are rapidly approaching a stage where there are a few hundred films readily available on DVD that completely surpass almost everything which is currently produced. I have just read reviews of the half dozen new films that are being released in my area this week, and cannot but question why I should watch any of these new offerings when I have copies of several films which will provide a far better viewing experience sitting on my shelf? This viewpoint is becomes increasingly common among serious film-goers. Before long the industry will be forced to face the choice of whether to abandon any pretense to artistic merit and concentrate solely on productions that have their maximum appeal for an increasingly limited audience, or to stop its mad rush to produce more such rubbish and re-think the role it should play in providing artistic entertainment in a 21st century world. Hopefully there are signs that an increasing number of independent film makers are beginning to do just this.I rate Black Narcissus at a very solid 9 stars and cannot recommend it too strongly. DVD's are still readily available, I doubt if this will be true of Avatar in 60 years time.",

            "content": "Sister Clodagh (Deborah Kerr) is promoted to Sister Superior, and sent to establish an Anglican mission/convent/school in a remote village high in the Himalayas. With her she brings several other nuns (a level-headed Judith Furse, an older nun Flora Robson, and a neophyte Kathleen Byron). The strange atmosphere of this remote region affects all those involved. Ruth (Kathleen Byron) falls hopelessly in love with a British jack-of-all trades and local agent (David Farrar). The surrounding events and Farrar's presence also rekindle Kerr's memories of a failed love affair she once had with a young man (Shaun Noble). When Noble left her life, Jesus Christ entered, and Kerr became a nun. Jean Simmons plays a beautiful beggar girl, who is placed in the care of Kerr by Farrar. Simmons later becomes Prince Dilip Raj's (Sabu's) wife, of sorts. The most stunning scenes occur toward the end of the movie. Ruth's mental disintegration and her pathetic pass at Farrar are very sad. Ruth's change in appearance is visually riveting, as much perhaps as Isabelle Adjani's transformation in The Story of Adele H. The performances by Kerr and Byron are superlative, their facial expressions revealing deep heartfelt emotion and pain. If you think Holly Hunter did a great (non-speaking) acting job in The Piano, see Black Narcissus for a real revelation!This Powell-Pressburger film is one of the most beautifully photographed color movies ever made. Black Narcissus won two Academy awards, for art direction and cinematography. It would take over 3 decades for a comparable film (Days of Heaven) to come along. If you are fortunate enough to have viewed the laserdisc version of the movie, you will be able to listen to Powell and Scorsese do a running commentary of the movie. Toward the end, you will learn how the final scene was shot to a film score, and not the other way around.",

            "content": "Black Narcissus takes place in the Himalayas, known in popular culture as the roof of the world because the world's highest peaks are found in that border region of India, Bhutan, Nepal, and Tibet. It's one forbidding place.Which is why Alfred Junge should have retired the cup in terms of Oscars for set design. There was no location shooting on this film, the cast and crew never got closer than London. The Himalayas were recreated totally with miniatures. The best achievement in set design that I've ever seen. Four nuns of the Anglican church are sent to this remote region from Darjeeling which is the last populated area of any note in the region to set up a church, school, and hospital. Maybe try and make some converts among the populace. Deborah Kerr heads the group as Sister Superior and has an interesting collection of colleagues in her charge.One thing to remember, these are Episcopal and not Catholic nuns. They have the same vows as Catholics, but they have an option of renewing or not renewing if they want to leave the order. Their task turns out to be far more formidable than they imagined. Faith in the rightness of your religion is not always enough. In one case tragedy occurs among the nuns.Deborah Kerr gave her final performance for British cinema before Hollywood beckoned and it's one of her best. Jean Simmons got her first notice here as the voluptuous and nubile Indian teenager. Kathleen Byron should have had a major career after her performance as the psychotic Sister Ruth. The two prominent male characters are Sabu as the young maharajah and David Farrar as Mr. Dean his adviser. By the way note Farrar's function in the running of things. The British never had the kind of troops to have occupied and run a place as big as India without a LOT of collaboration. They controlled very little of India outright. The various local rulers were played off one against the other and by getting heavily involved in investment in the various regions and becoming 'advisers' to the local royalty is how they did it. In fact when India became independent one of the major headaches that Lord Mountbatten faced was what to do with the literally hundreds of nawabs and rajahs around. In fact they still haven't solved the problem of one of the local kingdoms, Kashmir as we well know.Black Narcissus is fine drama showing the limits of faith and zeal in that faith when trying to convert an alien culture. You will marvel at the cinematography especially when you realize that this all is a studio recreation.One thing I don't understand though. Why in the Himalayas was David Farrar wearing those short shorts?",

The look, the tone and the setting all seem to be at odds with the notion of a group of well meaning nuns basing themselves way up in the Himalayan mountains. In a 'palace' previously a royal harem no less. So, the contradictions and a slightly mocking attitude are there from the start and the ladies, almost literally, come up against pragmatic masculinity in the form of Mr. Dean played straight as a die, but with a wink in his eye, by David Faffar. Deborah Kerr is great as Sister Superior, who seems anything but from the very start and she is well supported by those around her. I feel that the 'Widow Twankey' like act by May Hallatt has the production twittering on the brink of pantomime early on but it survives with the introduction of Jean Simmons, almost unrecognisable beneath her 'blacking up; and face jewellery. She slips like some Trojan horse into the proceeding and we begin to realise just how subversive this movie is to become. More like a film by Luis Bunuel than anything else this wondrous technicolour extravaganza, made on a studio lot, contains more amazing visuals than seems possible including one of the most horrific and iconic moments as a freshly lipsticked Kathleen Byron bursts forward to confront Kerr at the bell. Marvellous. And I haven't even the spectacular rain sequence, the quality of the then still experimental technicolour process or the ever present simmering sexuality.",

            "review_title": "Excellent film with a ridiculous story",
            "content": "This film amounts to an astounding array of cinematic techniques and artistry put in the service of a fairly conventional and even quaint story. In order to fully enjoy this film I would have to turn my brain off. The fundamental idea of the story is that there is some qualitative difference which amounts to an excess of \"earthly\" sensualism in this remote mountain location that is responsible for shaking the religious faith of a group of nuns and even driving one (Flora Robson) beyond the brink of sanity. I find this premise naive and so the entire film, despite its sometimes astounding beauty, falls apart for me.Another problem is that Deborah Kerr is such a good actress, she makes the relatively average talents of the rest of the cast almost a painful detriment. Sabu is a corny actor whose attempts to be cute are irritating (it's like he imagines he's still a child star), and his perfunctory romance with the young native girl played by Jean Simmons comes off as an afterthought in the movie. David Farrar has the right rugged screen presence but can't act either to save his life. The big fireworks are reserved for Robson, whose performance is mostly made up of lighting effects and makeup -- and thank the cinematic gods for that because otherwise it's a thoroughly clich\u00e9d and dull performance.But Kerr makes up for some of that... she truly was a genius. The way her eyes flash in the climactic scene when she whirls around, thinking to confront Robson in the small church, that's what I call \"the goods.\" She's one in a million. Too bad even she can't rescue the embarrassing flashback sequences where she has to go through the motions of the typical \"doomed young romance.\" She's anything but convincing as a naive emotional young girl.Her character is deeply repressed, and even though the film shows that the life she's living is a huge lie, it expects us to accept her vocation as some kind of noble sacrifice. Now I was raised Catholic, but I never heard of an Order that requires its adherents to renew their vows on an annual basis. This seems like just a very idiotic literary device included to provide some kind of dramatic impulse to the potential romance between Kerr and Farrar's characters.Even more troubling to me is the film's naive argument that this particular place is so sensual that it represents a threat to the ascetic philosophy of the nuns. Surely these nuns never should have been in a convent in the first place, if they are so upset by a little fresh air and a nice view. And this is compounded by the film's insulting and patronizing depiction of the native people of the region -- Farrar's character describes them as \"children\" and nothing in the film contradicts this idea. However what's truly bizarre and compelling is that the actual artifice of the film itself, all done in a studio, does seem to give this naive premise a very tangible quality as if it were plausible. I don't think you could get the same effect with natural lighting and images. So what really should seem silly, instead seems sublime. Still, the whole idea of the film is based on an illusion. The film did have a chance to push this into a higher gear by acknowledging it and transcending it, but instead squandered the chance on cheap dramatics and a brief action scene between the two contentious nuns.This is a very hard film to talk about. I think it is a film of great beauty, but it has nothing meaningful to say about the real world or about the real problems of people. Perhaps if you can watch a movie and disconnect from all feeling that there is such a thing as a real world outside the movie, then this could be one of the great films of all time. It truly is that much of a technical feat. But for me, it's basically a very well made adaptation of what seems to be a pretty lame novel. I only wish that all this talent could have been poured into something that I could believe in.",

Michael Powell's direction goes beyond impeccable: It is as near-perfect as one will see. But it is the psychological element, the bottled up hysteria of the nuns against the backdrop of forbidding nature, the aloof British male who is as much a Western peacock as the young Indian general who falls for the \"beggarmaid,\" and above all the unraveling nun that provide the foundations for a riveting film with a climax to match and the most perfect ending sequence I can think of.",

The building was a place where concubines resided and is filled with erotic images. A previous order of male priests have failed here.The nuns set about their work with the local community, the Old General pays the locals to attend the school until they get into the habit of attending.

After several subsequent viewings and despite Powell and Pressburger's later elevation to giants of post-war British Cinema,after watching it again last night on \"FilmFour\" it still seems to me a remarkably overwrought,garishly coloured,ludicrously overacted bit of Gothic nonsense.

The cinematography in the Himalayas is breathtaking.It is also a fascinating movie, as Deborah Kerr plays Sister Clodagh, the youngest Mother Superior in the history of the order, and charged with establishing a school and hospital in the Himalayas.British Agent Mr. Dean, played by David Farrar, provides the sexual innuendo in a facility that was designed to be the residence of the General's harem.With Mr. Dean in the middle, there has to be another bookend. It is Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron), who, like Sister Clodaggh, is attracted to Mr. Dean. This attraction turns the film into a horror movie in the last 20 minutes.The main feature of the film is the cinematography. It doesn't present much more than that as the story is rather thin. That's enough, plus the acting of Deborah Kerr to make this worth watching if you can ignore the colonialism in presenting a film on Easterners.",

This is my favorite of all of Powell's films; every frame is a work of art. It is difficult to believe that this movie was not really filmed in the Himalayas. The juxtapositioning of the closed, inner-directed world of the convent with the sweeping panorama of the world's highest mountains is the point of the film: we are simultaneously within the vast universe and within the confines of ourselves. Black Narcissus has another special thing to recommend it - a suitable role for the woefully under-appreciated Sabu. He was the most natural of performers, with a wonderful screen presence. The way he is shot by Jack Cardiff shows just what a handsome and regal presence he had. I have read that the story's author, Rumer Godden, was unhappy with the casting of Sabu for the part of the Young General, and said some very unpleasant things about him. She was wrong. If Sabu were around today, he would be a major international star. Most of the studios he worked for simply didn't know what to do with him - the times just weren't right. We are fortunate to be able to see him in this excellent movie.",

            "content": "I've never seen any of Michael Powell's and Emeric Pressburger's movies before, but if \"Black Narcissus\" is any indication, the others must be more than breathtaking. The movie portrays a convent in the Himalayas, in which the nuns - trained in western, Christian ways - come in contact with Eastern teachings. Specifically, Sister Superior (Deborah Kerr) now has to question how her God would deal with certain issues that face her: an old man in the mountains who refuses to budge, a rebellion by one of the nuns, and Mr. Dean (David Farrar), who may or may not have a crush on her.One of the most awe-inspiring aspects of this movie is that none of it was filmed on location, but most of it looks so real. You'd easily think that you're there in the Himalayan village. As it was, this film was sort of a last look at British domination of South Asia, as it got released right around the time that India gained independence. I would also derive (and this is pure conjecture, so don't quote me) that there is an allusion to colonialism's reverse effects: the Eastern influence on the nuns mirrors how the colonized countries of the third world were starting to affect the colonizers in terms of culture, food and other things (to be certain, South Asians constitute a noticeable percentage of England's population).Anyway, it's definitely one that I recommend. A formidable part of UK cinema history. Also starring Jean Simmons and Sabu.And yes, I imagine that on \"The Flying Nun\", San Tanco Convent probably was like this before Bertrille arrived (although I understand that some people will very likely object to me mentioning \"The Flying Nun\" when reviewing this sort of movie).",

I could tell this was definitely nothing like the exquisite NUN'S STORY--a very engaging and intelligently written film about a nun serving in the Congo. Instead, you have terribly flawed and screwed up nuns that seemed so ill-adjusted that you question whether or not they were capable of helping any person in any locale! To me, it was just poorly written and totally unconvincing. And, apart from Atheists who are looking for a film that makes Anglican nuns look bad, I can't see how any other person would be interested in this film--that is, apart from watching its beautiful visuals.

It looks wonderful, and has an interesting idea, but the careful plotting evident in the rest of Powell and Pressburger is not evident here; when things stretch here, they break.The most disappointing mistake in the film is during two separate shots at crucial points in the film there is a cut where it appears they either recycle the same footage for a few seconds to lengthen a take or they cut into another take to get the time they want for the shot. One is a close up of Sister Ruth and another is of the jungle right after a very important act occurs. Sorry, avoiding spoilers spoils reviews. Whatever, *Spoiler just in case* and I was not as taken as some by Kathleen Byron's performance as Sister Ruth. I felt it lacked subtlety. Every time we see her she's got them keerazy eyes. It just strained credibility too much to have her behave so brazenly when for God's sake she's a nun! Not that they don't have inner lives, but it went beyond permissible boundaries without proper reprimand and it felt like they were avoiding the issue instead of addressing it and finding a way for her to go nutty anyway. Also, they stir the pot so it looks like the natives are going to kill the nuns; then the Ruth plot which is only circumstantially tied to that plot contrivance becomes the main focus; then they completely forget that there was supposed to be danger.I also did not love the attitude towards the natives. I didn't just want some politically correct concessions, but they are all described as children throughout and the script has them all behave like children throughout.I was very surprised that was Jean Simmons. Quite a transformation.David Farrar was serviceable, but the part is underwritten. He should have a sign on his hairy-chest that says \"charming rogue.\" He does little to merit the fuss made over him or to suggest that the character has greater depths.Even the title is referred to only in passing, as a label for Sabu's character, and then forgotten, and it isn't really quite apt as it relates to vanity and not temptation as it would be more appropriate to.Quite a good score, wonderful cinematography (although I believe the other comment about color processes is correct), and there are moments where Powell's sheer intelligence shines through but they are rare.On the whole I don't quite understand why this film has acquired its epic reputation, on the whole it leaves too much out; not to the imagination, just out.",

            "content": "It was the marvellous title and plot about Anglican nuns setting up a convent high up in the Himalayas that fascinated me at first. If I don't find the first half of Black Narcissus terribly successful it's because that view from the top of the world happens inside London soundstages. The effort is admirable but it shows and sometimes, with the beautiful backdrops in the horizon, characters look like they're walking a stage. If nothing else, I appreciate the effort to make this type of film 25 years before someone like Herzog would steal a camera and actually travel to the Amazon to make his own.Where this soars for me, is when that artificiality is mirrored by the movie itself, when in the last half hour it turns into a Gothic horror ballet of color and movement that doesn't seem to be at odds but rather to confirm the theatricality. It's like Mario Bava was summoned from the future to light walls in deep cyans and magentas, to play puppet games with shadows and veils. And there's something that appeals to me about women on the edge of sanity, it's not just the high-strung emotions but also that somehow always an element of perverse eroticism bubbles under the surface. Here it comes natural because the women are nuns who must shun earthly passions, but it's also the landscape that evokes it, that sends the mind reeling.Surely the \"bell scene\" should be as famous as any setpiece of classic cinema, but it's also the small flourishes that captivate me. I love for example how the most shocking moment is that we open the door to find a woman dressed normally, like she may have wandered off from someone's dream and come looking for the one that dreamed her. How bells echo from a distance as Sister Philippa (now plain Philippa) arrives at Mr. Dean's house and don't cease their pounding until the doom foreshadowed earlier in the film. Or how economically we are informed about the Prince and the beggar maid.Light, color, sound, movement, like the great filmmakers to come, PP made grand films because they thought grand. Their enduring legacy is that most great filmmakers of that calibre came not before but after them. Black Narcissus is a prophecy of cinema to come.",

The high altitude, the native people, and the mountain vistas, have profound effects on the woman, and each, in their own way, begins to question their commitment to their chosen life. The performances are good, though somewhat typical in that rather dry, post-war kind of way. Kathleen Byron makes a very modern attempt to create a startling and unusually frank image of female sexuality. Her quick kiss of Mr. Dean's hand as he evicts her from his home is part childish defiance, part serpent's bite, and is just one of the many highlights of her performance. The 70-year-old May Hallat is also note-worthy, creating a bizarre and thoroughly original character in the form of the servant Angu Ayah.The movie's true stars however are production designer Alfred Junger and cinematographer, the legendary Jack Cardiff. Junger manages to create a vivid and hallucinatory vision of northern India on an English sound stage. The interiors of the crumbling palace, with their intricately carved screens and painted murals, are beautiful, and the courtyards, full of goats and chickens caught in the howling winds, convey an incredible air of authenticity. With a Technicolor camera, nobody ever really knew exactly how the developed film would look. All you could hope for was that a gifted cinematographer and a Technicolor consultant could twiddle those little dials in just the right way so as to alter the light spectrum and burn vibrant reds and haunting indigo onto the film forever. The virtual alchemy of the process, the unexpected serendipity, is what lends this film its excitement, and Cardiff's Oscar win is one of the most deserved in the Academy's history.An amazing visual feast, that while lacking in strong performances, teaches us much of the bravery, science, craft and artistry of vintage cinema.",

I wish I had left this as a half-understood, oneiric fragment, instead of seeing how little is going on in it. The script barely gives voice/or presence to the tensions that are supposedly driving these women bonkers. It has other primarily visual charms, but for me that adds up to a mixed bag. Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first. The 50's produced a number of films that must've stuck in the minds of the filmmakers who came of age in the 70s and produced that decade's film-art renaissance; strange little films that were trying to break out of genre constraints, that took the viewers out of the mainstream viewpoint. This is one. Summertime is another. They try very hard to be fresh, but ultimately they don't know what narrative will be in the future, so much as they know what color photography, and an attitude towards film could be. The results are intriguing half-measures.Kerr plays another enormous control-freak, but here she shows an iron will missing from the rest of her hand-wringing career. Sister Clodagh is from Ireland as is Kerr who oddly affects an English accent. Clodagh self-righteously speechifies about what a hard-working order she's in, but she's never shown so much as lifting a feather. She does tell others to work harder though. As a protagonist, this make her (ahem.) rather unappealing, and we come to resent her like Sister Ruth does. But back in the day when you could count on audiences reared by jerky nuns like this, it might've played differently. Sister Clodagh seemingly imagines god is most pleased with her when she's being a major tight-ass; so she punitively seeks out any sign of independent thought. God is just an excuse that someone like this use to get you to yield to her will. The 3 things you'll remember; the artifice, the set and the powerful use of color. And though not filmed 'on location' shooting outdoor scenes outdoors is still very novel for this era. The film is legitimately known for it's striking photography, and it's ability to conjure up India in the middle of England; sometimes more successfully than others. The miniature of the convent never successfully jumps scale. And birds disappear as they fly under the matte painting in an opening shot. (!?) But it's England and this type of effects-based synthesis is rarely attempted, so you have to cut it some slack. More intriguing is the complete artifice of the milieus, with heightened color schemes and a haunting wind; the psychological space is key here. On the bad side, the first drops of the final rainstorm are absolutely absurd. How can you solve such major problems (Technicolor) and get tripped up on such trifling, dumb details? Ditto for Sister Ruth's symmetrical bloodstains (paint) on her habit. How the hell did bloody handprints get there?The crazy housekeeper who's a nitwit is straight out of \"Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte\"; people seem to enjoy her performance. The young general (Sabu) here is a complete closet case who wants to wear brocade & ermine, cheap perfume and hang out with women. If he has a single nerve-ending interested in the hotty beggar-woman (Jean Simmons), then I'm Bea Arthur. He couldn't arouse anything in a nun but contempt. His subplot is DOA. Although originally I found too little occurring in the plot, I find loads in it now after several viewings. There are some shocking entries by the de-nunnified Sister Ruth who is rapidly going completely out of her gourd.INFLUENCES: This is practically a companion piece for Vertigo. And the siting of the convent is stolen directly from the hilltop lamasery in Lost Horizon - It's placed in the exact same disposition; on the left on a precipice with a valley below on the right.

Things start well, if strangely under the leadership of the young but firm Sister Clodagh as the Old General has paid his people to attend lessons and the infirmary. The presence of English man Mr Dean, with his drinking, free living and thigh-exposing shorts causes problems within the strict group. As time goes by though, harder times come and divisions are driven between the nuns.I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but what I wasn't expecting from a 1940's British film was a story about repressed sexual desire. The story unfolds in the nunnery while also giving us a bit of background for Clodagh but the majority of the plot is in the present. Regardless of whether things are going well or badly within the mission, the film gradually picks away at the relationship between the women to show the easy chemistry some of them have with Dean even if they do object and reject his presence. This grows nicely across the film, going from chemistry to slight affection to barely concealed desire. It maybe goes over the top a bit with the Sister Ruth towards the end but it still works because it has been building for so long. The \"main\" story of the nunnery works alongside this aspect of it and generally the film is interesting and engaging.The colours and sets in the film suit the tone of the film well. At times the fact that the production never set foot in another country was a bit of a problem for me but the location is less important than the minds and hearts of the characters. Kerr leads the film well with a conflicted character, while Farrar is just about a good enough mix of insolence and charm to make it convincing that he would be attractive to the women. Byron has the hammiest role and she seems to enjoy it, throwing looks and gradually going slightly mad with desire and fresh air. The support cast are generally good and include a surprisingly sexual turn from the young woman (Hallatt I think) and has Subu doing the performance he usually does and an amusing Knight.Overall this is an enjoyable film. It has elements and aspects that have dated but the central story of desire and conflict is well built and engaging. The rich colours match the slightly erotic air the whole thing has and the cast do well with the material.",

            "content": "I'm not a big fan of old British cinema (modern British cinema is often superior to American cinema), although every once in a while I'll catch an old British film on TCM that I enjoy. This, however, is one British film that truly impresses me.First, with the exception of the mountain backgrounds, this looks real. While its setting is the Himalayas, I've spent a lot of time in Thailand and visited many ruins and near ruins, and the \"palace\" where the nuns set up their school/clinic really does have \"that\" look. The paintings that are occasionally seen are excellent copies of temple art. Now in regard to the mountains -- clearly fake, but different than the usual Hollywood matte work of that era. Indeed, the mountains here were mostly painted on glass, which gives them a very pleasant appearance. There were some aspects of the film that seemed to have needed some further thought. For example, even before it was mentioned, it was clear that the convent was in a COLD and windy place, yet the British agent is always wandering around in shorts with his shirt open. Not very logical. And, there's at least two segments that appear to be in the tropics...very out of place.Another highlight of this film is that it takes enough time to go into the character of each of the principal nuns. For example, we can see at the start that Deborah Kerr, who is the head nun at the convent, has some power issues...a recurring theme. Another of the nuns -- the wonderful Flora Robson -- is losing herself in the mystique of the Orient. And, another sister -- Kathleen Byron -- is slowly going mad with lust and jealousy (I appreciated her role more after watching one of the supplemental videos on the Criterion Blu-Ray release, where she is extensively interviewed). Jean Simmons is interesting as a trampy girl who has a crush on the young prince (Sabu). She looks the part...sort of...very little dialog.Deborah Kerr is so young here (26) and relatively new to film (we Americans knew her for the films after this) it took me a short while to recognize her. Excellent as always, however. This is a wonderful role for Sabu, and I sense he was very proud of the finery in which he dressed for this film. David Farrar has a very strong part of the British rep in the area.There are a number of powerful moments in the film. I was especially impressed when the British agent bluntly asks Kerr, \"What would Christ have done?\" There's also a confrontational scene between Kerr and Byron that is very strong. And then the attempted murder scene is very dramatic.Interestingly, the flashback scenes of Kerr's life before becoming a nun were banned in the U.S. due to pressure from the Catholic Church. They are restored in the version broadcast on TCM and on the Criterion restoration.And, it's interesting that this film was made the same year that India achieved independence from Great Britain, and some have suggested that when the nuns leave the convent at the end of the film, it is symbolic of England leaving India. In one sense nuns who don't belong there...and a country that didn't belong there, either.Excellent film, and a fitting nominee for your DVD shelf. I give it a rare \"8\" because it is a truly different film.I have re-reviewed this film after buying the Criterion Blu-Ray version. The restoration is superb with the exception of a few stills of the mountains. Otherwise it is as crisp with true color as any old film I have seen restored.",

            "content": "American poet A.R. Ammons once said, \"There's something to be said in favor of working in isolation in the real world.\" Sister Clodagh (Kerr) had this much in mind when she took a Mother Superior position in a secluded former seraglio turned makeshift school and hospital in the Himalayas. She brings with her a bevy of Anglican sisters and the emotional baggage of a failed relationship back in Ireland. Looking to create a world anew under strict Anglican and Christian principles, the sisters are slowly seduced by the wild, untouched region they inhabit and the wanton attitudes of the locals including two wards: Kanchi (Simmons), and The Young General (Sabu). Aiding in the erosion of the order is Mr. Dean (Farrar) a hard- drinking British agent who takes a liking to Sister Clodagh and becomes an object of obsession to the unstable Sister Ruth (Byron).The first thing that sets Black Narcissus apart from other films is it's all-enveloping beauty. Done largely at Pinewood Studios in England, Production Designer Alfred Junge and Cinematographer Jack Cardiff created an otherworldly microcosm out of mattes and vibrant color, romanticizing a part of the world most involved have never seen. Shot by shot Black Narcissus is among the most beautiful films ever made. The exoticism of the wild breeze, the vivid flora and detailed costume design of the locals barely contain the explosiveness of the story and the eroticism that lies just beneath the surface. Yet despite the production's dreamlike detail, there's something undeniably false about it. It's almost as if directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger (known collectively as The Archers) wanted to make a statement about the futility of making a world in your own image where everything is controlled by some hard to define virtue.Throughout the film, Sister Clodagh must contend with trials and tribulations that pares her reality with a romantic realism; a world she cannot comprehend and with rules that directly challenge her verisimilitude. She's scared, shes confused and her only solace is in the arms of a boorish man who seems at times to taunt as much as the easterly winds. Meanwhile Sister Ruth easily folds under the pressures of living too far from her reality and becomes a foil to Sister Clodagh's desires. Add to that Kanchi's sexuality, along with the presence of a nearby holy man, everything around Sister Clodagh erodes her faith through silent challenges that unsettle the fussy, drab routines of the order.Religious rigidity isn't the only thing at odds with the liberated emotions of the studio concocted Himalayas. Behind the beauteous production design there lies a subtle subtext. 1947, the year of Black Narcissus's release was also the year of Indian independence from colonial rule. Within that context, the film can be seen as a conflict between civilizations; one holding presumptive power over the other without truly understanding it. Much like Gandhi's revolution, the change comes not with bloody revolt but with a subtle change in consciousness; a tension that is puzzling to the British occupants yet seems unpractical to start a power struggle. This tension is further examined in The Young General's romance with Kanchi. The Young General (played by Sabu the only major character of Indian decent) uses Christmas mass as an excuse to see Kanchi and while Sister Clodagh seems aware of their budding romance, she does little to stop them. How can she when locals are being paid by the Old General (Knight) to attend their school and sisters are planting flowers instead of vegetables. The very fabric of their existence is falling apart! Concessions must be made and Generals Young and Old have all the power.Lovingly crafted with vibrant colors and complex themes, drenched in eroticism and levels of hyperbole, Black Narcissus is unlike anything you're likely to see in your lifetime. Unlike Sanders of the River (1935), The Drum (1938) or The Four Feathers (1939) whose mission statements held colonialism to be a noble enterprise, at it's most grand, Black Narcissus displaces that nobility on an almost existential level. At it's most modest it is a psychological study of many desperate people trying to exist in isolation where nothing makes sense and may lead to madness.",

Big themes are set up and regularly referred to (cold nuns/hot natives, Christianity/Buddhism/Hinduism, the cracking-up of an enclosed community, etcetera) but they aren't really explored. The film is really a big lush bath of sensations, held together by the three beauties, and especially by Kathleen Byron.

            "content": "Nuns form a nunnery in the Himalayan \"roof the world\" and quickly get swept up by the local traditions, cultures and people. Being more effected by them than the natives are by the newly arrived nuns.Films are made too often and too often for the wrong reasons for them to stumble in the world of profound art. But here they have created a masterpiece which despite passing of time rarely fails to enthral and amaze. The care and attention to detail are astonishing.(Shame the bell tower scene features on the poster and in the trailer - should be kept as a surprise. But any film maker - from Hitchcock down - could learn from it. If they haven't already.)The first thing this film needs and then gets is a great cast. Deborah Kerr is amazing as she has to play two roles: The nun and the nun in her former life. This isn't as easy as you would believe and provides insight and comparison. The locals are well cast too - and believable - in a way so few films of the period are. Fully fleshed with a life and agendas of their own.Emeric Pressburger is a genius. This film is all the evidence anyone would need. Like musicals it has all the ingredients not only to be a failure - but a complete joke. A colony of nuns in the middle of nowhere! What nerve the producers had! My final thoughts are the final thoughts of many favourite films. Flawed or otherwise. They are a deep experience. Not always a pleasant experience and not always an experience you wish to repeat, but a unique experience. Black Narcissus is a unique experience and there aren't that many films that stand on their own like that. See it.",

            "review_title": "An excellent and fascinating psychological drama which very effectively explores the effects of eroticism and jealousy",
            "content": "Based on the 1939 novel of the same name by Rumer Godden, this is an excellent and fascinating psychological drama which very effectively explores the effects of eroticism and jealousy. Given that its subject matter related to nuns, it pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable to put on film in the 1940s. By the standards of the time, much of the film's content is very shocking. While that is no longer the case today, it is never less than compelling drama. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's writing and direction are both fantastic. There is a terrific sense of tension throughout the film. The glorious Technicolor of Jack Cardiff's cinematography is a joy to behold and he deservedly won an Oscar. The plot concerns five nuns belonging to the Order of the Servants of Mary who are charged with the operation of a school and hospital in the tiny Indian village of Mopu, located in one of the highest parts of the Himalayas. The nuns themselves are based in the Palace of Mopu, which was once used to house concubines. This rather inappropriate venue for a convent serves to emphasise the sense of sexual awakening that develops as the film progresses. To the nuns, the isolated Mopu seems like another world, one which is not exactly free of temptation.The film stars Deborah Kerr in an excellent performance as Sister Clodagh, the strong willed but emotionally repressed Sister Superior who joined the order so that she could forget about a failed romance in her native Ireland. At the beginning of the film, she seems cold and unfeeling to a certain extent but it soon becomes clear that she is attempting to protect herself. I imagine that it has become second nature to her to guard her emotions over the years as she was heartbroken when her young man Con absconded to the US and left her behind. However, she finds that she is increasingly preoccupied with her past the longer that she remains in the palace. The sorely underrated David Farrar is very good as the British agent Mr. Dean, a handsome, rugged man's man. He has little respect for either Sister Clodagh or her religion and the two of them quickly develop a rather tempestuous relationship. She finds him objectionable when sober and abominable while drunk and his opinion of her seemingly isn't too high either. When she opens up to him several days later, their relationship becomes more cordial. However, it may not end there as there are a few subtle hints in the final scene that there is an attraction between them.The best performance in the film comes from Kathleen Byron, who is absolutely brilliant as Sister Ruth. Before she is even seen, she is established as being the misfit in the convent in Calcutta. The Reverend Mother believes that she would be better able to function in another setting with fewer people. She sort of missed the boat there, it has to be said. In the early part of the film, the script does an excellent job at hinting at the fact that Sister Ruth is mentally unstable. The most dramatic example of this is when she rushes into Sister Clodagh's office, covered in blood from a patient and practically giddy. Mr. Dean has the unfortunate distinction of being the object of her lust and her obsession with him is the catalyst for her descent into madness. They have barely spoken to each other in all of the time that the nuns have been at the palace but she believes that they are destined to be together. As time passes, Sister Ruth becomes convinced that Sister Clodagh is attempting to steal Mr. Dean away from her and she is consequently filled with uncontrollable jealousy. Byron does a wonderful job at conveying the character's insanity through the intense, piercing look in her eyes. I was surprised by the sheer, unbridled intensity of Byron's performance in the last 20 minutes. Sister Ruth is one of the most frightening characters that I have come across in any film, frankly.The film has a very good supporting cast. Sabu is great as the Young General Dilip Rai, the heir to the tiny state ruled by his uncle the Old General Toda Rai. Against her better judgement, Sister Clodagh accedes to his request to be admitted into the school even though it is open only to children and young women. Although he claims to be interested only in his studies, he eventually runs off with the 17- year-old femme fatale Kanchi. Jean Simmons has no dialogue and very little screen time as Kanachi but she is suitably enchanting. Like Byron, she communicates a great deal through her eyes. The always excellent Flora Robson departs from her typical imperious character type as Sister Philippa, who finds working in the palace extremely distracting and spends most of her time mulling over her life before entering the convent. Judith Furse offers strong support as Sister Briony, the nun most suited to life in the convent, but Jenny Laird is a little annoying as the sweet but unreliable Sister Honey. The great character actor Esmond Knight has a very entertaining cameo as the Old General, who is mentioned frequently but only appears in one scene. In her final film, Michael Redgrave's mother Margaret Scudamore is uncredited as Clodagh's grandmother.Overall, this is an extremely entertaining film. My mother went to a convent school. On the few occasions that the nuns showed the students films, they were typically about nuns. Somehow, I doubt that this was one of them.",

This is quite a psychological story with these four nuns trying to get things established and running and their struggles with blending into the established cultures as well their faith when certain temptations present themselves. The story turns from calm to incredibly and eerily intense while properly utilizing their unique location.

It is, of course, easy to see the appeal it had at the time;b after six years of war and one of post-war austerity a film depicting an exotic location - albeit shot at Pinewood - and utilising Technicolor - far from commonplace in British films then - would almost automatically appeal to that particular public and throw in an order of nuns relatively isolated with one virile man (who unacountably, given that the Himalayan location is several thousand feet above sea level, wanders around in shorts and a shirt open to the waist) and a winning formula needs only the most perfunctory stirring.

It stars Deborah Kerr, Sabu, Jean Simmons, David Farrar, Flora Robson and Kathleen Byron. Music is scored by Brain Easdale and cinematography by Jack Cardiff.A group of nuns travel to the Himalayas to set up a school and hospital at the disused Palace of Mopu. Once set up high in the mountains, some of the nuns find themselves seduced by the atmospheric sensuality of the place. Which spells trouble as inner demons start to seep out.I haven't got much of a review here for you, it really would be redundant due to the widespread availability of detailed works written about the film over the years. Besides which, I can only really agree with 99% of what has been said about the film before. Is there anything new that can be said? I don't think so, really I don't.Black Narcissus is an experience, a sort of ode to spiritual cinema and a bastion of visual splendour. Some call it a masterpiece, others say it's just shy of being as such, but either way a vast majority of film lovers agree it's film making of considerable skill.Negatively, however small in the grand scheme of things, it's thin on story and a couple of our lead nun protagonists here are actually too filmy and pretty; I mean I don't intend to insult the thousands of real nuns in the world, but none are surely as foxy as Kerr and Byron as presented here?! You can kind of tell it's the meeting of a visualist and a story teller trying to find a common ground, but the visualist (Powell) holds sway for this one and film lovers the world over are all the better for it.With a spitfire on form cast, matte paintings and Technicolor so beautiful that eye orgasms are guaranteed, and sensual suspense dripping from the roof, Black Narcissus is landmark British film making.

            "content": "I've just found out about one final scene that was shot but didn't appear in the film as we know it - with Sister Clodagh back in Calcutta, face-to-face with the Mother Superior.  Powell writes in his autobiography: `If that was how we had it originally, I think we were bloody fools to cut it and substitute it for ... Anyway, I wish we had kept the scene, and I wish it were in my collection now.  The present ending is the only conventional touch in the whole film.'Exactly so.  I felt that there was something dissatisfying about the way the film ends, and now I have a better idea what it is.  It emphasises the wrong thing; and it's too open-ended with regard to the RIGHT thing.  A number of the Archers' films - including some of the best - only really coalesce in the final scenes anyway, and this one doesn't quite complete the process.  A good story, but not great.The art direction and the music ARE great, though, which might be what's making my slight, vague, nagging sense of disappointment all the keener. When I heard that this was a convincing depiction of the Himalayas filmed entirely in England, I thought, `Yeah, yeah.  Anyone could do that. There'll be lots of snow.  Snow is the same everywhere.'  But no!  Not a snowflake in sight.  (Except for a brief flashback set in Ireland, which doesn't count.)  It's lush and colourful and STILL looks as if it couldn't possibly have been made in the British Isles.  And even when there's no direct visual cues we still feel as if the old palace must be genuinely old, and kilometres above sea level.  (By the way, those two parrots we see are both Australian: a sulphur-crested cockatoo, and a gangan.  But they're part of the prince's private collection, so I expect he imported them.) Authenticity isn't the point anyway.  Otherworldly is more the intent.  It may be the most beautiful film you'll ever see.  I know, there are sure to be many rivals: I said `may'.  Brian Easdale's music is the art direction all over again.  It's beautiful, a good deal less Indian than it appears to be, and very, very good.The oddest Powell-Pressburger film I've yet seen, and not entirely satisfying; but it IS an experience you won't forget.",

Once there they must battle not only some of the villagers but also the elements and some growing temptations for a rebellious man (David Farrar). There's no question that BLACK NARCISSUS has become one of the most-loved and respected films from this period. With that said, it also came as somewhat of a disappointment on a couple levels but more on that in a bit. I guess the film's best remembered for its Oscar-winning cinematography by Jack Cardiff and it's easy to see why. The Technicolor has been called by many to be the greatest looking of any film and I personally wouldn't put up much of a fight against anyone who thought that. There were several moments during the movie where I forgot I was actually watching a film because the colors were just so beautiful that they pretty much took you away from the story trying to be told. The first glimpses of the mountains and how far up the building were really takes ones breathe away because the camera gets you so high in altitude that you really can't help but feel as if you're standing up there and taking in all this fresh air. I really loved the vivid reds that really came into play towards the end of the film whether it was the beautiful sunsets or the red dress that one character wears. The performances are another strong point with Kerr and Farrar standing out among all the actors. I thought Kerr was very good as she was clearly very comfortable with the role and manages to be very believable. Farrar is a very strong male role that allows the character to grow quite a bit and certainly much more than the rest. Flora Robson, Sabu, Jean Simmons and Jenny Laird all do fine work as well. While many people consider this a masterpiece I certainly wouldn't go that far. I had a few big problems with the screenplay and one was that very few of the characters were interesting. I think the actors brought the material to life and without their performances you'd really be lacking much drama due to the material. One issue is that not for a second did I believe the setting or the events that were going on. I had a hard time believing that any of these nuns, outside of Kerr, would be able to get this school up and running. Another problem is that the sexual temptations happen way too late and I think the screenplay could have brought them to the surface in a better way. Again, going by the film's reputation I'd say that the majority don't have an issue with the screenplay but it certainly kept me from enjoying the film more than I did.",

            "content": "When I reviewed Stanley Kubrick's \"A Clockwork Orange\", I praised Alex DeLarge's character arc for a few reasons. One of them was because it came as a surprise. When I wrote that, however, it sounded more like icing on the cake. I viewed it more as secondary. However, after watching this film, I quickly realized that surprise should be at the forefront of all character arcs. That was why I didn't care that much for this film.After 5 nuns (Sister Clodagh, Sister Briony, Sister 'Honey' Blanche, Sister Philippa, and Sister Ruth) open up a convent in the Himalayas, they encounter conflict and tension with the natives, their surroundings, and from within their own group. As they spend more time there, their conflict gradually intensifies.The film opens up with a promising start. It has great cinematography and a plot which is easy to follow. For a moment, I became intrigued by the film's plot as I wondered where it would lead to. However, that curiosity was quickly nullified. The second Mother Dorothea says the line \"Yes, she's a problem. I'm afraid she'll be a problem for you too.\" as she refers to Ruth, my anticipation quickly faded into disappointment. At that point, I had a feeling where Ruth's character was going to head right at the start. Because I felt that, there was nothing surprising about how she ended up. I wished that her character would have started out softer. The further I got into the movie, my disappointment kept on expanding as my concerns kept on sounding more plausible. Revealing her character flaws single-handedly broke the movie down for me. Hell, even the birds eye shot of the bell tower at the edge of the cliff was enough for me to be able to predict another major aspect of the climax. However, I can at least praise Ruth's character arc for being believable.However, there are aspects to this film which make it worth watching. For instance, the cinematography. Images of the mountainous landscape are gorgeous to look at. The fact that this film was shot in Technicolor doesn't diminish its impact at all. The shots look vibrant and overwhelming. However, the architectural shots look just as fabulous as well. A wide assortment of rooms and hallways from the film look immaculate with their amusing color schemes and the layout of furniture. Artsy designs on some of the walls serve as eye candy. I felt fully immersed with the environment at all times while watching the film.Some of the shots appear menacing as well. The shot of the bell tower suspended at the edge of the cliff is enough to send chills down your spine due to the angle at which it was shot. Also, Sister Ruth's iconic crimson lipstick sends a message to the viewer that there's no turning back for her. The film also uses shadows to create a foreboding atmosphere. The scene I'm referring to comes near the end where we see Sister Ruth engulfed in shadows while wearing dark colored clothing. Sister Clodagh, on the other hand, is wearing white in that scene, and we can clearly see her. It's a simple technique, but it helps to create a foreboding atmosphere and it also gives that scene a fair amount of suspense as a result.In conclusion, this film is worth seeing for the gorgeous visuals. They look overwhelming, vibrant, and at times - foreboding. However, the visuals aren't enough to save it from its predictability throughout the film and its disappointing ending. I found this movie to be a learning experience. I got more insight on how character arcs should be handled. Even though I didn't like this film, the incredible visuals and set design interested me in checking out more of Michael Powell's filmography.",

            "review_title": "Killer Nuns Run Mad in the Himalayas",
            "content": "\"Black Narcissus\" can be regarded as the first peace-time film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, who worked together as \"The Archers\". Their first collaboration, \"The Spy in Black\", was made just before the outbreak of war in 1939, but is set during World War One and was clearly made as a propaganda piece with the impending conflict in mind. Similarly, \"A Matter of Life and Death\" is about the World War Two, even though it was made in 1946, just after the war had ended. By contrast, \"Black Narcissus\" at first sight appears to be a much more peaceful film, although this appearance is later to prove deceptive. A group of nuns travels to a remote valley in the Indian Himalayas to set up a mission station in a disused palace. Although they run a medical clinic, they make little impression on the local people, and jealousies and emotional tensions within the group eventually lead to the experiment being abandoned. The film appeared in 1947, shortly before Indian independence, and some have interpreted the nuns' withdrawal from their mountain fastness as symbolic of the British withdrawal from their Indian empire. The two key characters are the Sister Superior, the Irish-born Sister Clodagh, and Sister Ruth. They are played by Deborah Kerr and Kathleen Byron who were, apparently, the former lover and the current lover respectively of the director Powell. This strikes me as a rather cruel piece of casting given that, in the film, Clodagh and Ruth are also rivals for the love of the same man, Mr. Dean, the rather disreputable British aide to the \"Old General\", the local ruler. This might seem a strange plot line for a film about nuns, but this is a film which takes an unusually critical view of religion for the period in which it was made. This has never been my favourite Archers film, even though it came chronologically between two of their masterpieces, \"A Matter of Life and Death\" and \"The Red Shoes\", and stars Deborah Kerr who had appeared in another masterpiece, \"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp\". Certainly, with its sumptuous colour photography it is a visually striking film; it won Oscars for \"Best Cinematography\" and \"Best Art Direction\". Its visual beauty is all the more remarkable in that it was not shot on location in India but largely made at Pinewood Studios, with some scenes filmed in a Sussex garden with a collection of Himalayan plants. The views of the Himalayas we see are actually matte paintings. The vivid colours of the costumes worn by the Indian characters contrast sharply with the plain white robes of the nuns. Unfortunately, the script is not as good as the look of the film. The clear intention of Powell and Pressburger was to contrast the austerity of the nuns' lives with the sensuality of their surroundings. The building in which they are living was once used by a local prince to house his harem, and the walls are still covered with erotic murals (which the nuns have painted over). The Old General's heir, the \"Young General\", studies with the nuns for a time, but is distracted by his romance with a lower caste dancing girl (an early role for Jean Simmons). The film's rather obscure title \"Black Narcissus\" refers to a scent which the Young General uses and which becomes a symbol of luxury and sensuality. Dean, in his dealings with the nuns, is quite deliberately informal both in his language and his dress, appearing both bare-chested and bare-legged. Despite the film's theme, there is surprisingly little discussion of religious matters or of what it means to be a nun in the way that there is in, say, \"The Nun's Story\", a film which examines the spiritual side of nunnery life in some detail. Ruth and Clodagh are, after all, women who have vowed their lives to the service of God; when a nun leaves her Order, as Ruth does, it is normally because of some spiritual crisis, not because she has become besotted with a good-looking rogue. David Farrar's louche and cynical Dean, for all his rough-cut good looks and hairy legs, never really comes across as a man so irresistibly fascinating that he could tempt a woman to abandon her religious vows. The film implies that neither woman has a genuinely deep religious vocation; we see from flashbacks that Clodagh became a nun in order to escape from the pain of an unhappy love-affair in Ireland, whereas Ruth is portrayed as dangerously mentally unstable, although there is little exploration of the factors that have made her so and no explanation of why her Order have not discovered her psychological unsuitability for the religious life. Although the film purports to deal with the clash between spiritual values and worldly ones, it does so in little depth, and even as a study of sexual jealousy it is not particularly convincing. The final violent climax has always struck me as exaggerated and unconvincing. It has been said that the Archers' films looked better than they really were and, although this is certainly not true of many of their films, it seems to me to be a fair criticism of \"Black Narcissus\". 7/10",

The most conspicuous feat of this 1947 Technicolor film is its remarkable cinematography (intense closeups, picturesque wide angles, tonal flashback shots etc.) and the art direction (the entire setting is built on studio lot yet it still can blow your mind away by its plainly stunning beauty), deservingly it won 2 Oscars in these categories, but shockingly, the film is shunned in all other competitions.Adopted from Rumor Godden's novel, the film bears plenty of effort to underline the ethnic and religious disparities, although hiring Jean Simmons as an indigenous maiden without a single line but crudely emphasizing her sensuality and materialism is a cheap shot betrays the supremacy beneath the benefactor's benevolent smokescreen. Surely it is a UK production, unfortunately it is so scarce that an outsider can break out of the tunnel vision which hobbles one's full comprehension of another culture or lifestyle, even as acute and astute as team Powell-Pressburger. A young Deborah Kerr brings about a broad range of capacities to endow Sister Clodaph with the contradicting personae which challenges her belief in a dire situation, her self-restraint battles with her yen towards a macho worldly man Mr. Dean (Farrar), a high-caliber rendition superbly counteracts Byron's Sister Ruth, a demented and vindictive soul can set the world on fire, Byron's explosive menace is spot-on and spine-thrilling, while both her and Kerr's images sport secular costumes are illuminating the screen leaving indelible glamor. Farrar's rustic countenance and rugged roughness makes him an apt choice for the sexual object and Sabu, whose effeminate manners could also spark controversy with his underdeveloped sub- plot. BLACK NARCISSUS, by any criterion, is an unanimous and momentous accomplishment in the film history, it is a concisely-designed psycho-drama and a nod to its vertiginous climax - a heartfelt cliffhanger in its literal meaning.",

The rugged Himalayas, a deserted monastery that a handful of proper English women is determined to turn into a nunnery, saw-toothed mountain tops, giant and snow-veined, crystalline air, the wind moaning in the background through the vast halls, billowing drapery, a Top of the World that Cody Jarett never dreamed of! Stupendous atmosphere.And the direction is above the clouds too. Powell and Pressburger construct a story that is leisurely and wondrous at first. The nuns are all in white. The local are in exotic dress. Everyone is bubbly and bright and living in a fairy tale, until it turns into a Grimm fairy tale. You see, each of the nuns is haunted by personal demons, as indeed all of us are. But when you're stuck up there on the rooftop of the world and there's only one guy around, David Farrar, and he insists on stalking around FIXING THE PLUMBING, and wearing shorts and sometimes no shirt at all so the starving women are exposed to his bare, slightly hairy chest -- well.The camera work is so fluid, so swooping, and the direction so professional that the soap-opera aspects of the film are almost unnoticeable. And it does seem rather like a romantic drama more than a story of spiritual evolution. Powell and Pressburger are given to shocking jump cuts and unexpected close ups -- long before close ups became commonplace. We see huge images. Not only of faces but of particular features, especially eyes although there are one or two shots of lips being painted. (That's the word -- painted.) These faces are important because they're about all we get to see of the women. Their costumes are identical.Deborah Kerr is just about perfect as the Mother Superior or Top Sergeant or whatever her title is. Her beauty is fresh-faced. She's slightly wall eyed. Her voice is tremulous and girlish. Everything about her face and demeanor suggests innocence, though she shows strength enough when the situation demands it.All of the nuns are disturbed in one way or another, but Kathleen Byron goes frankly mad. She believes that Farrar desires her as much as she lusts after him, and that the other nuns, especially Kerr, know this and are jealous of her. Paranoia with features of erotomania. The most startling moment in the film is when Kerr bursts into Byron's dark room and finds her out of her habit and dressed in sensual civilian clothes, her hair done with abandon, her face fully made up. The shot uses a kick light so Byron's face is lighted from below and takes on a character that is sexy, dangerous, and almost demonic.A lavish display of visual delights, and good performances and direction.",

            "content": "A film about emotional tensions, jealousy and lust starring... nuns. That automatically makes this religious drama considerably more interesting, but with its amazing photography and acting, this emotional roller coaster hits peaks as high as the mountain range it's set in. The story follows a group of nuns and their emotional crisis while isolated in a valley in the Himalayas. This is the first Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger film that I've seen, and based on this I'd certainly be up for watching more. Sadly, like many older movies it suffers from pacing problems which will put off viewers used to faster paced and dumber modern cinema. Still, despite its dips, it completes its dramatic story arc in satisfying style and ultimately delivers on the hard hitting emotion. It's a very well acted movie, with Deborah Kerr standing out in particular as the lead, while every shot is stunning. It's a very well filmed movie and many images linger in the memory long after the emotionally stirring ending.Black Narcissus works very well as a story. It's emotional without being manipulative and sentimental and the characters are complex and fully realized. It may seem slow and mundane to modern viewers, which admittedly it is at times, but whenever the pace dips the film usually manages to regain your attention one way or another. Thematically it's a deep movie, and thanks to intelligent writing it all comes together very well. Today it remains a striking film, but it's difficult to imagine how powerful this was for viewers in 1947. It's recommended viewing for those who enjoy classic movies and it's a triumph for British cinema. It's not as quite as strong as, say, The Third Man, but be prepared before viewing. This one has a real sting even today, and it's worth watching for the wonderful cinematography alone.9/10",

            "content": "I'm not a big fan of British cinema, although every once in a while I'll catch a British film on TCM that I enjoy. This, however, is one British film that impresses me.First, with the exception of the mountain backgrounds, this looks real. While it's setting is the Himalayas, I've spent a lot of time in Thailand and visited many ruins and near ruins, and the \"palace\", where the nuns set up their school/clinic really does have \"that\" look. And, the paintings that are occasionally seen are excellent copies of Buddhist temple art. Now in regard to the mountains -- clearly fake, but different than the usual Hollywood matte work that is common. And indeed, the mountains here were mostly painted on glass, which gives them a very pleasant appearance. The version recently seen on TCM appears to be a restored print. The color is excellent.There were some aspects of the film that seemed to have needed some further though. For example, even before it was mentioned, it was clear that the convent was in a COLD and windy place, yet the British agent is always wandering around in shorts. Not very logical. And, there's at least two segments that appear to be in the tropics...very out of place.Another highlight of this film is that it takes some time to go into the character of each of the principal nuns. For example, we can see at the start that Deborah Kerr, who is the head nun at the convent, has some power issues...a recurring theme. Another of the nuns -- the wonderful Flora Robson -- is losing herself in the mystique of the Orient. And, another sister -- Kathleen Byron -- is slowly going mad with lust and jealousy. Jean Simmons is interesting as a trampy girl who has a crush on the young prince (Sabu). She looks the part...sort of...very little dialog.Deborah Kerr is so young here (26) and relatively new to film (we Americans knew her for the films after this) it took me a short while to recognize her. Excellent as always, however. There is a wonderful role here for Sabu, and I sense he was very proud of the finery in which he dressed for this film. David Farrar has a very strong part of the British rep in the area.There are a number of powerful moments in the film. I was especially impressed when the British agent bluntly asks Kerr, \"What would Christ have done?\" There's also a confrontational scene between Kerr and Byron that is very strong. And then the attempted murder scene is very dramatic.Interestingly, the flashback scenes of Kerr's life before becoming a nun were banned in the U.S. due to pressure from the Catholic Church. They are restored in the version broadcast on TCM.And, it's interesting that this film was made the same year that India achieved independence from Great Britain, and some have suggested that when the nuns leave the convent at the end of the film, it is symbolic of England leaving India. In one sense nuns who don't belong there...and a country that didn't belong there, either.Excellent film, and a fitting nominee for your DVD shelf. I give it a rare \"8\" because it is a truly different film.",

Quite amazing to think it was filmed almost entirely in England.For someone familiar with India, Nepal and Tibet, a lot of suspension of disbelief was necessary, but few would have been so affected in 1947 no doubt.  Darjeeling is the Anglicised corruption of Dorje Ling, the original Tibetan name for that region before it was acquired by the Brits.  Some vaguely Tibetan and Nepalese clothing was evident, but nobody behaved anything like a Tibetan, though it must be said a fairly good attempt at a Nepalese girl by Jean Simmons.  I just had to laugh at the sound of kookaburras in the  bamboo in the small hours of the morning, dramatic intensity notwithstanding. :-)Those small matters aside, it really is a wonderful piece of cinema, with those small matters being probably very much part of conventional wisdom at that time.

            "content": "I looked up the movie and found that it was based on a 1939 novel of the same name and largely followed it. I cannot comment on the novel, but the movie never quite works.The concept is credible enough-a mother superior of a convent in Calcutta sends a group of her nuns off to form a new convent in a building in the Himalayan mountains which had originally been a seraglio for a general, and in which a monastery had tried to establish itself previously but only survived for five months. On top of that, none of the nuns know the Himalayan language or culture. Of course nothing can go wrong, can it?The nuns arrive to be greeted by the general's son, and the natives pack the new convent when they establish themselves-because they had been paid off by the general. A British official, Mr. Dean, is there too, and is resented by the sister superior Clodagh. While the new convent initially succeeds, serious problems soon crop up. Dean describes the natives as being like children, and they are. Clodagh had long forgotten her youth in Ireland, having been seduced and abandoned by a man she had thought she would marry, but the new environment brings back these old memories. Sister Ruth has her eye on Dean, who doesn't want her, and madness overtakes her. They also fail to save a baby's life, and the locals blame the nuns for it.The problem with the movie itself is that the nuns don't feel like nuns. You don't see them pray or do other routine religious work. Dean has a nice hairdo for someone living in a rough region like the Himalayas. And the natives are really too much like children. This movie is barely passable, but could and should have been done better.",

These are a mere decoration, however, to the real intent of the movie, which is to examine the minds and motivations of the Sisters who find themselves working in the exotic, isolated aerie, once the fortified zenana of a Hindu rajah. The madness which comes of so much introspection & loneliness is almost inevitable.A very fine cast brings the story to life: Deborah Kerr as Sister Clodagh, St Faith's young Sister Superior; Dame Flora Robson as gentle Sister Phillippa, whose appreciation of beauty awakens troubling memories; Judith Furse as sturdy Sister Briony, the convent's nurse; Jenny Laird as joyful Sister Honey, whose moment of panic threatens the convent's future; and Kathleen Byron as troubled Sister Ruth, whose physical frailty may signal emotional neuroses.As the agent of the munificent local ruler, David Farrar's casual virility troubles some of the Sisters. Indian actor Sabu had his last notable role as a charming young Prince with a fascination for Western knowledge. Young Jean Simmons appears as a wanton teen who is given a home by the nuns. Elderly Mary Hallatt steals her scenes as the convent's crotchety caretaker.Smaller roles are ably filled by Nancy Roberts as the Mother Superior of the Order of The Servants of Mary's convent in Calcutta, Esmond Knight as the Old General who gives the Palace of Mopu to the Order, and Shaun Noble as Kerr's Irish sweetheart. Movie mavens will recognize sweet Margaret Scudamore as Kerr's grandmother.The film makes magnificent use of Technicolour and thoroughly deserved the two Oscars it was awarded for cinematography & art direction The scenes showing Kerr's recollections of her former life in Ireland were originally excised by American censors, who considered them objectionable. They are not.**************************Born Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed in the Maharaja of Mysore's stables when he was discovered by Korda's company and set before the cameras. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE THIEF OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best and he found himself working out of Hollywood when they were completed. After distinguished military service in World War II he resumed his film career, but he became endlessly confined for years playing ethnic roles in undistinguished minor films, the one great exception being BLACK NARCISSUS (1947). His final movie, Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu had died of a heart attack in late 1963, only 39 years of age.",

It isn't their work: its where they work, high atop in the Himalayas. The young nun Deborah Kerr is made the head of this nunnery, the youngest ever in her order, and she finds a challenge in dealing with each of those under her charge. Then there's the local villagers, loyal to the Buddhist priest and upset by the infiltration of western culture. If Kerr found life with the king of Siam an ordeal, what she finds here is a key to the door to madness.The troubled nun played by Kathleen Byron gives her the most trouble, falling in love with one of the locals (David Farrar) and getting more jealous thanks to Farrar's growing friendship with Kerr, unbeknownst to Byron completely innocent. The other nuns are minor issues, although the hardworking Flora Robson finds a bit of the truth as she reveals that long forgotten feelings which she had long suppressed were coming back into her emotions.The future star of \"Guys and Dolls\" and \"Elmer Gantry\", Jean Simmons, wears dark makeup as a native Indian girl who speaks not a word but through seductive eye movements declares her list for student Sabu. He is obviously seduced by her staring at him from underneath a chair lustfully, and the temptation grows in a way that I'm surprised got past the censors.It's the wind, high altitude and smells of the Himalayas that are blamed for the sudden neuroses and psychosis that the nuns have to deal with. They all become too distracted by their inner struggles as humans which makes their vows seem impossible to fulfill. Only after the horrifying twist at the end (quite tense to be watch, especially on a big screen with this glorious color) are the nuns able to get back to their priorities. Sabu's observations about Jesus Christ taken lightly make you think too, showing that even other cultures focusing on learning more about the world around them can see the beauty in his simple words that many Christians twist into ways that turns off many others.",

I personally do not like priests and nuns, since I can not accept a human being repressing the sexual desire in the name of a religion.

While most of the movie tries to convince the audience how stressful the assignment is, and how terrible the \"heathens\" are, I was left puzzled. What she and the other four accompanying nuns went through wasn't that bad. Why did they lose it?For no explained reason, David Farrar lives in Calcutta, and despite a couple of drunken episodes, he's always around to dispense advice or help the struggling nuns. Most of the natives aren't interested in being saved or educated, but a very influential member of society actively seeks their help in furthering his education, so doesn't that kind of make up for the others' apathy? It was very strange to me, that these non-problems cause the nuns to hallucinate, beg for transfers, and lose their tempers.Jean Simmons has a very small part in this movie. She plays a morally loose Indian, given to the nuns so that she might stay out of trouble. She was given dark makeup for her skin and an earring for her nose, but her performance is more comical than believable. And to top it off, she doesn't utter a single word!

It nevertheless is still a great movie to watch, which is of course mostly due to its visual style.The movie is almost entirely set in the Himalayas, while almost the entire movie got shot at a studio, in full color. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger were two very creative directors who often used to experiment with grand and usual sets, as well as new movie techniques. This results in a great visual style for this movie, in which it very rarely shows that this movie got not shot at location. The art direction and cinematography were also the two things which earned this movie an Oscar. It was the first and only Oscar for cinematographer Jack Cardiff, who often is being regarded by many as the best cinematographer of all time.The story itself, while not being very intriguing, is also told great. It brings up some great- and perhaps also slightly controversial and daring themes the nuns are struggling with, such as their own faith and in the vows they have taken. The movie features some solid characters, played by some great actors, making the story work out all well.Deborah Kerr plays a great female lead and Jean Simmons also makes a grand and early movie appearance. She was only 17/18 at the time. Unfortantly some of the actors suddenly disappear out of the movie and sort of make a redundant impression.

            "content": "I have mixed feelings about this film. I saw The Red Shoes a while back, liked it, but found it somewhat flawed. I was interested in seeing more of The Archers' work, but it took me quite a while before I finally got one. When I did, though, I couldn't have picked a better one: Stairway to Heaven, aka, A Matter of Life and Death. It is one of the most unabashedly romantic and just plain audacious films ever made, a completely acynical testament to true love. See it if you haven't, it is one of the godliest films ever. So I needed to see another one quickly. Unfortunately, it took a while again. When I finally did, it was after I purchased Black Narcissus from the Criterion Collection.And, frankly, I was disappointed. There are at least two parts of the film that are absolutely impeccable: the cinematography and set design, both of which won Oscars. In fact, everything technical is great. But I don't know about the narrative. I think it's often very weak. First off, it is difficult to deal with constant and cruel insults against the native Indians; the nuns often call them \"little idiots\" and \"children.\" I know this film was made in 1947, but it becomes just a little too much to take. I guess I'm suggesting that it has become dated after 54 years.But it is not just that. I didn't ever feel any tension. It never seemed that the characters were changing. First off, I never got a good sense of any of the characters except maybe Mr. Dean, although he seemed a little light, too. Secondly, everything moves too fast. The film is 101 minutes long, but it feels much too short. I think to properly develop the relatively large cast of characters, the film should have lasted about 2.5 hours long, but I think the material could have easily sustained 3 hours. It seems like it should be an epic, but it never reaches that status. The relationship between Kanchi and the Young General is developed in this way: Kanchi, a sexual predator, is introduced. She immediately runs into a young man who was just made prince. She stares at him whenever he's in the nunnery. One day he spares her from a whipping, and then they disappear until the end of the film, where we find that he has married her. This comprises about 10 minutes worth of screen time. It should have taken up a lot more time. I never knew either of these characters. Similarly developed is the antagonism between Sister Clodagh and Sister Ruth. We see that Ruth is attracted to Mr. Dean, but this is simply shown through brief stares. Clodagh may or may not be attracted to Dean (I'm not sure if she was or not; it may have been purposefully ambiguous), but Ruth assumes she is. She begins to realize her own carnality, and eventually goes crazy. The final confrontation between these two nuns seemed preposterous to me, as if the scene were inserted to provide some sort of climax where there wasn't one at which the Archers could naturally arrive.The themes are also weakly defined, and a longer running time could have thickened them. As it stands, none of the themes came out well enough. I suppose it is mainly about that old Oriental eroticism that permeates so many Western films. Is it about sexuality? What is it saying about sexuality? I can't figure it out. And what does it have to say about colonialism? Many have speculated that its purpose is to be a farewell to colonialism. I don't see that at all. At the end, it is almost as if the nuns give up just because they feel the natives are too stupid to learn Christianity. And when the movie revolves around nuns, you would think that there would be some musings of some sort about religion. Religion as a subject hardly appears at all. It's just something that exists as a fact, even though religion exists more as a feeling, a mood, than an object. This is one of the major barriers facing religion today: it's all just a pointless code that one has to follow, without any real feelings of spirituality. There is prayer, but it never seems to mean anything. No wonder it is so easy for Sister Ruth to quit: there's really nothing that exists to keep her there.There is so much potential for a masterpiece here. This may sound like a grave blasphemy, but I think this film could stand to be remade. Its just that it would be impossible to make as beautiful as it is here. My suggestion: hand-held cameras, and digital touch-ups of the photography, just as Lars von Trier did in the title segments of Breaking the Waves and the musical segments in Dancer in the Dark. This would make the mood less magical, but it would give it an immediacy that is lacking. I would make it 2.5-3 hours long, developing all the characters more fully, and actually providing the rich sexual subtext that has been either lost over the years or was originally withheld because of censorship restraints in the first place. You can talk about the sexual desires of nuns nowadays without being burned at the stake.And who knows, maybe I just wasn't concentrating hard enough tonight. Possibly it is as good as a lot of people claim it to be. Maybe I was missing the subtext. I am definitely not dismissing it offhand. This is just my first impression. Even with all that I have said against it, it is still worth an 8/10.",

Along with her are several nuns, including a mentally-disturbed one (Kathleen Byron). The nuns' adaptation to their new environment--a dilapidated seraglio atop a mountain--proves difficult, and eventually, impossible.If there is such as a thing as cinematic perfection, \"Black Narcissus\" is among the films that has come closest to reaching it (filmmaking duo Powell and Pressburger's \"The Red Shoes\" is another). It's a phenomenal meeting of breathtaking visuals and rich, taut drama--there is truly never a dull moment here. The landscapes, all of which were painstakingly hand-painted to create the illusion that these women are isolated atop a mountain peak, are as incredible today as they were when the film was first released.Thematically, the film hits on a variety of topics, the central ones being isolation, sexual repression, and the related madness--and violence--that can be borne of it. The failure of man to adequately comport with any given natural environment is another core preoccupation here. The abandoned seraglio (a residence for concubines, ironically) is doomed before the nuns even arrive, as it was the site of a failed monastery. What reads as a portentous omen goes unnoticed by the characters, but the oppressiveness of the place quickly latches onto them like a ghost.Deborah Kerr gives a nuanced performance as the nun who is in over her head, while Kathleen Byron is counterpoint in a terrifying performance as a woman quite literally losing her mind. David Farrar turns in an admirable performance as the virile, strapping young agent who becomes the focus of Byron's repressed desires, while Jean Simmons (playing an Indian girl) appears in a supporting part as a dancing local, along with Sabu, who portrays a prince-to-be receiving his education at the convent.Overall, \"Black Narcissus\" is an indisputable classic, and is one of those films that earns its keep in the \"needs to be seen to be believed\" category. It is well-paced, well-acted, and expertly-shot. Shockingly, even amidst all the aesthetic beauty, the audience grows just as exasperated as the characters who cannot seem to shake the external environment--or their inner demons--from under the skin. 10/10.",

BLACK NARCISSUS is the story where nature shows its power, where, as the tag-line said: \"winds of the exotic past sweep men and women to strange and fascinating adventure...\" The sisters are be as candles that light up darkness. Yet, there is so much to happen in nature before it dawns...The content, being based upon the novel by Rumer Godden, is interesting, involving and very up-to-date. Adapted skillfully to the screen by the talented British directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, the novel adaptation is an absorbing story of human struggles, contradictions and clashes: order vs. desire, loneliness vs. lust, devotion vs. madness, obedience vs. rebel, confidence vs. hysteria. But even though lots of viewers will find the aspect truly convincing in the film as being on its own, I have to draw your attention on aspects why this seemingly clich\u00e9d theme has become so captivating here, something difficult to find elsewhere.Firstly, it is the clear manifestation of the contrast between the Eastern culture vs. the Western one or rather Buddhism vs. Christianity. Here, I would briefly refer to the words of Raymond Durgnat who said that \"the East as a schizo-eclectic culture opposes a human-but-heavenly order.\" Hard work and prayer opposed to the voices within the human being, obedience opposed to inner drives that cannot be considered as weaknesses. There is Sister Superior who acts and there is the holy man who just exists. The contrast is represented in many scenes, in many symbols, almost everywhere reaching its climax in the two female characters (referred to underneath).Secondly, it is the depiction of characters, from the film's point of view, performances, of course. Deborah Kerr as Sister Clodagh beautifully portrays a very human, changeable character. Her flashbacks of the promising past supply her character with a sympathetic and personal glimpse. The scene she talks to Mr Dean (David Farrar) is a manifestation of all her psyche. I don't hesitate to say that Ms Kerr's portrayal leads us to all major factors in the content. She is absolutely crucial in the message of the film embodying the entire contradictions, the thorough powers within a human heart. Yet, to the very final moment, she remains a sympathetic character standing on her own as Sister Superior. Other interesting characters include humble Sister Philippa portrayed by the great British actress Flora Robson, and the male characters, Mr Dean (David Farrar) and the young general (Sabu). They clearly depict the two men who transcend much in the external and internal worlds of the young idealistic ladies. Consider, for instance, the frequently mentioned Christmas sequence with the sweet carol \"Lullaby My Liking\", curious General and drunk Mr Dean...Yet, the true embodiment of two worlds and a stimulus for a wonderful analysis are two female characters: Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron) and Kanchi (Jean Simmons). While the former represents unfulfilled desire, the infamous hatred towards obedience, the villain-like fury and the human lust behind bars, the latter one embodies the sexually provocative young orphan who discovers her carnal desires and sends some lustful yet shy looks at the muscled handsome man. While Sister Ruth experiences clear struggles between flesh and spirit, young orphan occurs to represent the unity between flesh and spirit. While Ruth reaches the point of demonic fury, Kanchi reaches the point of mature pleasure. There are some subtle and sensual moments depicting Jean Simmons in the role of this beautiful 17 year-old sweetie of an exotic land, the birdie tamed by the man like the Gubbio wolf tamed by Saint Francis on the embroidery depicted in film.But the most important factor that makes viewing this movie unforgettable is the whole artistic merit. BLACK NARCISSUS embodies greatness on screen due to its splendid cinematography by Jack Cardiff and art direction by Alfred Junge. The Oscar winners can boast of a bravura lavishness and authentic effects. These glorious images are marvelous effects of studio sets, the terrific use of camera angles make it the powerful visual feast. The fact that the Himalayan scenery was all created in the studio and the three strip Technicolor at last shone in fullness of its magnificent possibilities has remained unchanged and undated for all these years. The movie is still enjoyable and stunning. Although the characters change, that aspect never changes...BLACK NARCISSUS is truly a film worth looking for, it contains most of the merits of cinema in general: drama, human dilemmas, captivating story-lines, visual splendor and an up-to-date message: human nature is changeable and not merely ruled by strict conventions.",

            "content": "Thoughts on Black Narcissus:I watched this for the first time the other night, having heard it is one of the Best Movies Ever. Hm. I dunno. I don't do well with melodrama, and this had it in spades. That being said, it's still a very good film, with plenty of good points.First and foremost is Jack Cardiff's brilliant cinematography. His use of color and light is simply astounding. This is, IMHO, far and away the best aspect of the film. I may put it back on my Netflix queue for that alone.The performances are all good, with Deborah Kerr giving a solid performance as Sister Cladagh, the leader of the nuns. The standout performance in my mind, though, came from Kathleen Byron as Sister Ruth, who gradually descends into madness.The story revolves around a group of Anglican nuns sent from their home in Calcutta to establish a church and school in a remote village in the Himalayas. Ironically, the building they are given by the local ruler (\"The General\") for their sanctuary was once the residence of his concubines, and now deserted.The central point of the movie seemed to be that these nuns, used to a cloistered existence, found the world, and worldliness, intruding on them as they lived in this remote outpost in the Himalayas. Sister Cladagh finds her mind turning to the memories of her life before she entered the service of God, and also finds herself being more and more strongly attracted to Mr. Dean, their laiaison with The General, all-around handyman, and the man Sister Ruth, in her madness, has become obsessed with. And Sister Philippa (I think), the gardener among them, finds herself planting ornamental flowers in the convent garden instead of vegetables, as planned. I wish the movie had explored the reasons for these changes a little more, although perhaps the filmmakers intended that to be ambiguous and leave it up to the audience to consider the whys and wherefores.As I said, the movie is strong in the melodramatic department, which detracted from my enjoyment and appreciation, but there were some very strong scenes as well, and some things to consider. One of my favorite parts is when Sister Cladagh is troubled by the presence of the local holy man on the convent ground, and wishes to expel him. This is a man who just sits without speaking and apparently without sleeping, day in and day out. Why does the Sister feel so strongly about him? Is it because the local people venrate him rather than the Christian God, or is it because he leads the ascetic existence that she is unable to find? When she makes her feelings about removing him known to Mr. Dean, he simply replies: What would Jesus have done? That's the end of the argument.Overall this is a good, if not great movie, for me anyway.",

The scenery and cinematography are great, but that on their own is never enough to label a film a masterpiece.The story started interestingly enough, though, ominously, not very compellingly. As the film went out it became duller and duller. The plot degenerated into empty, overstated, melodrama, like a soap opera. Even the climax was clumsy and weak.Not helping all this is David Farrar as Mr. Dean. I found him incredibly irritating, yet he was treated like he was some sort of Adonis.

            "review_title": "White Narcissists",
            "content": "Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger team up to direct \"Black Narcissus\", a lurid psycho-drama about a group of nuns who travel to a remote location in the Himalayas. Once there they set up a school, church and hospital, their intention being to \"tame\", \"civilize\" and \"bring God\" to the people of the Himalayas.The film quickly turns into a erotic melodrama, however, the nuns increasingly seduced by the sensuality of both their surroundings and a character called Mr Dean, a British man who walks about in obscenely tight hot pants. Mr Dean's sexual innuendo laced dialogue, coupled with the seductive Himalayan landscape, eventually causes the nuns great distress, awakening feelings in the women which they've spent their lives suppressing.Powell and Pressburger then go to lengths to point out how the nuns are all \"damaged women\", most joining the Church to escape various personal problems and/or dysfunctions. It's thus no surprise that the nun's desires, their passions, soon come bubbling to the surface. Scripture can't keep a lid on human nature.Pretty soon one nun, a mentally unstable woman called Sister Ruth, goes berserk. She believes the other nuns are conspiring against her and scheming to prevent her from \"being with Mr Dean\". The film then turns into a horror movie in which Ruth prowls the shadows like a monster, vampyric and ghoulish, waiting for the opportunity to strike and kill all those who stand in the way of her wild passions.Unsurprisingly, the film carries itself like a soft core sex movie. Every inch oozes repressed desire, suppressed passions and wild emotions bubbling beneath fragile surfaces. The film is one big tease, which culminates in a \"passionate\" handshake between Mr Dean and a nun at the end of the film. That handshake - a simple moment in which a nun's flesh touches another human being's - oozes electricity.As is typical of Powell and Pressburger, the film's aesthetics are gorgeous. \"Black Narcissus\" is unashamedly hyperreal, bathed in eye-popping colours, lush Technicolor visuals and featuring one gorgeous shot after the next. Legendary cinematography Jack Cardiff worked on the film, and claims to have based the film's style on the impressionistic work of Dutch Baroque painter Johannes Vermeer, but credit must go to Powell as well, who states that with this film and \"Red Shoes\" he hoped to \"break through the constrictions of normal motion picture storytelling\" and \"arrive at a sense of film impressionism\".But the film also sports a metaphysical tone which helps distinguish it from other films which might be termed \"baroque\" or \"impressionistic\". The nuns, for example, at times resemble ghostly apparitions. They're disembodied figures hovering above the ground, and in several scenes seem to partially disappear into pale walls or dark shadows. The film's Himalayan location (filmed entirely on sound stages!) itself conveys a kind of supernatural, ghostly atmosphere, and Sister Ruth's mental breakdown recalls the silent films of Lang and Murnau. She's a Nosferatu-like monster, Powell focusing on her bloodshot eyes, her demonic teeth and frightening gestures. It's a unique looking film.Incidentally, \"Black Narcissus\" was released shortly before India gained independence, so one must place it in the context of all those pseudo-racist Empire films (\"Elephant Boy\", \"Gunga Din\", \"The Drum\" etc) of the time. It exists at the tail end of this trend, however, so already treats the Empire as being in decline and unsalvageable. In other words the film, which ends with the nuns leaving the Himalayas (they're unable to do \"God's work\"), is about the Empire attempting and failing to tame a eroticized and exoticised India. Hence several key sequences, one in which an Indian General (who was previously enamoured by the British) turns his back on the British and embraces instead his native culture, and several in which the nuns are seen to have a doomed relationship with everyone, unable to heal babies, convert locals or do anything of use. Faced with these problems they thus decide to leave the country.The film's elegiac final images, where monsoon rains begin to fall as the nuns leave, therefore take on a covert meaning when looked at in this context. \"Narcissus'\" self-regarding melancholy ignores, as does the rest of the film, the experiences of the Indians themselves. It is self-reflexively a very British-centric film, and ignores the fact that it is the very self-concern and myopia of the British that turned out to have deadly consequences for their former subjects, a legacy of displacement and violent conflict that continues today. This prompts one to ask: Who are the narcissists here? It is this attitude, and the attitude of films like \"Black Narcissus\", which led to David Lean basically remaking this film decades later with \"A Passage of India\". Both \"Passage\" and \"Black\" portray \"natives\" as being childlike, comically vain imitators of the English, dangerously sexual and ominously threatening. But what Lean does is satirises the racist portrayal of \"natives\" such that we understand that we're seeing the world through the warped eyes of the Empire.Comparisons between the films are apt for another reason: both films use sexual attraction to probe the Empire's irrational ideology toward the natives (us pure/dominant, them dirty/subjugated). The central event in both films thus hinges on the lead character (both of whom are sexually repressed women) recognising that her attraction to these people and this country flies in the face of the ideological assumptions of British colonialists. In \"A Passage to India\" this tension is resolved and the lead character rejects her indoctrination. In \"Narcissus\" such a resolution is impossible. The film is simply too close (historically) to the event that haunts it.8/10 \u2013 Martin Scorsese would virtually remake this film with \"The Age of Innocence\".",

I felt a bit disappointed in that I had bought this film on the recommendation of other reviewers. So, I'm here to redress the imbalance of those who have given nothing but praise for this snorefest. The film is filled with camp, over-acting nonsense, especially from Sister Kathleen Byron (Ruth) and caretaker May Hallatt (Angu). They put this film straight into the camp comedy genre. And what a total waste of Jean Simmons - she is coloured in brown and given no dialogue! This is one film that definitely needed some explosions, a car chase and some random nudity. You know, naughty nuns, that sort of thing. Be prepared for a very slow journey with a predictable ending. If you can't guess the ending early on, then may I suggest you go and join your local nunnery as this film has clearly been too over-stimulating. You must have been gripped.

Paintings of orgies adorn the walls of the harem while a Hindu sadhu inside the precinct of the convent irritates the head nun and displays her religious bigotry.This film, with its striking visuals of convent life inside the harem and the tranquil Himalayas is a bit of a gem.

One can make a strong case for it, but because it was so restrained in the story, I never got a sense that Sr. Clodagh, or any of the other nuns were struggling with that aspect of their stay at St. Faith. As for the gorgeous surroundings, the rarefied air, and the constant wind providing distractions, one can see how the group would have had a difficult time adjusting to their environment. Because the Order of the Servants of Mary required an annual renewal of their vows, it was a foregone conclusion that Sr. Ruth (Kathleen Byron) would opt to leave her associates behind for a secular life, and it didn't surprise this viewer that she harbored an uneasy distrust of her new Mother Superior. But her eavesdropping on Sr. Clodagh and Mr. Dean was so obvious that it begged for a more clandestine approach. The confrontation at the top of the bell tower was made all the more ridiculous by the clumsy effort of the film makers to make Sr. Ruth's fall look like an accident. The effect was achieved much better under the direction of Hitchcock a decade later in \"Vertigo\".",

Movies of this period quite often featured a \"native\" like \"Sabu\" the magnificent. They were considered oddities by movie goers then, exotic. Certainly his costumes were. But of course they also needed Whites, dressed up to look \"Indian\" to play major roles, hence Simmons in what is probably her strangest role. But I have to wonder if it is not the fault of the screenplay, not the author which makes this such an uninteresting tale. It seems to be inspired more by Fort Apache (including ominous drum beats) than anything really Indian. She lived in India most of her life and seems to have written well of it. The story of a bunch of nuns (already a dubious subject for me) is ludicrous, offering \"help\" to the locals and the bringing the heathens to a real religion (as opposed to Hinduism -a sort of religion/ social structure over 5,000 years older than Christianity). It's preposterous, but plausible to Brits and Americans who understand nothing of the world, particularity in 1947. And of course it did happen, to no avail. The most gratifying part of the movie is the failure of the nuns as they ride off on their Shetland ponies. But as for entertainment, better to meditate for two hours for intellectual stimulation. The cinematography was good for the time. The costumes and setting were lavish. Amusing that not one part of it was filmed in India, mostly Pinewood studios. And to offset the ringing of the bell by Kerr they presented what was surely Tibetan monks blowing dungchen, not to be found anywhere near Darjeeling, even though it is in the farthest Northern reaches of India. Usually Rank movies are quite good. This was quite a disappointment.",

            "content": "The premise of BLACK NARCISSUS could have easily suited a horror film: a group of nuns stationed in an isolated Himalayan palace start to lose their sense of identity and vocation as they go mad from culture shock and painful memories of their former lives. However, this movie, one of the great achievements of Powell and Pressburger's collaborative period, is a fine spiritual portrait of its characters, erotic without being vulgar, interior without being too static or talky.The nuns are all fully realized figures, most of them not suited to the religious life from the looks of it: SIster Clodagh is vain and proud, while Sister Ruth craves affection and praise. In many ways, both are two sides of the same coin; one could have just as easily been the other in different circumstances. It would be easy to label the conflict between these two as the spirit versus the flesh, but that would imply Clodagh is a symbol of ultimate goodness, which indeed she is not. (Her reactions to the General's \"casual\" talk about Jesus Christ imply she is more interested in looking spiritual and compassionate than truly being so.) This is more than a \"sex and pleasure is bad\" story-- the real villain is pride.Or maybe even that's simplifying matters too much. I saw this movie in high school and just recently saw it again ten years onward. I understand more of the themes and psychology, but even now, I feel there are things eluding me. A few more viewings might make me understand better.That I'm interested in revisiting it at all is the sign that this is a fantastic film. Any movie lover should check it out, even if only for the gorgeous color photography. Only THE RED SHOES rivals BLACK NARCISSUS for such lovely cinematography.",

Eh? Why? The way I see it, if the ones who are supposedly filled with the glorious spirit of Christ are really so moved by their experience, then this, in turn, should be their time of absolute cheer & joyfulness.But, as was the case with these nuns, it was all such a dry and sobering affair that seemed like pure drudgery to me.On top of that downer, this film also feebly attempted to tackle such issues as lunatic madness and erotic fantasies which tormented these nuns, as well.If you to ask me, I thought, right from the start, that these women were quite obviously very badly adjusted to their chosen vocation as apparent servants of god. And it was because of this particular quirk that I'd say Black Narcissus pretty much stretched its plausibility-factor almost to the very breaking point.On the other hand, I will admit that the drab and daunting nature of Black Narcissus was somewhat alleviated by the lush, Technicolor treatment that its story was given.It is surprising to note that this film's exotic setting (which took place within the far-off region of the majestic Himalayas) was, in fact, all created right inside Pinewood Studios, London.*Trivia Note* - Based on Rumer Godden's 1939 novel of the same name, this film's oddball title refers, not to any poetic allusions, but, instead, to the name of a pungent aftershave (imported from England) which the young, vain, Indian prince frequently splashed all over himself.",

This film could very well have been banned by the Church in 1947, however, I found it very interesting and with outstanding acting by all the actors. Deborah Kerr, (Sister Clodagh),\"Eye of the Devil\",'67, was the Mother-Superior, and very young to hold this position among the other nuns. Jean Simmons,(Kanchi),\"How to Make An American Quilt\",'95, played a very young hot to trot gal who wore very pretty nose rings, which must have made a big hit in 1947 in comparison to 2006. There was one nun, Kathleen Byron, (Sister Ruth) who some what loses her composure and acts like she would really like to have Fun. Enjoyable film, but still very strange and mysterious; I can hardly believe it was produced and directed in 1947 on a low budget at the Pinewood Studios in England.",

            "content": "With Powell and Pressburger it always seems to be a beautiful production, and this one is no exception. The colors, lighting, camera angles, framing ... it's all top-notch. The set design which creates the illusion that the mission is on the edge of a cliff in the Himalayas is excellent, and I loved how the walls of the building the nuns us is covered with frescoes depicting nudity and the joys of secular living, having been the residence for a harem previously. Cut off from the world, living on a cliff and in primitive conditions, the little group of five nuns is pushed physically and spiritually to the edge, and all the more so because one of them is mentally disturbed.There are nice performances from both Deborah Kerr (the young nun put in charge) and Kathleen Byron (the troubled nun who slowly unravels). The latter has several terrific moments with a look which is truly scary; it's as if she has a devil inside her. Kerr's character looking back at her life before she became a nun, when she was being courted by a young man, is also a great touch; it humanizes her and adds so much more depth to her character as the film plays out. Less successful is David Farrar (an English expatriate living in the area who helps/taunts the nuns); I think he overplayed his big scene, and should have had a little more clothing on in general.Similarly, the plot is uneven. The dynamic between Kerr and Byron's characters is fantastic, as is their climactic scene, which is full of tension and very well directed. The smaller subplots, including a 17-year-old orphan girl taken in (Jean Simmons in brownface, ugh) and a young man eager to learn (Sabu) feel like filler. If the film had shown us more of the interior thoughts of the five nuns as they struggled along instead it would have been better, and also ratcheted up the tension. As it is, aside from the big moment, I'm not sure I really felt that. There is a goodbye moment that is very nice though, with a glance up at the clouds slowly enveloping the building, followed by a feathery soft handshake and knowing glances, topped off by a cute short-legged pony trying to steal the scene by throwing his head back a couple of times.Lastly, and I can't really escape commenting on this, there is an unfortunate air of superiority pervading the film. The natives are referred to as primitive people who are like children in one scene, and as all looking alike in another, and both by positive characters. The premise, a group of nuns in India there to convert people to Catholicism, is problematic in and of itself, but it's never examined or questioned. There seems to be symbolism in their leaving at a time when Britain was facing the beginning of an era of decolonization all over the world, but it's not in an introspective or reflective way, it comes across as concluding the place was simply too wild, and worse off for them leaving. It's all part of the context and beliefs of the period, but it's just not something I cared for.",

During their tenure however, the surreal setting and the sensuous atmosphere of the place forces them to re-evaluate their vocation.Based on a novel by Rumer Godden, this is a unique film which is that rare combination - artistically, a highly-charged drama with profound spiritual and philosophical themes, and technically, an absolutely dazzling piece of visual craftsmanship. The premise is intriguing - you expect the nuns to encounter hardships of weather or supply shortages, but it is their internal conflicts which really matter; guilt, loneliness, envy, jealousy and above all, longing. There is no female flesh on display at all here and yet the movie is dreamy and sensuous, struck throughout with an erotic undercurrent, and it moves seamlessly from costume drama to psychological study to full-blown Gothic horror for the hair-raising finale. The cast are excellent; Kerr is as fabulous as ever, Ryan is absolutely unforgettable as the doomed Sister Ruth (her performance puts minor-league female psychos like Glenn Close to shame), Sabu is iconic, Hallatt is hilarious, and seventeen-year-old Simmons is incredible as the sexually-charged, wordless native girl Kanchi, one of only a handful of examples of a completely believable performance from a non-ethnic actor (Simmons is from London). What really elevates this film for me however is the masterful direction and the astonishingly brilliant colour photography by Jack Cardiff, who won an Oscar. The story is told in the richest visual terms possible; so much passion is added through lighting, framing, depth of field, effects photography, filters, extreme close-ups and a myriad of superb techniques. The shooting of Ryan in particular is a masterclass in how to use photography effectively to enhance the drama, culminating in an incredible moment where the camera literally becomes her, as her jealousy of Clodagh fizzes and boils in her brain and the screen turns blood red. Exceptional. This is my personal favourite of the many superb movies by the great writer-producer-director team of Powell and Pressburger.",

The way that both Powell and Pressburger direct this movie reminds me of how the Coen brothers would direct their movies only that the Coen brothers movies are much more entertaining. There was a lot of other great performances in this movie from Kathleen Byron as the nun who is really sick of what Sister Clodagh is doing that she gets driven insane, a young Jean Simmons as an Indian teenager known to cause trouble frequently, Flora Robson, Jenny Laird, and Judith Furse as the three other nuns, Sabu (who was famous for playing Mowgli in the 1942 adaptation of The Jungle Book) as the young General, and David Farrar as Mr. Dean a man who would always help the nuns with their work and answer any questions they had for him. The most entertaining part of this movie is one of the final scenes in which you see Sister Clodagh is ringing the bell and then you see Sister Ruth (played by Kathleen Byron) trying to kill her when the attempt fails and especially for my first time ever seeing this film and that scene was the scene in the film that I least expected to happen.

            "content": "If it's fitting that one of their artistic peaks was set in Himalaya, it's still ironic that Powell and Pressburger collaborated so efficiently to portray a collective failure, translating Rumer Godden's love letter to India \"Black Narcissus\" to the chronicle of a doomed mission - for the first time, they didn't work on an original script but they sure knew how to transcend it.Sister Clodagh (Deborah Kerr) is assigned as nun-in-command in the new convent, her Mother Superior (Nancy Roberts) felt she's unfit. Too many forces undermine her mission starting with the elements: the convent is built on the edge of a mountain whose bell dominates a ravine that might have inspired \"Vertigo\". The weather doesn't help, the ceaseless winds are nuisances besides being eloquent metaphors of the nuns' own internal turmoils or the calls of 'nature' that will invade their spiritual confinement.Environment is a crucial place (as it's often the case in Powell's films) but time is no less relevant as the place was inhabited by an ancient king's harem and the walls are still covered with racy paintings that strongly contrast with the nun's austerity. The place is haunted by ghosts from a frivolous past with the little servant Ayah (May Hallatt) reminisces through a weird little dance.The mountains and the weather incarnate an unshakable present and the past -whether expressed in traditions, folklores and colorful clothes- inspire the locals a touch of defiance toward these exotic-looking nuns, if anything the closest to ghosts with all their white uniforms and staid demeanor. A haunting past and a present drowned in countless contrasts make for a rather uncertain -if not bleak- future.On the other hand, there's a young General played by Sabu who wishes to learn, intellectually curious about the peculiarity of the Occidental world, but still attached to his traditions. And there's Jean Simmons as Kanchi, a young and extremely sensual teenager, embracing the 'past' of the place through anl erotic dance that ends up catching the eye of the General. It's their attachment to the reality of the past that builds a converging future for these two.The portrayal of natives is limited to these two characters (discounting a small cameo from Esmond Knight) but there's also the old man, in lotus position, motionless like a Buckingham Palace guard. As unflappable as the mountain, he represents the place of religion that is here to stay and offers the contrast with the nuns in sterile gesticulations. Obviously, he's not the one too many in the place.Sister Clodagh has quite a burden with these nuns whose priesthood is limited to a yearly oath. Fiona Robson is the disillusioned one, Jenny Laird the happy-go-lucky, Judith Furse the most dependable and Kathleen Byron the rebellious loose cannon. But even Sister Clodagh has inner demons she tries to dissimulate under the uniform while her eyes speak the truth. She's given a few flashbacks revealing her failing romance that lead her to the orders like men going to the French legion.But the real test-of-character is David Farras as Mr. Dean: the British argent and their help, the man who fixes things and whose short outfits get more and more revealing of his sexiness, in an all-female film, he's the forbidden fruit. Another piece of irony is that this man is still less out-of-water than the nuns, and since he knows how to make his presence indispensable, he ultimately triggers the deepest impulses within Sister Clodagh and Sister Ruth. You can cut through the tension in that awkward scene where the bare-chested man is towering over them like a totem surrounded by pagans.The sexual tensions increase with the plot and ultimately, the film serves that purpose invoked by the Archers: cinema isn't about escapism, but about showing the naked essence of the truth. Tunics can't hide the eyes and the side glance Sister Ruth gives to Clodagh as the very mention of Mr. Dean says everything. Cardiff knows how to use shadows to enhance the truth-telling intensity of eyes, like a cinematic Vermeer or Rembrandt, he's literally painting Ruth's emotions with the magic of his lighting.And both Cardiff and Powell knew how to use Technicolor, relegated at that time to musicals or epic spectacles. They let sunsets and colorful paintings cheering up the sight, but keeping the predominant white of the nuns as bland as possible, even asking actresses to use clearing lipsticks because their natural complexion kept their lips red and sensual. In a scene where Ruth's uniform is tainted with blood -and Dean is wearing a red shirt- you could see the direction toward more fiery palettes culminating with the startling image of Sister Ruth in normal clothes, (a jump scare in that context) and one of British cinema's most intense moments, simply involving the use of a lipstick.\"Black Narcissus\" is a magnificent illustration of the perpetual battle between what elevates us and what pushes us down the cliff, passion and religion, Eros and Logos, our noble intents and our primitive instincts, what can be controlled and what can't, what moves and what doesn't. At the end, the British nuns leave, coincidentally the very year India got her independence.Call it passion, values, or just fate... if their characters never really knew when they were going, the Archers sure did and on every step of the production: writing, directing, lighting, cutting and even the music drives the climactic scene, foreshadowing its crucial role in their following masterpiece: \"The Red Shoes\".Even my disappointment that the film wasn't shot in location but in Pinewood studios, made me admire them even more: those matte painting made the illusion looked more real than reality, and as the late Bertrand Tavernier said, the film feels more authentic than David Lean's \"Passage to India\".That's it, the greatest trick the Archers ever pulled was to keep a total control on their art while telling story about people who couldn't have control on their lives.",

The color red in \"Narcissus\" was just that effective and striking a memory. Bright red drives Vicki and Ruth to tragic ends.The red under Sr. Ruth's eyes also reminded me of the red color scheme. Powell and Pressburger were masters of color.In Narcissus, the exoticism of red always contrasts very strikingly with the pure white habits of the nuns.Note that Sr. Philippa's apron was light blue, not an exotic or sultry color at all, which leads me on to Kanchi's color scheme. Kanchi was an explosion of extremely intense colors, from her hair decorations, nose jewelry, etc., down to her beautiful clothing. Kanchi was sort of like the Carmen Miranda or Conchita Banana of the time. Kanchi was a sassy little brat, wasn't she?Mr. Dean was one hot daddy, and I'm sure it was all Sister Clodagh could do not to lust after him herself. She had to constantly remind herself, IMO, that she was now married to God and to keep her hands off His earthly male inhabitants. Mr. Dean did not have a striking color statement, but his bare thighs and legs were enough to make him memorable to the viewer and to the nuns, lol.More clothes: The General (Sabu) was stunning in his richly embroidered coats and beautiful accessories.

He'll make you look good on the screen\", but it might be the best advice to give someone starting out in the movie business. Everyone must have been clamoring to be Jack Cardiff's Bff during his long career. An early practitioner of three-strip Technicolor during the 1940s, Cardiff was known as a man who could turn beautiful women into goddesses. Laurence Olivier once declared him to be the finest cameraman in the world. A modest person, Cardiff's talent as a lensman was such that he could take a bad movie (CONAN THE BARBARIAN; RAMBO) and elevate it to mediocrity. However, when he worked with first rate filmmakers such as John Huston and Michael Powell, the result was nothing less than magic.Cardiff's best work was with Powell and Emeric Pressburger, known professionally as The Archers. They were the Gilbert and Sullivan of motion pictures, not because they were accomplished librettists but because, as a working partnership, they brought out the absolute best in each other. On paper The Archers were credited as producers, directors, and writers, but the truth is, Pressburger was responsible for about 90% of the script while Powell called the shots on set. The Forties were their glory period, both during and after the war, gifting us with such artworks as THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP, ONE OF OUR AIRCRAFT IS MISSING, THE RED SHOES, and A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. My personal favorite of theirs is BLACK NARCISSUS.Although set in the Himalayas, not one frame of BLACK NARCISSUS was shot outside of the United Kingdom. All of the interior was filmed at Pinewood Studios while for the exterior scenes, Wales and West Sussex substituted for northeastern India. Because no mountain in the British Isles could compare to the tallest range in the world, Powell used matte paintings as a backdrop. In this capacity, production designer Alfred Junge would be of immeasurable value. His art direction was apparently so convincing that Britons of East Indian or Gurkhan descent, upon viewing BLACK NARCISSUS, honestly believed it was photographed on location in their ancestral land.In casting the natives, Powell and Pressburger chose Caucasian actors, a practice that would definitely raise flags today. Even today, it's difficult to visualize Jean Simmons as a teenage Indian girl. In fact, the only Indian cast member to actually portray one was Sabu, as the young general. To play Sisters Clodagh and Ruth, the Archers chose Deborah Kerr and Kathleen Byron, both of whom had worked with them before on separate projects. And... awkwardly, both actresses had affairs with Michael Powell at some point. But as far as I know, there was no tension between the two women.",

            "content": "Black Narcissus (1947) :Holy theme destroyed by gender attraction and psychological disaster. It's a British film trying to adjust itself in Asian culture but instead destroys the culture and cinema both by fetching Hollywood Romance. 'Nuns carried away by a Charming Man', if this sentence makes any sense to you then you are in for this show. After opening a convent in the Himalayas, five nuns encounter conflict and tension - both with the natives and also within their own group - as they attempt to adapt to their remote, exotic surroundings. One of them falls for a charming man and decides to quit the order, two of them likes the same man but to recalls thier fascinating old days before taking the order and rest two of them are working fine according to their responsibility. The concept itself was wrong that nothing could have saved it especially if you care about the purity of it's theme. So it didn't really matter if all the actors put efforts and director tried making it a good on screen spectacle. I am not catholic and don't know much about Nun's life but i know that you can't show them piss up each other just because of temporary gender attraction while thier permanent lives were devoted to the services and was chosen by themselves. Deborah Kerr, Kathleen Byron look beautiful and David Farrar keeps the Machoism alive but it would been great if they had acted better. Supporting cast is average and unnoticeable whereas Jean Simmons looks elegant as always. Powell and Pressburger's direction couldn't save the dead script and even thier efforts didn't look enough to carry it. The beginning is slow, the conflicts come in disaster way and even the climax doesn't feel effective i mean overall its strictly an average stuff. Despite subtle thoughts on display through nature Black Narcissus couldn't convince me with the story so it goes as waste of time for me.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest",

            "content": "From directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger (A Matter of Life and Death, The Red Shoes), I remember seeing this much acclaimed British film once before, but obviously not paying attention and not understanding what was going on, another viewing definitely helped. Basically, a new convent in the Palace of Mopu, near Darjeeling, far in the Himalayas, is being established. Young but stern Sister Clodagh (The King and I's Deborah Kerr) has been made superior, to be dispatched with four other Anglican nuns to set up a school and hospital for the local people. It is a difficult journey, and the old building sits near the edge of a high plummeting cliff. Their new home was also formally occupied by a religious brotherhood many years ago before they left due to mysterious circumstances, but they soldier on. Sister Clodagh and the other four nuns, mentally unstable Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron), Sister Philippa (Flora Robson), Sister Honey (Jenny Laird) and Sister Briony (Judith Furse), manage to establish a good school and infirmary. The Young General (Sabu) attends the school keen to learn new things, and his agent Mr. Dean (David Farrar) warns them that the atmosphere of the mountain does strange things to people, and if anyone gets ill, the Sisters will be blamed by the people. Slowly, the warning by Mr. Dean does indeed come true to life, as Sister Clodagh, on her first assignment as Sister Superior, has memory flashes. These memories are of her days when she was not a nun and in a failed romance in Ireland. Of course, Sister Ruth is most effected, becoming increasingly jealous of Clodagh and obsessed with Mr. Dean. Sister Ruth eventually has a nervous breakdown and gives up her habit and religious vows. A subplot sees the Young General, heir to the throne of a princely Indian state, infatuated with lower caste dancing girl Kanchi (Jean Simmons), but it is unclear whether they can be together or not. Sister Ruth has a complete mental breakdown and tries to kill Sister Clodagh, when she is ringing the bell on the edge of the cliff. In the struggle, Sister Ruth falls off the cliff to her death. The nuns realise that the mountain has got to all of them, and they leave. Clodagh's final request to Mr Dean being to tend Ruth's grave. Also starring Esmond Knight as The Old General. Kerr gives a terrific leading performance as the pressured lead nun, Farrar does well, Simmons is beautiful, and Byron almost steals the show as the dangerously mental eye-rolling nun. I can agree the plot is a little sleepy at times, but with the darker and melodramatic scenes featured, a great script and magnificent use of colour, this is most watchable classic drama. The title by the way is based on The Young General wearing a fragrance called Black Narcissus. It won the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction - Set Decoration, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Cinematography. Deborah Kerr was number 27 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 9 on Britain's Finest Actresses, and the film was number 18 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die.

            "review_title": "If environment alone can cause sexual madness, it's easy to see why priests become pedophiles",
            "content": "The madness in this movie, as portrayed by Sister Ruth, is the best acting I have ever seen for this condition. It's too bad the actress could not be successful in Hollywood because she was typecast into playing only neurotic women. It certainly gives us insight into why so many priests, otherwise good men, have fallen so low as to abuse small boys. If a lush environment, so brilliantly built on a set in London, can drive nuns mad, it's easier to understand how the abnormal state of celibacy can do that to young men, arrested at the very age when their sex drives are the strongest.Deborah Kerr does an excellent job as the equally repressed Mother Superior, who learns that to be in her position, she must serve others. And indeed she does, sitting with the insane nun through the night, even though it's obvious that the woman is about to do something drastic to herself or to others. The effect of the beauty of the castle high in the Himalyans is sufficient to drive one mad, and the others to increasingly higher states of agitation, which is somewhat difficult to understand. It's easier to believe that the privation on these English nuns of being in a primitive land, with only basic medical skills to treat a suspicious native population, would be enough to drive them back to relative normalcy in India.When the baby dies, the die is cast. The people refuse to attend school, and such was obviously the case with the monks who had tried to gain in foothold high in the mountains at this palace years before. We are never given to understand why Mr. Dean is there, a handsome David Farrar. The commentary indicates that he turned his back on acting several years later and Mr. Powell seems to admire him for it. He may have quit after seeing himself looking ridiculous on those small ponies, in those short shorts.Nonetheless, he's very sexy and the scene where he turns Jean Simmons over to the nuns is palpable with chemistry. Having several similar scenes with Deborah Kerr, especially when you understand WHY she is a nun, the movie shows remarkable restraint when the director does NOT allow a passionate kiss at the end. Just a handshake, with her hand turned upward, interestingly enough.This movie has been given rave reviews for how much could be suggested with a combination of painted sets and a few bamboo plantings in the Pinewood Studios. Indeed, those artists should have received the same Academy awards the cinematographer and director did. The lighting indeed gave a more eerie Gothic feel to the old castle at night. The climatic scene in which the mad nun vibrating with fury, slashes on her bright lipstick while Kerr starts reading the Bible, is unforgettable.The scriptwriter did an excellent job as well, injecting humor as Shakespeare would have him do, to give a little relief from the building tension. Knowing that the little boy translator was an Indian that Powell 'picked up at the London docks' along with the other extras, made his acting even more impressive. With none of the technological tricks that modern movie makers have, Powell created a work of art and a movie for the ages. Come to think of it, the range of electronic tricks, the CGI fakery, that directors have to call upon today probably prevent them from substituting excellent writing and great set design to create lasting art, instead of movies for non-discriminating kids. At least, they divert them from focusing on what could make a story idea sparkle and impress.",

I would agree completely with this assessment. I had no idea that color could look so good in the 1940s, and in many ways it looks better than it does today.The film's themes are also good. Some have said it is about \"nuns and lust\", but not in the sense that was made popular in the 1970s.

My mother (God bless her) noticed in the newspaper that a movie premiere was scheduled one night...a movie no one ever heard of...but would my sister and I like to go? Would we!? (after reading who was expected to show up). I was about to enter the 8th grade, my sister 4 years older, were dropped off at the gorgeous Cathay Circle in Hollywood early afternoon to wait for the beginning, sometime around 7:00 PM. Sat in the bleachers with several hundred other fans for those hours. I will never forget the first to arrive....Mickey Rooney and Ava Gardner. I see by the dates on IMDb that they'd been divorced by then, but she hadn't yet met Artie Shaw. Guess they were just escorting each other...but what an entrance! Everyone was there as this premiere was promoted to 'introduce' Deborah Kerr to her American audience. All I remember about Kerr was Hedda Hopper dragging her around from person to person with fancy intros. Van Johnson, Esther Williams, June Allyson, Judy Garland, Robert Taylor, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Davis...oh, and, Jimmy Cagney...need I say more? What a night. Please remember, movie fans, that in those days...stars were seldom seen anywhere. Would you turn around for a second look at Brad Pitt? I sure wouldn't. When I returned to my small home town in Washington State, no one would believe my good luck.Just wondering if anyone else was there...who reads this stuff. Were you? Well, I first saw this movie the other night on TCM...first time. No need to comment further...I assume the other stars of this movie were at the premiere...but my eyes were glued to Van Johnson most of the time.The cinematography is so incredibly gorgeous...and what set these colors off and were enhanced by...were those lovely, flowing, soft white nuns' habits.

            "review_title": "a melodrama that crackles with vitality decades on",
            "content": "Perhaps embarrassing to say, I've finally come to Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberger, the writer/director duo behind classics like this, Tales of Hoffman, the Red Shoes, and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (this despite knowing for a few years already that they were a primary influence on Scorsese, one of my favorites). This film, which I picked up almost by accident at the library, exceeded my expectations, if only as a 'period piece' In all, Black Narcissus, about a group of nuns who go to a secluded Parish in the Himilayas, each Nun experiencing, for better or worse, the startling, picturesque, and affecting atmosphere of these people, is a film that could only be made by these filmmakers, who have such a control over the style and characters that it often flows like music.Even if you don't go for the performances (and I do mean melodrama in the 'old-school' sense, not to sell short the term melodrama as something less than regular drama), the visual aspect of the film is worth it. Jack Cardiff, who was one of the early British experimenters with Technicolor, provides Powell and Pressberger a plethora of painting with lighting, and with textures. This is the day before the real visual delights were all up to the cinematographers and the director, and here there are examples with colors on the clothes of characters, on the sets (yes, they are all sets), and especially in the enclosed rooms made of brimstone (there is one scene where the use of yellows and oranges and different types of hues is enough to want to hang it next to impressionist paintings). Cardiff, in ever deserved for it, won his Oscar for his work here, and if you love just simply the (right) usage of the early Technicolor process, this is for you subject matter otherwise.But in terms of acting, going back to that, it helps that the performances are convincing enough, and sometimes even haunting. Deborah Kerr is a strong presence as the head Nun Sister Clodaugh, who wants to see her mission through to its strongest point, for these people to survive rightfully within the realm of the Lord. There are also other effective supporting performances, but none more everlasting than Kathleen Byron as Sister Ruth. She, to me, is a character that is a little more for the audience to identify with in a way; the one who had her faith beside her at the start, and yet found herself in a downward spiral with her faith. In the last twenty or so minutes of the film, I really got the most interest out of the film subject-matter wise; her turn makes what could've been cheesy and over-the-top into something special. The make-up, and her expressions and movement and reactions to those around her, practically qualify her for this to be her best performance (and I say this having seen little if any of her other work). It's always something to see the character of good turn to doubt then to evil, and this is something indeed.In short, whether your catholic or not, if you love cinema, Black Narcissus deserves one chance. It may be 'dated' for some, which is fine, and maybe the subscribed melodrama may not be everyone's cup of tea. But if you give yourself to the film, to let Cardiff and Powell and Pressberger show you what they got, it may also be very rewarding.",

It has a terribly condescending attitude towards the \"native\" population which is shown in a mumbo-jumbo kind of way, made worse by English actresses playing the roles of Angu Ayah and Kanchi. Farrar's character, wearing shorts, half open shirt and sandals in a convent at 8000 feet, is ridiculous. Kerr's sister Clodagh, whose background and managerial skills are an obvious recipe for disaster, is unconvincing.

In fact it's probably far less realistic, but it does, somehow, still seem to charm.It is a much grittier look at life as a Nun and the rigours of attending a foreign flock in the 1930's, whether they wanted to be tended to or not.There is danger and darkness from within and without, but nothing so terrifying as to make it that exciting for the most part. Which is a shame, because it had potential. I wonder if the TV mini series (2020) made better use of the storyline in that respect, but I won't rush to watch it based on this one.OK, I'll be honest, Nun's aren't my thing (I don't like monks either, although Christian Slater was quite hot in 'The Name Of The Rose') and religion winds me up, so this was never going to be a high scorer for me unless the story was really poignant and hard hitting and it's not, but yet there is still that charm that I mentioned. Perhaps it is David Farrar's beautiful eyes or perhaps it's his big manly chest? Because I am actually just that shallow. Who can say? Not me, but it does feature on the BFI (British Film Institute) top 100 British films list, so there must be something there.From reading the trivia, it seems that they've actually done a fantastic job with the making of this film. The sets, back drops, Etc are very good for the time and the actors do a fair job with the exception of May Hallatt as Angu Ayah, who is far too over the top and quite cringey to watch.So it's not really my type of film and a bit slow to get in to it. I would have liked to have seen more of the set up of the new nunnery maybe as a point of interest to give the beginning of the film some grounding and some actual thing to watch. There's a lot of talk about \"What shall we do?

            "review_title": "A visually gorgeous existential drama that left me a bit disappointed !!!",
            "content": "'Black Narcissus' was my first foray into the illustrious filmography of the legendary British filmmaking duo Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The screenplay written by them is based on a novel of the same name written by Rumer Godden. The film is about a group of nuns who are sent to start a Christian convent in the beautifully exotic Himalayas.First I will comment about what I loved in the film. Without a doubt, the film looks absolutely gorgeous. The colours on the screen are visually vibrant and also thematically expressive. There are certain shots like Sister Ruth looking down the cliff while ringing the bell in the convent or the sequence of Kanchi dancing in the huge hall room which will stay with me forever. I had always heard that Powell and Pressburger made visually captivating films with the help of the Oscar winning cinematographer Jack Cardiff and watching this film just confirms those claims in my mind. Although the film has a very theatrical and operatic tone to it, Powell and Pressburger used a lot of subtle touches in their storytelling to accentuate some of the themes that are being explored. I also loved Deborah Kerr as the sister superior Sister Clodagh. I think a big theme being dealt with in the film is false pride. The convent and its nuns think that they will be able to control their new surroundings and the natives. This is expressed in a subtle way when Sister Clodagh orders the removal of a picture on the wall of a room in the palace which portrayed people having fun and being mischievous. To some extent this pride aspect can be seen to be a bit of a commentary on the philosophies of the Imperial British empire. Although they go to the Himalayas and strive to help the natives and educate them, their latent racist opinions and condescending demeanor is very noticeable. The natives are given the tag 'unreasonable children'. This pride also gets established in the fact that the convent itself is located at a very high altitude towering above the homes of the natives. Dean and the Holy Man are two important characters. Dean is someone who lives a carefree life without obeying any customs or rituals, while the Holy Man has completely given himself up to nature and 'God' and has distanced himself from everything earthly. Sister Clodagh actually gets irritated by both these mentioned characters and actually says that the sisters shouldn't allow themselves to become like either one of them. But in the end we see that not only do the sisters confront failure in trying to assert themselves in this new environment,instead it is the environment that gets the better of them and forces them to face their genuine desires, the ghosts of their past and their inner struggles.Now, I will shift to the aspects that didn't work for me. Firstly it is constantly spelled out by the characters in the film that this new environment is changing them, but I didn't get why. Never did I ever see why this new environment was having an adverse effect on the psyche of the sisters. Sister Philippa is a character that we are supposed to sympathise with, but it was a character that remained extremely underdeveloped in my opinion. Another thing that really didn't work for me was the acting by the actors playing the native characters. We see them using this stereotypical 'Indian accent' that Westerners associate Indians with and it gets a bit annoying after a while and the acting by these actors also gets very amateurish at times.So 'Black Narcissus' is a film that has a number of great aspects, but it unfortunately failed to bowl me over as a whole. I was greatly impressed by the visuals and certain aspects of the direction. But I also thought certain characters and themes remained underdeveloped and the acting from the actors playing the native characters became almost insufferably bad at times. Not the best way to start my exploration of Powell and Pressburger's work, but there are certain aspects of this film which irrespective of the negatives make me interested in further exploring them as filmmakers.",

            "content": "While the title of this film may confuse you, Black Narcissus is actually a very strong story about faith, perseverance, and sanity. We begin our story by learning that an order of Anglican Nuns have obtained the ability to open a school and hospital in the Himalayas. The ruling Sister has given the task of running it to Sister Clodagh and four other sisters who will have the duties of building this sanctuary from the ground up. The building is there, they just need to bring the residents and create a sense of beauty around the \"palace\". The Sisters are chosen for their different abilities. One for her planting abilities, one for her kindness, one for her medical skills, and one that is chosen to be changed. It is up to Sister Clodagh (played well by Deborah Kerr) to help bring this Sister back into the open arms of Jesus. So, together they set off for their new home. When the arrive, they find that they are overwhelmed with work. The natives are coming in swarms to visit the hospital and also the school. They have arrived so quickly that the Sisters haven't even had enough time to set up a proper facility. Not only do they have this going against them, but the Sisters also find that the living habits on the mountain are horrendous. The wind blows everyday, the water is not purified, and they are in such a higher altitude that all the work that they do tires them out faster. Also, with all this work comes sores and sicknesses. Add another element to this environment and you begin to see the Sisters cracking down under the pressure. This element is stress. In the final riveting scene we watch as it is a battle between good and evil, our two protagonists fighting stress and insanity, one will not make it until the morning. Whoever does will have a tough road before them because the Sisters will leave the \"palace\".What a powerful film. I would first like to begin with talking about the colors used in this film. Why? Outside of the title, it is the most important element in the film. The colors that directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger use set the scene for many parts during the film. For example, the use of the white garbs by the Nuns represent their purity and devotion to good. It is only until Sister Ruth disrobes from the gowns and puts on a deep red dress that we know she has left her good behind. Red is another powerful color in this film. It is used to show anger, to show death, to show insanity, and even a moment of passion. The use of colors is not just by coincidence. They are being used almost as a co-star to the film. They are being used to drive a message deeper to the viewer.Was it a film about religion, or more importantly about seclusion? The Sisters were not really secluded from other people, their seclusion comes from inside of them. Most of the scenes when the Sisters are not helping the villagers are shown with the Sisters spending time alone. This cannot be good for the soul. It is interesting because right before Sister Clodagh leaves the main sanctuary, the head Sister tells Clodagh that she feels that she is not ready for the job at hand. The head Sister says that Clodagh is too \"lonely\". With Sister's surround her at all times, how can this be? I learned later that they were referencing the heart. So, as I continued to watch this film, I began to see that it was not a film about religion (while there were elements to it ... for example not removing the priest from the mountain), but about the sanity of humans. Each one of these Sisters lose a bit of their sanity by keeping to themselves and not interacting more with each other. Overall a very powerful film that will capture your mind and make you explore the intense nature of colors, humanity, and friendship.Grade: **** out of *****",

            "content": "If not the most beautiful Technicolor film ever made (yes I say \"ever\") then certainly the most ambitious. Shot entirely at Pinewood Studios in England, the film features some of the most stunning and convincing matte paintings ever produced. The entire Himalayan setting is a falsehood, but such a luscious and beautiful falsehood it is. This is the epitome of movie trickery\u2014and all done without the help of a computer.A ridged, yet inexperienced Anglican nun called Sister Clodaugh, played mercilessly by Deborah Kerr, is appointed Sister Superior of a new convent high in the Himalayan Mountains at a sight known as St. Faith. So off she and her other five or six sisters go into this forbidden palace. But there's something in the air up there; how the wind blows day and night, and how the air is so clean and crystal clear, and how an unnerving Holy Man sits upon the mountain perpetually staring into the intimidating white hills. Almost at once, Sister Clodaugh senses something is not quite right. At first she blames it upon the local nuisance, a carefree Englishman played by David Farrar, but soon she learns something far more enigmatic and sinister haunts the mountains, and neither she nor her companions have any power to stop it. It is a wonderfully atmospheric tale of the struggle to control the world around us. In many cases we may succeed, but ultimately there is always something greater than ourselves willing to beat us.I have to say, I'm not exactly sure what Black Narcissus is about. It is about many things. It's about faith, and how fragile it is. It's about the struggle of life and death. It is about the dangers of worldly pleasures, and the risk we take when we indulge them. But still, it is hard to pinpoint the ultimate theme of the film. Maybe it is meant to be like the mountains in which the Sisters dwell\u2014always beautiful and alluring, but also sinister and twisted. It's a delectable film, full of rich characters and stunning photography. There is a particular scene in which Sister Clodaugh is ringing the morning bell to announce that the convent is \"open for business\". The bell stands directly on the face of a cliff, just before a sheer, possibly thousand-foot drop into the wilderness below. Of course absolutely none of it is real. There's no drop, no dizzying fall. Yet the matte painting used to simulate the effect is so real and dazzling, that we feel the effect as if we were actually there. It makes us dizzy to watch from above as Sister Clodaugh rings that bell, praying that she won't go tumbling to her death below.All this trickery is the work of art director Alfred Junge, and genius cinematographer Jack Cardiff (both, by the way, won Academy Awards). The way Cardiff sets up his shots, and the angles at which he shoots the vast faux vistas creates a richly elaborate universe in which to dwell. It all seems so dream-like and yet very real. Never before or after was Technicolor used to such a beautifying degree. Often, the system either over-saturated or blended the contrasting colors. The colors in Black Narcissus are appropriately basking in rich colors, but not so much as it to become a gimmick. Instead it is just a brilliant nuance that is hardly noticeable until you step back and think about it. The atmosphere created by these three elements (production design, cinematography, and Technicolor) is a dark, chilling, mystifying atmosphere, full of forbidding and foreboding. The picture lives in a world reminiscent of Rembrandt and Vermeer and Van Gough. A beautiful contrast of dark versus light and an exploration into the world of color as has never been matched, even by such films as The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind.As the film thunders along in its flurry of emotions, one particular performance stands out. Of course, Deborah Kerr is excellent and perfectly cast, but the performance I wish to illuminate is much darker and wicked. It is British actress Kathleen Byron as the half-mad, over ambitious Sister Ruth. Byron is simply brilliant and, although in a supporting role, carries most of the emotional weight of the movie (which is quite a substantial amount). It's one of those subtle performances. Not an obvious acting job like Warren Beatty in Bonnie and Clyde. No, this is subtle and unique, even though the whole film is a melodrama. Byron's madness and frightfulness is kept at bay until the very end as it should be. Nothing is there initially, but the performance blossoms into one of the most chilling and effective portrayals I have ever seen. The rest of the supporting cast does well enough, highlighted by an old caretaker of the mountain palace played by May Hallat. It's a classic 1940s performance. Sort of a crazy old woman who, like everyone must at some point, has been turned insane by the mountain's atmosphere.Ahhh, this is one of the most ambitious, imaginative, and spectacular films I have ever seen. But it is not meant to be at all. It is subtle and subdued, despite the Technicolor and the melodrama and the astounding production design. It has every mark of an epic, thunderous, enormous film in the style of The Ten Commandments or The Sound of Music, but it somehow avoids such delusions of grandeur. Black Narcissus is everything a movie has to be. Deep, touching, moving, and above all emotionally exciting. It is very exciting to be sure. Although the story is not necessarily on full of action and big adrenaline pumping rampages, the film manages to pull of a different kind of thrill. The thrill of the chilling mountain air, the thrill of being high above the world, the thrill of the wind blowing against your face as you slowly, yet noticeable loose your mind.www.colewebbharter.com",

At least that's one of the two things in this film that can pass as dramatic: that and the natives of the village struggling with a sickness that is going around.The climax of the film has nothing to do with the latter, and is heavily invested in the idea that one of the nuns is choosing to leave this group of nuns because she can't suppress her sexuality. I say good for her, making her own decisions. Why does she NEED to stay, why must the other Sisters feel obligated to \"save\" her? Maybe that is just my view on religion though - I never liked the idea of imposing your religious beliefs or practices on others since religion is a faith, not a certainty.The rest of the movie is extremely slow, focusing on the Sisters' process of creating a school for the children of the community they visit. This film looks good aesthetically, but it tries too much to dramatize something that I do not find dramatic.",

            "content": "Inexplicably, I saw this film only recently in spite of having known about it and the novel for years. It was much talked about fifty years ago and apparently has captured many fans in the meantime. My disappointment upon viewing it is therefore perplexing in that I wanted to like it better than I did in the event, and I kept waiting for more as the story developed from one dropped element to another.The fact is that, when compared to the books and films made by or for the likes of E.M. Forster, James Hilton, and even Rudyard Kipling, this is very small potatoes indeed. The juxtaposition of East with West, high Himalayas with jungle, Islamic with Hindu, and Christian with Satanic borders on ludicrous, especially given the melodramatic anxieties vested in almost every scene. This is not the work of a great or even passably good director. The actors are not to blame; they are obviously trying their best to deal with what was probably in its inception a rather coherent literary treatment. I suspect disconnections between writers, photographers, producers, and directors whenever I encounter this sort of failure.Melodrama in films made in the first half of the twentieth century is common. What differentiates Black Narcissus from -- to cite a similar story -- Rain by Somerset Maugham is how the latter incorporates a tight and intense conflict in both story and film. The former is on the other hand all over the map, as beautiful and visually mesmerizing in its filmed version as it may be.Maybe Andrew Lloyd Webber could do something with this film. Or has a musical version already been tried?",

            "content": "Powell and Pressburger's \"Black Narcissus\" (1947) is a classic \"men on a mission\" film ala \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" or \"The Guns of Navarone\" except with the twist that the elite commando team is comprised of female nuns. At the beginning, the crack team is assembled by an elderly general -- err, a Reverend Mother -- and given an impossible mission. Their suicidal objective? To trek to a fortified citadel perched on a matte-painted cliff, create a nunnery, and convert the fearsome savages of Mopu.The fiery-haired Clodagh (Deborah Kerr) is the fearless yet stiff-necked team leader; Briony (Judith Furse) is \"the strong man\" who can theoretically bend an iron bar in her teeth and also functions as their field medic; Honey (Jenny Laird) is the affable second-in-command who can adroitly liaison with the locals; Philippa is \"the old hand\" whose expert knowledge of fieldcraft -- in this case, gardening -- enables their survival. Of course, Ruth (Kathleen Byron) is the unreliable one, the weakest link in the chain, whose personal failings may or may not threaten their well-being at a critical moment. Along the way, our intrepid team of heroes encounters untrustworthy characters such as the womanizing Dean (David Farrar) whose allegiances and motives remain suspect. Much like the similar archetype of Anna in \"The Guns of Navarone,\" Kanchi (Jean Simmons) is the exotic femme fatale whose unexpected appearance creates the usual complexities. As the mission proceeds, flashbacks and conversational snippets gradually reveal the sordid or tragic pasts of the various team members. The team leader, Clodagh, is not a humble teacher like Tom Hanks in \"Saving Private Ryan,\" but has a slightly more colorful history. As in the latter film, doubts emerge as to the mission's usefulness. Morale falls. Quarreling ensues. Of course, as in every \"men on a mission\" film, one of the team must be outed as a traitor of sorts. An individual must defy specific orders and thus endanger everyone else, as well as the mission itself. In this case, the \"mission\" refers to more than their objective, but the convent as well.Overall, this a highly entertaining film and tremendously benefits from the color photography by Jack Cardiff, as well as the adept directorial skills of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. Without a doubt, one of the sparkling gems of British cinema.",

At the Covent sister, now Mother Superior, Clodagh meets the person thats a liaison between her and the villagers Englishman Mr. Dean, David Farrar. Mr. Dean for some strange reason is very unfriendly towards her and here fellow sisters of the church. Mr. Dean feels that the cold windy and desolate Himlayas isn't the place for Nuns to to be and that in the end its, the mountains, unfriendly environment and the clash of cultures between the Nuns and the villagers would only lead to disaster for them. It turns out later that Mr. Dean was only half right; the disaster that that befell the nuns at Saint Faith had more to do with him and his attraction to one of the Nuns Sister Ruth,Kathleen Byron, then to the high and eerie mountain range and unfamiliar culture and customs of the people of Mopu. We learn during the film \"Black Narcissus\"that Mother Clodagh suffered a heart-breaking loss early in her life back in Ireland. The man that she was in love with left her when he moved to America leaving her both hurt and alone. What was even more hurtful then that was he didn't even know, or care, of the deep feelings that she had for him. Trying to forget that sad event in her life Clodagh became a Cathloic Nun and rose to become the youngest Mother Suprior in her Covent. Now here in the wilds of the Himlayas she meets and is somehow attracted to a man who reminds her of her lost love back in Ireland years ago. What at first to Mother Clodagh was just an slight attraction becomes to another member of her Covent an obsession who madly falls in love with the handsome and rugged Mr. Dean and, unlike Mother Clodagh,can't suppress or control her feeling about him. In the end it would become the tragedy that would force her, and the remaining Nuns, to leave the Covent Saint Faith for good. Just like Mr. Dean first told her that they would:Until and before the rains break.Breathtaking and touching as well \"Black Narcissus\", named after a perfume sold in war-time London,is more about lost and forbidden love then religion and foreign customs and cultures like you would have first expected it to be. Besides Deborah Kerr David Farrar and Kathleen Byron a grown-up Sabu and a teenage Jean Simmons are sweet and touching as the young general and the peasant girl Kagchi. Unwanted and without anyone to look after her the young general, who at first took pity on Kagchi, fell in love with her and in the end refused to whip her for stealing a brass necklace, from the Covent.

The dazzling new print at the National Film Theatre last week plays its part in increasing its reputation. The backdrops create a strange, static, fairy-tale atmosphere. And yes, I guess a sense of ludicrousness is not very far away in this tale of sexual repression in nuns - I think that Powell and Pressburger have built that into the attitudes of Mr Dean and Angu Ayah to the good sisters. But of course, it isn't interested in the cheap jibes about sex (or lack of it) in convents: it's about the power of desire in all of us, and the various strategies we use to deal with it. It's a universal theme, nowhere more powerfully presented than in the gripping performance of Kathleen Byron, praised countless times and praised again here. Her final entrance - pale as zombie, only her eyes alive with her passionate hate - actually drew gasps from the audience, which I expect included many who had seen the film before. And there are many other goodies: Jean Simmons and her sensuous dancing; May Hallatt, fabulously over-the-top; Judith Furse, with her stoic dignity; Nancy Roberts' Mother Superior - stony at first, but suddenly compassionate when talking of the wayward Sister Ruth; Flora Robson - a unique blend of heartbreak and humour; the costumes - brilliant work from Hein Heckwroth; as well as the already much-honoured work of Cardiff, Junge, Kerr, Easdale, and the Archers themselves.

Directors Michael Powell and Emeric Presburger, Screenplay Rumer Godden, Based On The Novel By Rumer Godden Released in 1947, British director team Powell and Pressburger's \"Black Narcissus\" was their first big hit, earning the film two Oscars. This was the time they enjoyed their greatest success. \"The Red Shoes\" was to follow. In Black Narcissus, Debora Kerr portrays Sister Clodagh, a young nun who is given a difficult task. She will serve as Mother Superior to a convent of nuns where they will work in a remote mountain village in the Himalayas, in a lush and beautifully strange, exotic half-Hindi land, where people live with nature and don't fight their own nature. Debora Karr's performance is absolutely brilliant. Dramatically willing herself into becoming the character of a nun who used to live a secular life, complete with the prospect of marriage and children, she becomes a nun after her life does not turn out how she expected it. We are able to get into Sister Clodagh's skin and see her memories, which reveal her to be a human being like any other. She maintains self-control and appears icy throughout the film when compared to the other Sisters who find it difficult to resist the temptations of the beautiful territory. Flora Robson as Sister Phillipa is an equally strong, if not stronger performance. She harbors feelings for the ruggedly handsome and adventurous Mr. Dean (David Farrar) who is British and oversees the work in the village. While it's also clear Sister Clodagh has feelings for him and all the other repressed nuns, Sister Clodagh is resolved to stick to the duties of their Order. But gradually, passions take over and grow dangerous. Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron in a great performance) becomes jealous of their Mother Superior like one sister would be jealous of a more successful sister and their psycho-sexual crisis boils over in that climatic scene on top of the mountain cliff where Sister Ruth attempts to kill the Mother Superior. Eventually the nuns leave the mountain village. Jean Simmons, 17 at the time, plays Kanchi, a beautiful wild child from the village. Sabu, a popular Hindi actor of his time, is the Young General who seeks to learn Catholicism with the Sisters, attempts to be an ascetic but is irresistibly drawn to Kanchi. The real strength, however, and this is something every critic can agree with, is not just the fine cast of actors but in its glorious Technicolor cinematography. First of all the Himalayan location may be a matte painting but it's so beautiful and sensuously colored. It's a riot of blue skies, white-grey mountains and emerald green pastures. There is a persistent wind through the film, and whether it's artificially produced or naturally produced, it serves as a terrific symbol for the winds of invisible passions and tensions between the nuns. There are several key scenes where darker or more intense shades of color and lighting are absolutely necessary for the mood and progression of the film, especially in the night scenes and most notably in the last part of the film. The art direction of this film was supposedly inspired by Vermeer paintings of women in still settings and the chilling Bell Tower scene is straight out of a Gothic horror romance. While the film may at first appear like a simple, uncomplicated story about nuns who come to work and pray in a \"pagan\" site (the House of Women or a harem palace) but it becomes darker and layered with psychological, nature-and-man relations. In fact, Sister Ruth's mental breakdown is so strong, and the way the film looks at this point is so dark and haunting it appears as if Alfred Hitchcock had taken over as director!! The final scene in which the nuns leave the Himalayans is another winner. This was a wonderful film and probably Powell and Pressburgeer's greatest cinematic achievement.",

On the other hand, first-run pristine prints cast from the original negative tend to blend colors more smoothly, more lushly, more sumptuously, resulting in a more romantic, idyllic view of the subject.Realistic transfers have the disadvantage of bringing out detail so much that studio-painted backdrops and matte finishes become obvious, compared with those originals which projected images as lovely, picturesque and romantic settings.Thus, while one may thrill to the razor sharp realistic imagery, one may also long for the more lush, idyllic, romantic renderings.  The later was the expressive style of the original \"Black Narcissus,\" a truly breathing work, which earned it's reputation as \"one of the most beautiful color films ever made.\" This reputation was not fashioned by the restored print.The same observations can be made for such restored \"classics\" as \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Gone With the Wind.\" In both cases the magnificence of the Technicolor process of the 40s was tempered in the restoration by the stark and sharp technology of the 90s and 00s.  The point here is that, despite the latest technological ingenuity, the ideal in film restoration has yet to be reached.  The objective is not to improve upon the original by enhancement, but to seek to bring out its qualities by paying homage.",

Accompanied by a rather curious collection of nuns - Flora Robson, Jenny Laird, Judith Furse and Kathleen Byron, they must combat the elements and their plentiful demons to make their project function - none of this is aided by the presence of the enigmatic David Farrar who seems to bring out the best and worst in both Kerr and the first-class Byron as \"Sister Ruth\" who treads a fine line between sanity and an almost demonic despair. The story addresses many of the issues of post-colonial India, of poverty, malnourishment, illiteracy and Christianity - amongst those who believe and those who want to - and tests the faith of each of the women in differing, potent, ways. Look out for a super performance from May Hallatt as the slightly demented caretaker they call \"Auntie\" who dishes out brutality and sagely wisdom is equal, haphazard, measure.

            "content": "Black Narcissus is one of the finest examples of mastery of the art form and it's magical qualities in film history. Seductive, suspenseful and filled with eroticism with a group of Catholic nuns as central characters it is a subversively beautiful film with an epic look and feel that was mostly created within the confines of a film studio. To the dismay of her Superior, young and inexperienced Sister Clodagh (Deborah Kerr) is assigned to manage a mission in the Himylayas with four other nuns in her charge. Three are selected for their strong points while one, Sister Ruth, is chosen in the hopes that the air will do her some good. Trekking to the mountainous former home of an Indian General's harem Clodagh immediately encounters problems with suspicious locals, a game hunter and a holy man who silently refuses to move from his perch on its edge. Gaining some trust, mostly by way of bribery, the villagers start to attend school and clinics set up by the nuns. Sister Ruth however remains a problem and a new obstacle in the unlikely guise of the rarefied atmosphere creates further hurdles reducing Sister Clodagh to an inept and ineffective martinet. Black Narcissus is stunningly assembled by Co-directors Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger and cinematographer Jack Cardiff. The breathtaking scenery created on painted glass and the ubiquitous presence of wind to emphasize the nun's contrasting white habits to the color and glory of nature that surrounds them along with the remnants of the striking fabric of the former residents as well as a youthful prince and a teen seductress raises both tension to the disconnect and seduction of the altruistic sisters out of their element. Amid the panorama and percolating chaos telling close-ups are also used with devastating and exquisite intent of good and evil.Kerr is perfect in the role of Clodagh attempting to maintain serenity in the face of failure, patience with her charges and composure in her struggle with detractors. Kathleen Byron's mad descent to the dark side as Sister Ruth is formidable and riveting and David Farrar's sometimes coarse sometimes understanding hunter adds to the veiled sexual tension as well as play confessor to Sister Clodagh.The digital age today has made film more magical than ever with some awesome visual representations of reality but given the tools they had to work with in 1947 Powell, Pressburger and company have yet to meet their equal in the implementation of smoke and mirrors and color in telling a story. Black Narcissus is a unique masterpiece.",

            "content": "I was terrified by this movie as a child and I couldn't understand why. After all, even at that age I had already seen hundreds of movies involving violence and murder. But when I saw it as an adult I realized that it is a story of diabolic possession - always a frightening subject to one who takes such things seriously.The genius of this movie is that it never states or graphically depicts that there is demonic influence at the nun's mountain convent. It was previously a \"palace\" housing the Sultan's harem. The demons of concupiscence continue to affect some of the inhabitants: the old crone who serves as caretaker who sways to the unheard music of belly dancing, Kanchi (Jean Simmons), the sexually precocious teen-age girl who tries to seduce every man in sight, and of course the beautiful Sister Philippa who inexplicably transmogrifies from a prim and proper nun to a femme fatale.It seems clear to Sister Clodagh, however, that there is demonic possession going on for even as Sister Philippa gives her the lip while putting on make up, she prays. Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron), despite her very beautiful face successfully hints at the evil presence within her soul with her sardonic smiles and sneers. On a second thought, the combination of beauty and malice in her actually heightened one's horror at her transformation.Sister Ruth's persona is completely transformed at the final bell summit scene where she is shown sickly pale but steely eyed and intent on harming Sister Clodagh.In some ways, this film prefigured The Exorcist with demonic possession as a theme.I borrowed the videotape of this film upon learning that it is in the short list of the favorite films of Pope John Paul II. One must remember though that the nuns in the movie are not Catholic but High Anglican. For those interested in subtle distinctions, High Anglicans subscribe to most of the doctrines of the Catholic Church except that they do not accept papal authority. Later, however, especially after Oliver Cromwell's coup d'etat, Anglicanism became more evangelical and identified with Protestantism and those who continued to practice the old Catholic rituals became known as High Anglicans. The nuns in this movie obviously belong to the latter as Protestants generally do not believe in the cloistered or religious life. Members of the British monarchy who continue to attend religious services such as mass done in the Catholic medieval order are High Anglicans.",

In part it reminds me of Written on the Wind, but that isn't quite right, as the melodrama is never quite as melodramatic as Sirk's film. What is this beast of a film? It's gorgeous and affective--a completely visceral experience. I do not know what I expected, but it certainly was not this, and I couldn't be more pleased. There's such complexity to these characters, such unexpected depth of emotion, and such a brilliant use of narrative (or use of non-narrative), that it seems impossible that this film was made prior to 1950. Ah, but then I've seen Lean's Great Expectations and Brief Encounter--two more great British films--and I know those in the UK were capable of this intelligence, wit, and sophistication without resorting to the crudeness one generally finds in films today. I love erotic films and I love emotionally distressing ones, but, because they can, directors choose to show rather than insinuate. That Powell and Pressburger could create as sensual a movie as this without so much as a glimpse of skin is incredible. I am amazed. Like the Rules of the Game, Casablanca, Citizen Kane, or Ivan the Terrible, Black Narcissus is timeless. It's tale could be told today and one would not blink an eye. It's that forward-looking. It's also extremely brilliant on a narrative level. There is not story to speak of here--just episodes in the lives of nuns perched upon a Himalayan peak. There's an unexpected moment of violence and a semblance of trajectory, but try to describe the over-arching narrative in distinct terms and your liable to leave out half of the film. The Black Narcissus is not a jumble, but it is rife with stories short and long. Then there is the scenery. The cinematography and set design are impeccable. Technicolor made everything look a little unreal and that's true here as well. I was convinced I was looking at actual Himalayan mountainscapes. Imagine my surprise that everything is either a set or a matte background. It's incredible. Everything looks more real than a set but unreal in the same way all Technicolor films do. My jaw remains dropped. I was familiar with Michael Powell before seeing this through Peeping Tom, which I could not quite reconcile in my mind with this picture and others he made with Pressburger before seeing them. Now I understand that the focus on emotional and psychological experiences rather than on physical ones. His films appear to be not stories but rather meditations on states of being and should be approached as such. Powell and Pressburger make a great team and should not be ignored in the annals of cinematic history.",

            "content": "Powell and Pressburger's 1947 film Black Narcissus is an adaptation of Rumer Godden's novel of the same name, about a group of nuns trying to establish a faith school in a remote Himalayan palace. Godden spent time in colonial India and later became a devout Catholic, both influences that are apparent in the story and are carried over into the film by Powell and Pressburger's screenplay.\nBlack Narcissus follows a group of nuns lead by Deborah Kerr's Sister Clodagh as they attempt to establish their school after being invited to do so by local ruler General Toda Rai. With the reluctant help of the general's English employee Mr Dean, they bring their religion to a foreign land and ultimately find themselves overwhelmed by the strangeness of the environment and the beliefs and habits of the locals, ultimately driving them to return home. Released near the end of the British rule in India, it is no wonder that a clear parallel has been drawn, although at the time of the film's release more attention was drawn by the erotic undertones of the plot and its depiction of nuns having mental breakdowns.\nPowell and Pressburger's screenplay exhibits their usual knack for drily witty dialogue when the story allows, although the film often treads darker waters, with Sister Ruth - already mentally unstable before the nuns arrive in the Himalayas - developing an obsessive attraction to Mr Dean and ultimately attempting to murder Clodagh, whom she believes to be a rival for Dean's affections. The atmosphere becomes increasingly unsettling (enhanced by Brian Easdale's haunting orchestral score) and the finale is incredibly tense, as the unhinged Ruth tries to murder Clodagh and instead falls to her death.\nIt's all quite gripping, and the casting certainly helps: Deborah Kerr gives an icy performance as the ambitious Sister Clodagh, who soon starts to thaw as she clashes with the dashing Mr Dean, who predicts that the sisters won't last in the palace beyond the start of the Monsoon season and is ultimately proved right. David Farrar oozes charisma as Mr Dean and can do wonders with a cocked eyebrow, whilst Kathleen Byron is impressively convincing as Ruth becomes more and more volatile, culminating in the tragic ending. May Hallatt gives an amusingly eccentric performance as Angu Ayah, although she's not remotely convincing as an Indian woman and she isn't the only white actor in brownface, which dates the film more than anything else: the only Indian played by an Indian actor is Sabu's endearing Young General.\nTechnically, the film was something of an experiment for the Archers, who decided to shoot as much of it as possible in the studio, using matte paintings and model work alongside the convincingly dressed sets to realise the Himalayan setting with startlingly impressive results. It's an astonishing example of Powell and Pressburger's grasp of mise-en-sc\u00e9ne which remains convincing unless the audience starts looking hard enough. The film marks cinematographer Jack Cardiff's first collaboration with Powell and Pressburger and he brings a painterly approach to his camerawork that helps to make the film look glorious. There are exceptions to the studio shooting, notably when Clodagh remembers the past: the fox hunting scene, with the camera keeping pace with the horses and dogs as they race through the countryside, is an achievement in itself. Black Narcissus is one of the handful of films produced by Powell and Pressburger in the nineteen forties that cemented their reputation as masters of British cinemas and it is a superb example of their talents.",

Sex.I cannot forgive the righteous contempt for faith, but I can watch this Powell/Pressburger on infinite repeat and admire the magnificent colors and, above all, the sex. Hitchcock once said that he wished one could play a love scene from across the room. He mused that the only way it could be done was through stripping. Strange, because surely Hitch would have seen BLACK NARCISSUS and witnessed the brutal repression, so potent that the screen should be sweating.By sticking one hawt male into a colony of helpless nuns, we watch them struggle (and, in some cases, succumb) with forbidden senses. The color, composition and lighting lend to an intense modernity. In fact, the color is almost certainly heightened to encourage the emotional density, the hidden arousal. Tight tight tight close-ups emphasize changing ideologies and suggestive glances, especially in a remarkable display of rapid triangle editing. Fades and flashbacks are inserted into prayer, furthering the theme of repressed sexuality and its destruction of faith, if we weren't already sure of it.BLACK NARCISSUS is a shallow narrative. The characters have unclear motivations other than needing some pleasure and women are depicted as pathetic, incapable of mastering their own desires. But the film has become an infinitely intriguing study of sexual liberation in the presence of faith and what repression just might do to the weak mind of women.71",

The whole way through the film is photographed with an attention to detail that few possess, constantly pushing the emotional themes of each frame into the forefront of the viewers mind.

The plot is simple: a small group of nuns are invited to start a school and clinic/apothecary in a remote Himalayas community 9,000 feet above sea level. The sister superior (a gorgeous Deborah Kerr), Sister Clodagh, is smart, flinty and ambitious. She's not afraid of this physical and spiritual challenge, although she acknowledges that one of the nuns, Sister Ruth, is a potential troublemaker. As the story unfolds, you learn more of Sister Clodagh's backstory in Ireland that inspired her to take vows. The unsettling impact of the spectacular landscape, conflicts with local citizens and their culture, and very thin mountain air on these nuns, including Sister Ruth and the older Sister Philippa (Flora Robson), result in the women unearthing darker, deeper truths about themselves. In other words, crazy things happen at 9,000 feet!\"Black Narcissus\" is a gripping period drama and thriller. The scenery, which was created with matte painting and other movie magic, is absolutely spectacular, and has a visceral impact on both viewer and the characters. Even at a time when movies were very restrained in their portrayal or exploration of sex, \"Black Narcissus\" gets the message across and fairly crackles with tension. These women struggle with repressed sexual desire, regrets about their past life choices, and societal views of what women can or can't handle on the job. They're proto-feminists in many ways.Younger modern viewers may not be able to overlook the \"white saviour\" tone of the story or the casting of a very young Jean Simmons as an Indian teen (with slightly darkened skin makeup), but this was common for films of this time period.I read that this film won an Oscar for cinematography, and you can easily see why.

It does admittedly show that obedience is part of the Rule but what the underlying Rule is in not giving any real amplification.Thus the film is not in any way a comment on the religious life - except in a very negative way - that all these sisters were there by default and have been failures in their previous secular lives - but merely deals with how disparate characters are unable to form a community because of their lack of connectedness and the lack of good leadership from their superior.Part of the failure of this community may be construed to have happened because of cultural difference. Here is a group of Anglican nuns out of place and out of joint in an Asian culture.If one wished to explore the nature of the failure of a group to form into - to use modern psychological parlance - an effective team - why use a convent as the mise en scene and nuns as the main characters? The film and its writers indicate to me a great lack of the intimate knowledge of religious life and any true understanding of why a person would seek to give their life to God in this way.

Sure, a films of that era have ages but A Matter of Life and Death, The Red Shoes and The Big Sleep are still very watchable.Sadly Black Narcissus fails on that front. Primarily the acting is far too overwrought. There's no subtlety or nuance, with the score crudely hammering home the director's intended mood with an equal refusal to treat the audience with any respect.There is some lovely camera work - particularly for the era - which is why I've rated the film as high as I did. Overall though this just isn't a film worth revisiting; other films in the 40s have aged much better, have far better acting and will offer a much more rewarding use of a couple of hours.",

            "content": "Many of the comments have captured the themes of this movie, in addition to its outstanding technical achievement.I would like to consider the movie from a couple of different aspects: the battle of wills between Mr. Dean and Sister Clodagh, and the effects of spirituality within the nuns as opposed to the lack of spirituality within Mr. Dean.As for the spirituality issue, I view Mr. Dean as an embodiment of Western rationalism and pragmatism. It is Mr. Dean who calls the natives \"children,\" and of course to him they are. They lack rationality and a pragmatic view of life, and he scoffs at their rituals, their traditions, their superstitions, and their religion. He thus immunizes himself to the fate that befalls the nuns. Let's call Mr. Dean a \"closed soul.\" The nuns, on the other hand, conditioned by their turn to spirituality, are \"open souls.\" As such, they are vulnerable to the tones, vibrations, and exoticism of their new habitat, and have no means by which to regulate their responses, or even to understand them. As sensitive and responsive souls, they respond instinctively to the patterns and rhythms around them, and don't have a capacity to identify and discriminate between varying spiritual forces and voices. They therefore succumb and become disoriented and confused.Mr. Dean knew this would happen, because he is a sufficiently astute analyst of human nature to predict how various souls will react to the local influences. As for him, he's detached. As he said to sister Ruth, as she proclaims her love for him: \"I don't love you. I don't love anyone.\" This is a source of pride for him, or perhaps a necessary internal control on the exotic stimuli with which he is surrounded.As for the battle of wills, Sister Clodagh is a study in human pride, whether that pride be clothed in spirituality or some other guise. She has sufficient awareness that she understands her own pride is a barrier to necessary openness and communion, but at the same time her pride insulates her from the influences that disorient the other nuns. It also insulates her from her past, and her attraction, if any, to Mr. Dean. Thus, her pride is a very ambiguous influence within her, at once destructive, but also protective.Mr. Dean's pride and will is the product of both his world view -- that of Western rationalism -- but also his instinctive feelings of superiority towards the natives and the local culture. I think Mr. Dean senses a kindred spirit in Sister Clodagh, and therefore condescends to befriend her, while he has nothing but contempt for Sister Ruth, who abandons her own rationality, pride, and vocation to indulge a passion. Passions just won't do for Mr. Dean, nor will they do for Sister Clodagh, although the latter is a more complicated case, because the flashbacks reveal that, at least at one point in her life, she was susceptible to them.So, the movie presents some interesting questions and stories about themes that are unresolvable in a general sense. A cast of characters is presented to show the ways that different souls and minds react to influences that are exotic, disorienting, inviting, and threatening. Keep in mind that this movie is decidedly not about the natives; the natives are quite at home in their own habitat and interpret Mr. Dean and the nuns through that prism. This movie is about individuals far removed from the expected, the customary, the supportive, and the expected, and how they react and grow (or regress) in such an environment.Other movies that explore these kind of themes are all the Mutiny on the Bounty films, Apocalypse Now, Dancing With Wolves, and Lawrence of Arabia, each of which treats in its own way the question of Westerners encountering new, strange, and exotic lands and cultures, and how various individuals react and respond to the inevitable dis-orientations.",

            "content": "When nominees are made for the best film of all time, this is one achievement which is sure to be mentioned prominently. \"Black Narcissus\" is visually stunning; it has one of the best scripts of all time by Emeric Pressburger, and Michael Powell's direction--as always--is both poetic and clear at the same time. One reviewer said you have to see it several times to appreciate it; the chief virtue of the movie is that it is great because an intelligent viewer is given all he/she needs to appreciate its main purpose the first time. This film has the same theme as do a handful of other cinematic triumphs--\"Elephant Walk\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and \"Hotel\" among others. Its theme is the battle by a brave person to do what proves to be impossible--to overcome the basics of nature, or human nature, by intelligent but misguided persistence. In this case, the story concerns a group of nuns who in a Far Eastern country attempt to bestow by teaching and example the benefits of their more-logical but anti-worldly system of disciplines upon the ruler and people of a tribal level and exotic cultural tradition. The result is of course at best a success d'estime; they fail, spectacularly, to change much of anything in a culture not ready for self-responsibility and categorical-level rights. But the value of the film lies in allowing the viewer to understand, gradually, how hard the nuns are trying by non-coercive means to recommend and to practice their own rigorous and anti-individualist form of failed Westernism--and steadily losing ground. As the nuns, Deborah Kerr is superb, others are very good and Flora Robson astonishing, as she usually is. David Farrar is loud, manly and convincing; and Sabu and a young Jean Simmons do well as the lovers whose sensuality foils the best-laid schemes of religion's outmanned defenders. Costumes, setting, atmospheric lighting, art direction by the great Jack Cardiff, sound and music---everything here contributes to an artistic triumph even though the film was shot on a back lot. This by my standards is a film not to be missed, from the same people who gave us several other classics as high in artistry as anything anyone in film has ever achieved.",

The film earns the highest complement a work of art can receive--it is perfectly, beautifully coherent on its own terms, like the logic of a dream.Yet, I could not help but be disturbed by the colonial and, yes, racial politics of the picture. Again and again, the people of the valley were described--contemptuously--as \"children.\" The film endorses this point of view. The very basis of the story is that the fecund, irrational, libidinous \"foreignness\" of the place can drive Europeans insane.Now, I do not want to adopt the fallacy of judging past eras and achievements with the moral standards of our day.

The sisters of the order soon find troubles as the oppressively isolated atmosphere of the convent takes its toll on them.The film takes on a unique atmosphere of constricting loneliness through various methods; the mountain-top convent is given an ethereal, other-worldly effect to it, which is emphasised through the use of painterly backdrops, this fairytale-esque escapism soon gives way to the distinct horror-movie feel that slowly seeps in as the runtime ticks by, and the central theme of repressed desires and their tendency to resurface produces a pervasive sense of unease that only gains momentum as the movie progresses.This uneasy atmosphere lends itself well to the plot, which centres on the character Sister Clodagh, however, there are some confusing turns that the story takes as well as some unresolved or nonsensical plot points. For a movie with such a tight set of characters, it seems odd that there is still some fat to be trimmed in this area, entire characters and their subplots serve no purpose other than to be used as awkwardly placed plot devices to further the story in an attempt to emphasise the themes of the film. It is not successfully done and the movie suffers for its rather lazy plot that is largely held afloat by the performances of the cast.Black Narcissus' unique tone, underscored with a bubbling atmosphere of repressed emotions makes for a tense viewing, and while the occasional lazy shortcut taken by the plot is an annoying distraction, this eerie ambiance and the compelling performances of the cast result in very good final piece.",

            "review_title": "Nuns in the Backwoods or Weak, undersized drama with drained potential",
            "content": "Drama. A screen adaptation of the novel of the same name by the English writer Rumer Godden. I have nothing to say about the original book source, because it was not published in the USSR and Russia, so I will evaluate the picture as an independent work. Frankly, this picture fell to me in the recommendations, after watching the excellent drama with Audrey Hepburn \"The Story of a Nun\", and a brief description interested your humble servant. So I decided to take a look - and was disappointed in this, although not much. And here's my brief opinion - Weak, undersized drama with drained potential. Now let me tell you about the advantages and disadvantages of this adaptation.\nSo, the advantages:\n1. The idea - several nuns are sent to the Indian wilderness, so that they opened a monastery, school and hospital in a former palace located high in the mountains. The young abbess will have to organize the work of the institution, curb the inner fears and doubts of herself and her sisters, and find a common language with the locals. But only upon arrival it becomes clear that this task is difficult to accomplish. This could make a good and strong dramatic story, but alas - banality on banality and boringness. Excellent potential has been shamelessly drained and ruined in the most inhuman way.\n2. Picture - the picture has received several Oscar statuettes for its technical performance - and quite rightly. Even now, it looks bright and immerses the viewer in British India and missionary and not only the activities of monastic orders. Costumes and decorations only enhance this effect.\n3. Music is not a masterpiece, and you will not want to listen to it apart from the picture, but within the framework of what is happening on the screen, it is good. You can even feel the tension in the right moments.\nSo the disadvantages:\n1. Scenario - apart from a good start, the film no longer boasts an interesting and intense story. No, there is a drama here, only against the background of \"The Story of a Nun\" the local one looks somewhat weak and does not catch the viewer at all. How many things could you think of? From the story of the collapse of human ambition to the victory of hard work over circumstance, to these two finals there could be many roads that could be played well. And the bottom line is banality, predictability, lack of interest and stereotyped.\n2. Heroes - only the abbess and Mr. Dean (an Englishman helping the sisters) are of interest, since all the others are typical walking cartoons with familiar images and simple to the point of disgrace. Are they interesting? Not! Are they remembered after watching? Not! Are they predictable in their actions and deeds? Yes! Are they worth our attention? Definitely not!\nMaybe in the book this story was told much better, but I have no way to compare. And this picture is simply ridiculous to compare with \"The Story of a Nun\". What they have in common is only the religious monastic order and the inner thrashing of the protagonist. Only if Audrey managed to reveal her inner world and show the struggle between her character and the dogma of the church, then the heroine of Deborah Kerr did not succeed (memories and dialogues did not help).\nA little about the main characters:\n1. Sister Claude, played by Deborah Kerr, is the young abbess of a new monastery in the Indian wilderness. Brave, ambitious, stubborn and ready to go to any lengths to achieve her goal. Upon arrival, all her qualities will face a severe test of fortitude and firmness of convictions. As I said, Deborah failed to reveal her character and make the audience worry about her. I am already silent about her way to get to the monastery. Actor's play is average, and nothing more.\n2. Mr. Dean performed by David Farrar - a local Englishman who helps the sisters settle in a new place. Rude, honest, what a libertine to look for, but sometimes an irreplaceable person in a difficult situation. The hero of David is remembered only for the fact that he looks too bright against the background of the dullness of the other heroes, although Dr. Fortunati from \"The Nun's Story\" was a real person, and here Mr. Dean is more of a function, so to speak, \"a focus of debauchery\" with which nuns need to fight ...\nI have no right to recommend this picture, but I will again recommend \"The Story of a Nun\", where the themes of man, God, and the Church and their relationship are revealed much deeper and more convincingly than here. Although I really don't want to scold \"Black Daffodil\".\nAs a result, we have an average drama, with a bad script, excellent but ruined potential, good music, empty and uninteresting characters and frankly average acting work.\nMy rating is 5 out of 10! About the recommendation - see for yourself.",

Shot entirely on the lots of Pinewood studio in London, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's film is the pinnacle of lush. There's a popular anecdote that goes around when talking about this movie. The directors once commented that because of the power of Technicolor, the lips of the actors would appear to be too red on screen. It was then decreed the main actors must wear a beige toned lipstick to hide their natural redness. It makes the scene at the end of the film all the more powerful when Sister Ruth sheds her black and white nun's clothing and paints the forbidden red across her lips and charges out of the building to the top, confronting Sister Superior Clodagh in a showdown swinging from the convent's bell 9000 feet above the Earth. I loved this film for two things: color and expression. I felt while watching this to be a part of a living museum mixing the art of the German Expressionists and the hyper realistic colors of some contemporary art (sorry no examples, I'm terrible with most art movements). I was also enthralled by the actual Technicolor camera.I picked this movie up at the University library.

It migrates from a commentary on faith & resolve into a superb melodrama. The plot-line stretches the limits of what we can accept from a group of nuns in a harsh, exotic location and the visual elements make it very rewarding to suspend disbelief.I think the best way to view it is to pretend that Sister Ruth (Kathleen Bryan) is the repressed side of Sister Clodagh (Deborah Kerr). The purpose of the flashback scenes with Deborah Kerr is a means of connecting the two women by appearance when Sister Ruth has removed her convent clothing. Kerr and Bryan look reasonably similar and the movements of their characters leading to the thrilling finish is in sync. I particularly liked how during the quiet moment between Mr. Dean (David Farrar) and Sister Clodagh, Sister Ruth was not just eavesdropping--but in the same frame. The finish with the rain on the flowers is also poetic. It absolves the nuns from leaving their mission too soon (i.e., as Dean predicted).Many of today's viewers will judge the acting to be \"over the top.\" I think other than Ley On's Phuba, they all hit it and make this film a lot of fun.",

As others have said, the fact that this film was shot on a set is really remarkable. To pull that off is genius in and of itself. Besides that, the artistry with which the shots in the film are handled is simply a pleasure to watch. Numerous rooms and places jump out at you with incredible beauty, including the \"blue room\", the \"chapel\" and the bell on the cliff's edge. The sets are gorgeous. Perhaps you could say that Black Narcissus is to Technicolor as The Night of the Hunter is to black and white. The visuals of both are unique and memorable in their own right.The other remarkable imagery occurs late in the film as Sister Ruth grows increasingly unstable. The \"lipstick scene\" is remarkable, but is quickly outdone by the amazingly Gothic scene as she stands in the door of the palace. Now that scene will haunt you!

I won't recap the story, since so many here have done so, but I will tell you why I think it mesmerizes me and so many others - in short - what makes it worth watching.The movie has a very unique atmosphere and feeling. Of course a large part of this is the amazing cinematography of Jack Cardiff. His cinematography is a character in itself. Part of what is so amazing is the fact that they didn't film this on location yet there are moments when you would swear you are there in the Himalayas. The colors are so visually stunning & the lighting is just perfect - every scene is composed so carefully yet you still feel as if you are being allowed to \"eavesdrop\" and like a voyeur, watch these people and the things that happen- and do NOT happen to them.Another thing in this movie is the amazing acting by all. When an actor holds your attention just waiting for them to say something- that's pretty powerful. Of course there is the sexual tension in this movie that also keeps you hanging on the edge of your chair. Will Sister Clodagh be like Father de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds? Or shall she remain true to her order? The flashbacks to her former life (which I'm reliably told weren't included originally) give you insight into the fact that this woman is not some pillar of strength, but a woman with the same desires and weaknesses as we all possess. It is partially the conflict between her and the \"fragile\" sister Ruth that give a lot of the tension.

I can't see any group sending a half dozen women cold into a foreign country that remote without some previous knowledge of the area. :::possible spoiler::::Sister Ruth's red rimmed eyes would have me sending her home on the first burro off the mountain! Talk about demonic! Someone previously mentioned that she wore black, the only dress she had was red. She might have been in a shadow but she was in the same dress. If you want a different movie I suppose this would be it. This movie was on TMC today 10/1/05 it might be on again, if they have a Deborah Kerr evening of movies. Jean Simmons was almost a Jennifer Jones rip off from Duel in the Sun 3 years earlier.",

            "content": "Black Narcissus tells the story about a Sister Clodagh (played by Deborah Kerr), who along with four other nuns opens up a convent in the Himalayas. Each having their own traits and good intentions (except for Sister Ruth perhaps, but more on her later), it doesn't take long before their flaws and desires start to show. These feelings become even stronger and more notable once agent of a general named Mr. Dean becomes more involved. He makes an excellent addition to the surrounding characters; his appearance is very much welcome, yet never becomes too dominant or overpowering; you certainly won't find any ''masculine man risks his life for a woman in danger and they live happily ever after'' scenes here.The first half of Black Narcissus allows the viewer to get to know the characters; the local people, old general and agent Mr. Dean welcome the nuns, yet it doesn't take long before Mr. Dean's attitude clashes with ''sister superior'' (that is sister Clodagh). Hard-headed and determined as she is, even she starts to daydream about her earlier, far more ordinary life, yet she tries to do what she believes is best. She certainly doesn't feel very enthusiastic about Mr. Dean's remarks and deeds at first (like when he gets drunk), or about Sister Ruth's remarks (that is when she confronts her about the idea of being fond of Mr. Dean himself).As expected, Sister Ruth is the most interesting character of the movie. From the moment she shares her negative thoughts about the local people, you can tell that there's something off about her, yet we're never exactly told what she's dealing with. Still, her excitement during the more shocking scenes - like when she's covered in blood or reports to Clodath after the baby's death that ''we're all alone - there's no one in the house'' should tell you something about her. Interestingly her character developments mirrors the way she presents herself; by the time she has left the order she's at her most alluring and by the time she's barefaced while planning her revenge, she's at her most frightening; the close up near the end of the movie is something to behold. Still, Sister Ruth doesn't just turn more dangerous over time - the meetings with Mr. Dean shows her are her most sensitive and vulnerable, yet it becomes clear that she's not the most analytical character in the movie; confessing her feelings without any second thoughts doesn't do her much good as she yet gets turned down - which only adds fuel to the fire.While mostly dramatic, Black Narcissus takes a far more suspenseful turn near the end; unsurprisingly with regards to Sister Ruth, once her illness/madness starts to take its toll, resulting into a series of scenes motivated by jealousy, anger and bitterness all ultimately lead to an attempt at revenge. Whereas it takes some time before these scenes get evoked, they are mindfully done and represent the movie's most captivating peak instead of turning a movie into quite a different direction for the sake of it.But it's not perfect. Whereas the runtime of Black Narcissus felt appropriate some of its lesser-important characters didn't really add much to the movie. The orphan Kanchi, who gets introduced by Mr. Dean I could have done without (probably to be expected since she doesn't speak!) and the younger general played by Sabu didn't really impress me in a sense either. Still, other surrounding characters played their part with conviction and while I wasn't too sure about the movie's progression at first, having it seen for the second time definitely changed my mind.",

            "content": "I've always found it arresting, and well acted, and the subject matter intriguing, but I gain new appreciation for the film's achievements with each new viewing. The casting, the closeups of Deborah Kerr's lovely face, the story, the sets that fooled you entirely into believing that it was filmed on location. The individual performances, especially Kathleen Byron as Sister Ruth, who fell into a deep erotic possession, and the close ups of her very expressive face, her often frantic voice, and her dashing about in a kind of frenzy, almost stole the show. Who has not trembled at some point with those feelings, fixated on someone who has completely captivated you. Sexual obsession. A kind of madness. But then there was Jean Simmons, in her teens, at her most sensuous, as the exotic young Indian woman who seduces a prince. The body language is so important, in all of the characters, each with his/her signature movements, gestures, or stillness. Credit the direction. The sound mixing, the brilliant photography, and the beautiful colors. The struggle against the constrains of society, the motives for turning to a cloistered life, and the ways in which it affects those who choose that life. It has become one of my favorite films, that I can appreciate on so many levels. It's also remarkable to see how well it stands up three quarters of a century after it was made. A true classic. Highly recommended.",

I would have liked to find out more about David Farrar's character, Mr. Dean, where did he come from? Why is he there? Did he leave a women behind?The images in this film are at times beautiful, the setting is amazing, but this seems to be played on a little too much. The constant wind, however, was very effective. It really gave a feeling of the harsh conditions up there.It is not surprising, given J. Arthur Rank's religious convictions, that this film looks at good and evil, and that good triumphs over evil in the end. The demonic transformation of Sister Ruth is a little over played at times, and leads to an inevitable conclusion.This is one of the classic British films of the 1940's and is well worth a look... 7/10",

Tell the inner motivation, show the feelings and actions and perceptions that brought to that conclusion, tell us, and convince us, possibly.This is what Black Narcissus doesn't quite even try to do. So, in this case, it is not enough. And we are left wih (beautiful) landscapes, photography, colour, and what else: the film won two Academy Awards, for such technical stuff, and some other important prices, and is placed at the 47th place in the British Film Institute 1999 \"Best British films of all times\".

If you're the sort that loves to remember some of the great images in, say, \"Citizen Kane\"--I believe you'll find this film filled with wonderful, wonderful understanding of what makes great motion pictures.It's a simple story, and as the film starts out, you really don't expect the emotional tensions to build to the intensity that they eventually do reach. The powerful performances of Deborah Kerr and David Farrar, bubbling with red-hot subtexts throughout, and the spectacular tour-de-force of Kathleen Byron, as the anxious and tortured Sister Ruth--leading to one of the most terrifying climaxes in the movies!--are complemented by a supporting cast full of delight, from the tender humor of Sabu, as the young general, to the wordless and utterly convincing portrayal of a lower-class Nepali flirt by Jean Simmons, to Flora Robson's anguished crisis of faith, to May Hallatt's hilarious clowning as the old caretaker, to the cuteness of little Eddie Whaley, Jr., as the precocious child charged with the job of interpreting for an entire convent of nuns...like a gorgeous flower-garden, with perfumed delights in all directions, this film literally envelopes you with one treat after another! It's not a film of weight and importance: it's pure entertainment, and neither Rumer Godden's novel--nor this movie--aspire to be monuments of great LITERATURE. As a drama, it's just for emotional thrills, and if you're looking for Jane Austen or Shakespeare--it's not here.But the film is completely absorbing, visually lovely, stirring and exciting, and--if you've never seen it--is absolutely guaranteed to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up with fear--and you'll find yourself coming back to it to enjoy it all again, over and over. It's a trip off to a remote place at the top of the world, for a dramatic tale of repressed emotion--of no deep importance, but what's life without some recreation? And let's also put in a word for a luscious orchestral score, although the recording is what you must expect for a 1940's film.If you don't know this great, great film, treat yourself to it!",

I honestly can't see how people are and were unable to see Mister Ruth played by Karl Byron's real features compared to others less concealed around them in daily life and it looks like there is more of that here like all movies since its inception.
