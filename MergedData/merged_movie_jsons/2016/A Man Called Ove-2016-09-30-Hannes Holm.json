            "content": "Some of the movies that I find the most interesting are ones that focus on interactions between people from different cultures. \"En man som heter Ove\" (\"A Man Called Ove\" in English) is one such movie. The protagonist is a misanthropic, aging man in a neighborhood in Sweden. He spends much of his time telling people if they're breaking the law. But when an Iranian woman and her family move in, this becomes a new opportunity for him.In addition to showing Ove's relationship with this new family, the movie uses flashbacks to establish what kind of a person Ove is. And believe me, there are some shocking things that happened in this man's life. I had never heard of the director or cast members before watching the movie, but I'm impressed with their work (including the cat). The movie has some clever scenes, but also makes sure to emphasize the characters' relationships with each other. I hope that Hannes Holm continues to make this sort of movie, and I hope to see Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd in more movies. Bra gjort!",

            "content": "The Swedish film En man som heter Ove was shown in the U.S. with the translated title, A Man Called Ove (2015). It was written and directed by Hannes Holm, from a novel by Fredrik Backman.Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd plays Ove, a man in his late 50's who has lost his wife to cancer, and lost his job due to redundancy. He is angry all the time, and demonstrates his anger by berating his neighbors, and making everyone stick to the letter of the regulations of the community in which he lives.You know something is going to change when new neighbors move in. The husband is Swedish, the wife (Bahar Pars) is Iranian-Swedish and pregnant, and their two daughters are adorable. You can see the end coming right from the start.What you can't see from the start is Ove's back story. Life has dealt him some bitter blows, some of them involving deceit by the people he calls \"the white shirts.\" Ove truly loved his wife, Sonja, portrayed very well by Ida Engvoll. Now he has nothing and no one to love, and he takes this out on the world by being a pain in the neck.The movie has some funny moments and some tragic moments, and, eventually, they all fit together. The film is well crafted, well acted, and well photographed. It's hard not to like a movie like this. Think about the movie as \"It's a Wonderful Life\" in Swedish, and without Christmas. Maybe the plot is obvious, but it moves you anyway.We saw this film at the truly excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work well on the small screen. It's worth seeking out and watching. (A Man Called Ove has an excellent IMDb rating of 7.6. It's interesting that almost every voter liked it, and both U.S. and foreign reviewers enjoyed it equally.)",

            "review_title": "\"Gran Torino\"-reminding Swedish movie",
            "content": "\"A Man Called Ove\" (2015 release from Sweden) brings the story of 59 yr. old Ove. As the movie opens, we see him bickering in a store over the price of flowers on his way to visit his wife Sonja's grave. Not long thereafter, he is given the boot at work, after a 43 yr. career in train maintenance. This leaves him with plenty of time to do the rounds of the small (and traffic-free) community where he lives. Then a young family moves in across the street, not knowing the many strict rules of the community. All along, Ove can't wait to join his beloved Sonja in the hereafter. At this point we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first of all, if you have seen the trailer, you are probably expecting something along the line of that other recent Swedish movie, the funny and irreverent \"The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared\", as certainly the trailer gives that expectation. Let me stop you right there, as \"A Man Called Ove\" turns out to be almost nothing like it, and in fact I will say that the movie's trailer is outright misleading. \"A Man Called Ove\" certainly has some funny moments here and there, but in fact deals a lot more with how someone deals with facing life without a dearly beloved significant other. The movie cleverly looks back at the budding romance between Ove and Sonja in a number of flashbacks, and it's not until the very last 15 min. that we get the full picture. (During one of those flashbacks, we hear Demis Roussos' \"Forever and Ever\" in the background, which I literally hadn't heard in decades. That guy was HUGE in Europe in the 70s.) The movie also looks at the importance of neighbors and the immediate community (and even integration of migrants, as the wide of the young family fled Iran and is now completely fluent in Swedish). The movie that came to mind as I was watching this is Clint Eastwood's \"Gran Torino\" of a few years ago. Indeed, certain parallels are uncanny (grumpy older guy, love for cars (in \"Ove\" it's a Saab), dealing with personal loss, adjusting to new neighbors, etc. Rolf Lassgard is outstanding in the title role, and kudos also to Barar Pars as the young wife from Iran.\"A Man Called Ove\" opened with little pre-release fanfare at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, somewhat to my surprise. So much the better! If you are up for a bittersweet Swedish movie about an older gentleman's adjustment to a new world, I think you will like this quite a bit. \"A Man Called Ove\" is worth checking out!",

            "content": "This is a Swedish film based on the book of the same name. It is sent to represent the nation at the 2017 Oscars and as for now, it made into the December shortlist. This is the tale of an old grumpy man and the life after the death of his wife. That would be a toughest phase of life for anybody. I am sure you had seen many films like this, but this one was slightly different, yet totally convincing on every topic it focused on. So funny, at a time meaningful and emotional, particularly how the tale ends.In a small township, a 59 year old man called Ove lived most of his life and now he decides to take his life. But the attempt was prevented when a new lousy neighbour arrives and so it keep delays further. Now's the time to reveal all the reasons behind his dreadful decision with lots of flashbacks and current affairs. That he's a nightmare in his neigbourhood to those who break the rules. He's not a friendly type, because of his childhood and the lessons he learnt from his father to face the life as tough it gets.The only friend he ever had did not last for a long. His wife was his world and then the job at the railway. The narration given a good enough focus on his romance life. His younger version, played by another actor reveals particularly the initial stage like how he had met her. I don't know these actors, but they all were so good. A perfect setting as well for the story to take place. I think the filmmakers did lots of best decisions and in the end it all paid off with a greater recognition in the international level.\"Honesty is the best thing, Ove. But sometimes honesty needs a little help.\"A heartwarming comedy-drama for all age groups. I was looking for such a film and I realised only after watching it. The character Ove was designed awesomely and all the story events built around him was excellent. Covered most of the topics like friendship, love, neighbours, job, moral values, even the pet animals. Loads of fun, guaranteed entertainment if you are seeking a comedy film. As Ove was portrayed very seriously, all his actions, especially the newly arrived woman make major difference to end the film most comedic way.The regularly visiting his wife's grave, the film beautifully gives an insight on the life of Ove being a widower and a retiree. But also how it all turns around for him who never laughs and finally he does, was the film's highlight. Like I always say, I'm not a book person, but I love watching films based on the good books like this one. An awesome adaptation and I hope those who loved the book, as well enjoyed the film.Usually all the good films run nearly or over two hours. Because of the slow and steady developments in its characters and the story. For this film, you won't notice the time. The pace of the narration, including the lovable characters and the storyline makes you forget everything else. In a few days the 89th American Academy Awards nominees will be announced and I am sure it will make. Looks like this year, three Scandinavian films going to make the noise at the Oscars. In the meantime, I hint you not to miss it, either it wins or lose, it is one of the best films of the year around the world.8/10",

            "content": "I can credit a mini-vacation to visit a friend for the good fortune of catching this film at a Richmond, Virginia art house, as I'm almost one hundred percent certain it would never appear in the area where I live. Because he (my friend) and his wife had read the book on which the story was based, the natural question was how closely did the film follow the original story, and with minor exceptions, it captured the essence well enough to deter any disappointment.The picture almost immediately calls to mind Clint Eastwood's 2008 movie \"Gran Torino\" and the similarities are many. The principal character Ove (Rolf Lassgard) is a recently retired senior citizen who's wife has recently passed away, and his severe conservative code of ethics is displayed in the way he attempts to enforce the administrative codes of his neighborhood block association. Told in a non-linear fashion, the story takes us back to Ove's childhood and young adult life, with a tender and touching story of how he met his wife Sonja (Ida Engvoll), and how they both managed to persevere through an unfortunate accident that left her crippled but determined to live a normal life. What could have been a morose story is emphatically brought to life when a new set of neighbors arrives next door to Ove, and he finds his ideas of immigrants consistently challenged. One gets the sense that Ove at no time wants to be bothered with other people, but at the same time finds it impossible not to reach out and help someone in a time of trouble or crisis. Having decided that he wants to join his beloved wife on the other side, Ove is constantly thwarted in his attempt to take his own life. In that respect, the film calls to mind another picture, this one from 1971, called \"Harold and Maude\". The difference however, is that the character Harold fakes suicide repeatedly to get a rise out of his family, whereas Ove seeks a real outcome. Or does he? The viewer must draw one's own conclusion, particularly after Ove declares that \"Killing oneself isn't all that easy.\"Because this is a Swedish film, the only one I've ever seen at this point, one rather major disconnect for me occurred when the Willie Nelson song \"You Were Always on My Mind\" popped up in the soundtrack. In a way, it did fit the occasion because it had to do with Ove's memory of his wife, but it just seemed odd and out of context. The other concession to American film making that I'm sensitive to because I've seen it so many times now, was a product placement for Coca Cola, which shouldn't amaze me so much in a global economy, but it was just too striking not to mention it.Filmed in Swedish with English sub-titles, this is a competent film that one ought to catch if it should come your way. Along with the heartbreak of Ove's personal story, there are many moments of warmth and humor, and you'll catch yourself chuckling in spots that are both touching and ironic. Not necessarily a feel good movie in the traditional sense, though the picture has a way of working it's magic in a profound way.",

Luckily, I got a preview ticket and could see it last night. I was kinda expecting this was gonna be good because I checked IMDb reviews for this movie said this was worth to see. I enjoyed this move a lot more than I expected. I like a fan of movie having good story line more than spectacular SF or CG scenes. To be honest, I love watching great nature scenery so it doesn't need to have a good story line. You can find about this movie's story line easily here and somewhere. so I don't write about movies much. I want to tell you why I loved this move a lot. First of all, Main character \"Ove\" acting is so excellent and involving. and his wife ensembles his character so adorably. Many scenes of his reminisces are very touching and got my eyes watery. I had thought to myself how it could be sad to lose a lifetime partner. and how it could be happy to get a woman I truly love. Someone can truly change your life.Characters and places in this movie were very restricted so it can be boring if you expect a very entertaining movie. If you go for movies that can give you a thought, definitely this will be for you.",

            "content": "En mann ved navn Ove (A man named Ove) is a Swedish-Norwegian co-production based on a success novel by the same name by Fredrik Backman, about a somewhat naive and grumpy man of 59, Ove. A railroad working man for 43 years missing his recently passed life companion and wife. Also being laid off at work, he decides to meet her again on the other side, and starts planning his suicide. But things don't seem to go his way this time either.In many ways this is a quite typical Swedish comedy drama where some small tragedy is mixed with life and a god portion of feel good. Easy yo love, and to some felt like it has a deeper mission and meaning. And it has, and the film is funny to some extent. When it comes to giving the a serious message, the film loses itself on the way, and becomes a story a bit too far fetched.If you don't take these too-far-fetched parts too serious, and with this the over exaggerated moral, this is a quite pleasant watch, though a bit too long for my taste.Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd, a classy Swedish actor, makes one of his best roles ever, being the exactly same age as Ove here, but is strangely enough made very strange in the make up, and seemingly much older than he is in real life. It's also strange that people around him is insensitive to this grumpy mans awful behavior. Being so unlovable, there is simply no reason why this man should get so much affection and trust.But, then again. This is pure fiction and entertainment. If you are able to see through this, you'll have a good time watching this tale of human relations and understanding.",

Somehow Lassg\u00e5rd grasps the classic silence with deep melancholy traits that are often found in our northern latitudes. He uses all his (big) body language to express emotions which makes him to a brilliant actor.Because children have a special role in the film, there is probably nothing in the world that can make a movie beautiful in itself. Lined up with grief and death the moments sometimes becomes strong. A dark wintry Thursday evening in a crowded movie theater there were many who shed tears.There is also a clear generational perspective in the film too. The generation born in 1940th's are retiring and leaving earth on natural reasons. Of course it feels bitter. But also the world they left with their differences are a bit odd in our eyes.

            "content": "Not long before watching this film, I read the novel it is based on and was absolutely blown away by how the main character--Ove--could be rendered so crotchety yet also so heartfelt and sincere at the same time. For the most part, this film adaptation of \"A Man Called Ove\" captures the essence of that novel.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of Ove (Rolf Lassgard), an old man in a gated community who seems to relish being the \"village grump\". He yells at cars for driving on \"the path\", does routine parking/garage inspections, and is just generally unpleasant to be around. Just when viewers couldn't imagine an ounce of sympathy for Ove, however, they discover he is grieving the loss of his wife, has just been laid off from his longtime job, and is on the verge of committing suicide. The rest of the film breaks down the middle, with one half flashing back to a young Ove (Filip Berg) and wife Sonja (Ida Engvoll) and roughly the other half a sort of redemption story for the present-day Ove, as new neighbors Patrick (Tobias Almborg) and Parvaneh (Bahar Pars) give him a chance at life again.As with the novel, the beauty of this story is that despite Ove's surly and often outright brutish personality, there is a relatability factor to him that just shouldn't be there (speaking to the incredible character nuance). Nobody really wants to be \"an Ove\", if you will, yet we all know someone like him or have been there a time or two in our own lives. The flashbacks really help to flesh out his backstory too, as it is fascinating to see a charismatic, hopeful Ove turn into the complicated figure of the present bit by bit.About the only thing I don't like about this film is how certain bits are played a bit too comedic for my liking. I understand the ridiculousness of Ove's situation in the first half of the film (constantly trying to die but always being \"thwarted\" by some problem or nuisance that needs solving), but in the novel it isn't played for quite as much comedy as it is at times here. It doesn't ruin the ambiance outright or anything like that, but it does feel a bit out of place in a film with such serious themes.Overall, though, I can see why \"A Man Called Ove\" was nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar (it is presented in Swedish dubbed in English). It's an emotional, deep, and yet somehow charming story of the life of a man we've all seen/known before and how he got that way.",

            "content": "I do have to say that I expected a bit more of this movie. It tells us the story of a rather grumpy old man that is isolated within his neighborhood and plans to bring his life to an end but is stopped by his own pedantry and a new set of people that bring a necessary chaos into his ritualized life.While the plot itself surely has potential, at the same time it is not something you have never heard or seen before. Movies love to show the warm heart in otherwise cold characters and elder people are always a good target for that because they already have more stories to be told to explain how their bitterness appeared.In this case, everything seems just a bit over the top. How every time he attempts to commit suicide something happens out of the blue is probably supposed to be of comical value but somehow just appears to be unrealistic. At the same time many of the characters seem a bit stereotypical or at least one-dimensional.It is a warm film though, with a warm message and it is never wrong to have some more of those. I did feel sympathy for this old man with his cat and his wife, and I did feel touched by their accident and so it surely makes some things wright. That it teaches tolerance, among cultures as well as along sexual orientations, is also a very positive point.All in all it is a warm film that doesn't harm anyone but the cold-hearted, but there are better similar ones existing.",

            "content": "Retired and widowed railroad worker, Ove Lindahl (Rolf Lassgard), still dealing with grief from the loss of his wife, Sonja (Ida Engvoll), to cancer spends his days continuing to work at his job and enforcing block association rules in his neighborhood. When Ove is pushed into retirement by his company, he loses sense of purpose in his life and decides to commit suicide so he may join Sonja. However Ove's attempts at killing himself are repeatedly interrupted by situations only Ove can help with and he strikes up a slow building friendship with a family of four, Parvaneh (Bahar Pars), her husband Patrick (Tobias Almborg), and their two daughters who move in across from Ove.A Man Called Ove is an adaptation of Fredrik Backman's 2012 book of the same name. The film was a massive critical and commercial success earning two award nominations at the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Makeup and Hairstyling and is the third most watched Swedish film of all time and has spurred development of a U. S. remake, A Man Called Otto, due out for release in 2022. A Man Called Ove is a simple by very resonant story of a man who's lost the value of his life but over the course of the film comes to re-evaluate it and his role in the lives of others.Rolf Lassgard is really good in the lead role of Ove as he's undeniably a very curmudgeonly character, but beneath his abrasive exterior he's a good hearted person who will help people out of a dilemma whilst also calling them \"idiot\" for having gotten into it in the first place. The movie does a good job of balancing the elements of sadness in this movie with moments of levity and humor as Ove's suicide attempts are progressively less and less successful as the movie goes on because he finds himself needed by others for whatever reason. The supporting cast is really strong with Fillip Berg well suited to playing a younger Ove in flashbacks that shows him developing a romance with Sonja and you grow to care about them and get invested in their relationship. Likewise the supporting characters in Ove's life such as Parvaneh, Patrick, Jimmy, Mirsad, or Ove's estranged best friend Rune all have some wonderful interactions with Ove that make you invested in this story and help make you fall in love with these characters. While the movie is quite sad and a tearjerker, it earns it by having a life affirming story with Ove rediscovering the value of his life in a way that'll hit many close to home.I really loved A Man Called Ove. I make no secret of this movie's ability to reduce me to tears, but in the best possible way. It's a movie that values humanity, community, and the importance of your life to those around you. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "\"That's not a dog. It looks like a winter boot with eyes.\" Ove (Rolf Lassgard) The titular curmudgeon (Rolf Lassgard) of A Man Called Ove, a film adapted from the Swedish best-selling Frederick Backman novel, can put down a dog and a human with equal verbal vinegar while hiding an unusually big heart. Yes, I know, the gruff-exterior and warm-interior motif, practically a staple of black comedies, is operative here but with an understated whimsy so as to make it fresh.With an eye on the Swedish penchant for order and its legendary liberality, this amusing and tender tragicomedy tells of a 59-year-old loner, who six months ago lost his luminous and loving wife, Sonja(Ida Engvoll), receding deeper into his already considerable introversion. Yet, writer- director Hans Homme carefully crafts a recognizable stock grump (think Jack Nicholson in About Schmidt and Bill Murray in St. Vincent), who becomes as close as he is able to his opposite, the dynamic and loving Iranian, Parvenah (Bahar Pars), and youths, and seniors who are recipients of his begrudgingly good deeds.It would be understating the complexity of this obsessive compulsive, \"nit-picking obstructionist\" to say he is simply converted into a good guy because to the end he remains grumpy, although he is readier than ever to dole out his reluctant charity. His eccentricity is nowhere more evidenced than in his dedication to his Saab and disdain for Volvos and their owners.Per usual, though, that disdain for his Volvo-owning friend, Rune (Borje Lundberg), transforms into a caring companion in Rune's later, debilitating years. His care for local youths and their bicycles and love challenges is typically deep while appearing hostile. The film uses flashbacks throughout to highlight Ove's romanticism that hides as an adult in an old man's grouch.His OCD personality defends even the most benign condo-living rules: \"The dog must stop peeing at our place.\" Ove is an eccentric whom you will love by the end of the film. After all, you just need to put an \"L\" on his last name.",

While this did give me a \"comparing\" perspective that I wouldn't typically have, I was still able to settle in and enjoy it.The main actors are terrific and carry the movie. While he's not exactly what I pictured when listening to the book (Ove is characterized as appearing more physically imposing and less \"soft\"), Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd really nails the most important role in the film. Bahar Pars, while less is asked of her acting-wise, is equally wonderful in the role of Parvaneh. Other than Sonja the rest of the other actors are forgettable in their roles.This movie held up to my expectations for most of the way through, but the ending fell short of the impact that I felt with the book and due to that I'd consider this more of a \"good\" movie than \"great\" one.In directly comparing to the book there are a number of details outside of the main Ove/Sonja narrative that had to be left out, which of course is expected. What I do feel that the movie lacks is being able to explain the relationships that Ove has with the other people in his life (outside of Sonja and Parvaneh). Some of those are equally powerful in showing Ove's strong moral compass and at the same time explaining why he acts the way he does.",

He uses rope, a gun, and a jump in front of a train. He keeps failing.He sees no point in living because his beloved wife Sonja, who put up with his immature nonsense, has passed away from cancer, and he lives in a world that doesn't want to put up with him.A Persian woman moves in next door (there is a big Middle Eastern population in Sweden, and it has been a source of much societal tension.)this woman turns Ove's life around. Suddenly he adopts a cat, allows a gay Persian boy to live in his house, and he saves a neighbor from being institutionalized.This movie had some really lovely moments, mostly with young Ove interacting with his father, who cleans trains for a living.It was very poignant watching how young Ove did not fit in in the world, and how he was mistreated by others.But then one soap opera event after another was piled on, with no real goal except to make the audience cry.And the saintly Persian woman turning his life around ... not believable in any respect. She wouldn't have done that in real life, and, again, in real life there is a great deal of tension between Swedes and Middle Easterners, and that isn't even hinted at in the movie, which makes the entire project suspect.But, if you like tearjerkers / soap operas, you may like this movie.",

The winner however that year was a movie from Iran I've yet to see titled The Salesman.I wanted to see the original Swedish movie version of A Man Called Ove after seeing an interview by Tom Hanks about his Americanised version of this story based on a 2012 novel of the same name by Fredrik Backman.I'll reserve judgement on Tom Hanks version A Man Called Otto till I see it but the trailer left me a bit underwhelmed thinking not another movie with Tom Hanks in disguise playing Tom Hanks again .A Man Called Otto however I have seen and think it's a delightful touching and humorous story about a man nearly 60 years old left alone after the death from cancer of his much loved wife .Ove as self elected neighbourhood detective keeps a watchful eye on his gated community and is keen to point out residents transgressions in his undeniably grouchy authoritarian manner.We see Ove thaw out a little when a stray rag doll cat (2 in fact) and a refugee couple reach out to him for help .Their scenes together occur in between unsuccessful suicide attempts as we get a peep into his younger life growing up with a stern father and his courtship and life with Anita his deceased wife.Ove is depressed and visiting Anita's grave each day promises her it won't be long before they are reunited.If my description of the plot sounds depressing my apologies as the movie itself is not depressing which is a credit to the screenplay writer Hannes Holm who manages to weave humour into all the characters and their life experiences.The 2 Ragdoll cats both Polish used in this movie were named Magic and Orlando and must be given screen credit for their fine performances. Magic was selected due to his adherence, curiousness and because he could never be startled away. Orlando was a stand-in used for the scenes when the cat was required to stay put or to be carried around for long periods of time.Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd, the actor playing Ove, was 59 years old when the shooting of the movie begun. The same age as the character he plays.He is delightful and perfectly cast as Ove who is a pretty complex character appearing gruff and resentful but his undercarriage is soft and sentimental and there are some very touching acts of kindness that he is responsible for.Special mention for Bahar Pars who is delightful cast as Parvaneh the Iranian immigrant married to Patrick her Swedish husband who move in across the street with their 2 children .If my description of the plot sounds depressing my apologies as the movie itself is not depressing which is a credit to the screenplay writer Hannes Holm who manages to weave humour into all the characters and their life experiences.The American Tom Hanks version titled A Man Called Otto has a new screenplay by David Magee and is based on the same novel by Fredrik Backman and the Swedish Screenplay by Hannes Holm I will look forward to seeing this new version and will keep an open mind till then.",

            "content": "Scandinavia always surprises us with different movies and with very peculiar story lines. Based on the bestseller book by Fredrik Backman, En Man som Heter Ove (original title), or A Man Called Ove (in English), tells the story of Ove, an old grumpy widower, 59 year old, who despite having been deposed some years before as president of the residents association continues to watch over his suburban neighborhood with an iron fist. Depressed, lonely and tired of the monotony of everyday life, Ove is a picture of a person who has given up everything, including himself. Stubborn, moody, with firm beliefs and rigid routines, his approach to life and negative view of the world are put to the test when a new family moves into the house across the street.To talk about old age and its dilemmas has never been an easy task, both in real life and on the big screen. Sometimes it seems that society wants to avoid or forget it, as if it was a distant drama to which we will never live or witness. Thus, it is common that actors with advanced age only interpret supporting characters, with roles that are far from the narrative's focus. However, when they had the opportunity to star in the leading role, they gave birth to great characters and great films. Among them are: Make Way for Tomorrow (1937), Umberto D. (1952), Ikiru - To Live (1952), Smultronst\u00e4llet - Wild Strawberries (1957), Cocoon (1985), B\u00f6rn N\u00e1tt\u00farunnar - Children of Nature (1991), Grumpy Old Men (1993), The Straight Story (1999), Elsa y Fred - Elsa & Fred (2005), Gran Torino (2008), Amour (2012), Nebraska (2013), 45 Years (2015) and the animation Up (2009).With a sincere, poetic and humorous story, the Swedish writer- director Hannes Holm (known for Adam & Eve - 1999, Klassfesten - The Reunion - 2002 and Himlen \u00e4r Oskyldigt Bl\u00e5 - Behind Blue Skies - 2010) addresses a sensitive issue in a subtle way. Humor is one of the key parts used in the process, being present at various times throughout the film. But we are also exposed to sad and tough situations as the story unfolds.The action takes place both in the present and in the past. At first we are introduced to the older version of Ove, played by Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd (known for J\u00e4garna - The Hunters - 1996, Under Solen - Under the Sun - 1998 and Efter brylluppet - After the Wedding - 2006). From the first impressions we encounter a guy who is rough, irritating, without kindness and also is the terror of his suburban neighborhood. He daily patrol the streets and sidewalks in search for irregularities and breaches of rules, which must be followed rigorously. Subsequently, through the use of flashbacks, we are introduced to his child version (Viktor Baag\u00f8e) and younger version (Filip Berg, known for Ondskan - Evil - 2003 and Od\u00f6dliga - Eternal Summer - 2015). Thus, gradually, his past is revealed, explaining his current behavior, which makes us reflect and reassess our views on the main character.The film deals with current concepts and issues such as immigration, globalization and changing values \u200b\u200bover generations. Parvaneh, played by Bahar Pars (she acted in N\u00e4r M\u00f6rkret Faller - When Darkness Falls - 2006), has Persian origin and is the woman of the family who moves into the house in front of the protagonist. Contrasting with Ove's personality, she is passionate and opinionated, being responsible for bringing heat to the protagonist's cold relations. Parvaneh portrays the case of so many other refugees who emigrate to European countries in search of a better life.The identification of the main character with the cars of Saab and the consequent dispute with the cars of Volvo, originally two Swedish brands, represents the nationalism. Ove was from a time when the products (consumer goods) were made within the country. Today, with global value chains and the internationalization of the economy, the goods have no borders and brands have become global. Half of Saab was bought by General Motors in 1990 and the remainder in 2000. In 2012 the company was purchased by China National Electric Vehicle Sweden AB. As for Volvo, in 1999 it was sold to Ford Motor Company. In 2010, Ford agreed to sell Volvo to the Chinese Zhejiang Geely Holdin Group.Ove, as a small-town boy, lived in a different type of Sweden and world. Life had a slower pace and independence and manual skills, such as carpentry and mechanics, were more valued. The difficulties of the younger generation are expressed, for example, in the lack of interest and patience to read manuals or in how a simple installation of a washing machine becomes a challenge.Apart from the excellent performance of Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd in the protagonist's caricatured role, the soundtrack is a treat apart. Engaging, it is captivating in the patrol's moments through the neighborhood and it's sentimental in the drama scenes. All the production work was very well done, from the cameras, photography, to the costume through the ages. Here we have to highlight a weak point in the script and direction. Although the first half of the film is great, as the story develops and its message and meaning are revealed, the director hastens to complete the book's plot and the movie loses some of its strengths in the second half. Some narrative links should have been better developed, as the change experienced by the main character and how the local community see him after that. As a final message Holm points out that life makes more sense when is shared with others. The film had potential to be much more than it was.Originally posted in: https://vikingbyheart.blogspot.com.br",

This shouldn't be a detriment to the viewers. After all, there's a reason why we say we're watching a movie, instead of listening to it or reading it. If one looks past the subtitles, they will be able to access more excellent flicks. A great example of this is the 2015 two-time Oscar nominated Swedish movie \"A Man Called Ove\" due to the simple and effective translation of the book of the same name by Fredrik Backman to the screen.Since 2012, the book has achieved popularity and retained a cultural legacy in the world of literature due to the deep and simple depiction of a curmudgeon finding ways to heal with the unlikeliest people in the unlikeliest ways. Director and writer Hannes Holm understood this when adapting this through various aspects like cinematography, the transitions, and where to place the big emotional beats. The look of the flick involves drab and bright colors, but they are used as a reflection of Ove's state of mind. In the beginning of the movie when Ove (played by Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd) is inspecting the neighborhood and later whenever he feels depressed, there's a blue tint that clouds the environment. Then, whenever he helps someone like the new neighbors, it brightens up. While this can come off as an obvious way to show how the main character is opening up and healing, it's not blasted into the viewers' faces because Holmes always ensures that the focus is on Ove and his thoughts.Another element that works beautifully in the film is how it transitions into the flashbacks. Because the novel heavily relies on the stream-of-consciousness device, the movie utilizes this whenever Ove tries to take his own life. Specifically, it flashes back to various moments of Ove's past that get triggered through a variety of things like a conversation with Parvaneh - the pregnant Iranian neighbor (played by Bahar Pars). Then, these thoughts get interrupted when someone needs assistance. Even though I don't remember how the suicide attempts are depicted in the book, they are portrayed somberly in the movie, while the interruptions are more comical. Granted, these scenes can become predictable if the movie was in the wrong hands. Luckily, Holmes makes them into dreams that get disrupted whenever someone wants help. For example, when Ove attempts to take his own life the first time, Parvaneh calls on him to help direct her Swedish husband Patrick as he drives into the neighborhood. As a result, viewers know that someone is going to stand in the way of Ove and his suicide attempts, but the movie is so invested in the flashbacks that it comes as an rude awakening when someone needs Ove's help. This is where the humor comes from.While the film has its quirky scenes, it's a tearjerker too, and it's another element that it does well. A lot of the emotional scenes take place during the flashbacks. These include the fire at Ove's childhood home and the bomb that goes off on the bus while Ove and his wife Sonja are on vacation. These are usually placed 20 minutes of each other, which allows viewers to think about what they saw and how it affects Ove in the present day while chuckling at various antics like him teaching Parvaneh how to drive. As much as I like the 1939 version of \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips,\" it tries to wring out tears from audiences every 5 minutes, which gets tiring after a while. Speaking of that film, Sonja is like Katherine since both become the person that the titular characters love the most and are able to turn the titular characters' lives around. The main difference is that Sonja's presence remains constant even when she is not on screen because of how Ove constantly thinks of her. This permits audiences to form an emotional attachment to the character and feel the impact of the stuff that occurs to the two characters. Katherine is only present for 20 minutes in \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips,\" and she is barely referred to after she dies despite Chips truly loving her. As a result, audiences don't feel the impact of Katherine and her influence on Chips in the same way that they do for Sonja and her effect on Ove.And now, I must talk about the strongest aspect of this movie adaptation: the performances. All of the actors do a good job of capturing the spirit of their characters, but of course, I have to single out a few of them. The first is Bahar Pars who plays Parvaneh. Pars played her character as pushy and determined but caring, especially when she wants specifically Ove to help her out. If in lesser hands, Parvaneh could become a nagger, which can become one note very easily. This doesn't happen with Pars as she allows the character to display her caring side, especially when she gets to know Ove more. It also helps that Par and Lassg\u00e5rd have good chemistry with each other, which permits the characters' relationship to evolve naturally.Ida Engvoll plays Sonja - Ove's wife. She mainly appears in the flashbacks with a younger Ove (played by Filip Berg). Engvoll portrays her as sophisticated, but with a sassy smile and a determination to help others as a teacher. There's also a no-nonsense element to her performance, which makes Ove's attraction to her all the more believable. This is especially true when Sonja out of the blue says that Ove will be a good father.As mentioned earlier, Filip Berg plays the younger Ove in the flashbacks. Berg brings kindness and awkwardness to the character, showing how he was before all the tragedies occurred. At first, Anglo-American viewers might think that he might be either George or Fred Weasley from the Harry Potter movies, but his deep baritone voice dispels any notion and matches that of Lassg\u00e5rd's. Both Berg and Engvoll have good chemistry, which make their characters' love for each other more believable.As much as everyone performs well in this movie, the strongest one undoubtedly belongs to Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd who plays the older titular character. The way he moves and speaks all embody a curmudgeon, but above all, he makes Ove more into a person that people can identify with than a caricature. Through his performance, Lassg\u00e5rd makes it clear that Ove fears being lonely and without purpose. Over the duration of the movie, Lassg\u00e5rd lightens up on Ove's curmudgeon ways while not entirely discarding them as the character helps others and opens up about his life and Sonja. The best indication of this emotional transformation is Lassg\u00e5rd smiling in the later parts of the movie when he's with Parvaneh or her daughters. Speaking of transformation, I have to talk about the makeup on Lassg\u00e5rd. Both him and Ove are 59 years old, but in the flick, Lassg\u00e5rd is made to look much older. This makes sense as the world has weighed Ove down so much that he has aged more. I didn't even realize that he had makeup on until I looked at actual photos of Lassg\u00e5rd, who has a full head of hair, and Ove has his balding gray tresses. The way that Lassg\u00e5rd is made up looks very realistic, and I can now understand why Eva Von Bahr and Love Larson got the nomination for Best Makeup at the 2016 Oscars. They deserved it.In summary, the film adaptation of \"A Man Called Ove\" proves that great movies can come from other languages because of its deep and simple nature. Holmes truly understood the spirit of the novel and conveyed that in a variety of ways, but the strongest element of the film are performances as it should be with a simple story like this. I can definitely see why the Academy decided to nominate it for Best Makeup and Best Foreign-Language Film at the 2016 Oscars. Like the novel, I recommend the flick to everybody as long as they don't let the subtitles get in the way.",

            "review_title": "A darkly funny portrait of love and grief in a cranky old man.",
            "content": "The cranky old man stereotype is universally found in fairy tales and films and are abundant in real life. They are easy targets to laugh at, pity, or to incite fear, and their grumpiness, loneliness, and declining relevance fuels their image. As if aging itself was not undignified enough, old men are also often depicted as mad or heading in that direction. In this context, A Man Called Ove (2016) is an unusually sympathetic, darkly funny, and insightful essay on the inner life of a lonely old man, playfully blended with themes of multi-culturalism in homogenous Swedish society.Ove (Rolf Lassgard) is the self-appointed superintendent of rules and manners in a small Swedish neighbourhood where everyone knows everybody. Having recently lost his wife to cancer and then retrenched after a lifetime on the railways, he is seriously suicidal. He fills his time by policing minor breaches of community rules with his gruff rebukes that keep the neighbourhood orderly. His daily patrols, helping the neighbours, and visiting his wife's grave are the only things keeping him alive. His tormented peace is disturbed when a noisy Iranian family move in next door. Even worse, they seem to be lovely people with nice children and they bring gifts of friendship at inconvenient times. Their arrival temporarily distracts Ove from his death-wish and whenever he readies the noose he is again interrupted by someone who needs him. Ove is always helping others while his own inner turmoil goes unrecognised.This simple, uneventful plot line is merely the picture frame for one of the most poignant portraits of grief you will find on film. While there is comedy aplenty in watching Ove relate to others, the deeper layers are anything but funny. The emotional pivot points of the story are Ove's grief and his promise to soon join his wife. If you are looking for comedy it is easy to miss glimpses of his deep despair mixed with his undiminished love for his wife. The acting comes from the school of understated realism and it avoids the melodrama that usually accompanies the grief genre. With deadpan Swedish gravitas, the most ordinary gesture, like Ove looking at his wife's photo or chatting at her graveside, is deeply moving. Frequent flashbacks fill out the story of Ove's life and towards the end of the film it is impossible to see him as just a cranky old man. The new family has given his life new meaning, and there are many beautiful moments shared between Ove and his pregnant neighbour. But he is always haunted by the promise to join his wife.There is a fine line between formulaic melancholy and the lyrical depiction of deep emotion. The Swedes are renown for doing deadpan comedy with dramatic force, and this trait shines in Ove. Little happens in terms of narrative propulsion, and any claim to originality is tenuous. The sheer force of the film lies in a lonely man's memories expressed through Ove's wide-eyed face. Some viewers may feel emotionally manipulated but that would be a harsh judgement. This is an outstanding film about universal emotions that all of us at some time will witness or experience.",

            "review_title": "Swedish curmudgeon warms to nice immigrant family",
            "content": "A Man Called Ove is a feel-good Swedish comedy that sidles up to the very serious problem of unassimilating immigrants from the Middle East \u2014 and the Swedes' increasing fear of them \u2014 then sappily slinks away, toothless. Ove's community of townhouses is a miniature of the regimented Swedish welfare state. Though deposed as board chair, Ove angrily continues to enforce the regulations. Rather than helping his neighbours, Ove refuses their requests and prefers vigilante law-enforcement. The film's central thrust is to discover the tragedy that created this bitter, selfish, righteous jerk. At the end, Ove not only abandons his own isolation but organizes the entire community to thwart the institutional attempt to take away his paralyzed old friend/enemy Rune. The flashbacks reveal Ove to have been a promising, solitary, nervous young man. He lost his mother as a boy, saw his father killed by a train while bragging about Ove's report card and stumbled into a marriage with the beautiful, smart Sonja. A bus crash aborts their child and leaves Sonja paralyzed. When she dies of cancer, Ove is encrusted with rage. If Sonja seems too good a catch for the unpromising Ove, her later career as a special needs teacher suggests she intuits potential others don't. Even Ove doesn't know his own continuing value, as his failures at suicide reveal. Hence neighbour Parvaneh's conclusion: \"You're amazingly crap at dying.\" Parvaneh is the film's crucial center: a pregnant Persian who fled Iran, married an affable but clumsy Swede and just became Ove's neighbour. Ove initially rages against the new family's incompetence, ignorance of the community's laws and rowdiness. He's warmed into accepting them. Their interchange represents traditional Sweden's encounter with immigrants from the Middle East. But this immigrant is a heavily sentimentalized soft-focus version of the immigration that is rupturing Sweden. Parvaneh is the idealized immigrant, with her two lovable Persian children to thaw Ove's heart, her tasty Persian cooking, her eagerness to join and to enjoy her new community. Director Hannes Holm's point is that this Other, an immigrant from that very different culture, is no threat to Sweden's traditional virtues but the opportunity for their renewal. This simplification undermines film's exhortation to embrace the immigrant. Because Sweden's threat is not from anyone like Parvanah, the domesticated, safe form of the Other, but from the violent jihadists and rapists that impose their old culture's values instead of accepting those of their new land. So the film does not really treat with the issue as it is problematically occurring but plays it in a much simpler, easier form. In sentimentalizing the immigrant the film ignores the real issue it purports to address. This sentimentalizing pervades the film. As if Parvanah's two little daughters were not enough to register Ove's revived feeling, he first confronts and threatens, then eventually adopts and sleeps with yet another Persian \u2014 the stray cat. So, too, the running joke about Ove's passionate commitment to the Saab automobile brand. That traditional value he inherited from his father. Its advantage is another metaphor for stasis: its mechanism does not require the propeller rod others do. If brand preference is a minor difference, here it balloons. Ove clashes with his kindred neighbour Rune when the latter opts for the Volvo family. The men's deepening hostility reflects in their graduation to higher models in their respective brands. Then Rune does the indefensible: embracing the German. When Ove rails against the German and the French cars, the film satirizes jingoism and belligerent nationalism as lightly and as safely as it did the issue of immigration. This very engaging, pleasant and reassuring film is fine \u2014 except for occupying the space and time that would have been better invested in a serious treatment of the issue it cites but evades.",

It was directed and written by Hans Holm, and it's based on the 2012 book, of the same name, by Fredrik Backman. The film stars Rolf Lassgard, Bahar Pars and Filip Berg. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards (including Best Foreign Language Film, at the 2017 Academy Awards). I enjoyed it.Ove Lindahl (Lassgard) is a 59-year-old widower, who's still grieving over the death of his wife (from six months earlier). To make things worse, he's forced to retire from his job (which he's worked at for 43 years). This pushes Ove to obsessively want to commit suicide, but he fails every time he attempts it (usually due to interruptions from his neighbors). Ove slowly starts to bond with these neighbors, despite being an extremely hard man to get along with, as he also constantly recollects on his past life.The movie is touching and surprisingly humorous. I'd even say it's more of a comedy than a drama, but that doesn't mean the characters aren't sympathetic still, or the drama isn't heartfelt (because those things are certainly true as well). The performances are all good, especially Lassgard in the lead, and it's definitely a well directed film. I can definitely see why it's received all of the acclaim that it's gotten too.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/208412653",

I guess the first one would be reflection on your life, especially when you get over 60 and people around you get sick, disabled or pass away.

But this is slowly revealed and we see someone who has a decent set of personal values that have been passed down by his father. He lives by these and expects others in the community to do the same. At first we think he is just a stickler for little things, but with the arrival of the new family next door, we soon find it is not little things that set him off, but only little things that represent major issues. I can see Ove as a great union steward, looking after his men and at the same time being loyal and hard working for his employer. Communities are built this way. The children next door immediately pick up on his inner nature, they are truly adorable. You can see that they immediately absorb is orderly and empathetic view of the world.",

            "content": "It's slightly annoying that I found about this Swedish film, based on the book of the same name, not long before watching the American remake starring Tom Hanks, but at least I got to watching the original version after. Basically, in Sweden, in a townhouse neighbourhood lives Ove (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd), a sixty-year-old widower curmudgeon with unwavering principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. He used to be the chairman of the neighbourhood association but was replaced by his former friend Rune (B\u00f6rje Lundberg). But Rune had a stroke some time ago and is now paralysed and being cared for by his wife, Anita (Chatarina Larsson). Ove is depressed following the death of his wife, Sonja (Ida Engvoll), a schoolteacher, six months ago from cancer. He has recently been pushed into retirement from his company after working there for 43 years. Ove is suicidal and buys rope from a supply store wanting to hang himself. But he is repeatedly interrupted by his new neighbours, Iranian immigrant Parvaneh (Bahar Pars), her Swedish husband Patrick (Tobias Almborg) and their two daughters, Sepideh (Nelly Jamarani) and Nasanin (Zozan Akg\u00fcn), who are moving in. During his suicide attempt, Ove has a flashback to his childhood. His mother died when he was a child, leaving him alone with his quiet father (Stefan G\u00f6dicke), who works at the train company as a mechanic. Ove gained knowledge of engines from his father and got a part-time job at the train yard. Ove did particularly well in his exams and his father wanted to spread the good news, but he failed to take care and was hit by a train and killed. Ove tries to kill himself again with carbon monoxide poisoning, using a hose to pump gas from the tank and inside his running car. Ove has another flashback and thinks back to his past when he fixed his house before it could be demolished. A house next door caught fire and Ove saved two people inside, but his house started burning and was not saved because the company planned to demolish it anyway. Ove is forced to sleep in a train, and when he wakes, he meets a young woman, Sonja, who buys his ticket. He is smitten with her and catches the same train every morning to see her again, and eventually they reunite in three weeks, and start dating. Ove's suicide attempt is interrupted by Parvaneh wanting a lift to the hospital because her husband has had an accident, falling from a ladder he borrowed from him. During the visit to the hospital, Otto gets into an argument with Beppo the Clown (Anna Granath). Later, Ove goes to the train station and plans to jump in front of a train. However, a man on the platform faints and falls onto the tracks, Ove jumps down and saves him. Ove is next annoyed by Parvaneh who needs driving lessons, which he eventually agrees to help her with. He is also forced to take in a stray cat because the neighbours are allergic. At a caf\u00e9, Ove tells Parvaneh about his past friendship with Rune, when they used to work together, and how they grew apart over the years, largely because of car preferences. Ove repairs a bicycle for teenager Adrian (Simon Edenroth) who delivers the newspapers and taking him to the kebab shop he meets another teen, Mirsad (Poyan Karimi), whose father disapproves of him being gay. Despite his improved relationships with his neighbours, the building companies are trying to force Rune into a nursing home. Ove tries to commit suicide using a shotgun but is interrupted by Adrian and Mirsad ringing his doorbell. Adrian says Mirsad had been thrown out after coming out to his family and needs a place to stay the night. Later, Ove opens up to Parvaneh her about what happened to Sonja. They went on a trip together while she was heavily pregnant, but while returning home the bus they were travelling on crashed, and it results in Sonja being paralysed and losing the baby. The local authorities ignored Ove's pleas to build wheelchair ramps, so he built some himself, allowing Sonja to continue working as a teacher before her death from cancer. Sometime later, Ove collapses and is taken to the hospital; Parvaneh laughs when a cardiologist tells her that Otto's heart is too big, due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Then Parvaneh goes into labour, giving birth to a baby boy. Ove gives gifts to Parvaneh's daughters, who refer to him as grandpa. As time passes, Ove is much friendlier to Parvaneh and her family, and all in the neighbourhood. A few months later, Parvaneh notices that Ove has not cleared his drive of snow, she and Patrick find that he has died in his sleep. A funeral is held, attended by his neighbours. The film ends with Ove reunited with Sonja on a train in the afterlife. Also starring Klas Wiljerg\u00e5rd as Jimmy, Johan Widerberg as Vitskjortan, Anna-Lena Brundin as Journalist Lena, and Viktor Baag\u00f8e as 7-year-old. Lassg\u00e5rd is good casting as the grumpy suicidal old man who is constantly irritated by his neigh bours who he considers \"idiots\" but slowly lightens up, and there is a good supporting cast. It is fair to say that my opinion of this version may have different if I had seen it before the remake, I did prefer the Hanks version, but all the same elements that made it worthwhile are in this one. The lead character being comically angry, the suicidal element, the flashback love scenes, and the well-timed funny and emotional moments, it's a reasonable comedy-drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, and Best Makeup and Hairstyling. Worth watching!",

The story, lifted from the pages of a popular novel, recycles the age-old theme of a cantankerous old dude who hates the ways of the modern world. While the resourceful Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd is in fine form in the lead, his character is too familiar to begin with. Director carefully follows the path well-travelled, which makes the whole movie seem more like a product than an actual work of art or self-expression.

I certainly liked how good the characters of Ove and Sonja looked together.And the plot and script never stay behind. The script was spontaneus, true and hilarious; this, along with the plot and the photography, creates a story that perfectly shows how invaluable is to have someone beside you when times are so hard; to have someone who makes you see that life is truly worthwhile and that everything is not lost.10/10.

            "review_title": "Despite sentimental diversions, this tale of a wily curmudgeon has occasional moments of genuine pathos",
            "content": "Released in 2016, A Man Called Ove was the Swedish entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards in 2017. Directed by Hannes Holm, it's based on Fredrik Backman's 2012 book of the same name. Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd plays Ove, a curmudgeon in his 60s, the former president of a neighborhood association of townhouses in a Swedish suburb.\nThe film is a drama with occasional comic moments. Despite patrolling the neighborhood with gusto, constantly looking for transgressors who break the rules (including driving one's car too fast through the development), Ove is actually quite depressed (chiefly linked to the death of his wife six months earlier and more recent loss of his long time job as an engineer).\nEach time Ove attempts to commit suicide (whether it's by hanging or asphyxiating himself by turning on the exhaust in his car for example), he's invariably interrupted by others who seek his help. His principal savior is Parvaneh,, an Iranian immigrant who's just moved in next door with her Swedish husband and two young children. She eventually gets Ove to open up after requesting favors of him including asking him to teach her how to drive and also babysit her kids.\nOve the film manages to have a big heart but eventually devolves into sentimentality. It's fairly predictable that the gruff Ove eventually will be able to let out his emotions, aided by Parvaneh, who makes him see that trying to kill himself is a bad idea, especially because he's someone who has much to offer.\nThe story also chronicles Ove's earlier life in a series of flashbacks-how he lost his mother as a young child and was close to his father who taught him how to repair car engines (one of Ove's life-long interests). Tragedy strikes a second time (the first being the death of his mother), when his father is hit by a passing train while on the job.\nThe third devastating tragedy is that his schoolteacher wife ends up paralyzed after their tour bus overturns on a vacation trip to Spain. Ida Engvoll is wonderful as Ove's young wife Sonja but has little to do in the part, which appears chiefly designed to evoke additional tears from an audience already inundated with a veritable heaping tablespoon of tragedy.\nOve's good character is made clear when he grudgingly helps others, which (in addition to his next door neighbor) also includes a friend of Sonja's former student who needs a place to stay after he reveals he's gay and is promptly kicked out of the house by an intolerant father.\nOve also saves a man who faints and falls on the train tracks. This leads to the resolution of the second act crisis, where Rune, Ove's rival, who took over as neighborhood association president, but is now semi-comatose after a stroke, is about to be put in a nursing home (against his wife's wishes), by \"whiteshirts\" (Ove's terms for heartless bureaucrats). A reporter who unsuccessfully attempts to interview Ove after he saved the man at the train station, ends up exposing the whiteshirts for some kind of real estate scam, and they back off sending Rune away.\nThe sentimental treatment of the handicapped Rune is coupled with additional comic asides which also don't work well at all (Ove's obsession with Saab cars over Volvos is one such example). Nonetheless, director Holm (who also wrote the screenplay), ends the narrative on the right unsentimental note: Ove initially appears to reach the end after collapsing and being diagnosed with an enlarged heart but manages to pull through, only to be found dead in his bed a few months later by his neighbors.\nA Man called Ove features a top-notch performance by noted actor Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd as the wily curmudgeon. Despite its sentimental moments, there's enough pathos here to sway even a critical film goer such as myself toward a modicum of approbation.",

            "content": "This review of A Man Called Ove is spoiler free**** (4/5)SENTIMENT IS A godsend, and to come across them these days is a real miracle that seemingly can't be done, in blockbusters maybe but in Hannes Holm's irresistible adaptation of Fredrik Backman's eponymous bestseller, A Man Called Ove has that and more. Holm gently matches beautiful material, emotional heft, and loving melodrama all in one and it's wonderful. Ove (Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd) is the grumpy man of the block \u2013 a 59-year-old retiree, who several years before the film's setting had been kicked out of the Condominium Association, yet he still angrily enforces rules for the isolated community, this turns him into the most hated man on the block. He writes down rules in his handy notepad, stops cars, and refuses to do the simplest tasks. He blames his wife's death on everyone and everything around him; he's always angry, shouting at people and terrifying animals. This perfect characterization comes with a flaw, he's terribly lonely, visiting the grave of recently deceased wife, and he tries to commit suicide. Until new neighbours move in. A young family of four. The young woman of this new family, Parvaneh (Bahar Pars) wants to meet her new neighbour, Ove doesn't want to know. Character-wise Ove is a lot like As Good As It Gets' Melvin Udall, he hates everyone and everything, until someone special takes a hold of his heart \u2013 that is Parvaneh and her two children. He starts to get used to her, he teaches her to drive, and he vows to baby-sit. And it's wonderful. Holms' direction is polished to near perfection, he handles Ove's story with fierce hands, there's no heavy touch, the way his camera moves through the community, the cemetery the detail is exquisite. It excels in its redemption tale setting, it's made with love, carefully mixing melodrama with dark comedy and Holm makes it work well. The material used from the novel is used beautifully. There's sympathy for him as visits his wife's grave, and as he wills to commit suicide. He's hilarious too, with his deadpan expression he's hilarious in his behaviour he utters the word idiot to passers-by, he imitates a Chihuahua plus his rivalry with people who own foreign cars is exceptionally funny. And he's emotional, thanks to timely flashbacks that carefully construct his life from the death of his mother, through growing up with his father, to the meeting of his wife, which combined with Lassg\u00e5rd's tour de force performance is a perfect storyteller. A Man Called Ove excels in brilliance, it's an incredibly human comedy which captures true sentiment and fires it like an arrow at your heartstrings; this could be one of the best films of the year by far. VERDICT: Flawless performances help convert this lovable tale onto the silver screen, with excellent execution in true sentiment and emotional heft.",

Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd can be so much better than this.It's typical Sweden and Swedish writers to write tragic situations and make swedes laugh about the it all to neglect the fact that it is tragic and should be processed for real to be better. To show the reality and twist it to the negative is to push people in one direction.... and then almost only that direction. So.... write something positive, something good and something that gives people a processing of a great future and joy.Lousy dialogue in several places and forced acting every now and then.Otherwise, this is a more than a good movie ... to be Swedish. Just the fact that most people use the argument \"good movie to be Swedish \", that says a lot.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Very nicely done. Great camera production and excellent quality of the film and the costumes for the time eras. - The actors : Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd is doing overall a approved character. - The story : Grumpy old man being bitter.... then turning around and everything is good.

This is the final straw and the two men refuse to have anything to do with the other...despite their shared principles. This is just the surface patina of an ocean of feelings that Ove cannot share as his wife has departed without him. He tends her grave daily and, almost as often, tries to commit suicide in order to be with her again. He is comically inept at this task and is tested sorely by the arrival of a mixed race family who take up residence next door. Through interactions with them, we get to learn of Ove's traumatic and sad life experiences and the joy that his wife Sonja represented to him.

I absolutely loved this film.It portrays the life of 59-year-old Ove as he gives up on life; his routine is interspersed with scenes of his past that tell us how he has become the man he is today. I have to say the performances were right on top. The two actors that portrayed this character were right on. I can see how the young Ove became the older one and why he resents everything and everyone - the light of his life, who made him the way he is, has gone.I thought this would be more depressing than it actually was. Yes, there were moments when I got teary-eyed because you can't help but relate to this guy and everything he is and has been through. However, I laughed out loud in more than one occasion and so did other folks in the audience. At the same time it is so tender and touching. Ove struggles all the way but his new neighbours, particularly the mom with her perpetual sunny smile on her face who is not afraid to rant right back at him cannot help but snap his out of his bad humour and make Ove open up to life.The photography is beautiful. The pace is as well. I thought there would be slow moments but there was no such thing. The scenes are every-day stuff for the most part but the interactions of Ove with other characters or animals or even his monologues at his wife's grave always have an element or two to perk things up, usually Ove's humour.There were only a couple of things I thought were overdone, like the bureaucratic character that seemed too vilified and a few other occasions that were exacerbated for comical value. However even despite that I cannot recommend this movie enough. It really is brilliant, a work of art. I am sure there is something in it that everyone can relate to.",

In fact, the story of a curmudgeon and his back story was almost certainly done before. And I agree that his personality was an expected result of his much-more outgoing and loving wife's death. So, that's it, you get the feeling that you've seen this one before except that the upbeat Iranian woman was probably Hispanic. Typical of foreign films, it's underplayed, but when you get right down to it, it's familiar and unsurprising.The actor who played Ove was good. The music, if there was any, was unobtrusive and forgettable. I've seen many worse movies of course, but the praise for this one is a bit hard to understand. If you like sentimental stories, you could do worse, but I just don't see anything special here.",

            "review_title": "A mixed result",
            "content": "In a Swedish townhouse community, Ove (Rolf Lassgard) is a long-time resident who is recently widowed. His grief only adds to his grouchy attitudes toward people who don't follow his standards of community living. His new neighbours are a young mixed-race family co-lead by Parvaneh (Bahar Pars), a very pregnant immigrant from Iran.Some of the best scenes in the film are those told in flashback as they explain how Ove developed such a negative attitude. The story (screenplay by Hannes Holm based on the book by Fredrik Backman) has a clever way of making us curious about finding the pieces of the past with various hints in the current story; and then satisfying our curiosity once such events are revealed in the parallel flashback story.Parvaneh's character is a bit of an anomaly. She can sometimes be annoying and take Ove for granted. Yet, the story seems to imply that she is there to \"humanize\" him. This might have worked better if her character had been more developed. Instead, too much time is spent on other subplots, sideshows and other characters that end up overcrowding the narrative. Some of the subplots also seem to be resolved unusually quickly.There seem to be messages like \"you can't go through life alone\" and themes of 'community values' which may be noble but their repetitions become didactic and annoyingly obvious and sentimental. Other themes work better such as the recurrence of administrators-from-hell (\"whiteshirts\" as Ove calls them), the insensitive bureaucrats that we can all recognize: Satan in multiple human forms.The conclusion is touching as it makes us have a better understanding about people who appear grouchy. Also, Lassgard gives a fine performance. But overall, the movie was rather mixed. The dramatic scenes are much better than the comedy scenes. Call me old-fashioned but I just don't find humour in repeatedly thwarted suicide attempts.",

In despair, he tries to take his own life, but it is interrupted by the neighbors over and over again.Even though he is unreasonably taking it out on others, you will somehow like him from the beginning. He is a self-made man with a sturdy body, maverick and dignified, resentful of bureaucracy, and no doubt in deep grief over the loss.He becomes acquainted with a new neighbor Parvaneh, an Iranian immigrant, pregnant wife next door. She has a lot of things that she needs help with. She dosn't have DIY tools, she has two kids to take care of, and she can't drive a car. It's funny that when Ove is trying to die, Parvaneh keeps pestering him for help. It's funny and heartwarming how he finds reasons not to die.In flashback scenes we see his earlier life. But I don't think the past part is as good as the present part. When he is young, it must be in the 70s, but the scenes do not look like that. And some events are too dramatic to take seriously.Back in the present, he finds people who need help other than Parvaneh. Some are minorities of some kinds. And through helping him, always reluctantly though, he is recovering his trust in people. I also like the tranquiel atmosphere in the neighborhood where we see human bonds are becoming restored in a touching and humorous way.",

After losing his job, Ove hastily contemplates joining his departed wife through suicide attempts that are continuously interrupted by neighbors. These same neighbors unexpectedly brightens and adds purpose to his mundane life.Appreciating the film means appreciating Ove's character. There is 100% comedy in his hatred for disorder, bureaucracy and Volvo Cars, but there is also heart in his selflessness. Through this, he gains purpose by becoming a father figure, ultimately allowing others to see deep under his protective exterior. Aided by a very sincere performance by Rolf Lassgard, I for one, was moved his resilience and change of heart. The storytelling & screenplay of this film deserves praise as well for its clever approach. From the unforced shift to flashbacks, to the timely revelation of the supporting characters' intentions, there is plenty of intrigue and comedy to go around. The only bone to pick here is the abundance of moments that are too insistently sentimental for my taste. Nevertheless, the message of A Man Called Ove is well received. It is a wholesome and endearing film about connections we make along the way, with a story too funny and moving to cast aside.",

In the English translation of the book, the story captures the cultural and emotional nuances of Ove's relationships and interactions within his neighborhood. Ove is not only portrayed as cantankerous and intolerant, he is also a warm, tolerant and generous human being who is dealing with significant grief. The book covers his many relationships within his neighborhood in much detail and it is from these that we learn the warm side of Ove. Some of these more significant relationships (e.g. Jimmy)are brushed over in the movie and therefore don't build the richness that is evident in the book. I suppose it's always a big ask to capture in film what makes such a successful book as A Man Called Ove. However, it's not impossible (e.g. Last Orders by Graham Swift). These criticisms aside, Rolf Lassgard as Ove (senior) and Filip Berg as Ove (younger) give commendable performances, Bahar Pars as Parvaneh less so.

He's a gruff bear of a man, cynical and snappy, and if someone would like to really know him, they need lots of patience. I rarely say this, but the score is fitting and sensitive, while avoiding the common trap of sentimentality. There were 2 things which were shortcomings: the film is entirely too long (by at least 30 minutes). I was nearly sighing at the end, because the story suffered a bit from the predictability. The ending was fine enough, but I had hoped for something more open-ended. Aside from these things, I would highly recommend this film.",

            "content": "This is a funny movie, perhaps it is tragic comedy somehow. The story is about a man that has a life full of bad events outside his control. When he is really young his mother dies and he is left alone with his father. So he grows up with his father. It seems as they only talk cars and not much more, but his father says that it is the only thing he needs to know in order to get by. In a way that seems more right, considering the outcome of his life events. You will understand it, when you see the film. Anyway, this movie really starts off when Ove is a older man living on his own. He looses his job and his life takes another turn. But on this way we get to see flashbacks to the life Ove has lived. The flashbacks make us understand Ove a bit more. I would consider it as Ove had a hard life, but he seems to have adapted to circumstances. He has also been good in accomplishments, when he has set a goal. You will understand that too, if you see the movie. I laughed a lot in this film, then at times it was tragic and there was nothing to really laugh about. It is about life, both joy and sadness and how you as a person can handle it. We are all different. Ove has his routines and we could say he likes routines. Every week he visits his wife's grave and talks to her. He tells her what is going on, as if she was still alive. I consider Ove a simple man, he likes his routines. Who doesn't? Ove is no different from other's that like routines. But then a new family moves in to the neighboring house and Ove's routines are changed. So what happens when Ove's routines change? Is it changing differently than all other strange events in his life? Well Ove is a interesting man. I would say a strong man, a man that adapts to the circumstances given. I like this routine-like movie with comedy and sorrow. It is a about a possible life, a life that someone could have. Ove is a unique person, who dares to be himself. I wish you do too. If you want to enjoy a good story in happiness and tears, then perhaps A man named Ove could help you with that? The part of Ove is well played, the actor seems like he is Ove himself. He makes laughter and convinces the viewer he is \"Ove\", even though it is all just fiction. It is not an action, it is not a drama, even though this tragedy contains drama too. It has a melancholic feel to it, but yet enjoyable with the possibility to bring laughter to those small moments of joy.",

            "content": "This movie was an adaptation of the book \"The Man Called Ove\". I both read the book and watched the movie. I can't say I liked them but it's the case when you can say that you something could learn from that. I mean I noticed and observed a lot of things from this creation that could help me understand myself better or even to become a better person. I'm gonna write my review considering both the book and the movie. Btw, I have to say that the movie was made pretty close to the script of the book. It's a story of a man who lost his wife at the beginning of his sixties. The man called Ove and he decides to commit suicide because he doesn't see any sense of life without his wife. But all the time he tries to do that he was interrupted by his new neighbor, a young Persian woman who was pregnant. And between all these interruptions we're shown the moments from his past. So we're learning how he met his wife, whose name was Sonja, many details of their relationship. Once they had a road accident and due to that his wife becomes disabled and she couldn't walk anymore. In the book, the author says that Ove never had lived before he met his wife so after she had passed away Ove died inside again. You know, the author of the book tried to show Ove like a man who doesn't like to talk but rather prone to do. So he was a man of deeds but not words. Also, we're shown that Ove is addicted to rules. He always puts rules above people. His wife was an educated person unlike her, Ove never read a book. Besides being a quite educated person, Sonja was a beautiful woman who can choose any man. But for some reason she chose Ove. The author says that she chose him because he had looked at her like no one before, that she saw at him something real and sincere though Ove almost had never spoken. He spoke only when he needed to complain or whine about somebody or something that had broken some of his rules. As we can see he was kind of a bore. And he had nothing in common with his wife. I think that Sonja, like the majority of women, chose him just because she wanted to have by her side a responsible and reliable man. It always seems safe. Is it right? I think it's a matter of personal choice. So finally, the meeting of Ove with his Persian neighbor fully changed his life. He started to pay attention to the people around him and he changed his mind to commit suicide. So in summing up, I want to say that Ove, of course, couldn't be a role model, but at the same time, you could find some of Ove character traits in yourself, and then you could use the Ove's recipe how to change yourself.",

Then, through flashbacks of several failed suicides, the audience slowly experiences the growth history of an honest and shy boy, as well as the endless regret surrounding the unexpected farewells in his life.Child, her mother died young, he can't feel any sadness because he's way too young to accept that his mother passed away. He watched his father cry desperately at the funeral; he emotionlessly watched his mother's coffin was carried out from the church door. Then, finally, this young kid raised his head. He recalled, \"The first farewell to the most important person in my life was so silent and unconscious.\"When he was young, his father had a sudden accident; it happened right after he and his father celebrated for the good grades he got from school. As a child who is not good at expressing his feeling through words and does not like to show his emotions, he accepts these heartbroken moments without tears on his face.When Ove gets to seventy, his wife also passes away. Once again, his beloved. He acted as nothing had happened. Later on, he can't control the sadness in his heart anymore; he decides to commit suicide, but he fails after trying several times.In the end, the old man Ove died peacefully, and he woke up; he saw his wife on the train, where he met his wife for the first time, just like when they're dating, Ove holds his wife's finger again. His life ended with this beautiful ending...",

While his transformation over the course of the film isn't entirely believable, it's hard not to get caught up in his evolution into a man who is willing to reach out to others to help them live while simultaneously wishing for nothing but his own death.  Rolf Lassgard is excellent in the lead role, as is Bahar Pars, the new neighbor who leads him out of the dark shadows of his life.  Despite the sorrow that lingers in the background throughout the movie, there is a strange light that keeps things afloat, providing just enough subtle humor to make the whole thing worthwhile.",

My impression from just briefly reading reviews in 2016, was that it was slow-moving story about a grumpy old man.  While it does contain those two factors, this film is so much more.\n\nA Man Called Ove was funny, clever, great dialogue, beautifully shot scenes and even a great soundtrack  for the movie's conclusion. This is a Swedish movie, so there is angst,  bittersweet themes and more acting than action. It is very nationally telling that in Sweden, this film is considered a comedy. While it did go dark and emotional, it never pandered. The humor was blended smoothly into the story. My attention was held throughout the entire runtime. Ove's journey from childhood, to a newly wed and finally an old man flowed smoothly even with the occasional flashbacks.  These breaks from the current timeline of Ove's old age were expertly inserted by the director (Hannes Holm) and editor (Fredrik Morheden) with no unnecessary exposition. Every actor portrayed a believable human,not just a manufactured character. Tom Hanks' production company, Playtone, will be remaking this film with Tom Hanks attached to star as the Ove character. While Tom Hanks is probably the best choice for Ove, I hope that this remake does not become a pale copy of the original film.",

Rolf Lassgard is indeed wonderful as Ove, likewise Filip Berg as his younger self, and Ida Engvoll as the love of his life.

A Man Named Ove (En Man Som Heter Ove)\n\n\"Stepping from the pages of Fredrik Backman's international best-selling novel, Ove is a quintessential grumpy old man next-door, strictly enforced principles and a short fuse.  Still grieving his late wife, Ove has largely given up on life until a boisterous young family moves in next-door and forces him out of his shell in this heartwarming tale that reminds us that life is sweeter when it's shared.\" ~iTunes.com\n\nI wasn't sure if we'd enjoy A Man Named Ove with it's tagline \"Misery Hates Company\".  However, we thoroughly enjoyed the unraveling of Ove's story through his memories during his failed suicide attempts. It crisscrosses genres from the blackest of comedies to tearjerker to walking the tightrope between sweet and saccharine sentimentality.  And it pulls it off splendidly. \n\nAvailable at ORL & iTunes.\n\nI give A Man Named Ove 5 frayed nooses out of 5.\n\n#filmreview #howisawit #amannamedove",

First Ove and his buddy took better care of living compound better than government officials AKA idiot white shirts. Said white shirts also arbitrarily burn down houses no matter if people are still inside and white shirts can have folks institutionalized against the wishes of there families. Healthy competition between Ove and his neighbor over there cars result in both diving nice cars. Such is the power of competition to do good things. The kicker was the vacation. They could have drove but his wife said the bus was more romantic. She obviously never traveled by gray hound. The bus crashes of course and leave his wife without the use of her legs, thus disparaging mass transit. \"If only Ove would have drove.\" Our heroic self made stoic individualist eventually dies of too large a heart, found with \nhis cat sleeping peacefully on his still chest.\nI enjoyed watching, but by the end of the movie I found myself questioning the motive behind this flick. I think the motive is glaring obvious.",

Many of the jokes are so unexpected that you not only laugh at their actual nature, but also at how surprising they are. Ove is the classic elderly curmudgeon with no perceived place in life or any more use to society. The film does bear very close resemblances to pictures such as Gran Torino, and suffers from a pervading sense of predictability. Fortunately it never rests on its laurels, delivering many moments of heartfelt humility and laugh out loud hilarity. The dialogue is razor-sharp and its story spectacularly well observed, capturing exactly what it's like to be in a state of obsolescence while also trying to control what's happening around you. Ove is a miserable antisocialite, but he gets plenty of chances to display real humanity while still never losing his gruff demeanour. What's so effective about the comedy is that it exists not to provide a succession of cheap laughs, but to force us to address some cruel realities including disability, bereavement and even suicide. Most would find this in poor taste, but for me there's no better way to combat the grim issues we face than through a comedic lens. Had this movie gone the other way and leant in the direction of saccharine sentimentalism, it would have flopped badly and been near-insufferable. But as is, it's frank, smart, loveable and oh so hilarious.",

I resigned myself to seeing it due to its Oscar nomination for Best Makeup and Hairstyling but immediately became entranced by its perfect blend of comedy and drama.  Ove (pronounced \"Oo-veh\") is one of the grumpiest men that you will ever meet and his story shows that it is never too late in life for a change of heart.  It is an incredible example of patient storytelling that discloses small details of a larger story to develop the characters until the big reveal toward the end of the film.  Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd commands the screen with his deep bass voice and old man posture.  He manages to be dislikable, intimidating, endearing, and humorous all at the same time.  He also shows an amazing transition as he forms an unlikely bond with his new neighbor, played by Bahar Pars.  Filip Berg is believable as a younger version of Ove and Ida Engvoll turns in a charming performance as Sonja.  All of the acting hits on the realism and humor that is needed for the film's dichotomy.  The makeup/hairstyling team of Eva von Bahr and Love Larson deserve the Oscar for their work on this film.  Lassg\u00e5rd is a youthful-looking man with a full head of hair and their ability to physically transform him into an elderly bald man is remarkable.  This film was shot using a lot of close-ups and the make-up looks great from every angle.  You may wonder why they didn't just cast an actual old man in this role but you will understand once you see the emotionally charged performance by Lassg\u00e5rd.  I don't know if this film can win the Best Hairstyling and Makeup Oscar because it is difficult for foreign films to compete with American franchises like Star Trek, but I would love to see it acknowledged for their excellent work.  While I enjoy foreign films, it is rare for me to rank them higher than an American equivalent.  Ove is one of those films.  I hope that they never adapt this with English speakers because nothing can ever top the original Swedish version (sound familiar, \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\"?)  Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Score, even Best Picture - I would have nominated Ove for all them.  \"A Man Called Ove\" is a must-see for every movie fan.  You will laugh its dark humor, shed many more tears than you expect (at several times throughout the film), and be left with one of the most perfect endings of any film that you will ever see.",

I've always been a fan of self-contained films that don't require too many locations in order to tell the story at hand, but this is one of the most impressive films I have ever seen accomplish that. Not to say that the camerawork feels like a documentary, but director Hannes Holm creates an atmosphere of characters that seems as though they exist out in the world somewhere. From all of its subtleties, to all of its ambitious plot points, A Man Called Ove is not just a great Swedish film, but one of the best films I was able to see in all of 2016. Here is why I believe you should run (not walk) to check out this film.\n\nWhether or not you can speak the Swedish dialect, A Man Called Ove is a must-see film. That's really all you need to know in my opinion, due to the fact the plot details reveal themselves slowly throughout the film. For that reason, I'm only going to touch on a few things that stood out to me. The basic premise is that a man has lost his wife from an unknown cause and finds himself in constant mourning. Never a hit in making friends, this lonely man named Ove finds himself wanting to commit suicide in order to be with his wife. Every time he is about to commit suicide, something prevents it from happening. Making friends with new neighbours that move in, the film begins to balance some happy and sad flashbacks, revealing he and his wife's past. That is as much as I can say without giving away the incredible conclusion this film has.\n\nPeriodically, the film flashes back to explore the relationship that Ove had with his wife Sonja. At its core, there really are two stories happening here. One about an elderly man living alone and the other a love story about a very unlikely couple. Their relationship in the past was a joy to see, because it added the much-needed levity to an otherwise somber film. It keeps you engaged throughout the entire duration, due to the fact that the present day material is great and the material in the past constantly reveals new things about certain characters, giving more meaning to the present day. Also, the ending to this film is absolutely stunning in my opinion, and that wouldn't have been possible without the flashbacks. A Man Called Ove is a great lesson for film student who wish to know the perfect use of a flashback.\n\nAs mentioned above, the direction of this film by Hannes Holm is incredibly sincere and some of the best I have seen from any independent production in 2016. With very few characters, he is able to create a world around them that feels incredibly well-realized and lived-in. A Man Called Ove is a rare film that gets better as it progresses and more in revealed, meaning that a second viewing will be warranted and will make the film even better once you know everything. That is no small feat for a picture to accomplish, but this one does it in spades. I loved every second of this directors vision for this beautiful (albeit heartbreaking) story.\n\nIn the end, as I look back on A Man Called Ove, I appreciate it more and more, due to the fact that it really is a film that tries to get your spirits up. Beginning with an elderly man who wants to commit suicide is not enjoyable in any way, but the way that he is brought out of that way of thinking was amazingly bittersweet. With fantastic character development and a conclusion that had me in tears, I really couldn't find much to dislike about A Man Called Ove. It's one of the best films in all of 2016, at least in my opinion, and I high recommend checking it out. Its Oscar nomination for best foreign film is more than well-deserved. This is exactly the right way to make a character study. I love A Man Called Ove.",

But when some gregarious new neighbors humorously worm their way into his sullen, solitary existence, they, along with a series of poignant, well-placed flashbacks, reveal the heartbreaking events that made Ove the man he is today. The film starts very slowly, gradually building to a beautiful, emotional ending, underscored by a heartfelt-but-not-maudlin performance by Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd. He, along with impressively spot-on casting (the younger Ove and Sonja, played by Filip Berg and Ida Engvoll, are amazingly convincing) make this superb tearjerker pretty darn close to perfect. A",

Very cool characters and our main guy is terrificly acted out by Rolf Lassg\u00e5rd - a very underated actor in my opinion. The story is sad but very heartwarming and it's guaranteed to give you plenty of laughs. Brilliantly told and paced and some neat tricks when it comes to the photography. A few flaws, like when Ove nearly beats up a guy using his horn and some other overdone scenes. Some too expected turns also takes place, but it never kill the film. \n\nI love the score and the feelgood vibe this film brings to me. Not a straight forward feel good flick, but it really does have that vibe. I also dig the cat.\nThe film reminds me of a mixture of \"Gran Torino\" and \"En ganske snill mann\" mostly, but several films got similarities. Still it manage to stand out well. A touching and very entertaining film - not the most typical combination, but a very solid one. Expected a typical semi-funny flick, but was acutally blown away. Great stuff!\n\n8.5 out of 10 black cats crossing.",

The well known  Swedish actor, Rolf Lassgard. portrays Mr. Ove in this story of a widowed senior who confronts the loss of his wife and ponders his future as he meets and interacts with new neighbors and acquaintances in the small town where he and his wife lived. This is a simple film filled with simple characters who in some way or another bring hope and joy to their otherwise bland existences. What makes the film work is that it is effortless viewing as the audience, via flashback, witnesses the youth and adulthood of Mr. Ove and how, in each instance, he plays the hands life has dealt him. I give the film an 8.0 with a note to anyone wishing to see it that it will no longer be distributed and available for viewing after October 13, an indeed unlucky number for anyone who misses it.",

This is the tale ofThe life after the loved one departed.24 January 2017This is a Swedish film based on the book of the same name. It is sent to represent the nation at the 2017 Oscars and as for now, it made into the December shortlist. This is the tale of an old grumpy man and the life after the death of his wife. That would be a toughest phase of life for anybody. I am sure you had seen many films like this, but this one was slightly different, yet totally convincing on every topic it focused on. So funny, at a time meaningful and emotional, particularly how the tale ends.In a small township, a 59 year old man called Ove lived most of his life and now he decides to take his life. But the attempt was prevented when a new lousy neighbour arrives and so it keep delays further. Now's the time to reveal all the reasons behind his dreadful decision with lots of flashbacks and current affairs. That he's a nightmare in his neigbourhood to those who break the rules. He's not a friendly type, because of his childhood and the lessons he learnt from his father to face the life as tough it gets.The only friend he ever had did not last for a long. His wife was his world and then the job at the railway. The narration given a good enough focus on his romance life. His younger version, played by another actor reveals particularly the initial stage like how he had met her. I don't know these actors, but they all were so good. A perfect setting as well for the story to take place. I think the filmmakers did lots of best decisions and in the end it all paid off with a greater recognition in the international level.\"Honesty is the best thing, Ove. But sometimes honesty needs a little help.\"A heartwarming comedy-drama for all age groups. I was looking for such a film and I realised only after watching it. The character Ove was designed awesomely and all the story events built around him was excellent. Covered most of the topics like friendship, love, neighbours, job, moral values, even the pet animals. Loads of fun, guaranteed entertainment if you are seeking a comedy film. As Ove was portrayed very seriously, all his actions, especially the newly arrived woman make major difference to end the film most comedic way.The regularly visiting his wife's grave, the film beautifully gives an insight on the life of Ove being a widower and a retiree. But also how it all turns around for him who never laughs and finally he does, was the film's highlight. Like I always say, I'm not a book person, but I love watching films based on the good books like this one. An awesome adaptation and I hope those who loved the book, as well enjoyed the film.Usually all the good films run nearly or over two hours. Because of the slow and steady developments in its characters and the story. For this film, you won't notice the time. The pace of the narration, including the lovable characters and the storyline makes you forget everything else. In a few days the 89th American Academy Awards nominees will be announced and I am sure it will make. Looks like this year, three Scandinavian films going to make the noise at the Oscars. In the meantime, I hint you not to miss it, either it wins or lose, it is one of the best films of the year around the world.8/10",

I have read the novel its based on and I recognised most of what happened from my recollections of the book. Its a bit like a Scandinavian version of Victor Meldrew from the BBC sitcom One Foot In The Grave - Ove is a decent guy who has had a slightly tough past but he comes across as quite snippy and oaf-ish, although he's more likeable than would first appear. It certainly has a sentimental aspect, although it is seemingly quite bleak certainly at the start. As a trigger warning, it does show preparations for suicide attempts, which may upset some, so bare that in mind. I thought the main character was very well portrayed by the actor Rolf Lassgard.It may feature some dark comedy, undoubtedly, but it also felt like quite a re-assuring film and I thought it was well done. Also, here is one short line of dialogue I remember, that made me smile (it was said by Ove himself, responding to someone complaining about him near his house):-'old man? im not your old man, **** - im angry man!' heh!.
