            "content": "This is definitely the type of simple film that many might dismiss when first hearing about it or seeing the promotional footage of it. What's really surprising about it is the amount of emotional and dramatic weight that it carries. It's not primarily interested in gun fights or car chases. Instead, it's interested in exploring the dynamics of race and culture, and in depicting everyone as flawed individuals who you still feel empathy for. It gives you a portrayal of what poverty and the economy can do, even when never attempting to justify the horrible behavior on display or trying to make excuses for its characters. It's filled with wonderful, thoughtful dialogue while also playing out like a realistic morality tale. The three leads are also fantastic, especially Ben Foster, who deserves to get more roles as the talented character-actor he is. This is highly recommended.",

I thought it was another dumb movie about inept country-bumpkins, which would rely on a mixture of slapstick and overly-done sappy and violent scenes in order to create enough of a pull to keep at least some audience members somewhat entertained.How wrong I was. I finally sat down and watched it with friends who insisted it was not what it appeared to be within the first few minutes of the film. Without giving too much away, and having to use a spoiler tag, Hell or High Water is a story about two brothers who after the death of their mother, organize a series of (justified?) bank robberies. What ensues is a catch-me-if-you-can scenario with the pursuing \"law\" hell-bent on catching them, and them hell-bent on not being caught. In short, it is a typical story of cops and robbers (or so you would think), with an atypical, uncommon and unconventional narrative. Given the plot, the remote setting and the almost nostalgic atmosphere and ambiance of the film, it is honestly a miracle, and more than a pleasant surprise, just how very gratifying and outstanding this film actually is.A definite must-watch.",

            "content": "Bank robberies have been featured in many hundreds of films since the early days of cinema: The Great Train Robbery for example dates back to 1903! More recent heist classics such as \"Oceans 11\", \"Die Hard\", \"Run Lola Run\" and \"The Dark Knight Rises\" tend towards the stylised end of the act. Where this film delivers interest is in aligning the protagonists' drivers with the banking and mortgage 'crimes' featured in last year's \"The Big Short\". Add in to the movie Nutribullet a soup\u00e7on of the West Texan setting from Arthur Penn's 1967 \"Bonnie and Clyde\", turn it on and you have \"Hell or High Water\".Chris Pine (\"Star Trek\") and Ben Foster (\"Inferno\", \"The Program\") play brothers Toby and Tanner Howard trying to rescue their deceased mother's ranch from being foreclosed on by Texas Midlands bank. Rather than taking one of the \"get out of debt\" offers advertised on billboards \u2013 cleverly and insistently introduced in long panning highway shots \u2013 the brothers have their own financial plan: a scheme that involves early morning raids of the cash drawers of small-town Texas Midlands branches. But the meticulous planning of Toby, as the calm and intelligent one, are constantly at risk of upset by the unpredictable and violent actions of the loose-cannon Tanner.Since the amounts of cash stolen are in the thousands rather than the millions, the FBI aren't interested and the case is handed instead by aged and grumpy Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges, \"True Grit\") and his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham). The pair have a respectful relationship but one built around racial banter, with Hamilton constantly referring to Alberto's Mexican/Comanche heritage. A cat and mouse game ensues with the lawmen staking out the most likely next hits. The sonorous cello strings of the soundtrack portend a dramatic finale, and we as viewers are not disappointed.The performances of the main leads are all excellent, with Chris Pine given the chance to show more acting chops than he has had chance to with his previous Kirk/Jack Ryan characters. His chemistry with Ben Foster is just sublime. Similarly, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham make for a formidable double act. It is Jeff Bridges though who has the standout performance and one that is Oscar nominated for Best Supporting Actor. (In fact with Michael Shannon also getting nominated in the same category for \"Nocturnal Animals\", we can add 'West Texan lawman' to 'Holocaust movies' (a Winslet \"Extras\" reference there!) as the prime bait for Oscar nomination glory!)The real winner here though is the whip-smart screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (\"Sicario\") which sizzles with great lines: lines that make you grin inanely at the screen regularly through the running time.\"In your last days in the nursing home, you'll think of me and giggle\" schmoozes Tanner to the pretty hotel check-in girl: a come-on clearly worth remembering as it delivers the goods, as it were.The trick here is in building up a degree of empathy and sympathy for the characters on both sides. The 'bad guys' here are successfully portrayed as the banks. Before the 2017 awards, you could get 25/1 odds on this winning the Best Original Screenplay Oscar \u2013 but I would personally rate it right up there with \"Manchester by the Sea\".Deftly directed by Scot David Mackenzie (\"Starred Up\") this is a film (the first of two!) that might well have elbowed it's way into my Top 10 of 2016 if I'd seen it during its cinema release. Well worth catching on the small screen.(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the- movie-man.com).",

            "content": "One of the most critically acclaimed films of 2016 and nominated for four Oscars, 'Hell or High Water' also had an intriguing idea, a talented cast with Jeff Bridges being a particular attraction and a script by ace writer Taylor Sheridan (writer for the brilliant 'Sicario', and went on to direct one of the most promising directorial debuts of 2017 with the recent 'Wind River').'High or High Water' was not a let down in any way. One of the finest films of 2016 and to me all its four Oscar nominations were among the year's most deserving (Bridges' nomination for Best Supporting Actor should have been a strong contender for winning). It is not the most original of stories sure, but that did not matter at all because it executed all its components impeccably and still had its share of surprises. It does have a slow start somewhat but not in any way a want-to-switch-it-off way.Along with 'La La Land' (it has become popular to hate that film, loved it personally), 'Hell or High Water' was one of the year's best-looking films. It has a rustic Western look in terms of setting that is very effectively evoked and it is stunningly shot. It should have been a contender for Best Cinematography, but at least got some recognition for the concise editing.The rip-roaring, at times hauntingly elegiac and at other times rousing, soundtrack enhances everything going on on screen. That one of the best scores that year was not even nominated and the pretty awful score for 'Jackie' (one of the worst things about a disappointing film) was even to a very subjective reviewer, who absolutely despises the \"I don't understand...\" and all its various other just as clich\u00e9d, overused and abused variations, is not easy to fathom.Best Original Screenplay was very much deserving, with Sheridan once again striking gold with a snappy, smart and tightly structured script. While meditative in pacing, the story is nonetheless absorbing and surprisingly rich in its complexity. It's also intricately told and with a mix of the hard-edged and the elegiac.David Mackenzie does a remarkable job directing, getting the most out of the story and atmosphere and bringing out the best of his cast. Chris Pine's lead performance is one of his best, but it's the supporting cast that shine more.Ben Foster, in a role that is the polar opposite to Pine's and perhaps the slightly more interesting, is a revelation, even more is an astounding Jeff Bridges who completely disappears into his role to unforgettable effect. One must also single out Gil Birmingham, who really wrenched the heart in this year's 'Wind River' and gives a different but every bit as wonderful turn here.In conclusion, wonderful film and a 2016 highlight. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "David Mackenzie's 'Hell or High Water' is A Terrific Movie, that turns out to be an unexpected delight of the Summer. With underwhelming superhero movies or reboots doing the rounds, this Heist/Crime Motion-Picture offers a Solid Story, that is Sharply Written, Expertly Directed & Very Strongly Acted. 'Hell or High Water' Synopsis: A divorced dad and his ex-con brother resort to a desperate scheme in order to save their family's farm in West Texas.'Hell or High Water' is a story of family & crime. You watch the 2 brothers rob banks, as they are tired of being poor & they indulge in aggression. And then you have Two Texas Rangers, after them, because they're wearing a uniform & they serve for the protection of the people. Its the difference of dynamics between its characters that make 'Hell or High Water' a solid watch. I wan engrossed by the camaraderie of the 4 characters, they are interesting to watch & hear. 'Hell or High Water' is perfectly paced, as the narrative hits the nail & culminates in a crisp 101-minutes. The film begins with a punch & ends on the very same note. I was thoroughly engrossed by the story & how well it progressed. Taylor Sheridan's Screenplay is Sharp. His Writing is tops, allowing us to get into the story & have an interesting experience. David Mackenzie's Direction is expertly done. He's handled the film, with command. Giles Nuttgens' Cinematography is fantastic. West Texas has been captured beautifully. Jake Roberts' Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Nick Cave & Warren Ellis's Score is good. Action-Sequences are well-done, as well. Performance-Wise: 'Hell or High Water' is filled with superior performances. Jeff Bridges steals the show as the senior Texas ranger, who's sly sense of humor with his Indian partner (a fabulous Gil Birmingham) & skill to put things together & get to the criminals, is delightful. Bridges gets his character spot-on & proves once again, that he's among the Greatest we've ever had. As the 2-brothers who go on bank-robbing spree, Chris Pine & Ben Foster are in top-form. Pine is a revelation, delivering a mature, restrained performance, while Foster, an actor who's potential isn't new to know, continues to astonish, with his enviable talent for playing unpredictable, unlikable characters. Also, the on-screen chemistry between Pine & Foster, appears real & affecting.On the whole, 'Hell or High Water' is a Winner! Don't Miss It!",

            "content": "Look at Chris Pine trying to prove he's not just a pretty face doing these small films that show his range, and show how he can do accents, but seriously, Pine was totally in his element here.Jeff bridges gave a great performance that matches his cowboy ethics in True Grit, playing a very old school Texas Ranger hunting down Pine and Ben Foster who play brothers robbing banks. A little in the Archie Bunker Territory when dealing with his Mexican, Native American partner, but all the way likable.Ben Foster was fantastic as well,as the bad apple big brother looking for redemption. Very dynamic acting, by all three main actors.The music really adds to the cool western feel, putting me in the cowboy mode. I thought it was interesting that they had one scene in the movie in which real life cowboys herding cattle appear, in a movie about the movie style cowboys, and it's some real cowboy stuff going on here.It's very macho without turning off the indi crowd that would love this film. There's a scene in the movie when Jeff Daniels Character confronts one of the bank robbers and it was like Eastwood and Wayne back in the day, man. It just wraps up the whole vibe of the movie in one swoop. I feel like it's the type of movie everyone in Texas should love.And it's very Texas (or rather what I expect from Texas): every dinner only sells streak, It's hard to be a armed bank robber because at least two people in the bank carry a gun. The film does use Texas as a perfect pocket for all American life with the bank robbers having a bigger agenda to save the land they own and secure a future for their family, screwing over the bank that's screwing them.It has the same appeal of the Timber when it comes to today's Westerns, but it's setting in contemporary times but with that old fashion tone gives it an edge.http://cinemagardens.com/",

            "review_title": "A morally complex \"cops-and-robbers\" film",
            "content": "In a year when the quality of life in middle America small towns has come back into focus, \"Hell or High Water\" feels like an important film, perhaps more important than it might have been had it been released prior to 2016. But it's not just timeliness that makes this a good movie. There are strong performances and strong writing Taylor Sheridan, someone we should definitely be paying more attention.The \"Sicario\" writer returns with another tale set near the U.S.-Mexico border, this one following two poor West Texas brothers, Tanner and Toby Howard, one an ex-con (Ben Foster) and the other a divorced father of two (Chris Pine), who start robbing banks for petty cash. Their objective is to make enough money to pay off the bank before it forecloses on their recently deceased mother's ranch, which she willed to her grandsons. The property also happens to be sitting on enough oil to guarantee the boys' future.With the stolen amounts too small to warrant attention from the FBI, a nearly retired Texas Ranger named Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and his partner, Alberto (Gil Birmingham), are assigned to track down the robbers and the cat-and-mouse game begins.The characters could be distilled to two outlaw anti-heroes and the ranger on their tail who is about to hang it all up, but Sheridan's script evolves beyond the archetypes and into complicated, ugly territory, which is exactly where he took 2015's \"Sicario.\" Whereas most cops-and-robbers stories have clear good guys and bad guys, this one doesn't. Foster's Tanner is the wild one who can take things too far and lacks a moral compass, but he's fiercely loyal and devoted to his brother. Pine's Toby seems good through and through, but he has a violent streak and their whole illegal scheme is his idea. Even Bridges' smart, shiny-badged old ranger has a slightly bigoted attitude that often expresses itself to his half-Mexican, half-Native American partner.All this \"gray\" makes watching how \"Hell or High Water\" plays out all the more interesting. We find ourselves rooting for the brothers' success only to have Sheridan execute some jarring turns in the story. Suddenly the stakes get higher and more real, and director David Mackenzie wisely keeps his hands off it all, which actually adds to the shock factor. We never feel comfortable with the violence in the film because it never feels stylish and never becomes commonplace, and that makes the violence that does happen more effective.There's also a social commentary at play beneath the main thrust of the narrative, which is what really makes Sheridan's work stand out. Race crops up at various points, sometimes subtly and other times less so. At one point, Tanner has a confrontation with a Comanche man at a casino that seems to digress from the story a bit, but it serves the purpose of highlighting differences and animosity between people, and the pervasive \"otherness\" that causes so many rifts in our society.That's where the timely factor comes in. It's not just about how these brothers represent the millions of Americans whose small town way of life is going extinct and creating such desperation, it's about how we go after what we want at the expense of other people, and treat others like the enemy. These fears, these attitudes and this desperation is cancerous and, sadly, cyclical. That's more than you'd expect from a movie about bank robbers, to be sure.~Steven CThanks for reading!

            "content": "'Hell or High Water' is a bit of an odd duck. Mainly because it got a wide release. This is the only great film that has released in 2016 that got a wide release. I mean, there are only four or five films that I thought have been really great and all of them have either got basically no theater release or a limited viewing. I truly hope that this spurs more films like it though. More well crafted movies that actually have characters you can get invested in. There have been so many films this year that have completely failed due to poor character writing. Now, this film isn't perfect. So lets just get the negatives out of the way before we get into what makes this great.There aren't many problems here. The only big issue for me lies in the films story. It's really not that good. Once you step back to examine it, it's actually pretty by the numbers. If you've seen any heist movie ever than you probably know where this film is going. It follows a very standard formula that rarely deviates from it's by the numbers approach.But it wasn't until I took a step back that I noticed it. That's due to how well executed it is. It's one of those films that's so finely crafted that you don't really notice it's issues. That's what I loved about the film. It has such great characters that the familiar beats it hits actually feel genuine. Because you get to know these people and you feel like their choices matter to what's happening on screen.Which came as a breath of fresh air in a time when films have become so predictable and convenient. Our three main characters are played by Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and Ben Foster. Who were all at their very best for this movie. Foster was the weakest of all but when acting across from Bridges, is hard to really stand out. Yet, that is exactly what Chris Pine does. I have never seen him give this kind of performance.I'm glad to see him taking on nuanced roles that legitimately show his range. It felt almost like his performance in 'Z for Zachariah' but he's far more compelling to watch here. Which really adds to his character. He is the one that you have to feel for most. And his sad yet determined personality really pushed you through the film.On the other end, Ben fosters character introduced the most conflict to the film. To avoid spoilers, I won't go into his character much but the film respected him enough to not make him the bad guy. It's so easy to make a character like that the films bad guy but he never becomes that person. It respects its characters enough to make them humans with problems instead of saying this guys the bad one and this guy is the good one.And it's all shot and directed with the utter most care and effort. With nearly every shot you can feel the attention to detail and the work put into making this the way it is. It may not be Alejandro Inarritu levels of ingenuity but I loved seeing effort being put into making the film. It's very rare to see great directing and inventive cinematography in wide release films like this.'Hell or High Water' is rare breed. It's a great film that got a wide release. There is a lot of love and care put into this and it shows. It's well shot, directed nicely, has a solid score, is brilliantly acted, and offers excellent characters. This is definitely worth going out and seeing. That being said, It falls just short of being amazing. The story is pretty by the numbers and it's ending doesn't really seem to know what it wants to do. However, it remains a great film and is definitely worth supporting in theaters.",

            "content": "The comparisons to 2007's \"No Country For Old Men\" are probably inevitable. Both films feature aging Texas lawmen near the end of their careers, who contemplate the passing of a more rational era in which they came up through the ranks. There's also the principal villains, but whereas Anton Chigurh was a Terminator-like, unrelenting and vicious assassin, his counterpart here, Tanner Howard is just plain old Texas locoweed crazy. You have to credit Ben Foster in the role of older brother Tanner to Chris Pine's Toby, his characterization is just off the wall insane.As for Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton, Jeff Bridges is simply astounding in his portrayal. One thing you have to give him credit for, now that he knows his matin\u00e9e idol days are long gone and over with, he has no qualms about letting it all hang out. I'm thinking about that scene in the hotel room when he took off his shirt and his big old gut is just hanging out there like a poster child for obesity research. Just when you think he can't get any better as an actor after \"Crazy Heart\" and \"True Grit\", he nails it once again and it's a wonder to behold. I wonder if he had marbles in his mouth when he spoke, his dialog was especially Texas drawl effective.The story itself puts the film in action/adventure territory with more than a hint of crime drama, so one's classification of the picture with the Western genre is probably more so by association with it's West Texas and Oklahoma locations than the cowboy roots of the principals. The same could be said of \"No Country For Old Men\", so there's another likely comparison.And finally there's the way the picture ended, leaving open the question of whether Toby Howard would ever be brought to justice. Leaving things off that way left a lot more question marks than the showdown that never was between Marcus and Tanner Howard. But at least it was a more satisfying conclusion than having Anton Chigurh wandering around with a bone sticking out of his arm and no resolution to his fate. But then again, life can be just like that sometimes.",

            "content": "\"Hell or High Water\" (2016 release; 105 min.) brings the story of two brothers, Toby and Tanner. As the movie opens, we see them rob two Texas Midlands Bank branches in rapid succession. It's only later that we learn why. After the second heist, the Texas Rangers are informed, and Marcus, who is going to retire in three weeks, wants to do one final case before going off into the sunset. At this point, we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Scottish director David Mackenzie, and here he brings to the big screen the outstanding script by former actor Taylor Sheridan, who blew us away last year with \"Sicario\", my No.1 movie of the year in 2015. Here the story focuses on the two brothers, one a divorced dad and the other just released after a 7 year prison stint. The brothers are played by Chris Pine (MILES away from the recent Star Trek Beyond) and Ben Foster. But the best performance comes from Jeff Bridges as good ol' Marcus, always short on breath and \"sitting on the porch, practicing my future\", when his partner asks him why he is sitting outside his hotel room. Bridges has gotten many acclaims over his career, and I don't know that this one tops them all, but it sure comes close. Add in the beautiful landscape of the southwest (New Mexico standing in for Western Texas), plus a gorgeous soundtrack fro Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, and it all comes together like a perfect cocktail. I'm trying to think of any flaws in this movie, but I can't think of any, hence my rating of 5 stars (which I rarely give).The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely, and I bet you with outstanding word-of-mouth a guarantee, this movie will gain strength at the box office in the weeks to come. Pretty sure this will pick up a lot of attention come the awards season at the end of the year. \"Hell or High Water\" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

A director who knows what he's doing, a writer who wrote an extremely tight script, and top-notch acting make this one you do not want to miss.Tanner and Toby Howard (both played remarkably by Ben Foster and Chris Pine) are two brothers whose mother has just passed. Texas Midlands Bank owns the mortgage on the house they occupy and they both know that oil has been discovered there. They decide to rob several different banks, pay off the mortgage, and in doing so, get even with the bank.Enter Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (played beautifully by Jeff Bridges). I do not believe I have ever seen Jeff Bridges in a movie I did not like. He is one of the few sensational actors left in Hollywood who tackles each of his roles with gusto. In this film, he comes across as the Texas Ranger (played by Tommy Lee Jones in \"No Country for Old Men\" and the codger in \"Gran Torino\" played by Clint Eastwood). Getting ready for his retirement, this is his last opportunity to feel like he still has live in him. He and his partner set out to catch the robbers.In a year of half-a$$ed attempts of \"blockbusters\" who exhibit no soul, this movie was like a breath of fresh air. As stated before, the acting--from top to bottom--ALONE makes this a must-see.

Both of their last respective projects (Sheridan - Sicario, MacKenzie - Starred Up) were gritty, violent, and engaging. All of those hold true for Hell or High Water.The main characters, Chris Pine and Ben Foster turn in great performances. Ben Foster plays the ex-con brother. And as usual, he turns in what I think was the best performance of the movie. He has a knack for playing a top notch supporting role, and often times gets overlooked. Chris Pine also nails it as the more straight laced brother. For a pretty boy of Hollywood, his portrayal is authentic. Jeff Bridges also compliments these two well as the older, sort of jaded officer. Both him and Foster even provide a good amount of laughs, but neither overdo it.The setting of the movie really sets it above others in the genre. I would say this movie is more crime/drama or heist film than Western, but it definitely has a Western vibe due to its northwest Texas setting. The area has been hit hard by the recession, a failing farm industry, and big oil. It all makes the recklessness and danger Foster and Pine engage in that much more enjoyable, and even sort of relatable. The audience can at least sympathize with them as they do what they think is right. Overall, this film is well worth a watch. It can be put in a league with more recent films like The Town, Drive, and The Place Beyond the Pines.",

            "content": "Hell or High Water (2016) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his ex-con brother Tanner (Ben Foster) rob three banks in one day with plans on hitting more the following day. Pretty soon Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and his partner are on their trail.Director David Mackenzie's HELL OR HIGH WATER is a throwback to a previous era's Western where you've got good guys, bad guys and guys that are somewhere in between. A lot of praise was aimed at the film and it's easy to understand why because it's a very laid back picture that takes its time getting to why the brothers are doing the crime and it also takes its time in explaining why the Ranger is so interested in it.What impressed me most about the film was the fact that it was so laid back. The quiet nature of the Texas small towns are certainly on display and I liked the fact that the director didn't mind keeping things at a slow burn leading up to the climax. I'm certainly not going to spoil the ending but it perfectly sums up everything that we had seen leading up to it. I can see how some might be disappointed that this film wasn't louder and feature stronger stuff but the atmosphere and setting were perfectly handled.Another major plus are obviously the performances but would you expect anything less from the three leads? Pine is certainly coming into his own and delivering one fine performance after another. His character is the one that is most haunted by his actions and I really liked the depth that Pine brought to the role. Bridges, who picked up an Oscar-nomination, is also quite good playing the Ranger who (no shock) is about to retire. For my money it was Foster who stole the film playing the more psychotic brother. I really thought the actor did a fantastic job at playing this crazy person who also had a great love for his younger brother.The cinematography, the editing and all the other technical aspects are excellent. I did have a few problems with the picture including some of the scenes that had songs playing over them. The country music selections were fine songs but at times I thought they weren't needed in a few of the scenes. Still, HELL OR HIGH WATER is a current day Western and a darn good one at that.",

            "content": "The American western seems to be slowly making a comeback in recent years. With films such as The Rover, Slow West and True Grit there have been some interesting and unique approaches to this old genre. Hell or High Water fits right in with these mentioned films by containing a lot of comedy, engaging characters, and no holds barred violence. Chris Pine and Ben Foster as the bank-robbing brothers share great chemistry and draw sympathy from the audience with compelling performances. Jeff Bridges stands out however as the hardened cop tasked to track down the brothers. His racist slurs and aggravated man persona works perfectly with his gravely, yet genuine voice and he finds perfect timing in his comedic delivery. The music, done by Nick Cave is also perfect. After crafting one of the greatest scores with Assassination of Jesse James, he gets pretty close to that here with very foreboding and meditative music. Especially right before the big showdown. And when it all goes down, the film will have you on the edge of your seat. It doesn't hold anything back and people die out of nowhere. It's very realistic and is worth the tension filed build up.Hell or High Water is a surprisingly great American western.

It should be called the reverts mortgage because it reverts to your heirs upon your demise. I can certainly sympathize with the Howard brothers here. When my mother passed away and left my brother and I with the bought and paid for completely debt free family home we both salvaged a considerable estate. Not like Chris Pine and Ben Foster have. Their little patch of land with the house on it is owed to the Texas Midland Bank and they have to cough up the full amount or be kicked off. Pine with wife and family there the situation is a crisis. Fortunately Foster is an experienced criminal who has an expertise in robbing banks. Even with some mistakes these two get away with a lot.That includes fooling the Texas Rangers on their case who are Jeff Bridges who is days from retirement and Gil Birmingham a full blooded Comanche Indian. They have an interesting relationship and Bridges isn't exactly the most politically correct person out there.Hell On High Water got a nomination for Best Picture in 2016 and Bridges was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Let's just say goals are accomplished, not without loss on both sides. The brothers Pine and Foster have a nice tandem chemistry the same as Bridges and Birmingham.The film this seems to best compare to is Clint Eastwood's classic A Perfect World.

A good guy whose make-up doesn't allow for bad things by anyone for any reason. Director David MacKenzie (Starred Up) and writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) serve up a quasi-western featuring a crusty old Texas Ranger doggedly pursuing two bank robbing brothers. If not for the numerous destroy-the-flow screaming political statements, this could have been a near instant classic \u2013 just a tick below No Country for Old Men.Chris Pine and Ben Foster play brothers Toby and Tanner Howard. Details eek out slowly about each \u0085 most importantly that Toby is a divorced dad and Tanner is an ex-con. Toby has meticulously planned out their bank robbery spree. The goal is to save his family ranch so his boys can escape the \"disease\" of poverty. Tanner is along to support his brother \u0085 and probably because he enjoys the adrenaline rush.Soon enough, Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is on the trail of the boys, and his highly developed instincts and gut feelings annoy his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) almost as much as Marcus' incessant and insensitive racial teases \u2013 a reminder of the days when buddies would verbally jab each other without the risk of class action lawsuits.The performances are all excellent. Pine is the quiet guy resigned to a life without happiness, but refusing to give up on his boys. Foster is the wide-eyed trouble-maker who long ago realized he would always be one careless moment from the end. Bridges literally becomes the Ranger being forced into retirement (age) but intent on remaining somewhat relevant. Additional support work is also quite colorful in a west Texas kind of way. The wonderful Dale Dickey gets an early sequence with the boys, the great Buck Taylor is always a pleasant presence, Margaret Bowman adds yet another memorable character to her resume as the T-Bone waitress, and Katy Mixon (\"Eastbound and Down\") gets to stand up for the little people.West Texas is a character unto itself with massive poverty, oil pumps on the horizon, dusty streets, rickety fences, and gun-toting citizens everywhere. Each of these elements is beautifully captured by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens (Dom Hemingway), as are the actual bank robberies and the quiet moments between brothers and Rangers partners. To cap it off, Nick Cave and Warren Ellis add a nice score and even better soundtrack \u0085 the best of which is an opening song from Townes Van Zandt.Mixed in with the impending gloom are some terrifically witty exchanges and some downright funny moments. Exceptional acting, a spot on setting, wonderful photography, and superb music are only slightly offset by the previously mentioned obnoxious and too obvious shots taken at big banks and oil companies. Sometimes a good story can be just that \u0085 and not a political statement.",

            "content": "This movie is more than just about two rather sympathetic men robbing banks and an old blabbermouth of a cop trying to catch them. It's much rather about the context of the events, about the people who aren't directly involved but still have their say. And what they say is \"screw you\" to the system, a say that, as we could see in the last months, spreads far beyond the small Texan towns.However, giving a glimpse at some sore social and economical spots of the modern US isn't enough to make the movie stellar. And while Hell or High Water is without a doubt a solid product, with a plot that doesn't crumble and some mature acting from the people you might not expect it from (Chris Pine, for instance, definitely exceeded my expectations, and it was refreshing to see him take on a grown-up role for a change), it still lacks somewhat in terms of artistic design.Yes, the social and political message is reiterated over and over, loud and clear, but the story itself remains just a bit too shallow, giving you not enough moral choices to make things complicated. What if Jeff Bridges' character was less of a grumpy old fart constantly ridiculing his partner? What if the Howard brothers were less handsome or had sightly uglier motives or execution style? Maybe it would be less appealing to root for the \"good guy pushed to the edge by the unjust circumstances\". And while it would've definitely made things more twisted, it would have also made this flick more intriguing and exciting to watch.Well, maybe it wasn't the case. But even if Hell or High Water comes short in regard to artsy dilemmas, it's still right on about the Texan lifestyle, hard as nails, and about the people who live it straight, on both sides of the law. And that's definitely good enough to consider those 102 minutes well-spent.",

            "content": "Blending the good, old-fashioned ruggedness of westerns with the cold-hearted brutality of crime thrillers, Hell or High Water is an intelligently scripted & smartly directed tale of family, sacrifice & personal duty that is further uplifted by its set of badass characters & solid performances from its cast, and is impressive enough to rank amongst the finest films of the year.The story of Hell or High Water unfolds in Texas and follows two brothers who carry out a series of bank robberies to pay off the mortgage for their ranch as some twisted form of poetic justice. The case is given to two Texas Rangers who are able to deduce a pattern in their operation and wait for them at what they determine to be the siblings' next target but things head for the worse real soon.Confidently directed by David Mackenzie, the story is cleverly paced & expertly crafted from start to finish, and manages to be gripping until the very end. The screenplay is even better as all events that transpire over the course of its runtime unfold in a seamless, sensible fashion with few twists surfacing every now & then, plus each n every conversation carry weight & meaning behind those words.Shot in sparsely populated areas with rural settings, the film is beautiful to look at and makes apt use of warm colour palette & camera angles to further enhance its imagery. Editing is excellently carried out, for it provides a tighter structure to its narrative and allows its characters to evolve at their own pace. Music is complimentary to the unfolding events and although the gunplay it has in store is brutal, it certainly isn't mindless.Coming to the performances, Hell or High Water features a committed cast in Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster & Gil Birmingham, and each one of them chip in with terrific inputs. Bridges is in as the ageing Texas Ranger with Birmingham as his fellow partner, Pine & Foster play the two brothers and although everyone is despicable in one form or another, their finely handled character arcs & fully-developed relationship dynamics do allow the viewers to invest in their journey.On an overall scale, Hell or High Water is one of the most fulfilling film experiences of 2016 for me, and easily packs one of the best screenplays of the year. The plot is lean, the characters are fully- fledged, and the interaction between them only adds more meat to their arcs, not to mention that the actors do an outstanding job in their given roles to make it one of the most complete films of the year. Destined to garner a cult following & scoring high marks in nearly all filmmaking aspects, Hell or High Water is absolutely worth your time & money. Don't miss it.",

This bank is about to foreclose on the mortgage on their ranch and claim the property, and robbing the bank to pay its own loan seems appropriate. On the trail of the brothers is a Texas Ranger, Marcus Hamilton, with only a few weeks to retirement.Interesting idea, clumsily written and so-so in execution. While the whole idea of robbing a bank to pay off a loan to that bank is wonderfully, wickedly poetic, here it is turned into a ideological, political sermon. So rather than a decent crime drama, the movie gets turned into an attempt to be something bigger, and it fails at that, taking shots at things clearly troublesome to the writer, but not necessarily to anyone else.Add in much fake atmosphere - mournful music, long shots of Texas vistas - just to make the movie seem more profound than it is, and you have case of style over substance. It was as if director David MacKenzie was trying to emulate the Coen Brothers' Fargo, but then didn't have the story to go with the atmosphere.It's not all bad though. Jeff Bridges is great as Marcus Hamilton and there are a few good action scenes and funny moments. I found the proliferation of guns a great, often funny, indictment of American gun culture. Not sure it was meant to be that profound or funny though, as it was probably quite realistic.",

In this case though I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a solid and straightforward thriller, that puts a lot of stead on character, atmosphere, and creating a convincing and engaging world.This it mostly does very well. The narrative sees two brothers robbing banks for small amounts, with a specific target to reach to be able to buy back their family's land from the bank; meanwhile a lawman on the cusp of retirement tries to stop them. It sounds a little clich\u00e9d, but what the film does is set the tone just right. The Texan heat is tangible, but so is the sense of a populace under pressure day-to- day. Such things are not in the main scenes, or main characters, but are evenly distributed across the whole film in such a way that it produces a world that is convincing, and people who are engaging and convincing.Within this, the pace of the film allows for the characters to breath, which means we invest in all of them. As a result the robberies are tense affairs, even if they are simple too \u2013 it is not a film that needs big set-pieces per se. That said, there are plot developments and details later in the film which do seem to be either holes or convenient writing \u2013 but by that point I was on board and willing to go with it. The performances do a lot to help with this, and there is a lot of quality in here. Foster and Bridges are known quality and do well, but I had some surprises with Pine, Mixon, Birmingham, and some others.The film is not as perfect as some suggest, but it is an engaging and convincing affair which has good pace, atmosphere, characters, and performances.",

Unlike most summer movies, the writing is fantastic, keeping me and the rest of the people watching with me attached to the movie and its characters even when they are just talking in a diner or something. Also unlike most other summer movies, the movie does not attempt to create artificial tension in the form of fast cuts or stupid action scenes, it creates tension in the form of dialogue and sometimes in the form of brilliantly filmed action. It should be noted that the cinematography in this film is truly amazing. The cinematography captures the desolateness and sadness of the area of West Texas that the movie is set in. There are also many wide shots, which looked like they were filmed with drones which also added to the beauty of the filming. The music also adds to the western feel of this movie. The writing of this film is where it really shines. The writing is captivating and it is so natural, for the area. The banter between both pairs of characters (the brothers and the rangers) is very entertaining in that you can almost feel their relationship and the history of it. Also, I have to say, the writing for the side characters, who are only in the film for their respective scenes is even better. This is the first time I have ever cared about some random waitress who is only in the film for 90 seconds because their writing is masterful. Also, the acting is definitely some of the best I have seen, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges both really shine in the film because of their stunning acting. The acting helps in that when Chris Pine and Ben Foster are mid- heist you can really feel the stress when they get into situations that one or both of them are not comfortable with. In closing, this film has amazing writing, cinematography, acting, pacing, everything. This film is just beautiful and you really need to see it, like yesterday, it is easily the best film this year and a major contender for Best Picture, Best Director, etc.",

To raise the money required he decides to take it from Texas Midland Bank with the help of Tanner, his criminal brother. They quickly rob two branches and soon Marcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker, a pair of Texas Rangers are trying to find them. Toby has planned things well but Tanner is far more reckless; as an example he robs another bank while Toby is eating in a diner. After their final robbery doesn't go according to plan a confrontation with the law seems inevitable.This film may be set in the present but it feels very much like a western... and not just because of the Texas setting and presence of men in cowboy hats. The plot too feels like a western with our two protagonists fighting back against those trying to force them off their family land and the two Rangers after them. The story is well told and even though the Howard brothers are clearly breaking the law it is hard not to feel some sympathy for them; especially as we are constantly reminded that the recession is biting hard in this part of Texas. The cast does a really fine job; most notable Chris Pine who is great as Toby; if I hadn't seen his name on the credits I'd never have guessed that this was the 'new' Captain Kirk I was watching! Ben Foster is solid as Tanner. Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham are a lot of fun as bickering Rangers Hamilton and Parker. While the story isn't 'action packed' it does have some good moments of action; these provide some shocks and believable violence.

            "content": "Hell or High Water is a movie about two brothers, robbing banks in Texas to save family property. Few key points that you have to know about the movie: 1) Cinematography - beautiful long shots of Texas landscape that just leave you drooling, amazing soundtrack (that country music...), great editing... Direction of this movie is just top-notch 2) Pacing - this movie is incredibly slow paced. But, amazingly enough, it only helps to make it even better! There are a lot of moments where the characters just sit and wait for something or just talk about something, and the viewer is not bored with it, because of the way it's shot and because of the importance of those character building dialogues 3) Acting - casting choices are perfect. Chris Pine as the brain of the operation is great. Ben Foster as an ex-convict - even better. But the person that steals the show is Jeff Bridges. He plays Texas ranger trying to catch those two robbers as a last case before he retires and his performance choices are just brilliant. He's just this old, kind of a bitter, constantly out of breath guy who is really more interested in the motives that drive our protagonists to do what they do than really busting them. Even the supporting characters shine in this movie! I loved both waitresses (especially 'what don't you want?' lady, just brilliant :), Gil Birmingham as Jeff Bridges' partner was also really great. Bottom line - grade A acting and characters development.4) Dialogues - just brilliant. Natalie's interrorigation scene, conversations in the diners, all of the Bridges/Birmingham interactions. Masterpiece! 5) Memorable scenes - like Ben Foster's assault rifle shooting scene, full of tension police blockade scene or final conversation between main characters. One of the best movies of this decade. 9/10",

            "content": "What defines a \"western\"? Is it cowboys? Guns? Horses? Boots? Or is it its morals of American masculinity itself; a study of what does, and what should, make a man? No matter what the criteria, Hell or High Water fits. Sure, it's not the typical period piece fare we normally get from the genre, but it's a wonderfully old-fashioned yarn that would've been a hit in most bygone eras. Only an \"indie\" by the most basic description, its qualitative and crowd-pleasing reach much exceeds its financial grasp. Boasting funny, enthralling, and character-filled fun from start to finish, this unconventional cowboy chronicle is the movie we've wanted all year. It's the story of the bank-robbing Howard brothers (Pine, Foster) and the nearly-retired lawman (Bridges) who's hot on their tales. The script is perfect, from the dialogue to the plotting to the characters to the themes. The simplicity of its cat-and-mouse setup allows the thematic and ethical complexities to unravel as the story does, instead of forcing it through hackneyed exposition. Touching on topics like the dangers of nostalgia, flawed justice, colonialism, and western heroism, its thematic richness is only matched by its penetrating visuals. With anti-hero films filling the cinematic landscape nowadays, this is more a \"pro-human\" film. We find ourselves \"rooting\" for everyone, not because they're necessarily \"justified\", but because we know them. Director MacKenzie is a proved actors-director, and the performances here are utterly naturalistic and masterful. Along with a wonderful soundtrack and grimily stellar sets and costumes, it's an enveloping viewing experience you feel like you're living. As entertainingly cool as it is penetratingly artful, HoHW is far-and-away my favorite film of 2016.",

            "content": "This modern western heist thriller isn't the film that tap into many's expectations, at least by those who go in anticipating a series of violent, adrenaline-fueled shootout sequences (though there are some). It is a film that sets the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis into it's story's backdrop in order to generate a smart, if slightly sluggish testament of men trying to survive the brutal aftermath of the economic collapse; while competing with their morally grey persona. Most of this is greatly accomplished by director David Mackenzie who serves a strong arm for this modern western flick. Teaming up with Mackenzie is writer Taylor Sheridan who wrote the fascinating screenplay for last year's thriller 'Sicario' and sums up for the almost equally intriguing script for this one. Set in 2008 at the dawn of the global financial crises, this film stars Chris Pine as Toby, a recently divorced father stuck living in an economically depressed Texan town who has not way for providing for his family's ranch other than committing a series of bank robberies with his ruthless brother Tanner (played by Ben Foster). Their heinous crime spark the attention of Sheriff Marcus Hamilton (played by Jeff Bridges) and his partner Alberto Parker (played by Gil Birmingham) who sprawl across the state of Texas to hunt them down.This film may proceed with a frustratingly slow pace against the wills of viewers who favor for a more action-oriented approach, but it is hard to deny the ingenious substance David Mackenzie packs into this film. Tapping into socioeconomic themes, this film paints a gritty picture of a society devastated by the notorious economic collapse of 2008 that left millions of money-starved individuals living in poverty and pointing their fingers at the corruption of Wall Street. Along the way, it takes its valuable time during the first half to develop our characters and set up the plot for the climatic showdown. One scene in particular take place in an old diner where Jeff Bridge's Marcus Hamilton is under investigation for a bank robbery previously ignited by the lead characters, when he unsuccessfully tries to confiscate what he believes stolen money (tip money) from a waitress. This accurately paints how people are so desperate for money when they are struck with financial stress and persevere to holding on to as much as they can. The first entire first half is a little sluggish with its momentum, but by the second half it fairly pays off for the benefit of the camaraderie of the lead characters who are empowered with engrossing performances by Chris Pine and Ben Foster. But that's not all, the cinematography by Giles Nuttgens used to capture the depressed nature of the old Texan town embraces a realistic picture of a town overrun by societal collapse, and its all quite intriguing to look at especially for the fact that the film was shot in New Mexico as opposed to the film's primary setting.Hell or High Water may run at snail pace, but it is fortunately in favor of developing some engaging characters and a riveting plot that greatly sets the film on a fascinating sendoff, at least until its ambiguous ending. Though the film boasts an incredible feat, many viewers are not likely to find a reason to rewatch this after a first sit. Nonetheless, it is still worth sitting through for those hungry for a fascinating experience.",

            "content": "Yet another film that I was looking forward to seeing, I even had to wait for this one to get to my area (one of the many downsides to living in middle America) Hell or High Water was sure to be a treat. I kept hearing positive reviews of this film, and it stayed at 100% on rotten tomatoes for awhile, so I was hopeful. In addition to the positive reviews, I thought Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges, and Gil Birmingham together couldn't a bad film make. The 2016 feature by David Mackenzie tells the tale of 2 brothers who will stop at nothing to save the land of their deceased mother, the last link to their childhood, and the riches that the oil under her land will promise. Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is a Texas lawman weeks before a forced retirement, training Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) to be able to take his place. Just when it seems like it will be a quiet couple weeks before retirement, a rash of bank robberies occur and Marcus and Alberto take the responsibility to solve the case. Tanner (Ben Foster) and Toby Howard (Chris Pine) have gotten the brunt of many bad situations in their lives. After their mother passed away, they were faced with the realization that the land on which she lived was being seized by the bank. After recently learning that there is a massive amount of oil under that land invigorates the brothers to save the land by any means necessary. Toby has a former wife and a child to think about and believes himself to be indebted to them and wants to gift them the land and the oil so they will always be taken care of. Tanner is constantly on the run, in and out of jail, and has nothing to lose by helping his brother, even if the means are criminal. After weaving together an intricate plan of robbing the very bank responsible for the foreclosure on their mother's land, then securing the deed through that very bank, the two begin an old west style run of bank robberies with a couple of Texas lawmen on their tails. As much as I had been looking forward to Hell or High Water, I was monumentally disappointed. Early in the film, we see over the shoulder of Jeff Bridges' character as he is reading his forced retirement letter from the department; this begins the formulaic downturn suffered through the rest of the film. Each pivotal moment was seen coming a mile away and easily predicted. There are few things more boring than watching a lazy movie in which the audience can predict each move made by the characters, and even each piece of dialogue spoken throughout the entire film. Jeff Bridges was flat on screen, Chris Pine was horribly miscast, and there are Grand Canyon sized holes in character development that are never solved. I never knew enough about the characters to become invested in them. Ben Foster was the only shining spot in this film, but even his exceptional acting couldn't save the film. A disappointment all around, I can't figure out yet why Hell or High Water is getting the amount of positivity the film has enjoyed thus far.",

The film has a sweaty desert setting and casts Ben Foster and Chris Pine as a pair of brothers cast into a world of crime due to economic difficulties. Pine has the lesser role of the two, basically all square-jawed niceness, while Foster, who has been an interesting presence in Hollywood ever since THE PUNISHER, adds another deranged role to his repertoire.Pitted against these siblings are the local police force, spearheaded by a typically laconic Jeff Bridges. The plot as it plays out is quite predictable, but the direction is far above average and the action sequences almost hum with electricity. The bank heist scenes are as tense as you'd expect, but a HEAT-style shoot-out and car chase are both very well achieved and some climactic moments are also nicely portrayed. It's not a film I'd consider a masterpiece, but it does the job well enough and the realism never drops for a second.",

Texans in stetson hats ride muscle cars instead of horses but it's still very much a western that we see. We still have the grizzly old sheriff in pursuit of bank robbers (and being casually racist to his Indian deputy). We have a posse of townsfolk giving chase, in SUVs nowadays. The notion that the two outlaw brothers aren't all bad, they do what they do to save their momma's ranch from the paws of greedy bankers.And as customary in westerns the last fifty years we have all of this tied to the passing of the West. The tone is elegiac. We stop to see cowhands in horseback rustling a herd away from a prairie fire that no one is bothering to put out, it will simply burn down to the river. The small towns we see along the way look decrepit, a far cry from their Roy Rogers days.It's not a completely wistful take. The Indian deputy reminds us that this was all someone else's smalltown America before you people came along. But as plaintive music now and then swells over shots of dusky prairie, the fundamental point here is a sense of inadvertent loss.The notion is that America is no longer great; that some essential purity of America is gone. Bankers took it away. Huge swathes of the country would agree of course; it's a fitting western for the Trump years, meant broadly. It would have been written and began production long before Trump came along on the back of outrage.It's what has come to be the worldview of the modern western, fueled by angst, fatalism and resignation to the passing of a way of life. Any worldview that laments change and looks back with nostalgic attachment to some purer past has no place in my home. But here's the cinch. These people would not look at their muscle cars and gas-guzzling SUVs, or TVs and cell phones, as part of modern change that sweeps away a way of life. They would not bat an eye at rock bars or getting a tattoo, which their grandfathers would have found abhorrent.In the western (both as film and mentality) so many things can change in other words, except the notion that a purer way of life is being swept. It's interesting to note that out of the many possible threads of what the western could mean, it has been reduced to this. What would it be like for example for modern westerns to celebrate the resilience of community, or the joy of banding together for common work? Sulking is a powerful impulse.",

Kelly Reichardt directed the minimalist \"Meek's Cutoff\", while Seth MacFarlane gave us the slapstick comedy \"A Million Ways to Die in the West\". David Mackenzie's \"Hell or High Water\" is not that easy to pigeonhole. Set in the present day, it focuses on a pair of brothers robbing banks in west Texas, while a Ranger looks for them.The cast members play roles very different from their most famous ones. Jeff Bridges (generally known for playing people disaffected with the modern way of life) plays the mildly racist Texas Ranger, doing what he feels that he has to in order to find the robbers. Chris Pine and Ben Foster show the robbers' desperation, complete with unnecessary risks. I thought that Gil Birmingham's character was a little underdeveloped, though.Overall, it's a fine look at the lengths to which people will go in desperate scenarios.

The bond between the two sets of men, one each on either side of the law, drives the movie.There is a touch of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" about Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster). Being brothers meant there was already a close bond, but they are also friends and hang out together. However they have a dangerous edge and rob branches of the bank that is about to foreclose on their family ranch.The two lawmen who come after them, Texas Rangers Marcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham), are buddies too; two aging Rangers with Marcus about to retire. Despite plenty of bantering insults, you know these guys are tight. Their banter reveals insights into their characters.The film has a feel. As much as it is modern twist on the Western, the way the brothers hit the banks and then hit the back roads is reminiscent of the depression era bank robbers: Dillinger, Bonny and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson - with a touch of \"High Sierra\" thrown in.Jeff Bridges steals the show. He is fascinating to watch in interviews with Chris Pine and Ben Foster. He's a good listener and doesn't talk over people, he's a laid back guy; the role of the laconic, but determined Marcus Hamilton was made for him.The team of two that sticks by each other to the end is a powerful combination, and two is the magic number; just like marriage. The best cop shows in movies or on TV feature partners who have each other's backs. Newman and Redford set the gold standard for buddies as Butch and Sundance, Connery and Caine polished it in \"The Man Who Would be King\", and it worked beautifully for Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in \"Lethal Weapon\". There is something reassuring to an audience when mates face the odds together. It's surprising that filmmakers don't go there more often - it's more effective than the lone wolf hero - and there are more opportunities for great one-liners.Script, direction, photography, score and performance all came together on \"Hell or High Water\" - it's just about the perfect creative storm.",

            "content": "Two brothers rob banks, for some reason, but now they are being hunted by the Texan police.David Mackenzie, the director of the very good \"Starred Up\", went on to create this modern-day western epic. Mackenzie really was one of the things who made this movie fantastic. However, he wasn't the best thing of this film, this lays in the screenplay, which I'll discuss in my second to last paragraph. Now back to the director. Mackenzie created a beautiful looking film. The use of light, shadow, composition, everything that there is to make a shot look good, was good in this film. The landscapes were nicely captured by the cinematographer of this film, Giles Nuttgens, who has previously filmed \"The Fundamentals of Caring\", an OK-looking film, so it was very surprising he created such a good looking film. The direction wasn't stale; the camera moved around, to create long, nice looking takes. An example of those lays in one of the robbery scenes. All of those scenes by the way were fantastic. They felt realistic, they were tense and, like said before, good looking. What David Mackenzie also did succeed at was creating a realistic film. Everything that was happening on screen felt like it could happen in real life. There were some scenes that were less believable, but you have to take the setting in account, and then it makes more sense. That's also something I liked about the film: they utilize the setting. It's not that the film could've been set elsewhere. It could only take place in Texas. The soundtrack was also very good. The songs fitted well with what was going on and they also made the movie feel like a modern-day western. The editing was superb. The pacing really hit all the high notes. There wasn't a single scene that was dragging, even though the film was very slow paced, slowly building up to the finally. The acting was fantastic; I am surprised that not all of them got a nominee. The whole ensemble impressed me, but the one that impressed me the most was the performance of the well-known Chris Pine. This role of his is totally different from the ones I know him for, and I like that he has stepped out of his comfort zone. He gave on of his best performances, which is also one of his most emotional performances. He really sold his role. Ben Foster as well was fantastic. I didn't see him, but I saw his well-written character. Jeff Bridges too was great. I like his chemistry together with Gil Birmingham, who played his colleague policeman. The two of them had well written banter and were a fun on screen duo. The screenplay was, like said before, the best part of the whole film. Taylor Sheridan, the writer of \"Sicario\", who's bringing out his big-budget, directorial debut \"Wind River\", which he also wrote, wrote this film. If there's something Sheridan can do is portraying characters. All of the characters were written with extreme care, and the film also takes time to develop these well-written characters. They were developed by small-talks and not by exposition. They were developed by giving small bits of information once in a while, so by the end of the movie you have a fully developed character. This also parallels the story overall. In the beginning we don't really know why they are robbing banks \u2013 I know it is said in the trailers and in the IMDb synopsis, but a reviewer I follow said to not read them, because it's more fun to find out yourself -, but after throughout the film you keep on getting these small hints and bits of information like pieces of a puzzle and near the end of the film all the pieces fall together, to form a fantastically well-developed puzzle. That's one of the main aspects I liked about the film, but it doesn't stop there. Like said in the previous paragraph I also liked the banter between Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham. The back and forward jokes were funny, just like all of the jokes in this film. Both of the characters were built on each other, which ended well in the climax of the film. The jokes may seem weird, because the film has set-up this serious atmosphere, so by having these jokes, you'd expect a theme-swap, but the film handled them so well, and the jokes fitted with the characters that made them.In the end \"Hell or High Water\" was a well-written and well-acted film, with good looking shots, and good tension. The film had set-up a realistic atmosphere, and the film was able to keep that atmosphere throughout the whole film. This film is defiantly one of the better films of 2016 and I would recommend seeing this, if you are able to. That's why I'm giving this film a 9.3/10.",

The locale and time frame of this modern crime film/western is similar to \"No Country for Old Men\", but, despite the fact that I admire the work of the Coen Brothers and Cormac McCarthy, I think it is a much better movie. It is less contrived and Jeff Bridges is allowed to remain true to his character. Although actually filmed in nearby Eastern New Mexico it presents a moving portrait of the realities of West Texas. The poor white working class, which never heard of \"white privilege\", the predatory lending practices of local banks, the resentment of the descendants of the Comanches \"lords of the plains\",and the ethos of the Texas Rangers. At the same time it manages to spin an excellent action adventure yarn without drowning the movie in car chases and gunfights. Jeff Bridges is excellent as the old Texas Ranger, as is his partner a half Mexican half Comanche played by Alberto Parker. Chris Power and Ben Foster are terrific as the two brothers one desperate, the other crazy who come up with a pretty smart but very risky plot to right an old wrong. Two cameos by a couple of tough waitresses are wonderful. The script is understated, witty, and deals with a panoply of social issues without being wordy or preachy. The direction is crisp and focused. The cinematography make great use of the spare dry Southwestern landscape. I believe you will enjoy this exciting and moving film.",

'Hell or High Water' has a very high rating currently on IMDb of 8.1, and I'm not entirely sure it's justified. Unquestionably it's a very well made film. The dialogue is exquisite throughout, the acting is superb and the direction is top-notch. But is the story strong enough would be my question. There are films out there that put an immense amount of time and effort into the complexity and thoughtfulness of their story line, and seemingly get no recognition for it. Then other films put almost no effort in and it gets completely overlooked. As mentioned though, it is a very well made film. Even though the story is slow and often quite simple, it somehow manages to remain interesting - mainly through great Texas-style dialogue. There's something Quentin Tarantino like about it, not in the dialogue style itself, but in the way that nothing can be happening, yet we are still enthralled just listening to what is being said.

It's not original at all, but it does take several original turns:-As opposed to just focusing on the Howards, with Tanner portrayed by Ben Foster and Toby as Chris Pine, we also follow a pair of Texas Rangers who are pursuing them, Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) -The pacing and plotting is different: there's two bank robberies in the pre-credits sequence, then there's planning on the Howard's part and investigation by the Rangers, then the big shootout scene, then a quiet 8 minute dialogue between two of the characters. A normal Western, or even any other thriller would be building and building as it went on.-There isn't any 'villains' in the traditional sense; in a modern take (the last 10 years), the banks are seen as the villains.The other thing that does separate this and prior Westerns/Neo-Westerns is the sheer quality of work. Taylor Sheridan, who produced an excellent screenplay with 'Sicario' ups his game even further, with his dialogues in particular shining. There's an excellent scene where the half-Indian half-Mexican Alberto talks about how all the land that \"these people grandparents took from my grandparents is being taken from them, but not by any army\", which sums up a lot of the film, and gives Birmingham a real chance to shine. There's another with Tanner and Toby talking about their upbringing, which says a lot about how Tanner and Toby differ because of that part of their lives.The characters themselves are excellently altered versions of prior characters. Jeff Bridges is fantastic as Marcus Hamilton - arguably the best of the film - as he gives this old Ranger a real fire and fight, but also a humour that is natural to Jeff Bridges. Chris Pine, who has always been a good actor stuck in the Captain Kirk box, plays the desperate family man forced to crime to save his family, who's quiet but also very valiant - he's doing this for unselfish reasons. And then there's Ben Foster, who plays by far the biggest twist on the convention: Tanner Howard is a violent rogue, who is very much a live wire and fully ready to commit all kinds of acts throughout the movie, but is doing these particular robberies for his little brother's welfare, and Ben Foster channels both sides to the character with equal virtuosity, making a 2D stereotype into a guy to both fear and root for.David Mackenzie and Giles Nuttgens team up awesomely together as Director and Cinematographer. Both of them use very constant long takes specifically to wring every ounce of tension out of certain scenes - a classic example is Tanner's dialogue with an Indian where he says they are both \"Comanche's\", and the camera lingers long enough to get the tension to max, or the ending in which you tense as if something's about to happen. They also focus on the Mise-en-scene well enough to show the world and have an audience invest in it, even when there's no soundtrack or incidental music to enforce it.I can put it in words - I love this film. For me, it's flawless and will only get better with more viewings. If you like Westerns, you adore this, and if you're OK with them (like me), you'll love this too hopefully.",

            "content": "Come pun hell (which is about what you are going to get) or high water, I have to write a positive review of Director David MacKenzie's Texas bank robbery flick \"Hell or High Water\". The film stars Chris Pine and Ben Foster as Toby and Tanner Howard (respectively). Toby is in a steep of financial problems so he asks his criminal bank robber brother Tanner to assist him in numerous low-cash bank heists in Texas. Jeff Bridges co-stars as the about-to-retire Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton, he is about as grumpy & racist as they come; but just wants to get the job done by going after the Howards. Gil Birmingham also co-stars as Alberto Parker, the mixed Mexican/Indian partner of Hamilton who becomes the butt of the many Hamilton racist remarks. MacKenzie did not cease fire and took it to the bank by orchestrating a very engaging movie that is \"Hell or High Water\". Tyler Sheridan's no-nonsense script was a hell of a good scribe time. There just might be a place beyond the Chris Pine that pins him to many other upcoming credible performances with his work here as Toby. Ben Foster has not been this good since his supporting villain role in \"3:10 to Yuma\". Jeff Bridges is worthy of a Best Supporting Actor nomination with his scene- stealing performance as Ranger Marcus. And Birmingham is a name to be reckoned with, with some impressive work here as Ranger Alberto. \"Hell or High Water\" does go a bit deep into the current economic state with southern banks, and that works quite well in this Hell. So go out or stay in tonight in a blaze of glory, and check out \"Hell or High Water\" come hell or high water. ***** Excellent",

This is a highly original, tension filled and character driven film that I absolutely loved. Hell of High Water was a perfectly paced film, were thrown right into the situation and we keep at the same pace for the entire film as we witness these bank robberies, it's never slow enough to bore but it's not to fast so that it doesn't take the time to build its characters, all the characters in this film are perfectly developed, they all have crystal clear motivations for their actions and there are no light weights in this film. Chris Pine and Ben Foster both give the best performances of there entire careers in this film, they both feel like brothers who are very different but in many ways very similar, they had amazing chemistry and made for a perfect emotional drive for this film. But in terms of Character interaction Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham absolutely stole this movie, like Pine and Foster they both felt like they'd known each other for a long time, they were hilarious together and felt like true friends who poke fun at each other but ultimately trust one and other. The bank robberies all feel realistic, you feel the quick and rapid pace of them, the intensity it real and it have for a perfect representation of how differently Pine and Foster operate from each other. While many characters in this film do a lot of bad things there aren't really any villains in this film because we see all their different points of view and it ensures that their are no singular characters to get behind. It's also just terrifically entertaining, the action is very well filmed and makes this film a pretty good re watch for me. My only real issue with this film is the fact that, at times it's a bit emotionally manipulative, I understand that we're meant to get invested in the characters but at times it came across as just needlessly depressing. Hell or High Water was one of the best films of 2016, its got terrific performances, investing characters, well done action, a perfectly paced narrative and it's a film that completely invests you in its story. Despite being needlessly depressing at times this is an absolutely fantastic thriller. 9.3/10: A (Phenomenal)",

            "content": "Taylor Sheridan takes us back to the concept of the Wild West but in his fine script HELL OR HIGH WATER he keeps the time and the locale contemporary \u2013 present day in west Texas. And instead of ornery outlaws he places his story in the hands of a divorced father and his ex-con older brother who resort to robbing little banks in order to save their family's ranch in West Texas. David Mackenzie directs with a fine-tuned sense of balance between humor, sensitivity, pain, and loss and manages to pull together a splendid cast of characters that gives a very fine ensemble performance.Following a series of armed robberies at a number of branches of Texas Midland Bank where very little money was taken, the idea behind the robberies is rather sensitive - the motive of unemployed oil and gas worker Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his ex-con older brother Tanner (Ben Foster) just released from prison is to raise enough money to pay off the reverse mortgage that will forfeit their recently deceased mother's ranch if not paid off. Oil was discovered on the ranch and in order to secure the future of his sons and ex wife (Marin Ireland), Toby needs $43,000. After two of the robberies, caustic old Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and his American Indian deputy partner (Gil Birmingham) pick up the trail and just miss foiling the next, and last robbery. To offer more would be spoilers, though the manner in which the story is brought to closure identifies the tenderness that exists on the part of both the robbers and the law.Both Chris Pine and Ben Foster offer excellent portrayals of two young men attempting to cope with life as it has been dealt to them. Jeff Bridges is in fine fettle as the old retiring age lawman who rattles off racial epithets/slurs to his good-natured Indian/Mexican partner in dialogue that is immensely memorable. Every minor role becomes major in the quality of delivery of a cast of surprisingly fine actors. Yes, it is a shoot 'em up contemporary Western, but it also is an extraordinarily well- written, directed and acted significant film with a fine after-burn.",

            "content": "At the time I saw it, IMDb had this rated at 8.3!?!?? Damn few movies get that high of a rating, so I was prepared to be entertained by a well-crafted plot. What I got was a slow moving, meandering bank robbery crime spree yarn, which turns totally senseless and absurd when we finally find out what the overall \"plan\" was, and what the motivation for doing it all was - $50K heisted, three innocent people dead plus the planned (!) self-sacrifice of one of the bank-robbing protagonists: It's all done for the two kids of our divorced loser \"hero,\" \"so they don't have to be poor.\" REALLY??? What-a-bunch-of CRAP. It's the obligatory evil bankers vs. the self-pitying mortgagor, who can only think of using today's all to familiar problem solving solution: violence. Plot holes and absurdities absolutely abound along the way crafted with the hopes that viewers will be as simple minded as the story being told.With the exception of the all too brief appearance of the delightfully gruff T Bone Caf\u00e9 waitress, who gave the best delivery of lines in the movie, the \"acting\" was a wasteland (unless you're into watching the camera pan Chris Pine posing). Poor Jeff Bridges, who has given us so many memorable performances, was little more than a sad, mumbling caricature of himself. On the plus side, the visual portrayal of West Texas as starkly and hopelessly bleak was well done.P.S. FACT CHECK: There are many (most?) reviewers who have willingly (eagerly?) bought into the the totally false central premise of the plot that the bank was going to own/acquire the ranch upon foreclosure, and was therefore the evil \"Bad Guy,\" deserving of being robbed repeatedly (and their guard murdered). WRONG! Foreclosures are governed by law which results in a advertised Public Auction with the property going to the highest public bidder, with any money received over the loan amount owed plus expenses going back to the Mortgagor.Also, the evil \"Bad Guy\" bank officer whose portrayal was demonized in the movie HAD to pay the delinquent property taxes on the property to prevent it from being sold at public auction by the Tax Collector.",

            "content": "If you're going to make a movie based in West Texas about the destruction of the agrarian economy and the way the banks rape the poor and why so much of the American heartland has turned into a ghost town husk of what it once was, what better way to embellish the moments than to include the songs of artists like Ray Wylie Hubbard, Scott H. Biram, Colter Wall, and Chris Stapleton in it. These are the men who've witnessed the destruction first hand and sing about it regularly.Hell or High Water, written by Taylor Sheridan, directed by David Mackenzie, and starring Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster, and Chris Pine, is a Neo-Western story about two brothers that go on a bank robbing spree to help keep the family farm in the family. Soundtrack and score writers Nick Cave and Warren Ellis also included classic country cuts from Waylon Jennings and Townes Van Zandt in the film, answering the question for many traditional/independent country fans what it would feel like to witness a modern-day big budget movie with all of your favourite artists comprising the soundtrack. The answer is it's pretty damn cool.But Hell or High Water is much more than just a vehicle for good music. David Mackenzie has taken his little film with a cool soundtrack and made it one of the most critically-acclaimed flicks of the season, shining a greater spotlight on the artists and songs that are deftly interwoven with the story, and in moments with haunting and auspicious timing. Independent music artists know that awards aren't everything, but if Hell or High Water wins big at the Oscars, it will be no small bragging rights for the musicians involved.The film moves a little bit slow at the beginning, struggling to create the adrenaline rush you would anticipate from scenes of bank robberies and high-speed getaways. It takes a while for the viewer to find a personal connection with the main characters, and despite the true-to-life and naturally-poetic setting of West Texas, we've seen this many times before, and recently. The story of the retiring (or recently retired) lawman, in this case Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton played by Jeff Bridges, is a trope of many of these movies. Take Tommy Lee Jones in No Country For Old Men for example.When the intricacy of the plot of the two brothers played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster begins to be revealed, and the relationship between them is given time to meld, this is when the movie begins to take hold, especially when their plan begins to race to a conclusion, and risks unravelling. This isn't your traditional Oscar- contending film in the sense that it isn't primarily intellectual or artistic in scope. These elements are certainly paid great deference, but this is a film of action, plot twists, and characters.Where Hell of High Water does play to the Hollywood mindset is how it re-imagines the whole Robin Hood story in a fresh and relevant light, despite the age and grit that encompass the story in its West Texas setting. This film could have been set in 1980 from how so many of the buildings, places, and people haven't changed. But the story is very 2017 in how legacy farms and ranches throughout the United States\u2014 and the family ties that have made them the harbour of memories for generations\u2014are being threatened like never before by a modern-day banking system that does not account for how estate taxes and corporate farming do a disservice to the interests of independent land owners.As Hell or High Water works towards its conclusion, the lines between good and bad get blurred, and the moments and characters hold much more weight. Though the film feels like an outsider for Best Picture, and one you probably watch once and greatly enjoy but don't feel the need to revisit, it does sell you on the idea it should be in contention for the best in a given year.Often it is mourned that music awards shows are not more like the Oscars, where truly the best films and the best performances are and is rewarded as opposed to a simple acknowledgement of commercial success. Yet as we've seen in recent years\u2014including an Oscar for Ryan Bingham in 2010\u2014the film industry can be a lucrative outlet for the artists that should receive accolades, but are often overlooked. Hell or High Water not only accomplishes this, it's one hell of a movie to get taken lightly. Let alone getting overlooked!",

            "content": "Many of the scenes in director David Mackenzie's 2016 film 'Hell or High Water' appear to take place in a post-apocalyptic world. Sun-scorched fields that seem to produce nothing but clouds of dust. The deserted roads where from time to time billboards appear about loans and debt payments. But especially heroes who behave like all restrictions of morality or law and order no longer apply. And yet this is the Texas of the years after the 2008 economic crisis (it might as well be the 2000 one or the 2021 one). The landscape is real and populated by people. People who are forced to do anything (this is one of the meanings of the title) to survive the apocalypse caused by other people and their institutions - in this case banks.'Hell and High Water' can be seen as both a western or as a movie about cops chasing bank robbers. It has many of the attributes of these genres and the Texas landscape suits them perfectly. The heroes of the film are two brothers whose lives took the path of the \"bad boys\". The older brother, Tanner, has just been released from prison and is often the victim of bouts of violence. Younger brother Toby is after of a divorce that has estranged his wife and two boys. The brothers' mother has recently died, and the farm she has left is in danger of being lost to a bank due to default on the mortgage. To keep their farm, the two resort to robbing the local branches of the bank that made them the loan. They steal at gunpoint only the money from the drawers (small bills that cannot be traced) and they also find a way to launder money at casinos. The plan seems to work for a while, until two policemen begin to understand their profile and methods, and until the violent instincts of the older brother can no longer be contained.'Hell or High Water' continues the line of several American films whose stories take place in the center of America today, among people hit by economic crises and marginalized by the way the capitalist economy works. What gives quality to this film is the excellent understanding of the social environment and the humanity of the characters that are brought to the screen. Every detail is excellently presented and filmed with empathy and expressiveness: the Texas landscapes with endless roads and plains covered in dust and industrial ruins, gas stations and restaurants, banks and small towns that don't seem to have changed much from the Wild West era with except for cars, not too luxurious either. Watching Jeff Bridges in his maturity roles is a delight and the role of police officer Marcus Hamilton suits him perfectly. The two brothers are excellently played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster. The smaller roles also provide the opportunity for some memorable performances, the most notable being that of Kristin K. Berg as a waitress whom the two brothers meet in a restaurant on the road and who will play an important role in their destiny. Each of these small roles and the extras appearances radiate authenticity, the characters seem to be the people we meet in everyday life, they build a human puzzle that fits perfectly into the social and natural landscapes. British director David Mackenzie's understanding of American atmosphere and social issues is remarkable. I noticed him first in 'Perfect Sense', a film made in 2011 that predicted the global pandemic and dressed it in a powerful metaphor. 'Hell or High Water' brings to the screen a well-written story with real characters and problems we understand. It will stay, I think, as a document about the crises of the first decades of 21st century America. It won three Academy Awards, and that was, in my opinion, one of the years when the Academy didn't get it too wrong.",

Rather than let that happen (and feeling that he has no other option), he hooks up with his reckless ex-con older brother Tanner (a typically excellent Ben Foster), and they set out to rob the various branches of the bank. Picking up their trail is a weary old Texas Ranger named Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges, in fine form), who's set to retire, and his partner, Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham).\"Hell or High Water\" starts out serious but still fairly light, turning darker and more serious as the story progresses and blood starts getting spilled. While we may be rooting for our protagonists, we can't help but feel that they can't stay ahead of the law forever, and wait for the inevitable. There is a sombre quality to the screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (writer of \"Sicario\", who also has a cameo as a cowboy), underscored by a haunting, melancholy soundtrack by Nick Cave & Warren Ellis. Commendably, it treats its characters as real and flawed human beings (including Tanner), and is largely believable, only turning more formulaic towards the end.Until then we get many pretty widescreen shots of New Mexico, some brief bursts of action & violence, a colourful assortment of supporting and background players, and engaging performances by the main four players. Bridges is admittedly once again essaying one of the \"mumbling Southerner\" characters that he seems to have grown fond of playing, but he brings a certain gravitas to the role and the scenario. He also supplies a heavy dose of sardonic humour as he teases his more straight-laced partner Birmingham. And speaking of Birmingham, he contributes such a natural, winning presence, that one hopes that this performance will help his career go even further. And Pine & Foster do well as the contrasting siblings, acting in a plot where the greed-heads at the banks are treated as the real villains.Overall, this is a fine film that people should check out.Eight out of 10.",

The atmosphere is rather bland, with little sense of conflict, tension or human drama and the characters are rather one dimensional. They are merely representations of the themes of the story. Their motives are clear but never feel personalized. Jeff Bridges plays the same weary coming-of-age law man that Tommy Lee Jones depicts in No Country for Old Men, but without the heart or the wisdom.The best scene in the is the last one, where Bridges confronts one of the men that he's been chasing all movie.

But you basically know what you're in for with this, and can expect great performances from the three leads *(although the chemistry between Jeff Bridges and his partner was unexpected and quite pleasant). But since I've brought up \"Heat\", this was much more low-key and for me, it's the dialogue that really sets this movie apart. Long stretches of sun-blasted Texas scenery, enlivened by the occasional punchy one-liner. And in case that sounds boring, this certainly isn't. But for a movie about gunning up and robbing banks, there's more fun to be had when the guns are holstered. Top to bottom, this is a great movie.8/10",

Perhaps the crew -- 90% British -- don't see any differences between those two states!)It's also very funny in places. But HOHW has a fatal flaw, and that is....plot holes the size of Jupiter.The biggest and most glaring: EVERYTHING in the film hinges on the two bank robbing brother's motivation to save the family farm from foreclosure, by robbing one local bank chain of the petty cash in the drawer (and then laundering that money at casinos, and ultimately, paying their late mother's reverse mortgage off with the stolen cash).I am gobsmacked the film's writers did not bother to research this AT ALL. That is not how reverse mortgages even work. You do not even have to make payments on a reverse mortgage, so it could not be \"in arrears\". And the mother borrowed only $25,000? That's chump change -- the ranch is clearly hundreds of acres (we see it at the end, stretching to the horizon) and worth at the rock-bottom minimum hundreds of thousands of dollars BEFORE THEY FIND OIL ON IT. So the brothers were never \"poor\" as Chris Pine alleges at the end, when claiming that's why he robbed banks -- so his two sons would not \"grow up poor like he did\". OK -- except he wasn't poor. And most people provide for their sons by GETTING A JOB. And maybe, moving somewhere where there are more jobs. Or by SELLING the land (so you could pay off the reverse mortgage legally) and then still having anywhere from several hundred thousand dollars to MILLIONS OF DOLLARS (!!!).On top of this, it is infuriating to think the filmmakers think if you cannot provide your children with MILLIONS OF DOLLARS...they are \"poor\". There is in their eyes nothing in between foreclosure/welfare and MILLIONS? Nothing like, say, \"an ordinary job\" and \"paying your bills\" and \"living an honest life\"?It's like some weird justification for armed robbery, to \"get even\" with banks -- who are apparently supposed to forgive all loans, and never demand repayment, and of course, we all know if you own property -- it is \"yours\" for all eternity, even if you don't pay your taxes, bills or mortgage loans.On top of this; HOW can people who KNOW they have just won the biggest life lotto of all -- owning a ranch pumping $600,000 worth of oil profits every year and ergo, worth at least $20 million -- be whining about \"how poor they are\" and \"how rough they have it\" and how they have to be criminals??? That defies all credulity. Most people in their shoes would be on spending sprees with the royalty checks.Some other posters have also noted other stupid stuff like \"casinos have cameras\" and \"since they are already suspect (definitely the Ben Foster character, as he's been shot by police), it would be easy to work backwards, and realize Chris Pine paid off the mortgage on his ranch in a suspicious fashion, and with checks from a casino\". The most mundane detective work would have turned up the casino laundering trick and bingo, case solved.Lastly: at the end, Chris Pine is GUT SHOT, and has a bullet in him, but it hardly effects him -- he's not rolling on the ground screaming in pain or dying from peritonitis -- and how did he get the bullet out? going to the hospital would have pointed a big fat arrow at him as part of the robbery team. Did he dig it out himself and do home surgery? WTF?Too bad that nobody edited this or read it before filming, or had a bank loan officers give it a once over -- the devil is in the details, and these flaws keep this from being anything more than a mediocre shoot 'em up robbery film (with debts, also noted by others, to \"No Country For Old Men\").",

The brothers move from bank to bank robbing all and sundry with Jeff Bridges hot on their tails (I say hot, but tepid would probably be a kind turn of phrase tbh). Much of the journey (no matter which side of the law you are observing) is full of pretentious philosophising which basically adds up to not a lot.What really harms this film though is that there is no sense of intirgue, mystery, fear or tension and the film basically trundles along in its unbearably boring fashion.The scenes toward the end with one of the brothers reminds one of Winchester 73 (only it was handeled better in that film and was far more exciting). Here it's crap and embarrassing.To sum up, despite having capable actors such as Jeff Bridges (normally brilliant, but mumbles his way through this film). Ben Foster (a reliable actor who chooses his projects poorly) Hell or High Water is a boring film which instilled no emotional investment from me and basically bored me to tears.Final note; the critics loved this pretentious claptrap which tells you all you need to know about Hell or High Water.",

            "review_title": "Brothers rob banks to save family farm",
            "content": "The last song articulates the film's \"spirit of the outlaw.\" In this modern-age western the entire West Texas world is a bunch of outlaws: the banks whose usurious system would sweep the oil-rich ranch out from under the dead woman's grandsons, the diners who don't recognize the robbers, the trigger-happy customers who turn a heist into a slaughter, the waitress who resents losing the robber's $200 tip that she needs to keep a roof over her daughter's mortgaged head. And so to the central quartet. Two brothers face off against two lawmen. Toby is the good son determined to improve the lot of his two abandoned sons and ex-wife by robbing the Texas Midland branches to get the money to pay off the Texas Midland reverse mortgage and back taxes. He recruits his wilder ex-con brother Tanner. The brothers' bond bristles with insults, parallelling that between Sheriff Marcus and his Indian/Mexican deputy Alberto. Exulting in political incorrectness, Marcus teases Alberto about his ethnic background. In return Alberto razzes his senior about his looming retirement. In blind poetic justice, the wilder outlaw and the tamer lawman are both killed.Though Toby and Marcus survive their success stays shadowed. In their last scene both appear dramatically cleaned-up, healthier versions of their earlier presentation. Marcus made it through a gun-happy society's law system to make retirement. Toby has ensured his sons' fortunes by passing on the oil-rich farm. But neither man knows peace. As Marcus senses (or as a moral man needs to believe), Toby is haunted by his brother's death and the deaths of the bank-folk incidental to their robberies. He remains an outsider in his own family, coldly dismissed by his wife, kept at a proper distance by his more promising sons. Marcus remains trapped by the incompletely solved case. How can he prove Toby was the second robber? How did Toby plan it all and get away with it? And why? The depths of Marcus's grief and anger are suggested when he tells Toby of the large family Alberto left behind.In the last scene Marcus gratefully accepts Toby's invitation to continue their conversation at his home in town. There they may find \"peace.\" We're not told what that \"peace\" means for each of them, if either will get it, and how. Perhaps Toby's \"peace\" would be avenging Tanner's death and dispatching the ex-sheriff's implicit threat to his scheme \u2014 or making the final sacrifice for his sons and going down in gunfire. Perhaps Marcus's \"peace\" would be solving that last case and bringing the robber to justice \u2014 or in his last shoot-out heroically escaping the torpor of retirement. It's a Mexican standoff.In the last shot Marcus drives off, disappearing into the countryside as the camera drops to wheat level. That movement implies burial, as if an augur of the final shoot-out that even a modern-day Western sets us up to expect. But that reading is inflected by the reflection of a triangle of light on the left side of the screen. The light changes that burial to resurrection. Perhaps the two heroes' \"peace\" will therefore rather be putting the antagonistic past behind them and getting on with their lives. That would make this a new age Western, which prefers a negotiated compromise over another shoot-out. That gives the men a sensitive, more female side, coherent with their later cleaned-up, more civilized look. That would also balance the tough flatness of the film's women, all consigned to the margin: Toby's hardened wife, the fleshy single-mom waitress who's drawn to him, his casino pickup, the waitress who for forty years has been serving up only t-bone steaks, the only option being peas or corn. Toby's courtly abstemiousness contrasts to Tanner's prostitute performing on the bed behind him.The title comes from the lawyer's instruction: Come hell or high water the heroes have to get the cash to the bank to avoid the foreclosure. The absence of high water is evident in the arid Texas landscape and the tired bodies that move bent and broken and hopeless through it. Only an Eastern city slicker would order a trout in these parts. As for the hell, it's in the people, helpless before the banks, hopeless in their cycle of generations of poverty, with only the rare opportunity to make the one score that may be too late for them but just might spring free their kids. This circle of hell might well be the Trump supporters, on the fringe of the economy and the law, so hopeless they'll bet it all on an irrational, even lunatic long-shot.",

            "content": "I think just by looking at the box office numbers, it's proved that it's near impossible to put out a western that has broad range appeal. Hell or High Water takes the genre into modern day gracefully and gives us easily one of the top 5 films of the year to date.I always try and find the time to go see the next western to be released because Hollywood rarely spends the time or money towards making them, so when they do they are usually pretty decent. Hell or High Water is more than decent, it's magnificent. The screenplay comes from the brilliant mind behind last year's Sicario, Taylor Sheridan. And just like Sicario, all of the characters are well realized and established from the word go.Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Gil Birmingham all give well-crafted performances and largely against type as well. Director David Mackenzie speaks out against typecasting actors and he does a good job of not doing that here. Bridges and Birmingham play a funny buddy cup duo who have been through more than one rodeo together with a love-hate relationship. Their banter back and forth makes for some of the best comedy moments of the film, but it's not just there for kicks and giggles, every line adds weight to the characters so that you care when the final showdown begins.That duo is nicely complemented by the duo of Pine and Foster, who play brothers who rob banks in order to save their family's ranch. Just as Bridges plays the quick witted, Foster plays the unhinged and unpredictable brother, Tanner, to Pine's more subtle and reserved turn as Toby. The screenplay itself never asks the actors to do anything too crazy or stunning, which is what makes the performances all the more special. The ability for these four men to do so much with their eyes and unspoken actions makes it some of the best work they have all done.I also loved how patient and subtle the film itself was. It doesn't push bloody gun battles or massive twists in your face, it relies on great acting and a good directing job by David Mackenzie. I was immensely impressed by this film and I can't recommend it enough. I hope we hear about this film come award season.+Pine and Foster's best work to date+Bridges banter with Birmingham+Subtle and patient+Characters are well thought out by Sheridan9.5/10",

            "review_title": "Highly atmospheric bank robber yarn undermined by questionable moral stance",
            "content": "Hell or High Water has garnered a magisterial 88 on Metacritic with just about every critic fawning over this tale of two West Texas bank robbers determined to save the family farm from the big bad bankers about to foreclose on their property. Screenwriter Taylor Sheridan's dilemma was how far should he go in humanizing his anti-heroes without ending up glorifying them. To my mind, he went a little too far. Perhaps there are shades here of Arthur Penn's sleek hagiography, Bonnie and Clyde, that placed two odious Depression era criminals on an undeserving pedestal.Director David Mackenzie along with Sheridan have set their tale of the two brothers, Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster), in a contemporary milieu. Tanner is the \"real\" criminal here, having spent significant time in the slammer, and is properly depicted as what the general public would probably refer to as \"scary.\" Nonetheless, the film's scenarists are not averse to also depicting Tanner as somewhat noble, especially when he sacrifices himself during a high speed chase and subsequent shootout with the police, in order to save his brother.Toby, on the other hand, has no criminal record, but allegedly has an excuse for planning the bank robberies and joining his brother in these nefarious acts, which culminate in the death of a bank guard and armed citizen, during the last holdup. It seems that the Texas Midlands bank won't give Toby a break and is about to foreclose on his farm, which is now worth a lot more since oil has been found on the property. Good guy Toby wants to leave the farm to his children since he has known nothing but poverty growing up.The twist here is the way in which Toby plans his robberies. The brothers only steal cash from the cashier's drawers, avoiding exploding dye packs and serial numbers which can be traced. The getaway vehicles are buried at the farm and the cash is laundered at an Indian casino, exchanged first for poker chips and then re-cashed for new currency.If there's any doubt that the film's scenarists have unjustifiably turned Toby into a \"noble savage\" of sorts, his underlying brute nature is highlighted in a fight against a miscreant at a gas station. But note that Toby (unlike Tanner who shoots innocent people), only fights creeps who deserve a good whipping. There is a sub-plot here which involves the Texas Rangers who are chasing the so-called bad guys. Jeff Bridges plays Marcus Hamilton, partnered with Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), his half Mexican, Native-American deputy. Most of their interactions consist of Marcus making bigoted jokes at Alberto's expense but his easy-going partner plays along since he knows that his boss is really a good guy at heart. Sympathy for the bad guys becomes more apparent when a waitress at a diner rebuffs the lawmen, refusing to allow them to examine the large cash tip Toby left for her minutes before making his exit.Marcus and Alberto really don't have much to do until the end of Act 2 where Tanner flees on foot on top of a mountainside, where he engages in a gunfight with the Rangers. Tanner shoots Alberto dead and Marcus in turns finishes off Tanner. Only some of the earlier bank robbery scenes rival the climactic scene with Tanner in terms of gripping action. The rest of Hell or High Water primarily consists of a series of moderately interesting but lugubrious conversations, highlighting the anti-capitalist themes.The denouement features one further disappointing conversation where Marcus seeks to uncover Toby's motivations for getting involved in criminal activities. Since we've already found out what was motivating Toby, his explanation to Marcus is rather anti-climactic. Despite Toby's harsh circumstances growing up, nothing seems to justify his decision to rob the banks where innocent people are killed. But if you listen to Mackenzie and Sheridan, Toby gets a free pass and is now permitted to deed the family farm to his children, far clear from the bar of justice. Hell or High Water is highly atmospheric, featuring good performances from all involved, but the overarching moral stance leaves much to be desired.",

            "content": "Jeff Bridges plays a crusty old Texas Ranger in his sunset years in \"Asylum\" director David Mackenzie's \"Hell or High Water,\" an atmospheric, slow-burn, modern-day western about two bank robbers. Ben Foster and Chris Pine are fine as the desperadoes who rob the banks. They seem pretty savvy, too, because they take their loot and launder it at an Indian casino. They aren't greedy. They take over the loose bills in the teller's drawer and leave the money packets with the ink-packs designed to explode and mark the thieves. Foster is cast as older brother Tanner Howard; Howard shot his father to death and did time in prison, while his younger brother, Toby (Chris Pine of the rebooted \"Star Trek\" franchise), participates in the hold-ups. Tanner is a mean-spirited, troublemaking dastard who has no compunctions about shooting his fellow man. Miraculously enough, these guys follow a strategy that involves robbing on Midland, Texas, Banks, because the bank is poised to take their dead mother's land if they cannot pay back the loan. \"Sicario\" scenarist Taylor Sheridan wrote this cops and robbers outing. Just as villainous Tanner and Toby ridicule each other as brothers will do, Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton and his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham of the \"Twilight\" franchise) exchange barbs. Alberto constantly needles Marcus because he knows his old partner wants to do something useful before he ends up on his pension. Marcus decides to investigate the bank robbers, and this assignment keeps both men on the road. Marcus is a shrewd judge of character and he figures out what the Howard brothers will do next. What could otherwise have boiled down to a cutthroat Texas manhunt turns into a character study on both sides of good and evil. Clocking in at 102 minutes, \"Hell or High Water\" features wide-open, sprawling spaces and towns on the brink of extinction in Texas. The banks are the real bandits, and the Howards manipulate the situation to their advantage. In one scene, Marcus and Alberto enter a steak restaurant right across the street from a bank that Marcus bets will get robbed. The waitress that takes their order is a grumpy old dame (Margaret Bowman of \"No Country for Old Men\") who asks them what they don't want on their order. Everybody, she points out, buys a steak and potato at the restaurant, and they either don't want the green beans or they want the corn on the cob. Bowman is a real hoot and a holler, and her minor role enlivens the action. \"Hell or High Water\" qualifies as a down-t0-earth crime saga with interesting characters. Bridges delivers another wonderful performance that borrows something from his Rooster Cogburn portrayal in \"True Grit.\" Incidentally, Bridges received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Similarly, \"Hell Or High Water\" received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Editing, and Best Original Screenplay. This is one you shouldn't miss",

So when they meet, that's where the story gets to its end part.It has a strong opening, then slows down. Actually, it was approached like a classic crime film, which mean no high-tech. The story was a one liner, but the events in that story were extended. A simple screenplay, yet very effective presented on the screen.

            "content": "There's a real old-fashioned, rough-and-tumble aura about the opening scene of Hell or High Water, as two bank robbers break into two Texas Midlands banks wearing balaclavas and waving guns before fleeing the scene with dust filling the air behind their clapped-out banger. While the legendary outlaws of the West fled the scene of the crime on horseback and sported much more impressive facial hair, this modern-day, un-flashy heist carries the same rush of crime- fuelled adrenaline as watching the likes of Billy the Kid and Jesse James in countless genre movies of old. Yet while the picture certainly attempts to recapture the spirit of the Wild West mythos, its themes are very much rooted in 21st century sociological struggles.The two would-be thugs aren't after the cash for the glamour, but instead they are brothers desperately trying to raise the cash required to pay off the bank about to roll over on their deceased parents' farm. It turns out that the quiet, more thoughtful sibling Toby (Chris Pine) is the mastermind behind the series of robberies, which are made extra delicious by the fact that they are robbing the very bank they are looking to pay back. Ex-jailbird Tanner (Ben Foster) seems to go along with it just for the thrill-ride, and although he is sympathetic and dedicated to his brother's cause, he's going to carry out his work with a balls-to-the-wall attitude, as it seems he was simply born bad. The jobs are planned with expert precision; using a different vehicle every time and burying them afterwards, hitting the banks early, stealing only unmarked bills, and cleaning the money in the casino afterwards.But it isn't long until ageing Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) in on their tails. Speaking as though he has a mouth full to the brim with chewing tobacco, Marcus is an old-school cowboy who enjoys making fun of his half-Cherokee partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) and falling asleep beneath the stars with an almost- demolished eight-pack dangling from the grip. He is also the smartest guy in any room, although his easy-going demeanour means nobody seems to realise. After Tanner makes an improvised smash-and- grab while his brother sits oblivious in a diner across the way, Marcus goes and figures the whole thing out. His un-PC sense of humour combined with Bridges' natural screen presence means that Marcus is a real crowd-pleaser, and a nice counterbalance to the emotional weight of Toby and Tanner's desperation.I had a new level of respect for Pine after the film, as he is an actor who has found life difficult outside of the Star Trek franchise, but seems to have found a perfect fit in the gangly, stoic cowpoke. Toby may even garner the most sympathy as the father struggling to keep up with his child support as well as trying to rescue his childhood home. Yet director David Mackenzie (Starred Up) and writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) work to keep their characters grey, and tell a more honest story of how people react in times of financial hardship. The great enemy here are the banks, eager to swallow up property by the handful as posters offering debt relief litter the highways. It's an intelligent film, and one of many in recent times to react angrily to a every increasing capitalist society. Yet it's also gritty and thrilling, and isn't afraid to indulge in a moment of bad-assery, because after all, isn't that what makes the West so endearing?",

            "content": "For all of the terrific acting, and there is quite a lot (and notably Jeff Bridges' scene partner Gil Birmingham needs to be in like half the movies made for the next few years), Hell or High Water is sometimes a little too on the nose and I think I'm just a little tired of seeing Ben Foster, masterful and compelling and Foster-y as he is, playing sociopathic criminals (sure, he's good at it, but after a certain point maybe they could stretch - and Warcraft doesn't count). But it also has the perspective and approach that would have worked just as well if it was a Western set in the 1950's (though the Hayes code certainly would've changed things - only a little), as the plains of Texas and the honorable(ish) bank robbers and old-time ranger-sheriff face off against one another in a cat-and-mouse chase. As a quasi-Cormac McCarthy-lite thing, it's fine, and sometimes more than fine. There's even a half-Indian-half-Mexican in the other cop (again, see it for Birmingham), and while Jeff Bridges is his usual awesome Chris Pine is the one who really delivers the goods. It's execution is solid, if standard. It has vision but could've used more-ish.It's the kind of movie I thought was just 'alright' walking out, but thinking a little more about it (and stepping away from Sheridan's more on-the-nose commentary on the destabilization of the working class in rural America), it works. Or maybe it's just nice to see a wide release thriller, near the end of summer no less, that's more about characters and basic conflicts even if, well, we've seen some of this before (i.e. the 'old man just about to retire doing x-y-z as his last thing')",

Now the poor start robbing the banks to provide a financial future for their kids. Sort of a modern Robin Hood version, if you were to look at it in perspective. Robin Hood stories have been made before and better and with more humor. Probably Jeff Bridges is supposed to be the dude that provides the fun part, but he overdoes it. Can't take him too seriously as a character. I hate that when actors act too much like a stereotype. This movie could have been better. Now it is average to reasonably good. Not great, but certainly not bad either. That could be my whole review. Had it been the Coen Brothers then EVERYTHING from soundtrack to photography to acting would have been excellent. Had it been the Coen Brothers. Watch \"No Country for Old Men\" instead of this flick, you will be in for a real treat. But it aint the Coen Brothers who made this flick, it's director MacKenzie. Who's that you might ask? I wonder too. Thanks to MacKenzie I have watched just an average heist movie, which had much more going for it. Still it was satisfying to watch. But it nags a little, that it could have been much better and in the end I feel a little empty. Is that all? That's the problem with films that take themselves too seriously. You gotta deliver when you aim for something great and classic. They didnt deliver...It is a wannabe classic. Nothing is more frustrating than second place when you aim for first.",

            "content": "\"Hell or High Water\" is a carefully crafted film with superb dialogue and a fine acting ensemble. The film blends wry humor with the serious backdrop of a hardscrabble life in the midlands of Texas.The structure of the film is well-conceived with a pair of brothers who are robbing banks for relatively small stakes pursued by the two police officers who are on their trail.Chris Pine and Ben Foster are entirely believable as the troubled brothers, both ironically seeking a kind of redemption through the robberies. Pine's character Toby is the deeper thinker, who has carefully planned the bank heists to pay off the mortgage on his family ranch by the deadline of its foreclosure. Toby is motivated to offer his son the chance to break free from the family curse. Foster's character Tanner is the brother who desperately wants the respect from Toby. It is surprising how sympathetic the two brothers become as the film progresses.The two Texas Rangers are Jeff Bridges' character Marcus Hamilton and his sidekick is Alberto Parker, as played by Gil Birmingham. The two cops have their own special relationship that serves as a mirror image of the two lawbreaking brothers. It is inevitable that there will be a \"showdown\" between the two pairs of characters.The only disappointment in the film was its ending. The ultimate lack of resolution is, unfortunately, a weakness rather than a strength of the film. The final \"conversation\" also stretched credibility in what had previously been extremely realistic depictions of the bank heists and the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 conversation between the cops.Still, this film is a cut above most of the mindless Hollywood film fare. The filmmakers were clearly attempting to weave a social commentary about the callous nature of home foreclosures and the same general mood of discontent that was apparent throughout the 2016 presidential election. In this regard, \"Hell or High Water\" serves as a time capsule for the decade of the teens in twenty-first-century America.",

            "content": "Don't be fooled by the cowboy hats as Hell or High Water (2016) is much more than just another western bank-robber adventure. It belongs with films like Money Monster (2016) and 99 Homes (2015) that are loaded with post-GFC themes, all scorching the underbelly of American capitalism. As a hybrid genre, it cuts across several cinematic boundaries to produce an action-packed semi- comedic yet darkly probing look at a society still reeling in the wake of the 2008 world financial meltdown.The story hinges on the pursuits of two brothers who rob several banks in the wild west of Texas. Toby (Chris Pine) is the likable one who wants to save his farm from mortgage foreclosure by a bank that still feeds off the sub-prime loan fiasco. Recently out of prison and far from likable, his brother Tanner (Ben Foster) is erratic after years of pent-up violence. As opposites they represent the yin and yang of capitalism, set against against dystopian landscapes of rusting cars, abandoned houses and poverty, beyond which are desert-scapes still beautiful despite human presence. Their fox-smart nemesis is a Texas Ranger called Marcus (Jeff Bridges) who is about to retire and wants to snare one more before handing in his badge.In many ways, the details of the robbing and running play second fiddle to the bigger picture that is painted in this film. Seeing the two modern-day Robin Hoods exacting revenge on the system that causes so much injustice and pain is an innately satisfying spectacle. Except for Tanner's violent tendencies, their crimes are victimless once we accept the premise that banks are evil. Several other narrative strands weave the larger story about today's wild west. Marcus has a part- Comanche deputy called Alberto (Gil Birmingham) whom he mercilessly teases on racial lines in a nasty throwback to white supremacy. It is hard to miss the bitter irony of former Indian land stolen by cowboys that is now stolen by banks, a twist that leads us inexorably to side with the bank- robbing brothers.Outstanding cinematography and fine acting performances are the film's great strengths. Portrait- like framing shifts seamlessly from wide panoptic views to close-ups of craggy age-lines and worried glances, all in a colour palette that glows like desert skies. The storyline has varied pacing that captures both the slow clock of desert living and the danger of life on the run. The principal actors are cast perfectly and bring authenticity and nuance to their roles. This is a visually engaging and thematically rich film with an unexpectedly enigmatic ending. It will undoubtedly find a place among the nominations for this year's best.",

            "content": "A heist thriller packaged as a contemporary western with solid performances, dry humor and a social commentary on the effects of unguarded and insensitive capitalism. While it offers nothing new in terms of plot, narrative or screenplay - it more than makes up through confident direction, well defined character arcs and excellent performances throughout. Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster) are estranged brothers who led completely different lives - one (Toby) as a doting son, caring husband and father, while the other (Tanner) has been on the wrong side of the law from the beginning who has spent most of his time in various prisons for petty thefts and robberies. When the bank announces to foreclose their property due to unpaid debts just when Toby discovers oil in their farm, he is desperate to get possession of it before it is reclaimed by the bank forever. Toby comes up with a plan to rob the same bank (multiple of its branches) and seeks assistance from his brother Tanner who regularly agrees. What happens when the plan is set in motion and a retiring police chief Marcus from a small town starts investigating.Chris Pine was a revelation in this role. While it is not intense or award worthy, he does complete justice by portraying a stubborn, meticulous and sometimes desperate man to get over with what they started. Jeff Bridges has some of the best lines though they range from being insensitive to downright racist - he surely offends Indian tribes, blacks, mexicans etc. along the way. But the dry humor he evokes along with his Indian partner are worth a second watch. The screenplay plays down many intense sequences to ensure they do not get sopped down or become melodramatic which would be inconsistent with the overall theme. The setup, the screenplay that reveals the plot without the characters saying it as a narrative shows the ability of the director about the confidence and the intensity shown in the 2013 'Starred Up' was a testimony to his talent. Jeff Bridges is one of the better contemporary Hollywood actors and his choice of roles has always been that extract maximum performance within the mainstream cinema. Ben Foster plays a very generic not so bright but trigger happy ex-con which has been played over many times but still done as good as it could be.Sometimes innovation is not the only answer to standout. Perfection and old school intensity does work too.",

            "content": "I knew too little before seen it and I had a little surprise. I didn't expected the movie to be that good. It tells an actual story. many people it has been trough this kind of things, because in places like this, they're so far away from everyone. Jeff Bridges says it perfectly: \"No one can help them now, they're alone\".It tells the story of two brothers who start robbing banks for getting the money they need to pay the debts they're in with the bank and so the child of one of them, Toby (Chris Pine) can provide a better future for his sons. He is helped by his ex-convict brother Tanner (Ben Foster) who is a bit crazy and has a criminal mind more violent than his brother. They're both being chased by the ranger of the state, the Ranger Marcus, played by a great Jeff Bridges (as always). All the actors in here are great in their roles. They fit perfectly in their roles, from the two brothers desperately looking for money to the old ranger who won't give up in making the law being applied. Even many of the secondary characters like tho woman from the bar or the mate from the ranger are great in their roles, so this a very good point of the movie.One of the few things I have to add against it it's that at parts, at least for me, felt a bit too slow and that all the things they talk with the attorney about their properties and so I feel like they were not explained clearly, but at least at the end we get a bit of explanation in this final dialogue between Marcus & Toby.Other things that is truly remarkable is it's cinematography. It captures the feeling of rush when they're escaping from all the banks, but also captures the feeling of loneliness of this Texas Midlands, all the plains with very few houses and a very long and dusty road.I recommend you this one if you want to get away from the typical image of USA (the people living in all of this big houses with plenty of money and so) and want to discover a new reality in there, and also if you want to see something different from all of this blockbusters full of explosions and non-sense things.

            "content": "'Hell or High Water' is one of those films which doesn't do anything technically or storytelling wise that you haven't seen attempted before, however it so well directed, so well written and so well acted, that you can't help but be bowled over by it. This is one of the best modern westerns I have seen in the recent past. 'Hell or High Water' at the heart of it is about the failure of the American economic system. Like a few other films made after the great economic crisis of 2008, the film comments upon how there are many parts of America and the American population that the post 2008 financial recovery process has failed to touch. Just like the John Ford or Frank Capra films of the Depression Era, more than characters, it is the institutions like the banks that get vilified in 'Hell or High Water'. The motivation behind the crimes committed by Toby and Tanner has its roots in the past injustices done by the bank against their mother which adds to this theme. At the basic level what 'Hell or High Water' does by depicting the recession hit working class America is lift the veil of America's economic prosperity from the eyes of urban America and the world as a whole. When it comes to films about vigilantes, you can have something like Arthur Penn's 'Bonnie and Clyde' which romanticises the actions of the characters, or you can have Terrence Malick's 'Badlands' where Malick cheekily makes fun of how mindless and reckless vigilantes/criminals/hell-raisers can accidentally find their way into folklore and mythic status. 'Hell or High Water' manages to remain reasonably neutral in its stance. Director David Mackenzie and screenwriter Taylor Sheridan show us both the sides. On one side they give us the motivations of the Howard brothers which are to some extent understandable. We also get these great side characters who are Texas residents and who somewhat side with the brothers from an idealistic standpoint due to their own financial misery and exploitation at the hands of the banks which makes them want to live vicariously through the brothers. However the other side of the moralistic divide is also represented by showing how easily things can go out of hand and lead to devastating consequences in these situations. The characters of the rangers, Marcus and Alberto help the narrative to give us the opposite point of view. Marcus and Alberto share a very brotherly relationship mirroring the relationship of the Tanner brothers. This is why when the film progresses towards its climax and we encounter fatal repercussions of the antics of Toby and Tanner, we understand the flip-side of vigilantism. David Mackenzie's direction is mature and gritty. He knows exactly how long to hold a shot and knows how much he can stretch and elongate a particular scene to infuse gravitas into it. He creates a brilliant dreary, desolate atmosphere. The streets and corners of the small Texas towns(although the film was shot in New Mexico) portray perfectly the presence of stagnation, a sense of disillusionment and apathy due to lack of progress and economic developments in the areas. Mackenzie makes some of the fields, the huge open spaces and ruinous locations look almost post-apocalyptic. He uses a lot of images of billboards with signs like 'Closing Down' or 'Debt Relief' at the side of the roads to further drive home the thematic backdrop of the story. The style of direction and the nature of the story itself has a very Coen brothers like feel to it and the viewer will be reminded of films like 'No Country for Old Men', 'Blood Simple', etc. But Mackenzie shows enough of his own flair to lift this from being blandly derivative. Taylor Sheridan has to be given a lot of credit for the depth of the screenplay. With 'Sicario' and now 'Hell or High Water', he has shown that he can use real socio-economic issues(drug war in Sicario) of the world as the backdrop of his screenplays and use such issues to enrich the surface level story lines. The intricate details of the script are very thoughtfully and intelligently written and they make a lot of sense.The acting is stellar. Chris Pine, just like he did in 'Z for Zachariah', drops his pretty boy status and plays a scruffy character with depth and gravity. He still retains the likability however which is also needed in this film to some extent. Ben Foster plays the live- wire Tanner and portrays the character with just the correct amount of energy and dynamism to prevent himself from going a bit too over- the-top. The chemistry between Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham is great. Their conversations range from childish teasing to nuanced discussion on America's racial history. Bridges' character is lonely and awaiting retirement and he hides his fear of having to live a lonely life post retirement by constantly teasing Alberto(Gil). All the scenes involving Bridges and Birmingham are captivating.Only one minor flaw bothered me and it has something to do with the dialogue in a few scenes. Some of the lines exchanged between two characters in the film told me exactly what fate lied ahead for these characters. The foreshadowing was a little too on the nose for me and the characters met the exact respective fates that I knew they would due to this blatancy. 'Hell or High Water' is a fantastic film that keeps the viewer always on the edge and has something to say about contemporary American society which gives it pertinence. It is brilliantly directed, brilliantly written and brilliantly acted. The ending scene perfectly encapsulates the sphere of moral ambiguity that the film as a whole resides within. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "This film kind of came out of nowhere, only seeing the trailers for it a couple of weeks ago, but the immediate hype was intriguing so I was eager to watch this as soon as it was released. First thing I do after watching this is head straight for the shop and grab myself some bottled American lager (well, brewed under licence but it's the closest I'm gonna get.) I get home, crack one open and sit there thinking about what I've just seen. First and only film I've seen of director David McKenzie was his grim British prison drama, Starred Up, which was incredibly good. And I was mesmerised by last year's Sicario which is written by the same Taylor Sheridan so it's a win-win combination already without adding the cast. The story delves deeper than a couple of brothers committing bank robberies across west Texas, it's almost political and opens the field to a broader history in a realistic manner, but leaves you sitting on the fence with regard to who's the bad or good guy and in fact, proves either can be both giving the circumstance. We follow the Howard brothers Tanner and Toby, Tanner played ruthlessly by Ben Foster as the impulsive, trigger-happy ex-con and Chris Pine playing Toby, the struggling, better, younger brother. Foster being a worn monster truck of brutal force whilst Pine is a filthy aged muscle car. Hot on their trail is soon-to-be retired Texas ranger Marcus Hamilton played masterfully by Jeff Bridges, and his partner, who Hamilton continually ridicules about his heritage, Alberto Parker, played by Twilight's shape-shifting wolf, Gil Birmingham. The relationships within both pairs are highly captivating and with a strong sense of realism. Their performances being some of the best I've seen all year, and yes, Bridges ultimately delivers but that's expected, Pine is equally amazing, shredding all skin and hint of Capt. Kirk but Foster is the star here. Maybe slightly biased, liking Foster since 3:10 To Yuma as Charlie Brown, his portrayal is ferociously compelling. You can't help but like the character and I suppose that's the beauty of this film, all the characters have they're own likability, making it harder to choose who's side you'll be on just hanging in there for the outcome. The script is amazing, superbly written with some classic clever quotes, giving Ben Foster some of the best lines in the movie, actually providing elements of comedy. The confrontations in particular are enthralling, making great cinema. Tense, powerful with a perfectly balanced contrast between the action and downtime, the only constant is the dusty ambiance that leaves you with a gritty taste, I could almost feel the dirt on my skin. It's excellence doesn't end there, with a flawless choice of veterans of west American dramas Nick Cave and Warren Ellis who's collaboration has been on Lawless and The Proposition; and independently Ellis doing an eerie score for The Road and Cave composing a haunting one for The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford. The perfect pairing of score and soundtrack gives the film an air of melancholy, a sober tone that belongs to this story.

The typical winners are heavy on drama, or perhaps are socially conscious. This nominee defies that. And while I don't expect it to win, I am glad it will get a little extra attention.Best Supporting Actor Jeff Bridges? I love Jeff Bridges. Everyone loves Jeff Bridges. The Academy loves him, too. It's too early to say, but I don't see this as being a win for him. He is great as the old, crotchety, semi-racist Texas ranger... but it's not one of those mind-blowing roles that really get noticed. There was no special makeup or voice alteration required. I would love to see Bridges be honored, but I doubt it.Best Screenplay? This would also be great to see. Although the basic plot is simple -- brothers robbing banks to purchase the family farm -- the intricacies are wonderful, such as why certain banks are targeted, and the way the brothers \"launder\" the money. I was not a fan of some of the heavy-handed messaging. The idea that the American military stole from the Indians, and now the banks stole from the American people. The message itself is fine, but the way they were so blunt about it by having Alberto express the exact sentiment... it sort of dumbed everything down.Best Editing? It is my opinion that editing is very hard to judge. Unless you are an editor, you may not know what goes into the job. Also, the best editing should be flawless, and not obvious in a film. For this second reason, I would gladly hand over the best editing award to this film, because the editing was indeed very smooth, and the pace was excellent. Some movies drag at 90 minutes. This one, with its pace, could have been three hours and still enjoyable. Surely the editing is at least partially to thank.",

            "content": "'HELL OR HIGH WATER': Five Stars (Out of Five)Critically acclaimed crime drama flick; about two bank robbing brothers, in West Texas, trying to raise money to save their family's ranch. The film stars Jeff Bridges, Chirs Pine and Ben Foster. It was written by Taylor Sheridan (who also wrote 2015's outstanding 'SICARIO'), and it was directed by David Mackenzie. The film received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics (98% positive on Rotten Tomatoes), and it's been a small hit at the Box Office (so far) as well. I loved it. Toby Howard (Pine) is a divorced father, living in West Texas, that desperately wants to leave a better life for his two estranged sons (John-Paul Howard and Christopher W. Garcia). His brother Tanner (Foster) is an ex-con, that wants to help Toby achieve this dream. They're family ranch is about to be foreclosed on, and there's a great deal of oil that's just been discovered on the land. The brothers decide to rob several banks, in order to pay off the farm. Marcus Hamilton (Bridges) is the retiring Texas Ranger that wants to stop them. The movie is a very well put together western/heist flick; that focuses a lot more on rich character development, than action. With that said, the climactic shootout/chase at the end is epic. The three leads are all great in the film, but Bridges is classic (it's probably one of his best performances ever). Pine is likable, as the movie's main character; and Foster is awesome at being crazy, once again (I don't think he can play anything else). Like I said, the movie is a little slow-paced/slow building at first; but it's worth it! Sheridan's script is brilliant.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFMQ3xbt9g",

            "content": "Despite the great performances and beautiful cinematography, it was like watching paint dry because the story wasn't there and the pacing was slower than a statue crawling in a leisurely stroll down a sidewalk. The story is supposed to be about two brothers who rob the branches of one specific bank, Texas Midland Bank, and the two Texas Rangers (not one as the advertising would lead you to believe) that chase them. The plan is to rob the banks that hold the reverse mortgage on the ranch the younger brother inherited and then use that money to payoff the mortgage. Aka, pay the bank with the same money they stole from it, after they launder the money through an out of state casino of course. Two Texas Rangers that don't really like each other are assigned the case. Of course, one is an old near retirement bigot and the other is Mexican and Commanchie minority. Of the brothers, one is a father with two sons and an ex-wife. The other brother is an ex-con that was convicted of - what else?- bank robbing. He is looking for redemption. He is dumber than his younger brother. That is all the depth these characters have because They all are rather flat and swallow. The story is shallow because certain things were never explained. They tell that the bank is evil and deserve to be robbed. But they never tell you why or show the bank doing an evil act to deserve retribution for their action. This makes it hard to feel for the brothers. Don't use old overworked tired reference clinches. SHOW US! The makers of this film relying on the average audience members having their own problems with their banks in order to having immediate sympathy with the brothers. That is a bad idea and lazy storytelling. In, the way the details of the plan was worked out and who thought of it was vague too. We never see the young brother coming up with the plan. We just hear everyone else say he thought of it AFTER THE PLAN WAS ALREADY SET INTO MOTION when the film starts! Yes, we don't see any of the pre-planning. Lazy storytelling again. In fact, almost all of the script seams to be racists jokes about Mexicans, Indians, Christians, and religion. Oh, and of course, near the end, we see the tired clich\u00e9 of the old ranger having a hound dog as a pet. This film does have it's good points like it's realistic touches and cinematography that makes you feel in you are in Texas. However, when it comes to the acting, it falls apart. The lead roles all turn in stellar performance which Pine and Bridges are the best. But once you get past the leads, it comes crystal clear many of the supporting roles had people who were not professional actors, especially the cowboy in the bank, the Cowboys in the restaurant, and the T-bone steak waitress. But even with the professional actors there was a problem because between Bridges and Gil Birmingham who play the two Texas Rangers, there was no chemistry at all between the two actors. Birmingham played his role like he was made of wood because it was so understated. This movie is way way over hyped. Save money. Wait for it on free TV.",

The western is more confined than most genres to a time period and placement, and the world has largely forgotten the old-fashioned stagecoaches, horseback riders and cattle wranglers of one hundred years prior. A philosophical western is even more rare, but it is always a genre that has lent itself to telling great stories about the law of the land and the lengths one goes to for their family. That's one thing the movie tells us (sometimes at point blank range) is that the times have changed: it is no longer foreign invaders and land expansion we have to worry about, but the loan companies, casinos and hidden interest payments that threaten to bankrupt our culture and way of life. The bank robbing brothers that Chris Pine and Ben Foster eloquently portray are not good guys by any means, but they are definitely sympathetic and desperate characters that are rebelling against a corrupt system.

Detective Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is on the trail to track them down with his Inuit partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) with whom he enjoys regular racially charged banter. On the verge of retirement, and his last big case looming, Marcus's experience and expertise plays off against the recklessness and hostility of the brothers to build up to an explosive climax.David Mackenzie's latest film after 2014's excellent Starred Up, sets its sentiments and certainly its politics in motion pretty early on, slowly hovering over some graffiti on a wall which reads 'three tours of Iraq, no bail outs for us.' The action takes place throughout in a series of American ghost towns with a creepy air of barrenness and desolation where once there was seemingly prosperity and hope. The tone is set in a scene where Birmingham's character talks of how many years ago the ancestors of Bridges took the land from his descendants, but now the banks are the ones doing the same thing.On the surface, Hell or High Water seems a straightforward cops/robbers tale, with a standard formula and clich\u00e9d characters, and it may well have been if Mackenzie hadn't injected something a little extra in the overall product. It doesn't just roll the characters out, it properly examines them, their motivations, fears and doubts. We learn of the brothers family circumstances, and their respective feelings towards their late mother, while Bridges as the seasoned cop is shown wrestling with his world weariness as his retirement looms. It's slow and sobering, with an unmistakable touch of the Coen's No Country for Old Men to it.Like a lot of intelligent scripts, it blurs the distinction between right and wrong, good and evil, heroes and villains in a whirlwind of moral ambiguity, with some sweeping desert cinematography, lingering atmosphere and a genuine air of suspense that will leave you thoroughly pleased. *****",

            "review_title": "A simple but effective film!",
            "content": "This film at its core is an extremely simple story of two brothers robbing banks without getting caught by the law/ Jeff bridges character. This film is actually quite surprising in the fact that it can have a lasting hold on you even with a simple premise, it is how it has been executed is the reason for that. Firstly the cast who are all on their top game for this film, Ben Foster is a crazy, wild and without limits ex convict who plays the brother of Chris Pine's character who is 180 degrees opposite. This contrasting character elements works fantastically well and shows and interesting and at some times testing relationship between the two of them. The character that Ben Foster portrays sort of reminds myself of the villain the Joker from Batman, for the reason that he does whatever he wants and doesn't care about the repercussions of his actions. The character is incredibly unpredictable which makes for great viewing as you have know idea what he will do. As for Chris Pine's character he is the 180 degrees opposite, he is quite, thoughtful and caring at heart. This all makes it very easy for the audience to resonate with the situation he is going through and make you want him to succeed even though what he is doing is illegal. Finally Jeff Bridges who is fantastic as a xenophobic and stereotypical cop, who is 100% focused in bringing the brothers to justice whatever that may be. He has the aura of a quite brutal and aggressive person on the outside but as the film goes on a more personal and heart felt element of the character appears, especially with is partner who he has banter with. Even though sometimes the \"banter\" with his partner can be quite horrible and spiteful at times it makes you resonate with Alberto, played by Gil Birmingham, and the person difficult he has in there relationship. In a strange way this film brings this simple story and characters together in a way that makes for great intrigue and viewing to see the ups and downs of the relationships between both couples. The story,script and actors may all be the main reasons why this film is so good, however there is another reason and that is the directing by David McKenzie. He does a fantastic job with this film , considering the multiple elements and themes that this film occurs along its way. Whether it be from the heart pounding bank robberies to the more quite intimate moments between the characters this film never sits still and has a very good flow to it. McKenzie also does a really good job of making the location looks beautiful when it needs to be and really dark and unpleasant during rough times in the film. It is a real testament to the talent that this director is by showing the exact same location, i.e. Texas, it two very different points of view. Finally this film has a quite surprising ending I personally didn't see it coming which refreshing to see. It may be surprising but in a way it closes and ties off all the avenues of this film, but at the same time does leave one open for mystery and suspense which always a bonus in a film of this nature.This film is 80% out of 100, it has great performances from everyone a good simple but effective story and great directing, definitely worth a watch and would not be a waste of your time.",

            "content": "I was not sure what to expect from this crime/drama film but I certainly was looking forward to sitting down to watch just how good actors Ben Foster, Chris Pine and the venerable 66 year old Jeff Bridges would bring this story to life. I must say that they did not disappoint me. The film opened well with the two brothers Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) and Toby Howard (Chris Pine) proceeding to target then rob a specific bank, The Texas Midlands bank branches. Very quickly we learn that Toby is the guy who planned the robberies and he is providing specific instructions to his older more trigger happy brother Tanner, on what they will steal. Specifically these two brothers did not want to engage in any robbery of the banks customers, nor were they going after the bank safe. Toby and Tanner's intentions were simply to rob The Texas Midlands bank branches that were located in smaller towns with less heavily secured personnel and/or without any security monitoring equipment. Their plan was to quickly take the loose cash from the bank clerk's tills and get the heck out of there.Eventually we learn why Toby (and older brother Tanner) are robbing only Texas Midlands bank branches and how much they intend to take them for before these two bank robbing brothers decide to stop. As the cash being stolen from these small town Texas Midlands banks is minimal the Federal authorities are leaving it to the local sheriff's department to meet with the bank managers and assess how to capture these two bank robbers who seem to be very cautious in how they select the banks they will eventually rob.The local sheriff is a guy named Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) who is assisted by his deputy, a native American Indian named Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). There is a secondary story we are provided with which encompasses that Sheriff Hamilton is only weeks away from retirement and as such he takes great liberties in taking flagrant pot shots about his deputy's native American heritage. Although Sheriff Hamilton's jokes appear to be both racial and personal against Deputy Parker, they are merely to remind Deputy Parker of his boss and pal's imminent retirement. Are we to believe that as these two local law enforcement officers are hunting the two brothers who are robbing banks and their identities remain unknown that maybe Sheriff Hamilton may not live to see his retirement? Well I don't want to spoil the film for anyone but there certainly are questions that the audience is expecting answers to which keeps us very interested in the four main characters.I would not classify this film as a western as it is more of a crime/drama and specifically about two local Sheriffs attempting to figure out where these two unknown bank robbers will strike next. We learn that the older brother Tanner has that stereotype \"mommy and daddy never loved me\" mantra and this is why he is the more aggressor of the two brothers living without fear or consequences for the action taken.I liked the way the film evolved and the ending was credible. It is certainly a film I intend to watch a second and/or even a third time. It is a good story, with even better acting and a quality film for the crime drama genre. I give it an 8 out of 10 rating.",

After seeing it I'm slightly puzzled why it has been touched by such acclaim . Giving it some thought I did conclude the screenplay was written by Taylor Sheridan whose main career in Hollywood is as an actor and actors do get overly praised if they either write or direct a production while it's impossible not to like Jeff Bridges and there's always an element of recognising a film at award voting that has traditional commercial appeal . Don't get me wrong because this film is a competent character driven thriller but probably no more than that My main gripe is that it does try and sugar coat the Howard brothers just a little too much . They're driven in to becoming bank robbers due to debts . Hmmm . Let me think now . Would it be too simplistic to have a couple of characters rob banks simply because they're a pair of greedy dumbasses ? Do I detect an element of post modernist morality where no one is responsible for their negative actions ? I much preferred the post modernism of New Hollywood where if someone robs a bank it's an act of nihilistic amorality or just simple greed One aspect of this film that is interesting is that it was directed by a Scotsman David MacKenzie and it shows in a some what clich\u00e9d outsider of America in general and Texas in particular . We see vast grasslands interrupted by oil drilling , cowboys and Indians still exist and it's a state where gun possession is almost universal which possibly makes an unintentional point that if you're a dumbass intent on committing armed bank robbery do it somewhere that doesn't have armed citizens",

            "content": "Chris Pine was determined to find a film and a role that was as far away from Captain Kirk and Star Trek as he could find. In the role of Toby Howard in David Mackenzie's wonderful HELL OR HIGH WATER, Pine certainly has found that role.Reminiscent of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (but not on that, esteemed, level) HELL OR HIGH WATER tells the tale of two brothers (Pine and Ben Foster) who rob branches of the bank that is about to foreclose on the mortgage of the ranch they inherited from their mother, in order to pay the bank back with their own money. They are pursued by a Texas Ranger (Jeff Bridges). As written by Taylor Sheridan and directed by Mackenzie, the movie is much, much more than the plot. It is about relationships and character and mood and setting...And...it is one terrific film.Start with the mood. Mackenzie imbues this film with the feeling of a lazy \"dog days of August\" atmosphere. Some will take that as slow - there is much, much dialogue and scene setting shots - but I took it as wonderful. It immersed you in the world of these people and the filmmakers took their time showing you this world.The dialogue is terrific, writer Sheridan also wrote the screen play to the terrific Sicario, so I'm looking forward to what he does next. In the hands of lesser actors than Pine (the smart brother) and Foster (the wild brother), this dialogue - and these brothers - could have been one note. But they are not. They are nuanced and multi-faceted and fascinating to watch.But they don't hold a candle to the performance that Bridges brings to the table.Jeff Bridges has been nominted 6 times for an Academy Award (winning the Best Actor Oscar for Crazy Heart) and he just might be in line for his 7th nomination (and 2nd win) here. His Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton, is just one fascinating, wonderful character. Much like Tommy Lee Jones in No Country, Bridges is playing a Texas Ranger that is nearing the end of his career. But, unlike Jones' character, Bridges is keeping up with today's \"modern\" criminal, but he's not keeping up with father time. I will start the campaign for an Oscar for Bridges for this role right now - that's how much I enjoyed it. Come for the acting, stay for the atmosphere - Hell or High Water is well worth the journey.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",

            "content": "Chris Pine and Ben Foster star as bank robbing brothers in this superb modern Western from Starred Up Director David Mackenzie. With a screenplay written by the acclaimed Taylor Sheridan (Sicario), Hell Or High Water is a tense, taut and brooding crime drama set in present day Texas.The plot is simple: the family ranch is on the verge of being repossessed by the bank, so Pine resorts to desperate measures and teams up with his criminal brother Foster as they embark on a series of bank robberies in order to raise the cash to secure the ranch. They are soon pursued by Jeff Bridges' almost-retired Texas Ranger as they work their way through a number of small, near-desolate Texan towns.However, whilst the premise here may be straightforward, Mackenzie actually offers us something hugely substantial. The quiet Texan towns and the desperation of the brothers are just some of the methods in which Mackenzie shows us how the global economic crisis has had, and still has, a devastating effect on people. We see a waitress desperate to hang onto a generous tip, houses for sale and a number of roadside billboards and posters offering loans and debt consolidation schemes. Indeed, the banks themselves are very much portrayed as the villain here, and as such it's very hard not to want to root for Pine and Foster as they cleverly seek to steal the money they need from the very branch they owe, so that they can make the necessary payments with the bank's own money.Considering this is a story that could perhaps have been set in any town, any state, or any country even, Hell Or High Water felt very much like an homage to the genre of Western movies but also to Texas itself. The sumptuous sweeping shots of the towns and absolutely gorgeous photography of untouched prairie landscapes felt as if they were intended to show the state of Texas in both its expansive and desolate glory, whilst providing the audience with a nod to the great Westerns of old (High Noon, The Searchers and True Grit all springing to mind).Credit must go to Mackenzie for superbly merging the old with the new here. This is ultimately a story founded on the 21st century economic crisis, yet set in what is ultimately a 19th century backdrop. One scene in particular that stood out for me was when the brothers were filling up their car at a gas station; a cowboy leaves the scene on horseback as two young kids drive up blaring out music from their car. Later, we see Jeff Bridges' Texas Ranger and his partner held up in their car as they wait for a group of cowboys to drive their cattle across the road. These were odd juxtapositions but they perhaps serve to highlight this fundamental theme within the film.Numerous references to Native Americans further enhance this idea; the acknowledgement of what once was. Again, though, there is more substance here, in that these references serve to point out an irony that the citizens of today's America are having everything taken away from them (by the banks) as the Native Americans had everything taken away from them (of course the circumstances here are vastly different). Most of these references were made by Bridges' character; perhaps the personification of this sense of 'the old'. Reluctantly approaching retirement and making constant racist comments to his partner, Bridges is world-weary and worn out with nothing to look forward to. Tracking down the brothers is his 'one last job' and one he embraces obsessively as a means to stave off his retirement. He is the epitome of 'old school' in his humour, methods and etiquette, but it is clear he is also terrified of entering a world he is unfamiliar with. It's a fantastic performance from Bridges, who emotes and conveys awkward humour, obsession and fear in his own unique way.Countering Bridges is the ever brilliant Ben Foster. The oldest of the brothers, he's street smart, unpredictable, ill-tempered, quick-witted and reckless; and the personification of \"the new\". It's his actions which give the brothers' journey an overwhelming sense of uncertainty and excitement and yet despite his copious flaws, Foster manages to make his character an endearing one.This is Chris Pine's vehicle, though. It's a restrained and thoughtful performance, and with that an intensely brooding one which encapsulates the entire tone of the film. It is Pine's younger brother who has masterminded the whole scheme to obtain the money, whilst getting revenge on the bank that has caused his family so much grief. It is he who has asked his brother to revert back to a life of crime. He is doing a bad thing in order to do a good thing, and there is barely a scene in which Pine is involved where we don't see the remorse and the shame etched across his face. It's a role which could not be further than that which made his name (as James Kirk in the Star Trek franchise) yet one he commands with great maturity.Mackenzie really does deserve much of the praise, though, for this fantastic piece of film making. Hell Or High Water is so steadily paced yet creates a significant amount of tension as a race against time evolves. He draws incredible performances from his leads, provides his audience with stunning visuals and touches upon themes which set this way above a typical heist movie or generic Western.For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/",

As far as movie goers go, I may be an exception, but I have a complete lack of romanticism with the American West. I understand the merit of older westerns, but nowadays, they tend to just seem dated. But something about Jeff Bridges in a Texas desert seems right. I'm also a sucker for a good screenplay and some risky robbery scenes, and right off the bat this film lets you know that is what you are in for. The contrast between the four main characters, the two brothers and two rangers, drive the narrative to a point to where you aren't sure who you are rooting for by the time the climactic scene begins. So if you like bank robberies, Chris Pine's eyes, and dramatic scenes of cars being buried, you should check this out. 8.7/10",

They wash the money at an Oklahoma casino. Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) plays a sheriff nearing retirement who is after them. Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) is his \"half-breed\" partner one of the many inappropriate slurs used in the film.Chris Pine was rather plain and subdued during the film, just being dutiful to a family that prefers to live without him. Jeff Bridges was a bore. Ben Foster was the only real animated character. He was reckless.The acting was okay. The dialogue a bit dry, except when then were bad mouthing Native Americans and Mexicans and even then it wasn't impressive. I imagine the film's popularity is due to the populist appeal of banks being inherently evil, and the common man can get back at them...this and the bank robbery scene where everyone in the bank has a gun.Guide: F-word.

            "content": "Hell Or Highwater is an acrid, mournful little tumbleweed lullaby sung at the American southwest, a tale of hard times and desperate men infused with the laconic nature of the area and given the spare yet hard hitting writing skills of Taylor Sheridan, who also penned the equally bleak Sicario. I wasn't quite sure what time period he was going for here until Jeff Bridges's salty Texas Ranger brandishes a smartphone, signifying the present. I imagined an 80's throwback, but I suppose the vacuous dereliction hanging about the rural West has only gathered with time, in a place where time has curiously seemed to halt dead in a financial sinkhole where not much of anything in the way of hard earned success can flourish. Chris Pine and Ben Foster play brothers and partners in crime, in the thick of a statewide bank robbing spree which gets progressively more dangerous, all to save a piece of property from the big banks threatening to foreclose. They're not evil men, they're not even bad men because Sheridan's script doesn't allow such stark delineation. They are men forced to make decisions, just like any other, yet in times like these one's decisions are often of an extreme nature, out of self preservation or desire to protect one's family. Pine is the introverted one, and the actor disappears into the role with ease and scruffy calm that contrasts his usual golden boy charm. Foster is the live wire, a man who functions on mostly instinct alone, lives in the moment and reacts like an animal from situation to situation. Quite the actor he is, and hasn't been let completely off the chain since 2004's Hostage. Here he fills the screen with intensity and much needed humour. The two have love for each other that occasionally peeks through the cloud of trouble they're flying in, the film adamant in showing us their damaged humanity through the desperation of their actions. Bridges is crusty and jaded, the badge and gun serving as his only family other than the uneasy camaraderie he has with his younger partner (Gil Birmingham), a man he berates solely because he seems incapable of proper human interaction, no doubt a result of decades on the job, wandering through the desolation of the desert hunting men who have broken their lives and wishing he ever had one of his own to begin with. There's an emptiness to this tale, a lonely ambiance punctuated by many a beautiful song from both Nick Cave, T Bone Burnett and more, whose downbeat lyrics only pile on the mood thicker. The film wants to examine the need to go to extreme measures in times of strife, but holds us in our seat long after the deed is done to show us the ramifications, both negative and positive, of such actions. The result isn't pretty, but it's damn well beautiful and one of the best films I've seen so far this year.",

            "review_title": "A Morality Tale Not To Be Missed",
            "content": "The growing pantheon of films featuring bizarre depictions of the American Midwest just received an enthusiastic new member, for once not from the minds of the Coen Brothers. This modern take on the classic \"cops and robbers\" tale is directed by David Mackenzie in his return to the screen after a three-year hiatus. In fact, if this film accomplishes anything at all it should be to send the message loudly and clearly to any studios hoping to hire Mackenzie in the future: don't rush him. The film is centered around a string of bank robberies in Texas committed by Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his slightly psychotic brother (Ben Foster), all while being pursued by a dogged Sheriff hoping to stave off his retirement a little longer (Jeff Bridges) and his loyal partner (Gil Birmingham). This may seem to be a fairly straightforward story by this description, but the twists of morality and ideas of what the true crime is here make it anything but straightforward. The real anchors of the film, as they should be in any character study, are the incredible performances of the cast. Chris Pine has comparatively few lines to the other three major characters, yet he manages to convey Toby's pain and stolid commitment with great skill. Ben Foster's manic glee is a real show stealer in itself, consistently keeping the audience on edge as they try to gauge how close to going over the edge he is in any given scene. Veteran actor Jeff Bridges is predictably great, finding an excellent balance in his sheriff character wherein viewers are rarely sure exactly how capable he is, both physically and mentally, while never doubting his dry wit for a second. Gil Birmingham has the least meaty part to work with, but finds an enjoyable and surprisingly beloved chemistry between himself and Bridges. The actors make viewers care about both pairs on either side, making this the first film I would say that truly makes you dread when these two opposing forces inevitably meet. Many claim it, this one owns it. While the performances were undeniably great, it will ultimately be the vivid cinematography that sticks with viewers long after the credits roll. Opening with a 360-degree pan of a small town in the Midwest, we are immediately plunged into this world. The dilapidation is apparent as the camera shows graffiti-soaked walls, vandalism, and general disrepair swamping most of what we see until the bank comes back into the shot. Now we see the bank with new eyes; it is no longer just a bank that we suspect is about to be robbed, we now know it is for some reason the only clean, well-kept building in the surrounding area. This helps key viewers in on the central theme of the film before a word of dialogue is uttered or a single scene transition takes place. From a film lover's perspective, it is breathtaking. Moving beyond the opening, there is much more to appreciate here. The wide vistas and blue-yellow color palette of this part of the country is on full display here as Director David Mackenzie never shies away from long, establishing shots of the quiet surroundings. Masterful use of angles accentuates the themes of the film in subtle ways; as the brothers discuss their actions, a low-angle shot is used to give them a sense of power, yet all the while a windmill looms over them, continuously turning its spokes, and serves to underline the idea that the action of the film ultimately will not change anything. Sound is not without purpose here, either. Most of the film's sound stays within the diegesis, helping to establish a sense of place within the world. This leads to many quiet moments where the creaking of equipment or the rustling of grass is all that exists to your ear. In addition to rooting viewers, this lack of excessive dramatic flair helps to feed directly into one of the films main themes; that nothing we see here will affect anything. Naturally, if nothing we are witnessing will serve any pretense of changing the problems we see for the better, what would be the point of dressing it up with a sweeping, dramatic score? It would only be dishonest, and dishonesty is best left to the banks. At the end of the day, Hell or High Water offers a simple tale told complexly, presented beautifully, arranged painstakingly, and paid for happily. With a few Oscar-worthy performances from the principle actors, incredible visuals, and some heady themes of morality, this film easy ranks among 2016's top releases. Come Hell or High Water, make sure you check it out.",

            "content": "'Hell or High Water' is a modern day Weston, a heist 'buddy' movie with a political backdrop, think of 'The Big Short' with a western theme. I was compelled to watch this when I realised the writer of SICARIO also wrote this.A gritty drama about a divorced dad and his brother, who devise a plan to only rob 'West Midland Banks' in order to save their family's farm from repossession. The Texan area has been hit hard by recession, a failing farm industry, and oil drilling.The sense of depression is immediately illustrated in the opening scene by some graffiti sprayed on a wall that reads \"3 tours in Iraq - no bailout for me.\" Remember the banks were being bailed out worldwide. In every aspect the banks were the true villains. Just as a reminder, and every so often, the barren roadside billboards advertise debt management, refinancing and other related bank services.The bank raids are the scenes with most suspense and drama, you can really feel the tension when they get into situations that especially Chris Pine's character feels most uncomfortable with, the money is laundered through the nearby Casino.Even though there is a lot of violence, there is also comedy, an example is when the rangers go to a 'steakhouse diner' and are served by a waitress, who will only serve streak done only one way, this demonstrating how nothing ever changes and no-one really has a choice, not even what they eat or how its cooked or anything else. The food ordering process and the dialogue are really funny.Ben Foster's character is always on the edge of crazy, there is tense scene at a petrol station when two young guys pull up and try to pick a fight, Chris Pine's character steps in, beats one of them senseless as he knows his brother would surely kill him if he didn't step in. Chris Pine's character ultimately wants his estranged sons to escape (what he calls) the \"disease\" of poverty. Chris Pine's and Ben Foster's performances both shine, Ben gives the star performance and every bit as well as Jeff Bridges, who plays the world-weary officer on the point of compulsory retirement due to age. I feel Ben is the actor completely in his element (more of him in this kind of role please!).Chris pine is a versatile actor not only able to play Captain Kirk (for which he's never likely to win an award for), but there's a good chance of 'best supporting actor' for his performance in this.Highly recommended film.",

Riding perhaps on the faintest memory of No Country for Old Men, a film that makes the much vaunted so-called art of Hell or High Water look like a pile of chocolate bar wrappers strewn on the floor, this exercise in stretching a fleeting moment of acting into a two hour migraine is, under all the tonal work, daft and missable.",

This film was not in my anticipated list at all, I was not even remotely excited to watch this when the first trailer came out...then the reviews came in. With such high ratings, I had to see what all the fuss was about and I can honestly say the high ratings are justified. Hell or High Water is so close to perfection, so close! What brings this film to those heights you ask? The acting. All three main actors in the film are perfect and to be honest all deserve nominations for at least\u00a0one award in any ceremony. Jeff Bridges? A Legend. Chris Pine? Finally getting a chance to show his acting chops. Ben Foster? Whoa now, completely transformed himself (2016 has not been a bad year for him). What helped them was the script which had me transfixed from the first section of dialogue, it had everything from witty humour and banter between the characters\u00a0to emotional tension between the brilliant brotherly bond (dare you to say that ten times in a row!) of Foster and Pine. The direction from David Mackenzie was solid and the cinematography was sublime with some really creative shots when following vehicles. Excellent wide shots to let the audience take in the Texan environment. I won't spoil the film, but there is a scene in the movie that is what I call an \"Oh My God!\" moment (a scene so shocking, I\u00a0literally mouth those words out), did not see it coming whatsoever and I don't think anyone else did, brilliantly executed. The score was also appropriate, with country vibes that suit the Texas locale.\u00a0I say it\u00a0is close to perfection, the only flaw I found was that the script allows the characters to have too many conversations that do not further the plot. Whilst this is good for character development, too much of it and it starts to slow the pace down. Overall, Hell or High Water is a near perfect crime/drama with powerhouse performances (particularly Ben Foster) and a sublime script, even if the dialogue is bit excessive at times.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",

            "content": "David Mackenzie directs the perfectly execute Hell or High Water, a fantastically mastered picture written by Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) to explore the integrity of the southern Texas in a game of cops and robbers between three players. Chris Pine and Ben Foster star as the dirty handed brothers Toby and Tanner who are hell bent on raising up the funds to pay of the mortgage of their late mothers farm, and secure the future of Toby's sons. A wonderfully hand crafted crime drama that's thick in strong film making and beautifully smooth in capturing the breezing landscapes of Texas.While committing a series of bank heists, Toby (Pine) and Tanner (Foster), journey among the towns and fields of West Texas to be a pair of mischiefs among the local southerners. Though Toby only seeks to provide for his family, he must have the assistance of his thrill seeking brother who gets his kicks by having the time of his life when holding up people at banks to find high spirit and adventure in the brothers labour. Meanwhile, old timer Texas ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) tries to find one last long ride to escape his up coming retirement as he and his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) track down the duo.What becomes of this marvellous tale, unravels to be two brothers having a final adventure together and making the world their oyster, and two law enforcers making gentle banter with each other as they make their last chase together. Jeff Bridges' rusty ranger may have time on him but still knows the ropes and has no hesitation to have fun as well by splashing out frequent dry humour. We meet a deeply developed Chris Pine with Kirk in him at all and giving his very solidly executed performance. Opposite is the stand out performance by Ben Foster bringing a wild beast to the narrative delivering excellent chemistry with Pine.Opening with an exceptional 360 degree camera shot, what follows opens the horizon to a beautiful visual experience entering the sun setting county of Texas. A masterfully cinematography performance by Giles Nuttgens brings the story and characters into a whole new light.What sets the whole film is the wonderful, captivating original score by Nick Cave & Warren Ellis who bring brilliantly selected and crafted music to the perfect atmosphere of the film, and washing the audience in sheer western and southern sound holding all tones of each moment and enthralling the melon collie and easy amusing Texas spirit.Hell or High Water can only be described as a masterfully directed story with on the point performances, with a great score and camera work. The film does take you back to the Coen Brothers No Country for Old Men in its plain cold shell but just pure genius in filling but with the easy amusing quirks of Bridges and Foster. 9.0/10",

Their family is losing the farm though there's a good chance there's oil there. Their bank wants to foreclose on the family to get the oil and the brothers think they can get the money to forestall the transfer by robbing small banks. Jeff Bridges is the Texas Ranger looking for retirement who wants one last notch on his belt.For me this played like an acting contest between Bridges and Pine, with Jeff perhaps just squeaking ahead of Chris near the end. This is no small feat, Bridges is masterful and Pine is just beginning his career. But both are excellent here.

This movie is clearly meant to be a howl of anger on behalf of poor, working-class rural America, who look at banks as villains and want to blame elite America for its problems even while they accuse liberals of being too soft and allowing lazy people to collect welfare. There's a pride of a certain kind of Texan attitude that pervades this film, but it's damn near intolerable from my perspective as a city dweller who understands that the real world isn't a John Wayne western and who doesn't feel comfortable with the idea of a bunch of hothead macho men itching to shoot somebody with their precious guns. I didn't feel sorry for the people in this movie, despite the screenplay's heavy-handed attempts to shove their plight down my throat. The people who live in areas like this prove time and again that they are incapable of voting for leaders who could actually do something to help them, and instead actually vote against their best interests because they're too uninformed not to, and then whine that the world has forgotten them. If the film had cast even the slightest critical eye on this environment and asked some more probing questions -- like how responsible are these people for their own plights -- or if it had come out in a different political climate, one where I don't now have to watch my country be governed for four years by a woefully incapable president because a bunch of poor Americans still think abortion is the most important topic in the world, I might have been able to tolerate it. As it is, it made me profoundly irritated and revealed to myself how little compassion I feel like having at this moment in time for the people whose voices were so loudly heard during our latest election.Grade: C+",

It's about 2 good old boys, Chris & Ben, robbing banks and being chased by the Texas Rangers, Jeff & Gil. Of course the good old boys have a good reason for stealing the money; It's a recession and the Midland Banks are foreclosing on their home & land. Chris comes up with a plan to steal the money he needs for his mortgage from the bank that is trying to take his property and then use the money to pay off his debt-he does launder the money in a casino first. Ben has just gotten out of prison and is a little more energetic about robbing the banks than his little brother, Chris. Chris doesn't want to hurt anyone but Ben likes the excitement and doesn't care who gets hurt. Katy plays a waitress that lucks out when she happens to wait on the boys.

This is a seemingly simple story is told with such a brilliant skill that i was blown away for every single moment and minute of this small masterpiece.Script was simply perfect. It is so rich in details, every conversation is near damn perfect. Director David Mackenzie without a doubt gets here an Oscar nomination next year for best directing. Cinematography was breathtakingly beautiful as well, well everything. And i didn't even mention acting, which was stellar - by everyone and this is why i think Jeff Bridges is one of the best screen performers of our times. Overall, \"Hell or High Water\" is the fastest 100 min. I've had in a movies in many moons. It so damn perfect - this is a movie heaven.",

The realization is very aesthetic and also very effective, enjoying a very good scenario of Taylor Sheridan, this movie brings us in the \" Univers a kind of western, thriller, road-movie! But quite effective with a perfect distribution with actors who have carried their respective roles to the maximum of their art. First of all, Chris Pine who gives us one of his best performances, then Jeff Bridges and then turns into an anachronistic sheriff, and finally Ben Foster who impressed by his most successful performance, you mix everything: realization, screenplay, music, decor Natural and leading interpretation, and you will only make a very good movie, a success of its kind.

            "content": "The people that populate the world of Hell or High Water seem to stand at attention and out of time. They sit at the corner booth of their favorite diner sporting white gallon hats and speed through one horse towns on the way to the only profitable business; the local liquor store. It's a solemn austere existence; one reminiscent of Sam the Lion's in The Last Picture Show (1971). Yet there is no false hope to be had here. The ghosts of the past are long gone. The only thing left amid the boarded up downtowns and clearing fires is the possibility of bequeathal.That is the basic idea brothers Toby (Pine) and Tanner Howard (Foster) have when they first don their ski masks and head for the nearest Midland Bank. Their scheme is remarkable in its simplicity; steal only from the cashier drawers, $20's, $50's, loose change; whatever they collect, they launder through the nearby Comanche Reservation Casino. The ultimate goal is to save their family farm. Seems ever since oil has been discovered on their turf, the bank has been just itching to foreclose and with the death of their mother, the second mortgage has become unsurmountable.Much of the film was shot in and around the panhandle plains of west Texas. The camera's fixation on big sky and barren grazing land appeals to our inner-cowpoke. Yet Hell or High Water is closer in spirit to Hud (1963) or Lonely Are the Brave (1962) than the high stake and higher implausibilities of The Searchers (1956). The stark small town blight litters the plains like pools of runoff and while the people talk the Big Jake talk, they mostly come across like the townsfolk of Cold Turkey (1971).Even Toby seems inclined to cut and run at the first sign of trouble. Every tension building chance of capture brings with it the possibility that Toby may just loose his cool, just may catch himself in a lie, just may fold. Yet something keeps him there, shotgun loaded, robbing banks with his older brother. Call it a moral imperative, his family is on their last legs financially and he has two sons to support, but in a sense he's also keeping the spirit of Texas alive by acting like Billy the Kid.Yet every Billy the Kid must have a Pat Garrett and for that we have the ambulant and ever jaded Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Bridges). Set to retire wrapped around a leather Barcalounger, Hamilton jumps at a chance to hunt \"them two boys down,\" going so far as to stake out a bank they're fated to hit. Jeff Bridges brings all the gravitas an actor of his caliber does to this remarkably modest film. He brings unexpected mirth to Hamilton whose shrewd investigations and causal bigotry have a ring of west Texas authenticity and twangy cheer.If ever there was an actor best suited for this film however it's Ben Foster as the older, more criminal minded Tanner. He blissfully antagonizes everyone he meets, fancying himself a Comanche: lord of the plains and enemy to all. The only person he shows love for is his brother which proves his most enigmatic quality. Living his life in and out of prison can harden a man, even to the embrace of long suffering family. Yet when asked \"why did you agree to do this with me then?\" Tanner responds \"Because you asked me to little brother,\" without skipping a beat.Hell or High Water is a modest, under-the-radar crime drama told confidently and brilliantly by director David Mackenzie. It is at once a composite of Robin Hood crime drama and elegy westerns and an example of seamless top-to-bottom storytelling. While Hell or High Water comes from well-worn traditions, it is exceedingly rare to see a film of this caliber. Like the people who populate the film, it simply stands out of time.",

Hell, even a small time investor would have sunk the 40k into paying off the back taxes so long as you tripled his return (which could have been done in less than 3 months considering that the movie states that they're making 50k a month off of the oil) In the end, the plot of this film is just a very cheap excuse to promote very real and very serious issues that many people are facing in this country.

            "content": "It's about five minutes into this gritty crime drama\u2014which kicks off with a long unbroken tracking shot\u2014that you know you're in for something special. And the remainder of the film, all the way up until the bittersweet closing shot, doesn't disappoint. The story is set in a post-GFC West Texas and follows two bank-robbing brothers who have underlying motives to their unlawful actions (to tell would spoil the narrative's wonderful drip-feed style), whilst also tracking the soon-to-be-retired Ranger who's seeking to finish his career on a high. Taylor Sheridan's screenplay is remarkably simple yet effective, wisely resisting the temptation to resort to thriller-ish tropes despite ostensibly playing like one. He allows the multi-layered characters to do all the heavy lifting and is rewarded with a cast that absolutely nails it. As polar opposite siblings who share an unbreakable bond, Chris Pine and Ben Foster are magnetic; the former a level-headed brooder with the weight of the world on his shoulders, the latter an unpredictable live wire who would gladly kill for his younger brother. On the other side of the fence, Jeff Bridges brings his A-game as a sardonic law-enforcement veteran who is equal parts intelligent and stubborn, terrifically supported by an understated Gil Birmingham as his oft-tormented partner. Most impressively the film doesn't seem to pass judgment on any of the characters (or at least not until late in the piece), allowing them to exist without labelling them good or bad; they all have parts of themselves that fit into both categories. Director David Mackenzie also deserves a lot of praise, as he sublimely balances the need for a tight and tense plot whilst simultaneously allowing his characters ample room to breathe and grow. Mackenzie also gets the very best out of his cinematographer Giles Nuttgens who delivers bold, sharp and stylish camera movements in addition to a level of photography (i.e., lighting and framing) that is as good as you'll see this year. Narratively powerful, visually mesmerising and backed to Nick Cave's transcendent soundtrack, Hell or High Water is one of the finest motion pictures of 2016.",

Basically, the film is about a few brothers who are robbing banks in order to pay off a loan to the bank so they can save their childhood home or whatever. The action isn't anything crazy however whoever directed this amplified the action simply by adding just the right amounts of tension and grit. Anyway, this film could have been a classic for the ages if Chris Pine didn't stink up the screen with is lame acting stills. I mean Chris Pine is good in mindless action flicks or anything that does not require major acting chops but in a film like this, his handicap is more than noticeable.

One of the boys (Chris Pine) is notably less rambunctious than his older brother (Ben Foster), who has just left the slams after a six-year vacation there. Foster is thrilled with the banditry, whoops with delight as they zigzag away from the banks, leaving a cloud of dust. Pine loves his brother but believes him to be a little nuts. Pine has spent the last year or so caring at home for their dying mother. \"This the bed she was in?\" asks Foster, on seeing the empty bed for the first time. \"Well, Eff it. She didn't care much for me anyhow.\" (A pragmatist.) As the two reckless boys set about their task, usually planned, but one entirely spontaneous, we meet the other side of the law -- Jeff Bridges as a casual old Texas Ranger on the brink of retirement, and his Comanche deputy and sidekick, Gil Birmingham, whom Bridges is always teasing about his Indianness -- catching the robbers with voodoo, eating pemmican, and the like.In contrast to the robbers, Bridges kind of slouches around, takes his time to think things over, and exercises his fulgurating intuition to anticipate their next move.I don't want to get into the plot in any more detail. It's a good movie. It rings true. The location shooting in New Mexico is evocative. The characters -- even the most minor -- are colorful. The story itself is credible, with moments comedy alternating with those carrying the tension of a coiled spring. It certainly seems right as a picture of small-town Texas. It owes a lot, I suspect, to the wildly successful \"Fargo\" that preceded it by a few years but I don't care.

Chris Pine plays Toby who is divorced from his wife and estranged from his two sons. His recently deceased mother has left him a ranch on which oil has been discovered. Problem is that his mother was in debt to the local Texas Midland Bank and they are going to foreclose on the loans if they are not paid back very soon. So money is needed quickly or the oil rich land will be lost.Toby, and his career criminal brother Tanner (Ben Foster), embark on a series of early morning bank robberies of Texas Midland Bank branches in order to get the money to pay back the bank. Nice twist. Banks bleeding the people dry is an overarching theme of the film. All the robberies are small so don't interest the FBI. They do interest the soon to retire Texas Ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges) though, and he and his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) go on the trail of the robbers. Jeff Bridges plays his role in a nice gnarly way. And has a good rapport and banter with Gil Birmingham's character.The film has everything you would want from a western. Even a modern one. Dusty sunlit Texan vistas, bank robberies, a posse like band of locals going after the robbers, a shoot out, a good sibling story with a sacrifice, nostalgia for a time that has passed, and a moral message about generational poverty and the role of banks.

GRADE: A-  SYNOPSIS: In order to save the farm, two brother run afoul of the law  JIM'S REVIEW: The anti-hero, a staple of the 70's culture wars, is back  with a vengeance in David Mackenzie's modern-day crime drama, Hell or  High Water. Its tale, of two brothers who break the law in order to  survive poverty and foreclosure, reeks of the anger and frustration  facing the middle class families across America today.  Tanner (Chris Pine), son of the recently deceased Mrs. Howard, cooks up  an illegal scheme to fight the banks from taking the family's land.  (You see, there's Texas gold in them hills). Bringing aboard Toby (Ben  Foster) his hot-headed ex-con brother, the two siblings rob from the  rich (the banks) and give to the poor (themselves). As these outlaws  commit more and more robberies and start to acquire a real nest age to  help pay off their mortgage and living expenses, the odds of  diminishing returns becomes more and more evident. It's 60 / 39 %  against these modern day Bonnie and Clyde wannabes' success rate,  especially with a wise ole sage of a sheriff, Marcus (Jeff Bridges),  and a \"mixed breed\" partner, Alberto (Gil Birmingham), tracking down  this robbing band of brothers. (I excluded those powerful 1% fat cats  into the equation.) After all, the family that steals together deals  together...and deal they must with the consequences of breaking the  law. One knows, amid the gunfire and violence, that the cost of living  in the fast lane is past due.  English director David Mackenzie effectively captures the desperation  of America's poor with his stark images of a Texas wasteland. Large  billboards about mortgages and loans dot the dry rural landscapes,  nicely filmed by Giles Nuttgens. Mr. Mackenzie's film is a poetic mood  piece with intricate plotting and a narrative structure that keeps one  riveted to the characters and their actions. He also casts his film  with actors that are perfectly suited to their roles from the wonderful  lead actors already mentioned down to the smaller roles of waitresses  and tellers. (Katy Mixon, Margaret Bowman, and Dale Dickey are  standouts.)  Taylor Sheridan has created fully drawn characters and his dialog is  concise and insightful. Their conversations are totally natural and  bring a gritty realism to the story. Yes, the plot is predictable, the  set-up contrived, and the film is a tad too leisurely told from the  outset. But the haunting images and true-to-life characters are  heartfelt and linger long after the film ends thanks to a terrific  script, taut direction, and some of the best acting one will see all  year.  The quartet of lead actors are wonderful. Jeff Bridges is custom-fitted  for this role. His grizzly worn-out Texas Ranger is no stranger to this  actor's repertoire, but he wisely downplays the outlandish nature of  this country trooper and makes him human and believable. Both the  character and the actor blend so effortlessly. His consummate acting  prowess throughout the film is remarkable. Chris Pine, downplays his  good looks and shows a troubled loner, out-of- touch with life but  barely hanging on to his humanity. It is one of his best performances  in an impressive list of film roles that the actor continues to add to  his resume. Ben Foster excels as his deranged brother who loves the  dark side as much as he loves his sensitive brother. He makes his  character resonate with a flair for danger that attracts and repels  simultaneously. As Marcus' partner, Gil Birmingham brings a droll sense  of humor and fondness to his sidekick role.  The film builds to its tragic conclusion...what else could there be!  Hell or High Water is an excellent crime film that makes the ordinary  extraordinary. It is well worth a visit.",

            "content": "Hell or High Water is a modern Western in spirit and atmosphere, and crime/heist drama in execution. We follow two brothers as they rob various banks over Texas in order to pay the same bank back the debt their deceased mother owed. Meanwhile a couple of Texas rangers follow their trail and attempt to second-guess their next move. The story is not your usual cops-and- robbers affair, instead it prefers to spread attention amongst all the major parties. Almost the entire second act is taken up with developing these characters and getting them in position for the finale. While this lull in the middle can drag the movie's pacing down a little bit, it goes a long way in painting each individual with their own charming quirks and personality.Toby and Tanner are ultimately rednecks who grew up in difficult childhoods, with a father who abused them and a mother who let it happen. Tanner spent a number of years in prison after standing up to his abusive father, while Toby juggled an ex-wife and two teenage boys with his dying mother. He takes it upon himself to save his family ranch and keep it out of the grasp of the banks who seek it for their own gain. Meanwhile Marcus is an aged Ranger nearing his retirement and taking the opportunity of his last job to make the most of it. Alberto is his ethnic partner just seeking to provide for his family at home. Marcus' somewhat racist slurs towards Alberto creates a dynamic of banter between them, rather than painting Marcus as a genuine racist (which he, quite obviously, is not).The message of the story is one of wealth. Toby and Tanner are hit hard by the difficult financial times of the country, and their little crop of land is one of the ones hit the hardest. Their crusade of robbing banks has little to do with the money itself, but is more a middle finger to those who they see as screwing them over. It's not just them though, the entire region is hit with it, with some people, like a waitress they over-tip, protecting them out of their own need to provide for themselves and their families financially. On the flipside there are those that take the bank robberies personally, regarding them as being thievery of their own pittances of wealth.Hell or High Water paints the region of West Texas in the same amount of detail and respect as it paints the characters who inhabit it. This isn't just a place of sand and cowboys, but of real people struggling to get by, complete with cowboy hats aplenty, almost everyone carrying a gun of some kind, and the main source of consumption is a steak and a beer (there's a great scene in a small cafe that only serves T-Bone steaks and the Ranger's confusion at the abrasive old waitress).The acting is top-notch across the board, bringing a huge amount of depth to these characters. Jeff Bridges could certainly be in contention for another Oscar nomination as Marcus, who fears retirement just as much as he does not closing the case. He wants to drag it out as long as he can to avoid the inevitable. His comedy timing and delivery is also great, giving Marcus' slurs towards Alberto a humorous edge rather than an offensive one, straddling that thin line between charming and outright racist. I've been a massive fan of Ben Foster since Hostage and I'm still waiting for him to get the recognition he deserves. Could this be it for him? It's certainly possible in my opinion, providing Bridges' equal in performance quality. His Tanner is, again, a character who could've easily turned completely unlikeable, but Foster turns on the charm, delivers his one-liners to perfection and actually makes him quite a likable loose cannon. Chris Pine's good looks almost betray him, but he still manages to slip into the redneck role and be entirely convincing. He doesn't quite get as much to chew into, but his level-headed brooding certainly adds the emotional backbone of the film's plot. He's ultimately a soft-hearted guy, but he's not afraid to stand up for those he loves.I feel the music deserves a mention as well. The licensed music isn't my taste at all (Country music is just about the worst genre out there), but even I can't deny it's perfect for the tone and setting of this movie. What would a movie set in Texas be without a smattering of Country music? When it comes to the original music though, it's all wins. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis team up again and provide their quintessentially Western audio to a movie that deserves it. They don't particularly break new ground with mood or instrumentation, but the sharp shrieking violin is the perfect mood setter that fits right alongside the licensed Country music.Hell or High Water is a triumph of filmmaking. It's not a perfect home-run due to some pacing issues, but it shows an incredible amount of depth in a story that could've otherwise been a shallow bank robbery Western to shove on the pile. It's story of wealth is one that will hit home with many, and it's augmented with some fantastic characters and performances that bring them to life. I give Hell or High Water a brilliant high 8/10, and would definitely recommend it.",

            "content": "Set in Texas, \"Hell or High Water\" is a crime drama about two brothers who resort to robbing banks in an attempt to save their family's ranch from foreclosure. It works very well as a straightforward crime story, but there's much more to it than that. There's also lots of sociopolitical subtext here about the current economic conditions of working class people in the US, as well as the financial system that's exploiting them.And the performances here are top notch: Ben Foster, Chris Pine, and Jeff Bridges completely nail their performances in this one. But the same could be said of everyone who appears in this film.Anyway, thumbs up from me. A number of critics have called this film \"one of the best of the year.\" I tend to agree with that. It will probably make my personal \"top ten\" list for 2016. It's a really solid crime-drama with plenty of things in it to recommend.",

            "content": "The question of whether the ends justify the means boils down to this: if a goal is morally important enough, is any method of achieving it acceptable? Socrates said, \"It is never right to do wrong, and never right to take revenge; nor is it right to give evil, or in the case of one who has suffered some injury, to attempt to get even.\" The question dominates Scottish director David Mackenzie's (\"Starred Up\") Hell or High Water, a modern genre Western set in West Texas in which two brothers, the unemployed Toby (Chris Pine) and the ex-con Tanner Howard (Ben Foster), rob various branches of the Texas Midlands Bank in order to to meet overdue alimony payments to Toby's divorced wife Debbie (Marin Ireland). They also want to prevent foreclosure of their deceased mother's ranch by the same chain of banks. Toby also recognizes that the oil discovered on the property influenced the bank to sell their mother a mortgage she could not repay. He calculates that if he pays off the mortgage he can then put the property in the names of his two sons, Justin (John-Paul Howard) and Randy (Christopher W. Garcia), and guarantee them a better life than he and his brother have had. The film lets us know repeatedly that the banks are the villains.Sheriff Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges), a burly, good-natured but cynical officer who is near retirement has been assigned to the case. He tells his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) when he spots the Bank Manager, \"That looks like a man who could foreclose on a house.\" After Alberto, who is part Mexican and part Native-American, tells Hamilton how the American Indians were robbed of their property, he says \"Now, it's the banks who are doing the robbing.\" Toby later explains that he robbed banks because he's been poor his whole life. \"It's like a disease passed on from one generation to the next,\" he says, then adds, \"But not my boys.\"The film is location-specific and we don't have to ask where we are. Giles Nuttgen's cinematography assures us we are in the Southwest (the film was shot in New Mexico) with dusty landscapes, oil rigs, a burning sun, billboards wanting to know if you are \"In-Debt?\", and decaying towns filled with abandoned homes. Writer Taylor Sheridan, who wrote the screenplay for Sicario, offers clich\u00e9d portraits of rough-hewn good ol' boy types who look like they would just as soon shoot you as say hello, a cantankerous waitress in the T-Bone Diner played by eight-eight-year-old Margaret Bowman who knows what you want to order even before you open your mouth, and a sheriff who playfully teases his partner with racial jokes, some funny, most not.The two brother bank robbers are very different. Tanner is a trigger-happy sociopath who has just been released from serving ten years in prison, while his brother, though looking as raunchy as his brother, is shown as being meek, thoughtful, and careful. Neither are very proficient bank robbers. One time they arrived at the bank not knowing it has been closed up, another time they get there before the manager even arrives with his keys to open the banks.After bigger banks are hit and Tanner kills two people, the inevitable chase scene takes place that leads to the desert, then to the mountains where some issues are resolved and others are not. Hell or High Water is a highly entertaining if not quite fully satisfying film that respects its characters enough to make them fully dimensional. It also has a rare social conscience. As far as whether or not the ends justify the means - you choose.",

Mainly because of the development of the characters, the interactions that is sometimes serious, dramatic, awkward and humorous. The cinematography and character elements sort of reminded me of a Coen brothers film. Nowhere near at complex or having multiple scenarios and many viewpoints in the story colliding with one another. The acting is very good, Jeff Bridges fit right into this role but the actor that really impressed me was Ben Foster. As the loose canon brother between the two bank robbers. Ben Foster didn't really impress me as an actor all that much. The last movie he really stood out to me was in the film \"3:10 to Yuma\". Overall, despite the slow development and a simple plot it's a film that is well worth the watch. Mainly because of the unraveling of the story, the dry and yet enthralling style of it all.7.5/10",

Some saying that this is the greatest film of 2016 and one of the best for modern westerns. I heard some say it was an alright film, nothing great nothing terrible. I also heard some say that is was horrible, boring, pointless, dumb, etc. You name it, someone said it. Now, with a Best Picture nomination, 'Hell or High Water' had to do something right to get that credential. Well, Oberrated is here to breakdown all of your confusion. Just kidding, but I am breaking this down my way... 'Hell or High Water' was great. As far as performance, story-telling, and fantastic memorable moments, it was a well-done and great film. I can not say one person had a bad performance here, not Ben Foster, Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, Gil Birmingham, not one. Even down to Margaret Bowman who played the T-Bone waitress! This was a performance heavy film that transcended a dumb story-line when written on paper into an Oscar contender. (and I only say this because when I typed that summary section I realized, this is a dumb as hell story when typed out, just IMO.)... Now I can not sit here and say it is an all-time great and side with some friends who have said this was a 2016 best, maybe a top ten but not best. But I also can not say that this was a worst, and to those who have said it was a worst and was boring, they probably are the casuals who want a shoot'em'up film. But hey, everyone has their tastes, some just are simpler than others.So that is it. 'Hell or High Water' has tremendous re-watch value. It has incredibly memorable moments that I loved and simply fantastic performances that made this film what it is. Now, I can not say this has a chance at Best Picture, but that does not count it out as a great film. Highly recommended!-- Oberrated.com --",

            "content": "Anticipation for this film didn't build until the end of 2016 when I desperately thought \"please, I need more good movies from 2016.\" Out of a plea, I saw this film hoping it could give me another good movie of the year. Fortunately, it definitely did give me a more memorable and skillfully crafted film experience that I was hoping for. First of all, the performances by the three main actors should be recognized right off the bat. Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and Ben Foster give compelling performances that feel rich with character and are a joy to watch from start to finish. Overall, the performances were great with the exception of some smaller roles that aren't too crucial to the film and are easily forgivable. The script itself feels tight and flows quite beautifully. My only concern was the beginning when I was wondering about the two brothers themselves. Since we don't experience sufficient back story or previous character development, it might be hard to jump on board with these criminals in the beginning. In that regard, maybe the screenplay itself could've been restructured in a way that I could care more about what happens to these two brothers. Thankfully as the rest of the film plays out, we begin to care and connect to these characters more and character development becomes less of a problem.Technically, this film is shot and edited pretty seamlessly. Gorgeous cinematography add to the \"western\" feel to it with very capable directing. Although music/score fit the setting, I feel like more somber music at times could've brought more emotional weight to where we need it the most. Regardless, the film is crafted very carefully and precise. It was a joy to watch this beautifully constructed film play out and see the care the creators took into making it.Another small issue I had was that of the pacing. Perhaps I didn't have the right mindset walking into this film but the pacing is much slower than you might think. It takes about half the films run time for things to really pick up in a way that makes you grip your seat like you want to. I can see why they chose to do that and honestly, the way these performances are, you probably won't get bored anyway. Overall, Hell or High Water was surprisingly very very good. My main issues with the film are really on the small side and although the ending was very satisfying, the movie as a whole left me slightly underwhelmed. That being said, it's hard to not recommend this movie to anyone because of its strengths.",

            "content": "Modern urban crime westerns tend to be ponderous slow burners and must have Tommy Lee Jones in the cast.British director David Mackenzie brings an outsider's perspective to Hell or High Water and keeps the pace moving even adding some humour. Mr Tommy Lee Jones is replaced with Mr Jeff Bridges.Two brothers, Toby (Chris Pine) who is more thoughtful and sensible and Tanner (Ben Foster) who is more reckless as well as being an ex-con. Both rob remote branches of the Texas Midland bank. They take loose bills from the cash registers, not all the robberies go smoothly but the boys have an ultimate motive.They are robbing the bank that plans to foreclose on Toby's ranch which may contain oil. The boys are basically taking the bank's money, laundering it and repaying back the same bank.Bridges plays veteran US Marshall Marcus Hamilton on the verge of retirement who takes more of an interest in the robberies than the rest of the police as these are not big money crimes and no one has got seriously hurt so far.With his half Indian partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) they develop a theory of what they might be going next as well having some admiration for the robbers.In a of these types of movies, the robbers keep robbing until they fall out and the police get on to them. If there is an endgame to their scheme it is an inept one. The characters here at least have put some thought here although flawed and Tanner is always going to be a liability.We still know we are going to get an almighty shootout at the end andwe also get a more surprising and personal showdown between the Marshall and Toby. It does not work for me which lets the film down as a character's wounds would leave him open to a smart lawman.Yet in the main this is an intelligent, thoughtful and well acted film, it has his moments of slow burn but it is pacy enough. You have some humour such as the waitress who got a big tip refusing to part with the money as the tip was proceeds from a bank robbery or Alberto wistfully telling the Marshall that once the white man took the land from the natives and now they are losing the same land to the banks.",

            "content": "Hell or High Water is a classic example of a movie that was made to please the masses. It's well done, well-acted, with performers who are perhaps superior to the unchallenging material they're doing.It's the standard thing about a pair of good ol' boy bank robbers, brothers, the older one (Ben Foster, who specialises in crazy) a jailbird who's either heading back there or heading to his grave, and the younger one, (Chris Pine, the story's hero) someone who we are supposed to believe was pushed into a life of crime due to unfortunate circumstance. He's the \"hero\", though I wondered more than once about the people whose money he and his crazy brother were stealing, and how they'd feel about such a person.The movie's other main character is just as familiar as the good younger brother, crazy older one dynamic. It's the ageing lawman, someone who is unrealistically forgiving of the crimes he is attempting to stop, just as the filmmakers expect you to be, and is played by Jeff Bridges as if his mouth is filled with cotton. The unspoken \"enemy\" in this story is the banks; the robbers and lawmen both seem to think they deserve it. They're not really on opposite sides of the law, here. It is assumed that the money the brothers are taking belongs to the rich, unfeeling and exploitative banks themselves. But is that really the case? What about all the hardworking people who have accounts there? The brothers are perhaps more likely to be stealing their life savings.This movie glorifies bank robbing, turning the robbers into heroes, but not convincingly. There is also the matter of the Bridges character and his casual racism toward his mestizo partner. Was that really necessary?",

Reunited, they put a plan into action that has a high risk/reward profile.

It's a stark environment for a deadly game of hide and seek.So much of the film is about fate. The paths of the two pairs are fated to intersect just as the older brother is fated to always return to crime. In their conversations, a heavy fatalism hangs over them like the layers of dust that coat every surface.Seeing Chris Pine out of a Starfleet uniform may be eye-opening for some viewers. Sadness and grittiness are ever present in his characterization of a young man who resented always having to be responsible because his older brother failed to assume the mantle.Jeff Bridges turns in one of his finest performances. It's a meaty role with layers of depth, perfectly portrayed.The story is nearly universal. Toby, the younger brother, could be an absentee father in Detroit, where his kids rarely see him, struggling to make ends meet in an economy that is faltering and an older brother who turned to crime. It is not clear who the film blames for the victimization of the struggling local economy, but we know who the characters blame.

While tentpole films are fun to see because they are events, films like Hell or High Water harken back to when filmmakers were more concerned with telling interesting stories, instead of making easy money. Hell or High Water is engrossing, tells its story with depth and smarts, and features really well-rounded characters. This film is truly a great film in almost all aspects, and will likely get a ton of recognition during Oscar season.From the opening scene of this film, the film is gripping, using both intrigue and acting to its advantage. Much like many other great films, this film begins with a bang and holds the audience's attention throughout. Chris Pine has proved that he's a talented actor over the years, but this film is a major step up for him, that being said the show stealers are Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges. Foster has had amazing performances in the past, but this stands as one of his best, and Bridges plays a role that fits him like a glove, and he does it perfectly.The actors are notably great, but the film is gripping because the story it tells is interesting. The story doesn't feel like a rip off of other films, and even more impressively tells it's story with depth and smarts. Nothing in this film feels like it's unrealistic or bombastic, every action in the film is well thought out and makes sense, that being said the film has a decent level of emotional depth. The impressive thing about Hell or High Water is that it's not overly sentimental, but it's the kind of film that still evokes an emotional response.Perhaps the biggest reason that the story is interesting, and emotionally gripping is because the characters are so well developed. From the onset all characters come from relatable places, and have plenty of layers. Above that the characters are funny and at some point they simply begin to feel like real people just being captured on film. That being said every character's conflict hits even harder, because the characters feel so relatable.Finding something wrong with this film is extremely hard, and in a day and age with so many films coming out in conjunction that's rare. Hell or High Water is well acted, gripping, funny, features great characters, shows an impressive amount of emotional depth, and never needlessly substitutes action for smarts. It seems safe to say that this film will get a lot of attention during Oscar season, especially for it's screenplay. If you're a fan of westerns, heist films, thrillers, or just in general like great films this film is a good choice.",

            "review_title": "Unmitigated excellence",
            "content": "The mood is set very quickly, and it feels very different from the average crime drama. While lead character Tanner demonstrates a decidedly boisterous attitude, and moments of violence dot the runtime, otherwise the film is awash in depression, desperation, desolation, destitution, and dog-tired dejection. Between atmosphere, content, and setting, this unquestionably fits in the western genre after a fashion, yet 'Hell or high water' is most definitely a feature all its own.Morose Texas rangers Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) are hardly die-hard go-getters. The sheer exhaustion they exude is punctuated and emphasized by the sardonic, racist barbs they playfully toss at one another. Brother bank robbers Tanner (Ben Foster) and Toby (Chris Pine) butt heads even as they work together, and despite Tanner's more hard- and hot-headed attitude, I've never seen Foster or Pine in roles this subdued and dispirited. Every chord in the dour score composed by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, every character written into Taylor Sheridan's screenplay, every performance from the large supporting cast, and every shot captured in director David Mackenzie's eye echoes the same dire atmosphere. And every passing moment is absolutely brilliant and captivating.Within the first 10-20 minutes we're left to wonder how the narrative could possibly be drawn out over 100 minutes. The answer to that rhetorical question is that the filmmakers spread out the ambience of overwhelming existential despair to fill every corner of the feature. Pervasive themes of loss, capitalist greed, pillaging of resources, and more spill across every square meter of the gorgeous yet bleak open sky landscapes we see throughout the picture.Yet for as undeniably grim as it all may be, 'Hell or high water' is executed with unyielding dexterity and skill from every single person involved. That includes characters and actors in even the smallest of roles, appearing in only one or two scenes: Amber Midthunder as a a hapless bank teller; Melanie Papalia as a sex worker; Heidi Sulzman as another Texas Ranger; Marin Ireland as Toby's ex-wife Debbie. That includes every element of the production: hair, makeup, stunts, effects, wardrobe, location scouting, set design and decoration, cinematography.I somehow totally missed out on this when it was first released in theaters, and that was a mistake I'm ecstatic to have corrected. I entered with no particular expectations, and have been blown away in every regard. This is a truly phenomenal film, and it deserves to be seen by the widest of audiences.Well done. So very, very well done. Highest possible recommendation!",

            "content": "This is the type of movies I want to see Ben Foster in. Not in Warcraft with that golden wig and casting spells. Felt really good to see Ben Foster in this movie. Many might give this one a miss because of the mellow trailers but it's a good movie. No doubt about that.STORY & SCRIPT - The story revolves around two brothers who are planning to pay their debts by robbing banks and two ageing officers who apparently are the only ones following this case. Jeff Bridges' character, Marcus Hamilton wants a last swan song to end his career with, due to which he is hell-bent on catching these mystery robbers who are going from one bank to another. Toby and Tanner are polar opposites of each other. When one is hot-headed, the other is smart and cool but both of them are sincere about their family. The story has a very slow pace and after the consecutive robberies the movie almost comes to a halt. It allows the dust to settle before the final showdown. The ending in particular was beautiful. It had me engaged about what was going to happen and when the credits rolled I was left thinking what will the final confrontation between Toby and Marcus will be like and that's what a movie should do.DIRECTION - It was bold of the director to maintain such a slow pace to such a simple movie. We could see the ending right after the halfway mark but do you know what kept me interested? The characters. The interactions. Most of the times in movies when I see two characters interacting, I feel like people don't like like that. At that moment the movie just looses me. In this movie, the interactions felt natural. There were silent moments which left room for character building. The racial undertones in the characters didn't stick out. It felt rather natural because unlike Tanner, Marcus was racist just to tease his partner. That scene when Marcus finally gets his revenge got to me. Not kidding. Every character felt well-rounded from start to finish. Right from the waitress(both of them) to the main characters. I liked the final reveal of Marcus' body and you hear a rattling noise and you see that death was right at his feet. Just the bearer of it changed.CINEMATOGRAPHY - Let me get rid of two minor gripes. One was the sky at the beginning of the movie. It felt very artificial. Second was the fire. The CGI was really off. Probably due to budget constraints. Other than that the landscape shots and action scenes were very well shot. The bleak tone of the scenario was very aptly captured. As the movie was not rushed you have the time to actually take in the scenery, making the scenery a character of the movie. ACTING - Ben Foster was the highlight of the movie and I am happy that he was. Blunt, brute and stubborn but with a heart of gold. He felt like he had dug his hands deep into this character and he delivered perfectly. Chris Pine also showcased the finer side of his acting prowess after starring in cheesy roles and of course as Captain Kirk. Jeff Bridges, was also in his comfort zone and boy was this a step-up from R.I.P.D.FINAL VERDICT - A very mellow and probably underrated too but a must watch for people who love a slow paced movie. Due to the movies grounded tone, I felt fresh because lately I have been seeing all these cheesy movies with weak scripts botched by production houses. Very few times a movie with such a cast delivers and I can say this that this movie delivers and delivers well",

            "content": "No one should ever ask for a sequel or, hell, remake, to the Coen Brothers classic modern Western with Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, but this might satisfy those who dared to.I've wanted to see Hell or High Water for some time now. On the day after a heated, year and a half election season ended, it might not have been the best day to see it since it was sooo\u0085depressing.The movie revolves around two brothers acting as some messed up Robin Hoodlums who rob banks to help secure the \"lessor evil\" brother's family's future. Meanwhile, a grumpy old ranger is dragging his punching bag partner through the investigation and might be smarter than his Columbo tactics indicate.Unfortunately for the film, they really hammered over our heads about how bad the Texas towns the characters were travelling through are doing. In fact, in a movie about bank robberies, there are more signs of the recession than banks. We get it already. Luckily, there's much more here to absorb than concentrate on all the obvious, and in most cases, literal, signs.For the second half of my life, I've developed a deep appreciate for Jeff Bridges. Here, he is good, sometimes pretty good, but out of left field, Chris Pine showed some real acting chops. I wish I could say the same for his brother, played by Ben Foster. Ben wasn't bad at all, but he's playing the same role/acting he's always done. The real star here was Pine.As mentioned above, it's fairly close to the classic and modern \"Western,\" No Country for Old Men, but never hits it completely. With one emotional scene \u2013 and when you get there, the stakes are high and you get a jolt, but just not as many as I would've liked to in comparison to the other film.Overall, totally worth it, but take heed: it's truly a depressing movie. Wonderfully shot and acted with a script that's pretty real, but it's still a downer. Be prepared for that.***Final thoughts: Normally, I do all I can to avoid trailers, even going as far as to look away and pretend not to listen when they're shown before movie theatre feature presentations. But, I saw this one from beginning to end several times over a month or so of watching many movies. Initially, I thought I saw it all, knew it all and had the movie I actually did want to see pegged, but mercifully, they only showed a snapshot of all that happened in the movie. Just a taste. Which is what trailers are SUPPOSED to do. Most ruin many critical scenes and plot points and that's why I stay away. For Hell or High Water, you can rest assured: the trailer-maker(s) respected this film.",

            "review_title": "Poetic justice, DIY style",
            "content": "What poetic justice can be more perfect than making the villain pay (literally) the damage it has caused its victims? I'll come back to this. HOHW has been described in different ways by different critics, juxtaposing terms like western, thriller, chase movie, crime story, drama. What I would like to call it is the collision course of two wildly different odd couples, ironically, in a maddeningly languid pace. I should add an additional spoiler warning here although there is really not much of twists to speak of. The point is that quite a few critics use the term \"slow-burn\" in unqualified praise of this movie. Some of the reasons and cause-effects take their good time in being revealed. While there is no intention on the movie makers' part to create a suspense mystery, the audiences may sometimes get that flavour, and enjoy it. In that sense, the next paragraph in which I attempt a capsuled plot outline will in a sense constitute a SPOILER. The main villain is a creature all of us are too familiar with: a bank (the Texas Midlands, in this specific case). Without going into any details, let me just say that the bank managers to get an imminent foreclosure on the property of an old woman who just died. Her two sons' unorthodox way of fighting back is to rob its branches to make the repayment to save the property in order that the oil reserve just discovered will ensure that the next generation will not be victims of poverty that they struggle with all their lives.The two brothers, one of the two aforementioned \"odd couples\" are Tanner (Ben Foster) and Toby (Chris Pine). While temperamentally explosive Tanner who has been having a violent and criminal life is an infinitely more experienced bank robber, it is mild-manners (for a bank robber) Toby that is the brain, masterminding the scheme of laundering the loot at casinos. It is also Toby who has even a resemblance of a family, with estranged wife and off spring living on the aforementioned property. Toby is still very close to his teenage son Justine, as well as maintaining a civil relationship with estranged wife. Oh yes, the brothers Tanner and Toby love each other deeply.The other \"odd couple\" is pre-retirement Texas ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and his partner Mexican-Comanche Alberto (Gil Birmingham). Just the name of the actor is sufficient to conjure up the persona of Marcus. Alberto is an absolutely reliable and level-headed partner. Comradeship and friendship between the two are very evident, Marcus's customary tongue-in-cheek racist remarks toward his partner notwithstanding.Women do not play any significant part in this movie but make a mark. Two short scenes, both with waitresses, are particularly unforgettable. Katy Mixon is a kind-hearted, soul-soothing waitress Jenny that strikes up a brief conversation in the restaurant with Toby who is unaware that Tanner is pulling a single-handed job at a bank across the street. When she is called away, he leaves after placing a $200 tip on the table. When the cops subsequently investigate the robbery, Jenny in her honest nature tells Marcus about the tip but refuses to show him the bills as \"evidence\", claiming \"the tip was left BEFORE the robbery\". Marcus, without losing a beat, retorts \"before THIS robbery\". Still Jenny wins. A much shorter appearance by Margaret Bowman as the world-wearied waitress at \"T-Bone Restaurant\" is the true scene stealer, with two veteran, hard-as-nail cops cowering before her. Later, in a conversation between Marcus and Alberto, the latter refers to her as \"rattlesnake\".Performances are from good to riveting. Pine has opened up a new dimension, moving from main-stream blockbuster hero to somewhat artsy character actor. Foster reprises again his overpowering stage presence going back ten years to \"3:10 to Yuma\". With double nomination (Oscar, Golden Globe) for best supporting role, Bridges effortlessly delivers what you expect of him. I am not sure if I should categorize Birmingham as \"support to a support\", but anyway, he is good! The final scene, a climatic confrontation between Pine and Bridges where not a single shot is fired and not even a voice is raised, is a gem.",

I liked the plump waitress a lot (!). Everyone acted well. Nice locales. Awesome soundtrack. Taylor Sheridan is a writer to watch out for. Even though Sicario was just OK.I was not a big Ben Foster fan before this film came out. But he did a good job here. Chris Pine who played the subdued and confused brother was a perfect foil for the rough and impulsive Ben Foster. This is one of the best American films I've seen in a while. I am not saying this is as good as the American films of the 40s, 50s and 70s. But this is as good as it gets for 21st century American cinema.Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham deserve special mention for their chemistry and their back and forth digs at each other.

            "content": "I saw the trailer for this film only two days before it was released, the three leading actors in it certainly appealed to me, but it did also look like a good thrilling film, directed by David Mackenzie (Young Adam). Basically in West Texas, divorced father Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and his ex-con brother Tanner (Contraband's Ben Foster) rob two banks early in the morning, they have a plan to commit several small-scale bank robberies over the course of a few days. Their robberies are well-planned, but Tanner's wild nature and unnecessary risk taking is frustrating Toby, it is revealed their mother died recently, due to a reverse mortgage their ranch has been left in debt, if not paid in a few days there will be a foreclosure on the property. Toby is determined to pay the mortgage off, and oil has recently been discovered on the land, he plans to sell the oil rights to pay for his estranged sons to have a comfortable life, it is also revealed Tanner went to prison for killing their abusive father. Two Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Twilight's Gil Birmingham), are assigned to catch the robbers, Hamilton is close to retirement, but determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile Tanner robs a bank while Toby is unaware and waiting at a nearby diner, they escape and take the stolen money to be laundered at an Oklahoma Indian casino, the money is exchanged for chips, and Tanner gets more playing poker, they are converted to checks that make the funds untraceable and the gambling covers up how they acquired the money. The Rangers set up surveillance outside a small town bank they believe will be hit next, the brothers do not show up, but Hamilton deduces their pattern and determines their final target, the robbery does indeed occur, Tanner continues with it despite customers holding weapons, a shoot-out ensues, a guard and an armed customer are killed, but the brothers escape. Several of the armed townspeople pursue Tanner and Toby as they race out of town, gaining some distance Tanner stops and fires an automatic weapon rifle at the \"posse\", they turn back, the brothers then split with two cars, Toby takes the money, while Tanner turns back to confront the Texas Rangers and local law enforcement. To give his brother more time to escape, Tanner draws the lawmen off the trail to a desert mountain ridge, firing at them with a sniper rifle, he kills Parker, Hamilton is furious and calls for a SWAT team, then uses a local resident to help him find a way behind Tanner, Hamilton borrows the local's rifle and takes out Tanner with a single long- range shot. Toby manages to pass through a law-enforcement checkpoint without suspicion, he makes it to the casino and is able to launder the rest of the stolen cash, he sees the news about his brother's death, but he is able to make it to the bank and deliver the checks in time to prevent the ranch's foreclosure. Some time later, Hamilton has retired, he learns that the Rangers and banks have cleared Toby as a suspect, as he has no record and the oil wells earn him more in a month than robberies, Hamilton confronts Toby at the ranch, he makes it clear he knows the brothers were responsible for the robberies. He does not explicitly admit his culpability, but Toby explains his motivations for wanting his sons to have a better life, both men have weapons, but the tension is broken when Toby's former wife and sons arrive, Hamilton realises Toby gave his family the farm and all its profits, Hamilton departs, but Toby suggests they may meet again, implying they will try and kill each other when the time comes. Also starring Katy Mixon as Jenny Ann, Winter's Bone's Dale Dickey as Elsie, Kevin Rankin as Billy Rayburn and William Sterchi as Mr. Clauson. Foster is great as the more rebellious and aggressive brother, Pine is good great as the more calm but equally determined brother, and Bridges is terrific as the Texas Ranger near retirement but prepared to catch the crooks. It is a good simple story, a pair of desperate redneck brothers being careful to cover their tracks, and the law enforcement officers on their trail, the robbery sequences are exciting, the chase and shoot-up sequences are thrilling, and the script is snappy, overall it is a most worthwhile heist crime film.

            "review_title": "Finally, a modern western with true grit.",
            "content": "Having been plagued by modern over the top and predictable westerns; folks like me can't quite figure why it has taken so long to be served up a quality western that's sure to please any audience.Okay, so you have the old-timer Texas Ranger and his Comanche/Mexican partner, but this isn't the Lone Ranger. The bordering on retirement Ranger and his younger partner even sounds cliche, and might have been if it weren't for the depth of the character, which Jeff Bridges used to turn a caricature into a man of depth and one you care for.While Texas Ranger, Marcus Hamilton, (Bridges) brings an incredible and respectable level of gravitas to his role as a wisened old school Western Texan lawman bordering on retirement. It's his accurate portrayal of how older lawmen and cowboys communicate their feelings of kinship that I found impressive. Hamilton's relationship with his young partner, Texas Ranger Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), is one that demonstrates how rugged and rough Western Texans camouflage their respect and kinship in a most peculiar way. Hamilton's jabs related to his younger partner's, 'Injun' background is only tolerated, because the duo are like two sides of one coin, they both know they need and care for one another (but to admit the same would be considered a threat to their reputation as masculine frontiersmen. Even today, in the rugged and largely rural West Texas, where one's ability to survive is based on endless hours of work and social isolation from the rest of the world - it's clear that concept of political correctness is a foreign and relatively unknown concept. There still exists an understood and unwritten frontier code among cowboys and lawmen, especially in western Texas, that hasn't much changed since the beginning of the 19th century. The few who violate this code are fortunate if they can walk away while suffering the not soon to be forgotten damage to their reputation. Saying the wrong thing, looking at the wrong lady, or staring down a man who worked for 16-hours and drank for four more - can lead to egregious bodily harm - or worse.Despite what my review might lead some to believe, the Texas Rangers aren't the primary characters featured in the story that is Hell or High Water. That honor goes to the Howard Brothers. Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) is the older, reckless unrestrained brother turned bank robber; whereas Toby (Chris Pine) is the younger, more intelligent, thoughtful bank robber.Writer Taylor Sheridan handed Chris Pine an incredible character in the well fleshed out role of the Western genre's anti-hero, Toby Howard. He's a bank robber with a conscious. He sees a targeted string of bank robberies as a pragmatic, even righteous solution to a legitimate problem (one that very much still exists today in Western Texas). His character is far more nuanced than the Clint Eastwood, 'Man with No Name,' type, or the commonly portrayed vengeance seeking renegade who doles out his version of righteous justice, one body at a time. Pine's antagonist is the sort that you want to know. He's a modern day bank robber who evokes sympathy and understanding (no spoilers here)!Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) is more in line with the Western movie bad guy. His fresh out of prison perspective and spontaneous, unrestrained reactions are not always respected by his younger brother, Toby. Though he quickly bought in to Toby's bank robbery scheme, it grows increasingly clear that he's in it for the thrill and adventure. This makes the idea that the growing relationship between the two is based on misplaced trust, but brothers will be brothers, especially when there aren't any other options. Pine and Foster play the brothers with a level of finesse rarely seen in modern westerns.None of these characters would be the least bit interesting if there wasn't a compelling western with guns, violence, a few bodies and good guys versus bad guys action. It's all here, gang. The only thing missing are the horses. It's a modern western set in a time where it's common sense to recognize cars are much better and faster when the goal is to get out of Dodge - and fast! Later traditional good guys pursuing bad guy chase scenes would end quickly and poorly if the Howard brothers chose horses to outmaneuver pursuing cars and helicopters.Though categorized as a modern western, there's enough character development and action to please any fan who likes to watch a great caper story with heart and a great ending. It's hard to find fault in the well-crafted and tightly edited film. Under the direction of director David Mackenzie, Taylor Sheridan's well-written story proves to be an award winning combination. I don't ever recall give any film a 10 star-rating (I think such ratings are overlooked as hyperbole or stealth \"insider\" reviews). Hell or High Water is a rare gem and a solid 8/10 film.",

Not a single performance is weak or superfluous. It's location and tell-tale times of economic insecurity are as much a character as the bank tellers, waitresses, and worn cowboys are. Chris Pine, the electric Ben Foster, and most notably, Jeff Bridges, navigate the dry roads and open expanse of east Texas. Every scene has impact and develops the characters, every exchange of dialogue in their perfect drawl just fits - as if you can only nod at its simple wisdom. The movie sticks; and if ever you find yourself crossing the great state of Texas on their long, straight roads - this film may very likely make its way into your musings.",

            "content": "Hell or High Water (7 out of 10) is a very good film overall and is certainly worth a watch. I wanted to get that out of the way because I have a serious complaint about this film. Hell or High Water spends most of its time in a realistic place. It paints a picture of two brothers who have a realistic life with believable relationships with both each other and the world around them. It also paints a realistic scenario that, while not without holes, certainly gives a purpose behind the bank robbing and other shenanigans. Hell and High Water is also a fable. Not quite of the Magic Realism kind that one easily could have seen this film drift into but of the wish fulfillment kind. The kind one would expect in a children's adventure. In other words the ending of The Goonies. Now one could easily argue if The Goonies ending worked for well The Goonies but it simply doesn't strike true to a film that admittedly was getting looser with reality as it went along. Upon reflection one certainly, could imagine that the writer or director was well aware that they were drifting into fable territory and simply loosened the rules of the world of the film as events progressed. I certainly am willing to give this finely crafted film this. The ending just seemed too clean for a film so otherwise grounded. The equivalent of a ghost pirate ship drifting in the background.Speaking of endings souring an otherwise fine experience. The inclusion of a blasting Black Sabbath song at the end of the first Iron Man worked because well it's and Iron Man movie and it's an Iron Man song. This film is drifting quietly into the sunset and suddenly we are blasted with this loud obnoxious country rock song (Outlaw State of Mind by Chris Stapleton) that doesn't fit the scene, or mood and honestly at that point doesn't fit the film. The film overall is great, The acting is more than solid all across the board and the film spends the vast majority of its running time in a good place. Like I said a very good film overall.",

On their tail, a couple of ageing Texan rangers.The plot is so banal as to include a \"last robbery\" for the thieves and a \"last job before retiring\" for one ranger. The only mildly interesting think may be the photography of the harsh, immense territory where society seems to be crumbling apart with houses for sale in the middle of nowhere, abandoned villages and business gone bust. The mood is sombre, but in a \"been there, done that\" kind of way.One of the two rangers is played by Jeff Bridges in a role that would have suited TommyLee Jones, grumpy and gruff, mumbling his words as if he has a toothache. The Bridges character is the one on the brink of retirement, but it looks more like he should have retired way earlier, being slow, overweight and out of breath after a couple of steps.

            "content": "\"Hell or High Water\" is the greatest film of the last 5 years. It succeeds in making the audience laugh, cry and thrill while telling a relatable and gripping story of friendship, sacrifice and crime.From the get go, \"Hell or High Water\" ensures the audience that they are in the solid hands of the craftsman, David Mackenzie. The film opens with a long take, and is probably the best long take since Goodfellas. The take isn't only successful because of the action, composition and color that's in the frame, etc, but its element of surprise, setting and framing that engages the audience at the very beginning of the film. This quality of opening shot is repeated throughout the whole film, and if this doesn't even get nominated for best cinematography at the Oscars, I think I'l cry. All the other technical stuff is amazing as well- special effects, Music, acting and so on.My favourite part of the film, however, is its violence pacing(yet another film term I've made up). In \"Hell or High Water\", David Mackenzie teases the audience with little glimpses of unsatisfying violence, and builds up the tension and pacing until an explosive finale. I am a self confessed gore hound(to an extent), so when I see blood squibs bursting, I get quite excited, especially when I'm in a cinema. Not because I'm a sadistic, person hating emo ( in fact, I'm the first person in the world against real life violence), but rather I can engage in spectacular art that I personally enjoy, so when the bombastic conclusion to the film was unfolding before my eyes, I reveled in David Mackenzies' control throughout the film. It is a really rewarding payoff, and I could sit through and through this film again just for the last 30 minutes.To say that this film is all art and no narrative would be an injustice to its greatness. The story delves deep into the human soul, and investigates morals and values in our society that have been previously neglected. The characters are developed through the wittiy and revealing dialogue in the film, and the use of dialogue to create character is the best seen on the silver screen since Pulp Fiction(or any Tarantino film for that fact). The dialogue never feels dull for a moment, and keeps the audience laughing and engaged with the film for its duration.\"Hell or High Water\" is a cinematic gem, and will be revealed to be a classic of this generation of filmmakers.",

            "content": "Hell or High Water is a neo-Western crime thriller starring Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, and Ben Foster. As far as neo-Westerns go, this one is easily one of the best. Despite its relatively simple plot, the film still feels fresh and smart thanks to its interesting characters and dialogue.Two brothers, divorced father Toby (Chris Pine) and ex-con Tanner (Ben Foster), work together to rob banks throughout small towns in Texas in order to pay off the mortgage for their family's ranch. On their case are Texas Rangers Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). Thanks to the quick thinking of Marcus, the two rangers end up hot on the trail of the two brothers as they execute robbery after robbery.Featuring well-developed characters and some great shoot-out scenes, Hell or High Water succeeds not only as a neo-Western, but also as a fun action film as well. I really enjoyed seeing the creative ways the two brothers covered their tracks after each of the robberies, matched equally by the quick thinking of Ranger Marcus. The wide landscape of Texas makes for a great Western backdrop and the film's cinematographer makes full use of this. The film also serves as a commentary on the greed of the banks so we the viewers gain a sense of justice from the brothers rationale in robbing them.I rate it 8/10",

            "content": "Taylor Sheridan wrote the screenplay for Sicario and he seemed to have an uncanny ability to dish out hair-pulling tension through clich\u00e9 scenes seen a million times. With Hell or High Water, he proved he is no fluke, and it is a better film than Sicario on so many levels. The story couldn't be more simple...Two brothers, Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner Howard (Ben Foster), rob banks. Hot on their heels are two Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) who is on the last leg of his job before retirement and his Native American partner, Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham).The film involves elements of a crime thriller and the chase but it is essentially character studies of not one but two pairs of mismatched relationships. Their arcs intertwined so seamlessly that I wasn't just rooting for the brothers to get away, I was also hoping the Rangers catch them! I can't remember the last time I was rooting for both polar-opposite gun-toting parties in a movie. How the film succeeds in being different with familiar characters is one of its awesome move-sets (sorry, I am still in Pok\u00e9mon Go mindset :)). It does it by giving them divine purposes which I will not divulge, but I will just say this is in the territory of The Big Short all over again where the banks are the biggest robbers of hardworking folks in the sun-drenched land of West Texas. The film is a masterful meditation and evocation of time, place, character, moral stakes, immoral choices and brotherly love. The music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis fits the ambiance to a T and is startlingly emotive, stark and melancholic. The dialogue is stellar, at times it is the silent spaces between words that speak louder. The banter is confident and many times darkly funny. Just listen and marvel at Marcus' constant racist jibes at his partner. The simple return by Alberto would be a punch to Marcus' face but no, we get an occasional return uppercut jibe back at Marcus' ignorance. The dialogue between the two of them feels lived-in. These are two buddies who have probably worked together longer than their marriages and they can take each other's nonsense because they can see through the racism to the weakness. On the other hand, Toby and Tanner's bond is drawn through contrast. Tanner is hell-bent on violence and can't seem to stand out of trouble, but he is always mindful of his brother's objective and in the end he shows what it means to lay down your life for your brother. All the nuanced and textured performances are stirring, none more so than Chris Pine's. Goodness me, I have seen him in so many movies but I be hard-pressed to say that he can actually act beyond having that handsome mien and melting blue eyes. But here Pine shows his surprising range with his grizzled and laconic look. It is a role he nails it with perfection. This is a big step-up to a new level for him that I never knew possible. Talking about the four main characters, I have to mention a minor one that is so great I am sure where she is now she will probably be a cult figure from on out. Watch out for a scene in the only restaurant in a small washed-out town as a waitress takes the order from the two Rangers. Her first line is \"alright, what do you NOT want?\" I laughed so hard my sides hurt. Her execution of the barrage of words is perfect and the reaction from the two unsuspecting Rangers priceless. This is one of those rare films that the moment it is over you begin to wonder what will happen to the characters and you would wish so hard the scene would just continue. No, it isn't an open ending. Every character experiences their closure but you will love and pity them so much that they will continue to live in your consciousness. This is a gem of a movie.",

            "content": "\"Hell or High Water\" is an American movie from 2016. It is probably the most known work by Scottish director David Mackenzie so far and the script comes from Taylor Sheridan, a successful actor as well. This is Sheridan's second screenplay only and after \"Sicario\" was also already pretty good, this one here is at least on par, especially because Sheridan shows that he is also really great in terms of comedy. Two thirds of this film are relatively light and the movie lives through the cool/badass dialogues by the two cops as a vital ingredient. The movie runs for 100 minutes and scored several Academy Award nominations, one of them for Sheridan's script, another for Jeff Bridges' supporting performance (is he really supporting?) and it also got in for Editing besides the crucial Best Picture nomination. The film is basically two duos of people from start to finish: the bad guys and the cops, even if you could say that at least one of the bad guys is not entirely bad as his motivation behind these bank robberies is somewhat honorable and we are also reminded at the very end that he never killed a person in his life.It is a genuinely entertaining film and a lot of this is thanks to Bridges. I am okay with his Oscar nomination, even if a lot of his great performance is thanks to the dialogues written for his character. More serious mentions like the one about his dead wife are not elaborated on enough for Bridges to really make a dramatic impact, but the second half of the film, basically everything after his colleague gets killed, is pure Oscar bait and I am not surprised he is nominated again, the second time after his win and no less than 45 years after his very first Oscar nomination. He has pretty great chemistry with Gil Birmingham and even if the latter is not getting any recognition awards-wise, I still hope it can boost his career. Now about the bad guys: Who would have thought that Chris Pine can make this character work as honestly I always saw him as a bit of a mediocre (in terms of range) Hollywood beau. But he did what he had to do here in order to make the film even better. He reminded me of the main character from \"Justified\" at times, only that he was one of the bad guys of course. And Ben Foster confirmed what realistic movie buffs have known for over a decade now, namely that he is incredibly underappreciated in Hollywood and maybe the one actor in Hollywood right now without an Oscar nomination who is most deserving to get one. For this film, it did not work out yet, but I hope it will soon in the future.Overall, this is a good example of a modern western. It plays right now, i.e. in the 21st century and offers pretty good performances from start to finish. It is also genuinely funny on so many occasions. One example would be the old waitress who almost stole the movie with her one-scene performance. Hilarious stuff there and she was on par with Bridges and Alberto Parker. Surprised that Parker is that old already, he looked great for his age. But that is just a side note. Now I said that this film is pretty funny, but it is also dramatically relevant and edge-of-seat stuff on some occasions, especially in the last 40 minutes. I myself would not say that this is one of the best films of the year, but western fans like myself (and fans of the previously mentioned television show) will still enjoy it and some of the scenes are certainly contenders for some of the best 10 or 20 (in terms of both comedy and drama) moments of the cinema year 2016. One final thumbs-up for the music in here. The songs used fit very well in terms of tone and atmosphere.",

He's a trigger- happy wild man in 2016's Hell or High Water (my latest review).Quote: \"The ex-presidents rip off banks to finance their Endless Summer. Whoa!\" Oops, wrong movie, wrong quote. \"High Water\" is about two brothers from Texas. They instead rob a series of banks that are trying to foreclose on their family ranch. You see their mom died leaving said ranch in debt due to a reverse mortgage. Time for these boys to saddle up, switch cars from village to village, steal regular amounts from the teller drawers, and pay everything off secretively.Hell or High Water is familiar stuff. Heck, if you've seen Public Enemies, Bandits, Point Break, or even 1986's Wisdom, you know what you're getting into. Oh well. Director David Mackenzie (Spread, Starred Up) does an admirable job to boot. He creates a world in which \"High Water\" feels like the type of flick the Coen brothers would have made years ago. It's bullets and blood undercut with a little darkness, a little tongue in cheek humor, and shades of a modern-day Western. It has big name stars and another star in the canvasing cinematography by Giles Nuttgens. His camera-work showcasing the Great Plains, gives you the viewer something to stew over. The \"Big Empty\" becomes the \"big zesty\". The Lone Star State dons its ski masks, its cowboy hats, its desolate abodes, and its sizzling sirloins. Ha!Anyway, the two actors playing the Howard brothers are Chris Pine (Toby Howard) and Ben Foster (Tanner as mentioned earlier). The Texas Ranger in hot pursuit of them, is played by the veritable Jeff Bridges (Marcus Hamilton). They all immerse themselves in these roles to the point where you forget that it's actually the same guys. \"High Water\" plays out like a cat and mouse game between everybody with almost no interaction via the gun-toting robbers and their prognostic, old timer cop. Foster and Bridges could easily play these characters in their sleep. Pine however, really comes into his own just like he did in January's The Finest Hours.In conclusion, Hell or High Water is a nifty little genre piece, a film that feels almost too perfect for its own good. Its score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is at times haunting and the ending is a non-violent standoff with overly preachy dialogue. Also, the opening shot by Mackenzie is panned to perfection and the shootout scenes are loud and panting. With \"High Water's\" late August release and commonplace approach, I unfortunately have to give it a fifty/fifty chance at Academy Award consideration. \"High Water\" as a flick doesn't feel dated but it also doesn't quite meets its \"Waterloo\" either. Again it's a little too familiar but entertaining in a blithe sort of way. Rating: 3 stars.",

            "content": "This was one of the movies I just had to see with the buzz around it. I had heard more than a few times that it was the best movie of the year, so I waited patiently for a chance to watch it. It didn't get a big release so I had to be watch it on home video. The critics were right about this one, it's thrilling and it walks the fine line between a character driven drama and surprisingly effective action movie.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Toby Howard (Chris Pine) and Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) can't make ends meet and they're at the end of their rope. The movie begins with a small Texas Midland Bank opening. One of the tellers Elsie (Dale Dickey) has come in early and unfortunately is the only one in the bank when 2 guys in ski-masks burst in. They demand the cash from the teller drawers, only small bills. Elsie tells them she doesn't have access until the manager shows up. They wait and wrangle the manager into helping them. He starts to protest but gets hit for it. The bank robbers manage to get away and speed toward the next town. Toby blasts Tanner for being unnecessarily forceful but it's pretty obvious that one of them is in it to raise the capital and one of them is in it for the thrills.They're able to successfully rob a second and then surprisingly a third before they head home to dispose of the getaway car. We then start to get a peek into Toby and Tanner's life. Toby lives one his mother's ranch (she passed away after battling a long-suffering illness) and Tanner has only gotten out of jail a year ago. They have resorted to robbing banks to pay off a reverse mortgage on the property so Toby can leave it to his kids. Both of them seem to have made peace with the fact that they probably won't get away. Their case has been handed off to the Texas Rangers and a pair of Rangers Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) are assigned to it. Marcus is about to retire and wants one last shot at glory before he gives up his badge and gun.Hell or High Water has it's own distinctive flavour. The movie radiates Texas in all it's glory. I don't just mean in the prettier aspects either. Even coming from someone who has never been to Texas, this is what you picture Texas looking like. Small one-horse towns dot the landscape and while the residents of those towns seem content, the outsiders (the Texas Rangers) take pity on them. Hell or High Water has an authentic country feel and I would add that even though a lot of what is being shown isn't pretty, the cinematography beautiful too look at. It reminded me a lot of Sicario, which is interesting because this was written by the same writer of Sicario.My favourite thing about Hell or High Water was the strong relationships between the characters. Through Chris and Ben's performances and the strongly written script, you really latch on to Tanner and Toby. They have a deep bond as brothers despite the fact they're very different people. You root for them to make it out because they're underdogs up against the system, they have a righteous cause, they've just been forced to do what they're doing because of the unfairness of the system. You also grow to really like Marcus and Alberto. They have no problem laying into each other but they work well together. A lot of their teasing each other is racial humour but it's not meant in a truly racist way, they're just like any pair of old friends who know how to get under each others skin. It can be hard to get you to like characters on both sides of the situation but it's so key to why Hell or High Water works.When it comes to the cast, you have a couple people well cast into roles they've similarly done before and a couple of surprises. This is a different type of character for Chris Pine, the only time I've seen him do something similar was Z for Zachariah. He's a better actor than he's given credit for, he slips into Toby completely. Ben Foster was also great, I like him best when he's playing more unhinged characters. Jeff Bridges was doing his Texas drawl, he's also a really good actor but he was also really hard to understand at points. Gil Birmingham was pretty poignant as Alberto, he's funny when he's playing off Bridges but he also delivers a good monologue in the middle of the movie.The movie delivers in the end too, I got a lot more action than I bargained for and it was suitably grounded and gritty like the rest of the movie. I really liked the ending, there's a classic western standoff at the end of the movie. Pairing that with the sharp dialogue, it made for a great wrap-up.The movie that I would compare this to would be The Town. Both centre of blue collar protagonists, one represents the brains and the other has the devil-may-care attitude. They also show the other side of the coin, presenting intense yet likable cops who are just trying to get their job done. I still like The Town better but they're both great entries in this genre. I thought Hell or High Water lived up to the hype, I'd give it an 8.5/10. I won't round it up to 9 though, it's really good but it may or may not make my 2016 top 10.",

            "content": "This film was superb in so many different ways. The acting, directing, cinematography, script, even the timing of the scenes; all flawless! This movie - as a whole - really is a fascinating piece of work. Equal to praise is the director who manages to build characters all of whom we can sympathize with; the writer who drafts a script with so much meaning, intrigue, and entertainment; and the actors who each transition into their respective roles so naturally and seamlessly. Chris Pine is perfect as the desperate ex husband in need of some cash to build a reliable future for his kids who he preaches ethics to; Ben Foster even better as the reckless and dangerous, yet loving brother and uncle; but it is somehow Jeff Bridges who manages to outshine these impeccable younger actors - he not only makes his performance believable to the most extreme critique, but he makes you forget he is acting in a film - it is as if we are third persons watching a real life Texas Ranger do some detective work. He deserves at the minimum some recognition from the Oscars. Let me not forget to tell you that each scene is structured with careful scrutiny to every major and minor detail in order to reach a level of perfection only rarely seen in films. Finally, without spoiling the film, I will say that any film that manages to both create a blockbuster showdown between the big good guy vs the bad guy, but also create a tense emotional debate on morals between protagonist against antagonist, deserves my warm appreciation. There is plenty of humour; plenty of action; plenty of drama; plenty of real meaning. Every scene; every line; every facial expression has a purpose to creating a true masterpiece in cinema. There are plenty of excellent films to come out soon, and I warn you this is the film to beat! It is a slow moving film, but if you have the capability and patience to appreciate brilliance, then you will no doubt love this!",

Not a chance!Best performance was by Chris Pine, however the performances by the legendary Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster are too nothing short of brilliant themselves - which brings me to why this movie is my unforgettable : the depth of the characters and the brilliance of actors! Speaking of Chris Pine, you wouldn't expect the Star Wars actor to ooze with masculinity, but let me break it to you I didn't see that good a manly performance since Christian Bale in Dark Knight series or Brad Pitt in Troy. It's not that Chris Pine is running around destroying half of the city or fighting epic battles and banging unbelievably hot women, he is only fighting to bring his ungrateful family out of poverty, just being a provider, just being a man! And the last scene where Chris is confronted by Bridges....oh what a beauty! No high octane action in that scene, just two men sorting their stuff out. Chris Pine I apologize for thinking low of you.",

            "content": "We saw this on DVD from a Redbox rental. It is set entirely in west Texas, Midland and surrounding areas but is filmed entirely in various New Mexico locations.The story here is that a bank has \"helped\" an elderly woman keep her ranch but in the process has accumulated a big debt to the bank. When she died the bank was prepared to foreclose and take the property for themselves. In her will she left the ranch to her grandsons, and its value plus the oil well royalties would set them for life. But it appeared that they would in fact get nothing.Their uncle is Ben Foster as Tanner Howard, he has been in and out of trouble many times, including 10 years in the pen. He devises a plan, they would rob a number of branches of the bank, then use the bank's own money to pay off the lien. He would be helped by his brother, the dad of the grandsons, Chris Pine as Toby Howard, who had never been in any kind of trouble. They would just steal money from the loose bills in drawers, only $20 bills and lower, and avoid money bundles that would have dye packs or tracking devices. Then they would go to a casino, convert the cash to gambling chips, drink a bit, then convert the chips back to money, ultimately into checks written to the same bank they robbed. Their plan is in danger of being foiled by career lawman, Jeff Bridges as Marcus Hamilton, about to retire. So this is a very interesting story and to get the full enjoyment you need to be able to root for a bank robber because the bank itself is more evil. If you can do that then it is a good movie.SPOILERS: In the end, right after the two brothers have accumulated enough money to pay back the bank, in their last robbery a number of customers have concealed handguns and follow them outside and begin shooting. The brothers get away and Toby gets to his escape car but Tanner takes the getaway truck into the hills, followed by lawmen. He gets killed but Toby gets to safety and with the help of a lawyer friend makes thing right with the bank. As the movie ends old Marcus has retired but he visits Toby, says he knows what they did just can't prove it. It appears the grandsons will be set for life.",

            "content": "I'm sure this film will be compared to 'No Country for Old Men' a lot. Both are set in Texas, with a near-retired ranger chasing morally ambiguous men on the run. However, in that comparison, 'Hell or High Water' comes up rather short. The cinematography was nice for the most part, but at times looked cheap and mediocre. The music was forgettable, and occasionally really out-of-place. There is a scene near the beginning where the brothers enter their Mother's old bedroom, and the director blasts violin music at the audience, hammering in the emotion to the point that it took me out of the film. The plot was mostly predictable. With about 30 minutes left in the film I knew precisely what would happen, and I was proved correct. However, that doesn't stop it from being a really entertaining film, just not a great one. The dialogue was really hit-and-miss. The banter between the brothers was mostly natural and fun. Yet the banter between Ranger Hamilton and his partner, Parker, is really repetitive and forced. To the point it is obvious they are telegraphing an emotional climactic scene between them.Though I've listed plenty of negatives, there's a lot to love in this film. Pine and particularly Foster were fantastic. Foster has long been one of my favourite actors in Hollywood, and he's never turned in a half-arsed performance. In this film he's amazing. He was given permission to go wild and ham-it-up and he is compulsively watchable. Every moment he is on the screen, we are drawn to him. It's a shame he wasn't nominated for an Oscar while Bridges was. I'm sorry to say I don't think Bridges was great in this film. I think it may be that his character is near identical to Sheriff Bell from NCFOM, but everything about his character was predictable and derivative. He didn't feel real like Bell, he FELT like a Hollywood construct.The opening act of this film is fantastic, as is the last. Though it drags in the middle, the set-pieces are worth it, and I'm glad I saw it. It won't be a classic like NCFOM, and it lacks any true gut-wrenching feeling. But it's not forgettable either. And the scenes and performances that are worth it, and REALLY worth it. Give it a watch",

            "content": "This modern outlaw Western directed by David Mackenzie is receiving high praise from critics. Like the faceless cattle barons and railroad tycoons memorialized in 1950s celluloid, today it's the bankers who are handy villains bent on destroying the little guy. That's true even if the modern cowboy rides a drilling rig. Brothers Tanner and Toby Howard (Ben Foster and Chris Pine, respectively) team up to rob branches of the Texas Midland Bank, an institution that has drained the value from their late mother's ranch and now (since corporations are officially people, I can anthropormorphize) sits rubbing its hands, waiting to foreclose. That would be a double catastrophe, because oil has been found on the land, and Toby is desperate to hang onto it so he can pass this valuable parcel to his kids. But he lacks the cash to save it. Thus, the robber scheme is hatched. On the hunt for the robbers are two Texas Rangers\u2014Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). Hamilton is just weeks from retirement, but sharp enough to figure out the broad outlines of the plot. He just can't quite put the pieces together. He rides his American/Indian/Mexican partner mercilessly, and you understand Parker's stoicism in the face of these insults is part of the joke. He gets his own barbs in too. Early on, he asks Hamilton: \"Are you going to do anything about these robberies, or just sit there and let Alzheimer's take its course?\" Watching Hamilton and Parker is fun; watching the brothers is fun. They are real characters and they have real relationships here. For me, a big part of the fun is not knowing exactly what to expect, because the movie falls both within and outside the usual formulas. As Philadelphia Inquirer reviewer Stephen Rea says, it's \"at once a tale of desperation in hard times and a keenly observed character study\u2014or studies.\" I had a little flutter when the lawmen referred to Lubbock (home of my grandparents) and Young County (my great-grandparents). The filming, however, was in New Mexico. Not the same at all.",

The year is 2016 and director David Mackenzie is resurrecting the Western genre. It's the 21 century Wild-Wild-Best where the main protagonists have more to say with facial expressions, dialogue and scenes.They speak between the lines and this invisible speech penetrates the veins of your senses.In these Texas landscapes you can see a mirror of nowadays America. This is America of the poor and the desolate.Vast land, old cars, banks which prove who are the current slaves to the system and which you can rob at least few times on the movie screen for one year. Banks that have done so much damage to humanity and nothing has changed but only aggravated.Nevertheless, there is nothing vulgar in this movie, so do not expect Tarantino or The Good,The Bad & The Ugly. It is more Bonnie & Clyde meet the character of Michael Douglas from Falling Down. It has the feel of Blue Ruin and No Country For Old Men.The human wreckage lies in the middle of the story, that you have seen many times but this one, is so far the best and is beyond words. The mirror of the movie can be applied to any other place in the world.The social anomaly of how sometimes you can do the craziest thing in your life because the system had failed and you are either Neo, or Noah or Tanner & Toby in this movie.The secret is to take the reins in your hands and cross through the unthinkable. Well, would you? As I said, at least do that on the screen!Ben Foster steals the show in the brothers team, in a Breaking Bad finale.Your brain counts every second. The density of the masculinity & the protest within the massacre are so intense and merge in a self-destructive outburst in one of the saddest but expected endings.Chris Pine completes the damned symphony in almost monologue but still a dialogue \"There-was-no- other-way\" verbal clash with the old cop character played by Jeff Bridges. Epic,sweaty and dusty music from Nick Cave & Warren Ellis complements the cathartic message of this great little movie. A very personal movie. A movie that will stay and to which you will return and reflect in the echoes of your continuous self interpretation.",

Beautifully filmed in the vast, open spaces of New Mexico, it gives a good look at small town life, and makes a bit of a statement about the lengths some will go for money, and what they need the money for (and not just the two lead characters) Story also has a lot of intentional humour, which caught me by surprise, and top notch acting all throughout.

But I would not watch it again for sure. I'll try to list what I think is really good about this movie. Jeff Bridges nailed his role. It is the only deserved Oscar nomination for this movie. I especially loved his \"racist\" jokes about Indians and Mexicans, and perfect timing for them. Jokes are good themselves, but in Jeff's interpretation, they are awesome. Further, the soundtrack is excellent. And finally, Ben Foster had a few really memorable scenes. First, when he leaves the car and goes towards persecutors, like Rambo, shooting bursts of machine gun fire. Second, the moment when he says: \"Lord of the plains... that's me.\" and then takes a bullet in the head. Everything else is mediocre and mostly already seen.7/10",

Pine's character is the semi responsible one while Foster is the nut job but not for the first time , the actor who steals the show is Jeff Bridges. He is fantastic as the nearly retired sheriff. There is so much that is good about this film . The sound track is perfect , the cinematography makes a baron Texas look almost inviting and the script is first class.

At a time when conceal/carry has become commonplace (especially in places like Texas) this encounter is worse than stupidly suicidal.

            "content": "Review: I really had high hopes for this movie, after reading rave reviews but I must admit, I found it slightly boring because it takes some time for something to happen. Its about 2 brothers, Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) and Toby (Chris Pine), who go around robbing banks, to try and save there families land, after there mother dies. Tanner is the ruthless brother, who has just been released from jail and has a dodgy past but Toby has a clean record, and has spent time looking after his mum before she died. Whilst going through a separation with his wife, Toby plans to leave his kids there land, which has oil beneath it, but they have to buy the land before the bank takes it away from them. Whilst going on a robbing rampage, Texas ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges), makes it his goal to catch the thieves before he retires, with his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), who questions his methods. When Marcus finally works out there pattern, the rangers finally come face to face with the robbers but Toby manages to get away. With the case closed, and the blame fully on Tanner for the robberies, Marcus works out that he wasn't working alone but there isn't enough evidence to takedown Toby, who played a big part in the robberies. It's quite a basic plot, with no thrills or twists, so I was surprised that it went down so well with audiences. The cast played there roles extremely well, and the chemistry between the two brothers is very believable but it seemed very one toned in my eyes. There is some enjoyable wit, especially between Marcus and Alberto, which lightened up the intense mood but I still was expecting more from this western. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by David Mackenzie, 50, who also brought you The Last Wilderness, Young Adam, Asylum, Hallam Foe, Spread, Perfect Sense, You Instead and the great Starred Up starring Jack O'Connell. He certainly has covered many genres throughout his career, and he was a surprising choice to take on a western, because he is born in Scotland and his last film was a prison drama. He done a good job with the script, which was written by Taylor Sheridan who brought you Sicario, and he put together a great cast, who were perfect for there roles. At 67 years old, Jeff Bridges has proved, time and time again, that he still has it, and with a role in the upcoming Kingsman sequel, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, and another 4 projects in the pipeline, he certainly isn't planning to stop acting any time soon. Anyway, I can understand why people enjoyed it but I still preferred No Country For Old Men.Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $27millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their crime/western/dramas, starring Ben Foster, Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, Gil Birmingham, Katy Mixon, Dale Dickey, Buck Taylor, William Sterchi, Kristin Berg, Jackamoe Buzzell. 5/10",

            "content": "The best thing in this movie - and there are lots of good things - is the cinematography. It is meant to present West Texas and Oklahoma - in fact, the credits said it was filmed in New Mexico - as a very poor and desolate part of the U.S. Yet the cameraperson filmed this movie like a painter, framing the shots carefully - and perhaps choosing special lenses to bring out the colors of the desolate countryside; that's just a guess on my part - in ways to make it intriguing just to look at.But it was also very worth listening to. I didn't care for Jeff Bridges' character; it was written too much like a stereotype. But he certainly did what could be done with the role to invest some humanity in the part.The same is true of the other actors and actresses. The dialogue they are given is sometimes caricatural or otherwise undeveloped, but these actors do a good job of putting humanity into what could be comic book characters.The action moves fairly slowly, but at an appropriate pace that never once had me looking at my watch. I was thoroughly involved in the characters, even though I didn't particularly like any of them, and that is a high compliment.I'm in France at the moment. In the States, I don't know if I would have bothered to go to a theater to see this movie. That would definitely have been my loss, because this is a movie that benefits from being seen on a big screen.It reminded me that Westerns - and this is a Western of sorts - are often among the best made of American movies.",

It immerses you in the dusty planes of a 'Neo-Western' New Mexico with confidence and ease. There's a lot to unpack thematically, from the phenomenal mirror-image brother relationships to the thinly veiled political message, and most moments, even the exciting and genuinely tense 'action' sequences, are conveyed with a subtlety that makes for a much quieter, more character-driven affair than usual. It has proper stakes and emotionally affecting moments of all kinds, and it certainly leaves a lasting impression. 8/10",

            "content": "A battered car carries two bruised brothers, Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) across a desolate post-industrial borderland. Passing billboards advertising debt relief and loans, they make their way to the bank. It's the first of many they will rob at gunpoint. On their tail is Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges), three months from retirement and looking for a hobby. What better way to pass the time than guessing the Howard brothers' next move? He's joined by his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham), and together they will chase Toby and Tanner, all the while wondering why the youngsters would want to steal cash when their family is sitting on an oilfield. Could the motivation go beyond simple greed?Hell or High Water is the ninth feature from director David Mackenzie, and it follows his excellent prison drama Starred Up. As with that film, ostensibly there's little here we've not seen before, but it's pulled off with such confidence and control that it seems effortless, making for an effortless watch. For a film about post-9/11 shattered ideals it's a very accessible and humorous package. Taylor \"Sicario\" Sheridan's script is surprisingly banter-filled and funny, to the point where one could argue the emotional impact of the climax is somewhat undermined. Indeed, the final confrontation is comfortingly predictable more than tense, its ambiguity mild compared with, say, Tommy Lee Jones's hauntingly sad dream speech ending from No Country for Old Men.The Coen Brothers' masterpiece is but one touchstone for Mackenzie. Also referenced is Michael Mann's Heat: the concurrent story lines with their inexorable slide toward violent resolution; and the idea of honour existing equally among thieves and cops. I was also reminded, in the ageing lawman and the righteous criminal, of Joel Schumacher's Falling Down, not least in the brazen reminders that our antiheroes are fighting back against a system constructed to screw over the everyman.The idea of such decency and honour is fanciful, naturally, but fantasy is part and parcel of the mythologizing of what we might call the New Old West. This is a scorched landscape of masculine archetypes. Like John Boorman with Deliverance, Mackenzie is a foreigner painting on an all-American canvas; and he's joined by fellow outsiders Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, composers who've touched the broken heart of the American Dream before in The Assassination of Jesse James and The Road. Their subtle score here takes a back seat to a dark acoustic playlist. Ben Foster can do unhinged-meets-vulnerable in his sleep, although this is Chris Pine as we've not really seen him. He's fine, if occasionally coming across as stolid when striving for ambivalent. Bridges is the growling, grumbling goodie version of True Grit's Rooster Cogburn. Marcus's banter with Alberto is fun at first, though after a while I found his racist barbs as wearying as the receiver himself does. Regardless, in both pairings \u2013 brothers or partners \u2013 a sense of well-worn chemistry is evident.For fans of modern Westerns such as No Country and The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, this is pretty much required viewing, even if expecting the sheer existential weight of those films may be pushing expectations too far. A well-intentioned morality tale, Hell or High Water has enough deadpan humour, familiar characterisation, and well-crafted action scenes to please genre aficionados and mainstream audiences alike.",

            "content": "\"From the director of STARRED UP (2013) and the writer of SICARIO (2015)\" seems to be a double warrant that this latter-day cat-and-mouse bank robbery Western will not disappoint. Hell yeah, you bet, it doesn't. David Mackenzie's latest picture takes place in New Mexico, substituted for West Texas in the story, its vast flat-lands where cowpokes once galloped heroically now has been infested by an economic downturn, Mackenzie rams home that halcyon days are gone, derelict landscapes are sublimely captured by the film's traversing shots which also topically inform viewers that capitalism has avariously seized the opportunity to exploit the scrape for its own benefit, with big placards of banks' artifices glaringly omnipresent against the lugubrious backwater. The mother of Tanner (Foster) and Toby Howard (Pine) is the victim of a bank stratagem, the heinous reserve mortgage, after her decease, Toby inherits the range, but needs to pay off the debts to the Texas Midlands Bank before the deadline, otherwise the ranch will be foreclosed, more significantly, oil has recently been discovered on the land, it will be a gold mine but he must secure the dough before bank takes it over, so he avails himself of this obsolete action (nobody robs bank nowadays!) to bag enough cash from the said bank, with Tanner lending a helping hand, who is an ex-con (for manslaughter of their own father) and has just been released from the jail over a year. In Toby's plan, they cannot risk taking notes of big face-value, which can be tracked, so they need to rob several branches to rack up the sum, and Tanner turns out to be quite an apt partner-in- crime, although sometimes also a loose cannon who has no scruples about violence when he sees fit. But Taylor Sheridan's script robustly refuses to lend an easy dichotomous characterization between the two brothers, Tanner is aggressive, presumptuous, but also deeply connected by their brotherhood and family bond, he has nothing to lose, and will do anything to make sure that Toby can buy their land back from the bank, ethically we shouldn't root for him, but Ben Foster brings home Tanner's atrocity and self-sacrifice to audience in such a pressing force, our moral compass might be unconsciously deflected. Chris Pine's Toby, on the other hand, stays close to our compassion, a retiring but seemingly innocuous Texan (although Sheridan ascertains that the violent DNA runs in the family), divorced and has two children whom he hasn't seen for nearly a year, if he fails to pay the mortgage, he will lose everything, not to mention a safe future for his children, we can wholeheartedly concur his actions because he has no other alternative, also because he is righteously fighting against the canker pervading in our society presently, only if, their last mission had not gone awry, a robbery on the pay-day is a big remiss, while trigger-happy on-lookers are simply too bovine to be martyrized for the interest of the banking conglomerate. The pair traces Howard brothers are two Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Bridges), and his half- Mexican-half-Comanche partner Alberto Parker (Birmingham). Marcus is on the verge of retirement, considers the chase his last field-day out and wallows in his politically incorrect jests with a condoning Alberto meanwhile trying to outguess Tanner and Toby's moves, which culminates in an an-eye-for-an-eye retribution in the wild where Bridges gives a text-book paragon of changing emotions, from initial insouciance, to sudden terror, then a pang of anguish until a regarding but also benumbing victory, the Dude is back for more trophies! Then, in the finale where Marcus visiting Toby in his ranch, both actors superbly register an enticing ambiguity in the face of the ugly truth behind their inevitable encounter, intrepidly take the gray zone with a whopping bang, death could be a relief after all the damage has been done, but it is the residue of the unpalatable memories will haunt both in the rest of their waking hours, or maybe in their dreams as well. A summer sleeper in the North American box office front, HoHW is a remarkable endeavor pays reverent homage to the Western genre while yoking its story intimately to today's climate without losing its sober angle, an evocative soundtrack cooked up by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is also irresistible for those reminiscent souls, heading vigorously into the Oscar season, in my opinion, Bridge is reserved for a nomination, Foster could be a left-side contender, while its script, cinematography and editing also have a good chance, if it can scoop a SAG nomination for its splendid cast, then a BEST PICTURE player will not be a long shot afterwards.",

First, it is the lazy director's way of manipulating feelings ( ooh, something bad's going to happen, the music tells me so) and filling space. The songs in this movie are sentimental but the images are anything but. I played two great scenes without sound, one, where the two brothers wrestle in the twilight and the other the last few minutes at the end and both are much stronger without music (natural sounds OK).

The brothers are Chris Pine and a brilliant Ben Foster, (surely one of the best actors working anywhere today), and an even better Jeff Bridges is the grizzled old sheriff on their trail.

            "content": "I don't know why, but sometimes when I watch a film it reminds me of another film and I just can't shake that feeling for its entire runtime. In this case, 'Hell and High Water' just made me think of 'No Country For Old Men' all the way through. They are both set in the deserts of Texas and are about an outlaw on the run from the law. Okay, so that smallest of synopsis doesn't quite fit if you've seen both films, but it's as near as I can get in such few words. I guess what I'm trying to say is that, in this age of 'shared cinematic universes,' it wouldn't surprise me to see both films somehow existing side by side.Whereas 'No Country For Old Men' had a man on the run with an ill-gotten bag of loot from a hired killer while the law was \u2013 kind of \u2013 hot on both their trails, 'Hell or High Water' as a pair of brothers robbing banks while Josh Brolin is a sheriff on the brink of retirement and his long-suffering partner looking into the trail of empty cash drawers they've been leaving in their wake. Both films show the contrast between the two sets of characters' journey and from now on I'll do my best to concentrate on 'Hell or High Water' rather than constantly dwelling on how similar it was to 'No Country For Old Men.' The two robbers here are played by Chris 'new Kirk' Pine and Ben Foster (who looks fatter than the last time I saw him on screen!). I guess this casting was deliberate, but Pine is definitely the more sympathetic of the two and we get the feeling he's being led astray by his older, more violent and law-breaking brother. Plus Pine is also afforded the backstory of an ex-wife and child who he owes money to. Then we have the long arms of the law, mainly Brolin, who shines as the gruff and not always politically correct sheriff who is hot on their heels. I would say that him and his partner are probably more enjoyable to watch than the bank robbers as the banter between them and general long suffering vibe is truly a joy to watch.So, it's ultimately a cat and mouse game where you probably can guess that the two couples are going to meet up during the final act and it's all going to end badly for someone. Despite enjoying the film with its lush desert setting and realistic banter between the pairs, I'd say that its predictability would be the one area where it falls down a bit. I was only about a quarter of the way through when I made my prediction as to how it will play out for the four main characters. I won't mention it here as it turned out to be 100% correct, therefore would be giving away one hell of a major spoiler.Despite the bank robbery scenes naturally involving high-tension and speedy getaways, I did feel that the overall pacing of the film was quite slow. To some, that may sound like a negative point, but it's not the kind of story that needs fast-paced shootouts and high-budget actions scenes. It's a character piece as much as it is a cops and robbers film. I did my best to stop mentioning 'No Country For Old Men,' but I have to say that if you enjoyed that, i.e. characters, settings and mood, then you should like this one too. At least no one gets killed by a weird, portable hydraulic air-type pump thing. Weird.",

On their trail are two Texas rangers Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham). The story moves along at a steady pace with plenty of wide open shots of the Texas countryside interspersed with trucks rolling down roads pockmarked with foreclosure, debt relief, and fast cash signs. The script is written by Taylor Sheridan who had success with Sicario and continues to excel with his storytelling. David Mackenzie directs the camera speeding along the roads or capturing the brothers bonding over beers and wrestling after a robbery. The story captures the sentiment of the times and anger at the big banks while still having a captivating plot.The acting is phenomenal with Bridges leading the way with his thick cowboy accent and his racial stereotyping of his patient partner. Foster fits well in the role as the crazed ex-con brother whose unpredictable behavior causes a few close calls. Pine is more serious as the sensible brother whose plan sparks the string of robberies and hoping to get away with it. Gil Birmingham also brings humor in his interactions with Bridges.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",

            "content": "David Mackenzie's latest film, Hell or High Water, feels like one of those movies that could've been made at any point in cinema's existence. It is a simple meat-and-potatoes tale of bank heists and blood brothers, the sort of story that great directors from Kubrick and Altman to Arthur Penn and Tarantino have made their staple at one time or another. And though it's set against the woeful landscape of an America in the throes of the most recent economic downtown, you could easily see it taking place in the Dust Bowl era of Bonnie & Clyde. Working from a screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (scribe of last year's superior Sicario), Mackenzie sets his film in the Texas midlands, the last frontier against \"progress,\" as the few scattered denizens would call the encroaching destruction of their old-fashioned way of life. Gone are the desperadoes, the Gary Coopers and Jesse Jameses of old, and all that's left are a few dying embers of what had once been the great American dream. Three such embers are at the heart of Hell or High Water, and it's these three that set the desert fields ablaze in a trail of blood and violence. Two of these three are a pair of brothers, Toby and Tanner Howard\u2014rough country boys who are at once peas in a pod and yet polar opposites. Toby (a sufficiently grunged-up Chris Pine, playing a stoic Southern loner role that somehow bypassed Josh Brolin, who usually corners the market on such parts) is quiet but decent, eking out a hardscrabble existence in a desperate attempt to keep his family ranch from foreclosure. His big brother Tanner is far more erratic and intense, which makes the casting of Ben Foster a no-brainer. Tanner's antics seem downright Tremor Brother-esque; a hard-living ex-jailbird with no compunction against brutality if required. The brothers have cooked up a scheme to save the family farm as well as get revenge on the faceless banks that have f_cked them over: by pulling a string of penny-ante heists at each branch, taking only cashiers' trays of loose bills (to prevent ink-pack bursts and access to traceable currency). It's a smart play, but also one that requires several jobs in rapid succession. And sooner or later, their luck will inevitably run out. This is where the third ember comes into play: Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton. Played as a prickly amalgamation of Rooster Cogburn and Columbo, Jeff Bridges's soon-to-retire lawman decides to pursue the bank job investigation as one final hurrah before he turns in his star. Paired with Gil Birmingham's stalwart, snarky Alberto (who also bears the brunt of his partner's deliberately un- P.C. ribbing), Marcus shrewdly assesses that the thieves are working towards a goal and accurately calculates the locations they'd need to hit in order to meet their quota. But as with every single heist film since the days of old, something goes wrong. There is a grim edge to Hell or High Water, but it refuses to wallow in it. Instead, it is bleakly funny, fraught with little character foibles sure to get a chuckle or two out of any audience. Even in the tensest moments (and there are more than a few, be forewarned), there is a nevertheless a laid- back undercurrent. In large part, it's due to how easy the three leads slip into their characters and convey decades' worth of life and experience in their performances. Bridges impresses the most, at least for me\u2014there are several moments in the film where he is as good as he ever has been, even as the Dude\u2014and you could almost see yearly spin-offs built around the character on cable TV. Pine, who usually sings best playing zany sorts like in his Carnahan collaborations, nevertheless is very striking as a low-key working joe who nevertheless has a depth of insight far exceeding his rough-hewn appearance. And then there's Foster, who is never anything but riveting when he's on-screen and whose mercurial talents continue to cement him as one of the peak actors around. Hell or High Water also cements Sheridan as a writer to watch out for. His last two scripts have been perfectly methodical, like a chemist's precise formula, almost perfectly calibrated. He has an ear for dialogue, both ruminating (at one point, a cowpoke laments that the way the country's going, no wonder his kids don't want to raise cattle for a living) and snappy (\"Only assh_les drink Mr. Pibb.\" \"Drink up.\"). Aided by a plaintive score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis\u2014as if there could be any better pick\u2014Sheridan's voice is powerful enough that it almost seems like Mackenzie hardly has to do any heavy lifting at all. And though he doesn't set up high-octane thrills like Denis Villeneuve did with Sicario, he instead presents a sober, soulful threnody to the dying myth of the American outlaw. (On a final note, I agree with Tanner: only assh_les drink Mr. Pibb.)",

            "content": "Hell or High Water is a moody cops and robbers film that follows uneasy parallel pairing of brothers ( one through blood, the other in arms) where the characters are more symbolic than human. It is a virtual poor me testament by nearly every player in the film as they gross on about life in boom or bust West Texas, the banks (Midland in particular) being the evil monolith and their cause for woe.With the bank about to foreclose on late ma's old homestead that just happens to be sitting on oil brothers Tanner and Toby decide to pull some bank jobs to pay off the mortgage. When one bank offers slim pickings the boys move onto another. Veteran Texas Rangers Hamilton and Parker are assigned the case and set out across the dusty landscape where they encounter more resentment than respect from locals while trading insults with each other. Toby and Tanner meanwhile seek out one more payoff to save the ranch.Stuck knee deep in cynicism and self pity Hell or High Water's cast from leading to supporting center on mistrust and betrayal as they launch from major to minor tirade between heists. Taylor Sheridan's script is perhaps too ambitious as his characters drone on about faceless thieving bankers, ageism, subtle bigotry, triggering, genocide and white privilege without creating anyone of much depth since they are too busy playing victims. It is little wonder psycho like Tanner is the lynch pin to any of the energy present in the film since every one else is in a victim funk.With the stilted dialogue spouting one declaration after another there is little room for the actors to stretch but Jeff Bridges does register as the aging ranger that time has passed by. Ben Foster's Tanner does the requisite unhinged role adequately while Dale Dickey and Margaret Bowman make the most of their time in a couple of scenes.David McKenzie's direction plods most of the way as he surveys a vanishing America when he should be developing character. Opening the film with a well shot and edited bank job he manages to even inject some graffiti editorializing within it and he never lets up cutting between the brothers posing and moaning about life's inequities as if on the cover of a John Mellancamp album while Hamilton needles Parker about his Comanche heritage during a languid stakeout in the wrong town. By putting far too much emphasis on the external forces that drive them McKenzie sacrifices character in favor of this fall back to explain their actions which remain remote at best.",

They will rob banks, with ski masks, until they have enough money to reverse a \"reverse mortgage\" with which a bank fleeced their newly deceased mother. Not just any bank, the bank branches of the offending financial institution. Tanner, an ex-con, just wants the thrill of the plan but Toby wants to save the ranch for his two sons. What's more, they have planned it out in many ways to cover their tracks, such as burying getaway cars. Naturally, after the first two successful robberies, the Texas Rangers are called in. Marcus (Jeff Bridges) is on the verge of retirement; his partner, Alberto (Gil Birmingham), a half-Comanche, wishes he was about to rock in a rocking chair. By studying the methods used so far, Marcus gets an idea about what bank may be next. What's more, Tanner does one job on the spur of the moment and leaves clues. As the brothers get closer and closer to completion, will Marcus find them first? This excellent, sometimes violent, film has one sensational story.

The acting from the leads are all well, as is the script and writing. There are few tense moments but the film never fully has much suspense which one had assumed. When thinking about it, it is quite simple with no turns or twists. It reminds of the Town, though in that film I find superior since the audience had more of a connection and care for it lead characters, and there was more of a buildup to the climax.This film is quite predictable with its ending, they could have went with another direction instead of the typical Hollywood fair but to some, it worked.

Well, Hell or High Water just surpassed it.This is an amazing piece of art, with characters full-developed at the smallest detail. David Mackenzie takes his time to not only introduce us the characters, but he makes them THE film. There is an absurd level of personality development with scenes that are so simple and subtle, but that manage to captivate us through a brilliant script.Chris Pine and Ben Foster have probably their best performances ever, as well as an Oscar-worthy performance from Jeff Bridges. I mean, how great can they be? I love the duo chemistry, I cared about them so much and that put me at the edge of my seat at the end of the film, when all the action unfolds. Also, Gil Birmingham (Alberto Parker) played brilliantly Marcus' partner. The constant bickering between each other is funny and compelling.I'm surprised with the quality of the direction by Mackenzie. I didn't know him until now, so I'm blown away by the outstanding achievement in what he did. Great cinematography, amazing long takes with a perfect soundtrack accompanying this thrilling Western. As for flaws, I can't really pinpoint any ... The pacing is deliberately slow, so that might not please some people, but the truth is that, if the pacing isn't as controlled as this one was, the characters can't be as captivating and the connection between them and the audience falls apart.Hell or High Water is by far the best Western of 2016! Pine, Foster and Jeff Bridges have Oscar-worthy performances (especially the latter) in a film with a brilliant direction by David Mackenzie. Cinematography, soundtrack, script, suspense, characters, story ... This movie achieves everything that it wanted to achieve with every parameter at the very top of quality. A Western masterpiece.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",

            "content": "Two brothers commit a series of bank robberies to raise enough funds to prevent bank foreclosure while a tough Texas ranger on the verge of retirement pursues them in this modern western from the writer of 'Sicario'. The film opened to positive reviews with a lot of acclaim for its performances. Of particularly note is Jeff Bridges as the elderly ranger who eventually reveals a very human underbelly to his overtly racist and condescending character, Gil Birmingham as his patient partner and Ben Foster as the elder and more unpredictable brother. It is the dialogue that really makes the characters come alive though and the film is frequently laugh-out-loud funny with excellent repartee between Foster and Chris Pine (as the other brother) and some truly kooky supporting characters, even if a number of them are little more than stereotypes. Whatever the case, the best aspect of the film is how we are positioned to care for both Bridges and the two brothers. There are no villains in the film, give or take 'the bank', and while the film harps on a little too much about the evils of the bank, the lack of human villains make everyone in the film feel like the victim of unfortunate circumstance and chance - something that has earned the film comparisons to the movies of the Coen Brothers. This is a motion picture that deserves to be appreciated on its own terms though. Between the gorgeous cinematography, brooding music and witty lines, it is not an experience easily forgotten and one that leaves it up to the individual viewer to decide whether the ends justify the means.",

Every character in this movie,{including the T-Bone Caf\u00e9 waitress} I feel like I met while visiting there. This movie captured the heart and soul of Texas. Hell or High Water is extremely dynamic in the character study of each and every person in this film. My favorite is Ben Foster's character 'Tanner Howard', everyone else in this film is the resin, this guy is the catalyst that truly makes this one solid movie. At first glance Tanner seems shallow and foolish, as the movie progresses you see that he is the only one that truly grasps the reality and the consequences of their actions, but he does it anyway because of his loyalty and love for his brother. I love the seen in the Casino where Tanner and the large Comanche Indian go nose to nose, it is the second reference to the white man becoming like the American Indian and being stripped of land and dignity. It's as if Tanner has become a Comanche warrior on his last stand before becoming extinct in the world of the evil rich. This is a movie that really should be watched more than once so you can catch every line that is incredibly scripted. Well, I gave this movie a 10 because I loved it, every aspect of it, even the music.",

It features two double-acts, each on either side of the law: Chris Pine and Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham. All four are excellent, in their very different ways. Pine here gets a role he must have been dreaming of for quite a while, where he can shine as an actor rather than a pretty face. His partnership with Thomas, who excels as his wired, wiry brother, is terrific. Jeff Bridges is great as ever as a shrewd Texas Ranger on the cusp of retirement, with a perfect foil in a stoical Gil Birmingham as his sidekick.The direction by David (Starred Up, Hallam Foe, Young Adam) Mackenzie is mostly laudable, with some excellent work in several getaway-car sequences. There are, here and there, some strange choices: an oddly truncated helicopter shot, the use of a hand-held camera for a simple, quite touching scene between Pine and Thomas, an eccentric final image (which I think may refer to missing evidence, but it's not at all clear). The music is mostly good, but sometimes gives away too much.Carping aside, it's an engrossing and entertaining movie, that pays its audience the compliment of considering them intelligent human beings.",

            "review_title": "Hell or High Water",
            "content": "\"Hell or High Water\" is a tense, character driven modern western that subverts the classic western idea of the \"white hats versus black hats\" by showing the point of view of both the pair of robbers and the pair of sheriffs hunting those robbers. The opening shot of the film is probably my favorite of the year: it is seemingly a static shot as a car passes by, but suddenly the camera begins to dolly and rotate slowly, following a car that has just come into the town in the background, with glimpses of a woman getting out of her car in the foreground as the camera passes by her. The car in the background disappears behind a building as the camera begins to float behind the woman in the foreground going into that building. The scene climaxes with two men wearing ski masks and holding guns suddenly jumping out from behind the building just as she is about to open the door. The shot is slow (it lasts about a minute and a half long), but it is very suspenseful and intriguing, perfectly setting up the following scenes as the two men rob two banks together. One thing this film does very well is suspense. Each shot is pretty much the perfect length, and each intense scene has the perfect set up and just enough build up. The director knew exactly when and when not to use music during the scenes, especially during one suspenseful moment near the end that is made all the more suspenseful by the silence during the scene.Each character is given depth and each one you understand, even the most despicable one in the film. The two bank robbers are Toby and Tanner Howard, the latter being my favorite character and favorite performance of the film. They are brothers and it is insinuated that they had an abusive father, who Tanner eventually killed at a young age in order to protect his brother and mother. Tanner is an impulsive hothead, and after he went to prison he spiraled into a life of crime and even more prison, leaving Toby to deal with their property and their mother, who died recently. Toby is smart, thoughtful, and while he isn't perfect, he clearly feels sorry for what he is doing and feels empathy towards others. He doesn't see his ex-wife or his children very often, but he does care about them. The whole reason he is doing this in the first place is to help them financially and make sure his children don't go down the same path as him. Despite their hard times, Tanner and Toby do care about each other as well, and Tanner is basically only doing this for his brother. The sheriffs are more normal. Marcus is an old, experienced sheriff and a bit of a traditionalist. It is insinuated he had a wife, but she died, so all he really has left is his job. He goes on this hunt with Alberto, a half-Native American half-Mexican that has a wife and kids. He was forced to go on this hunt with Marcus and is constantly teased about his race by him, although he doesn't seem to be a serious racist (he genuinely cares about Alberto, even if it doesn't always seem this way).These characters slowly unfold to us and their situations each begin to make more sense. The film is study of these characters but also of the death of the \"old west\", but doesn't view that time period with rose colored glasses. At the same time, it views the death of this time as a tragedy, but only because the big banks are taking these people's lad and money. In fact, these banks are probably the only clear enemies in the film.The film has a very clear plot throughout and some very intense moments, but it is very much a dialogue driven film that has several great small moments and encounters that are pretty much inconsequential to the overall plot. The cinematography is often restrained but fantastic, with several long takes that are barely noticeable. It is a complex and very well written film with some very good direction and acting that is engrossing from beginning to end. I recall a single short scene in which I didn't like one small performance, but other than that the cast was great across the board. It is unpredictable and suspenseful but also quiet and somewhat poignant.",

It's engaging, it has beautiful cinematography, a killer soundtrack, great acting (with great chemistry between the characters), a nice and interesting political message and very good writing.Chris Pine plays a very three dimensional character and so does Jeff Bridges. Their characters are both morally imperfect, but they are portrayed as the good guys. I think it's interesting to think about who really are the good and bad guys in this film, but one character for sure is evil: the banksHell or High Water is not afraid to address a flaw in American society. Banks are ripping us off, who cares if they get robbed? The banks control the human, of course there will be resistance. The banks are the reason our protagonists rob banks after all.One thing I didn't like about this film is mentioning how native Americans got their land taken, it's sad but true but I didn't think it belonged in this film. Maybe the screenwriters wanted to be a bit politically correct, or the message about natives just didn't get to me, since I'm not American myself. Apart from it being set in Texas and having lots of wide shots of deserted landscapes, there are some very recognizable tropes from the Western genre. First of all, the white hat obviously resembles the good guys, while the black hates represents the bad guys. But that's why only Jeff Bridges' character can be seen with a white hat in the poster. He's a police officer, he brings criminals to justice. However, beneath this white hat lies a broken man coming to his end. Furthermore, the story of this film felt like a western, two men robbing banks must've been influenced by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Also, we can't forget the accents, that also give this film a western feeling.I was very happy with this film, it lived up to expectations (this film was on my radar for a while), it's a great addition to the Neo Western genre and it got me excited for David Macenzie's upcoming projects.",

Gripping, atmospheric crime thriller moves at a deliberately slow pace, but benefits from a riveting story, compelling characters, crisp dialogue, gritty action scenes, and striking cinematography on its way to a powerful climax. Bridges is well-cast, though it's hard not to see occasional shades of Rooster Cogburn, while Pine and Foster are perfectly matched as discordant siblings. ***",

It puts the emphasis on the characters, their dynamics, and putting that to the test. Sure, the bank robbery scenes are adrenaline rushing, but the core of this movie is really the relationship between two brothers and their ideological differences. Chris Pine plays the straight arrow who has more of an ethical reason for what he's doing, even though he knows its wrong. Whereas Ben Foster plays an ex-con who's just looking for a thrill. But regardless of the difference in ideologies, you see an inherent bond between these two brothers that transcends the events of the film, and that was something great to see...",

            "content": "\"Hell or High Water\" even features a cast led by the national treasure that is Jeff Bridges. And yet, while moviegoers desperate to see anything that doesn't involve a superhero may be willing to overlook its shortcomings, others will undoubtedly be disappointed to find that it's somewhat less than the sum of its parts. As the film opens, brothers Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster) arrive at a remote Texas Midland bank branch to rob it. While there are some hiccups, they make off with the loose bills in the registers. They then proceed to do the same thing at another branch of the same bank, and while things go a little smoother, the end result is the same. As crime sprees go, these jobs aren't that impressive on the surface, but, as we soon discover, there is a lot more going on with them than meets the eye. The early scenes of \"Hell or High Water\" are the best. After seeing so many meticulously choreographed bank heists that try their damnedest to outdo the likes of \"Heat,\" it is amusing to see one staged on a smaller and more realistic scale. It becomes even more interesting once we understand that there is more going on than immediately meets the eye. However, once writer Taylor Sheridan has established the basic premise, he doesn't seem to have much of an idea of how to fill the hour or so between those early scenes and the climactic moments. Even though none of them are especially revelatory, the performances are probably the best thing to be had in the film. The most surprisingly satisfying of the bunch comes from Chris Pine, who turns in his best work to date in a part that finds him dialing down the smirky charm of his nouveau Captain Kirk in order to play a far more serious-minded character. Mackenzie's direction and Giles Nuttgens's cinematography create a kind of horizontal vertigo in the dizzying sweep of the landscape and there is a great soundtrack with original music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis. It's an action-thriller with punch; Bridges gives the characterisation ballast and heft and Pine and Foster bring a new, grizzled maturity to their performances. \" \"Hell or High Water\" channels the uncut adrenaline of crime, but it's also a moral drama that takes the measure of each destabilizing action it shows us. The movie is on the right side of things, even when it barely knows where that is.",

Two brothers who have taken different life paths are joined together by their mother's passing and the imminent foreclosing of the only thing their family ever had. With little to lose the \"good\" brother joins his older dark sibling in order to secure a different future for his offspring. With a simple modus operandi the two brothers might actually pull it off. But there's a determined Texas Ranger who on the eve of his retirement catches the case. This will change things for the brothers.Besides the stark atmosphere brought to celluloid ,there is also a synergistic casting. It propels the story which always keeps the viewer rapt and on edge throughout. In simple terms a great movie that is equal parts crime drama and western.",

Before that Toby tipped generously the waitress which later said to the police that she didn't recognize them .Toby divorced and want his two sons have a comfortable life unlike them. The two rangers Marcus and his indian partner stayed at a hotel in a town because Marcus thought they'd rob that bank. They went to a restaurant with a very weird old waitress. They waited there for a long time and Marcus figured they'd rob another bank. The two robbed the relatively bigger bank on the payday. The town people chased them outside with their cars and the older brother stopped and shot the cars with his rifle and made them return to their town. It was a very impressive scene. Toby was shot but it was ok. He took the other car and the older brother moved on with the police cars behind. He went up on a hill and exploded the car. At the summit he started shooting people down there and the town people also showed up. The Indian ranger got killed and Marcus with a town man went up behind him and Marcus shot the older brother in the head. They couldn't catch Toby he wasn't a suspect but Marcus wasn't convinced. He retired but went after Toby seeing he gave the range to his sons and his ex wife and he was living elsewhere. Marcus said he'll keep chasing him and he left the ranger where they found oil beneath and making lots of money. They were rich now. Their sickness of being poor thru generations were cured.

Ben Foster and Chris Pine bring absolute realism to their roles as redeemers against the villainous Bank while Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham as lawmen have you standing next to them throughout the movie. Some of the scenes from the diners are just wonderful and there is one in particular with an ornery old waitress that could go down as one of the best ever. Woven throughout the fabric of the movie is the theme of a dying Texas, a sense of hopelessness that the good times are gone forever, it is quite a sad thread to be sure. I've seen quite a few Texas movies and I have lived there for some time. I have to say that Texas ain't America, it's just a place that happens to be attached to America and I think it's a reluctant attachment. I'm sure they could do better on their own! The music is so good it almost has you crying, but then again all Texas music can do that to you if it's dropped into the right scene. Here it's done with such a deft touch that you'd think it was written specifically for the movie. To summarize, this is the best ensemble cast since \"No country for old men\" Bridges is at his best (or even better)and the rest of the actors are right up there with him. The plot,although it's been used before in many forms, is unfolded in a way that makes it seem like it's a brand new idea. The fantastic music and the hardscrabble scenery have you walking along with the story, so in a way you get your exercise while you're watching. Well worth the money I'd say!",

I must say I am much more impressed with this film.First off it is hard to tell if the story of this movie is a Western, Heist Crime Drama or deep socioeconomic study reflecting the state of affairs in an important part of American society.Script is very good, dialogues are very realistic and characters are developed just enough. No pretentious pressure on the spectator to bond with the protagonists. It is not a story of heroes or villains it is more a study of a situation with realistic characters with a story in it.Pace is slow for fast paced action lovers, but it is in no way bad. It just contributes to highly atmospheric nature of the movie and bursts of tension spice up the flow and fit very well in it.Photography is very good. Not breathtaking or spectacular but still masterful, and you can see the hand of the director and his team in carefully crafting every scene, and everything withing a shot.Scenography is mostly beautiful rural mid-west landscape and boring small towns with their motels, diners, bars, casinos and banks.Acting is outstanding. Especially Jeff Bridges, but I must say every episodic role seemed to me to be acted very good. Even some memorable performances of a couple probably non-professional actors.Sound is great, no dialogue is unintelligible, no music is out of place and action scenes are not much more louder than the rest of the movie.It is really extremely difficult to find any flaw in this memorable accomplishment of the film crew.This movie will make you think. It might explain to you why Trump won the last election. It could even give additional fuel for thinking to the participants of the gun ownership debate in the US. There is only one dishonorable villain this movie points a finger at - the banks.Some people are screaming out loud that there is a giant plot hole in the film cos having found oil on your mortgaged property means there is no motivation for you to get money through all this trouble. THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE TALKING about. Mineral, gas and oil rights are very complicated in mortgage situations and none of the cases are strictly defined by laws. Most cases are regulated on contract by contract basis and in connection with state laws but in most cases contracts favor the lenders and in some cases finding oil can even mean automatic forfeiture of the mortgage to the bank.",

            "content": "Today I'm revisiting Hell or High Water, a neo-western crime drama which follows two brothers (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) who carry out a series of bank robberies to save their family ranch, while being pursued by two Texas Rangers (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham). With a gripping, gritty and overall superb script by Taylor Sheridan, who cameos in the film, he was nominated for an Oscar \"Best Original Screenplay\" and rightfully so. It's one of those scripts that are just amazing in every way. The same is to say about David Mackenzie's direction and bringing the screenplay to the screen. There's suspension and tension in almost every scene, even the more dialogue heavy scenes keeps us engaged. With the writing, Taylor Sheridan wants us especially to care for the characters but also the towns and land. Every character, small like big, is there for a reason. It's easy to fall in love with them, because of the actors who play them but also the writing and rich knowledge Taylor Sheridan have for the genre and country, he makes it so easy to get immersed and that's important. This is fictional but his writing makes it so convincing that it could easily be reality.Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, what a brilliant duo, I'm saying it again and again with their musical scores. True maestros. The soundtrack is also great, with country and rock songs that fits with the film. Music and sound design are on point, brilliant really. Giles Nuttgens served as the film's cinematographer and it's fantastic, beautifully shot and his work is just amazing on so many levels. Jake Roberts was nominated for an Oscar \"Best Editing\" and I can only agree, the editing and pacing of the movie is superb. There's not a single scene that feels like it doesn't belong there, the run time of 102 minutes are perfect, the director uses that length to give us spectacular drama and a memorable neo-western crime story.For me, the reason why this crime story works so well, is because of the actors who are in it. With Chris Pine and Ben Foster playing siblings, who are very different from one of the other but still has this brotherly bond between them. They're acted with such brilliance, I'll say the same about the Rangers who are chasing them. Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham, the former of them was actually nominated for an Oscar \"Best Supporting Actor\". I think Chris Pine and Ben Foster deserved to be nominated too. There's so many memorable performances in this film, both from the leads and supporting cast. But what else is memorable? For me it's the scenes, as so many of them remained in the back of my head, throughout the years since I last watched it. The first scene being one of the scenes I remember the most, I'm of course talking about the series of bank robberies they do in the beginning. Openings like that are what makes movies iconic, just look at Star Wars - A New Hope for an example in iconic openings. Hell or High Water was rightfully nominated for Best Picture in the Academy Awards. With the film being nominated for four Oscars, it was nominated for numerous of other awards. The American Film Institute selected it as one of its ten Movies of the Year.",

            "content": "I was anticipating this movie given the high rating on many review sites but unfortunately came away quite disappointed. It's an okay movie with a decent story and good acting. The story: I found myself thinking too much of \"No Country for Old Men\" while watching this movie. Old part of Texas that still seems like the wild west, bad guy being chased by an old aging lawman. It also had a feel of a western version of \"The Town\". They start out robbing banks and doing it in such a way to keep from getting caught but over time they make mistakes that brings the law down upon them heavily. The movie starts out quite good going right into the action. But it takes forever into the movie for the characters to develop or to get a full understanding of what is happening and why. I've read in other reviews about the great performances by the two main actors that play brothers, but for me they go a bit too heavy on the Texan accents. Chris Pine is barely understandable much of the time and Ben Foster plays the same character he did in \"Alpha Dog\" (Jake Mazursky). I had to guess at the plot throughout much of the movie and there were characters introduced that you never saw again but played a key role... The old lawman (Jeff Bridges) who goes chasing after him with his sidekick reminded me of the relationship between Hank Schrader and Steve Gomez of \"Breaking Bad\" which also has kind of a wild west feel to it. All in all, these characters were not very original and the story line seemed too familiar. There were certainly some good lines and scenes in the movie. But the movie really left me wanting for more. I tried reading all the rave reviews trying to figure out what I had missed and I just don't see this movie as a cinematic great. I've read all the reviews about how it goes into detail of life in middle America that have suffered through this depression and the moral dilemmas when trying to take care of your family. Just an okay movie that I would have preferred to have waited to see at home rather than spend the money to go to the theater and see it.",

Two rangers (Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham) are assigned to solve the series of crimes.In some ways, \"Hell or High Water\" resembles \"Bonnie and Clyde\". Once we know the plight of the robbers, we viewers end up sympathizing with them despite their occasional brutality.The film has a good chase scene in the second half though compared to other past crime capers (of which there are many), the action is more steady than exciting. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The movie's strength is mainly in the dialogues: those between the two brothers and those between the two rangers.The Bridges character is near retirement. He is smart and likeable in some ways but acts like a dumb ass when he makes racial taunts to his long-time colleague whose heritage is half Native American and half Mexican. Birmingham's reactions to the \"teasing\" tells a lot in subtle ways; there is offense mixed with a history of accepting the rudeness. Despite this tension, it is clear the long-time colleagues respect each other.There is an underlying theme that represents our modern times: that many people, like the robber brothers, are living in hard financial times and it is the banks who are regarded as the true villains. It's rather courageous and rare for a modern film to challenge the status quo this way. Add to this the bonus of a cameo appearance by Margaret Bowman as a waitress in a small town dive - someone who seems to have been born in a swamp.",

It uses the backdrop of West Texas, which stretches out as far as the eye can see and is really brought to life by the absolutely masterful cinematography of Giles Nuttgens.That is probably the films biggest strength, in my opinion anyway. The picture is so smooth but with so much edge that it is impossible to not get sucked into the world this film attempts to convey. Every shot in this movie has a story, and is filled with so much detail hidden in plain site that my jaw was dropped for most of the duration.The story is about two brothers caught up in the career of robbing small banks scattered around the small towns of West Texas. Played by Ben Foster and Chris Pine, the relationship of these brothers unfolds in a way that allows us to have an idea of how their relationship has been before the events of the film.That is the magnificence of this film. The way it throws us right into the middle of the story of these characters. It doesn't rely on much exposition either. The film shows us who these characters are and why they are doing what they are doing. The brilliant acting of Foster and Pine make it feel all the more sweeter. Jeff Bridges is as good as he's ever been as the retired turned back cop who comes across the case of the bank robberies. Every other actor in the movie also does a really good job.Hell or High Water is a brilliant crime film set in modern West Texas that feels almost like a 21st century western. It's cinematography and performances, as well as the writing all combine to form an incredibly subtle, yet touching film about family, friendship, and doing what is necessary for the ones you love, even if that means breaking the law.",

Marcus decides the brothers are too smart to take the bills that may explode on them. Marcus also decides the brothers are saving up for something. But what?You will find out why the brothers rob banks, and only take loose cash. And when you find out what they are doing and how they go about it, you will be impressed. It's really very clever. Of course, it's still wrong and criminal, but very clever. This is actually the big twist that Marcus comes close to solving, but cannot prove. The banter between Marcus and Alberto is annoying for the most part especially when Marcus throws insults at Alberto because he is part Indian and part Mexican. I suppose the insults were meant to be comic relief, but they were not funny and really had no place in here. We were not impressed. The banter between the brothers was okay - nothing special - but one must listen carefully as they will talk about the why of what they are doing. It is here you will learn everything.

            "content": "It's interesting to me to see how the current social climate in this country can mold a film into a Best Picture Oscar nominee. I've probably seen this same scenario a number of different times, but the reasoning behind it is what brings Hell or High Water (2016) into a different category. There have been tons of heist films, and often the robbers have a tight connection, like that of brothers. Heck, The Blues Brothers (1980) essentially did the same basic plot but with \"putting the band back together\" as their way of \"saving the ranch.\"Partly because this film seemed so quintessentially Texas, I couldn't help thinking it was a toned down version of another Best Picture Oscar winner No Country for Old Men (2007). With last year's Best Picture Oscar nominee, The Big Short (2015), showing how many honest Americans were swindled by the greed of banks, it's no wonder that this year we would see the more down-to-earth side of this financial fiasco. Not only are these robberies meant to save their home, these brothers also wanted to \"stick it to the man\" that put their family in such dire straits to begin with.In the end, Hell or High Water is a pretty standard plot and it's pretty predictable from the beginning to the credits. However, when the citizens of these towns aren't concerned that their banks are being robbed and they begin to side with the robbers, you know there's something wrong with the society. Granted, this society in Texas was hit hard by the recession, so it's no wonder that they don't trust the banks that are being knocked off. It's realizations like this that help to show why a presidential candidate practically backed by big banking did not win last November.A modern twist to a standard bank heist archetype, I give Hell or High Water 4.0 stars out of 5.",

I didn't quite get it how you have to rob money when oil spills out of your land. Why he can't pay off the land with what the land produces, probably a legal issue not too clear.The characters were pretty traditional, a brainless bad-guy out of jail, a sunny boy chased by smiles of women out of divorce, a sarcastic old white policeman, making fun of his immigrated colleague, of Mexican Indian origins. And that's it. Country scenes are open space, blue skies, some fire and black smoke. Nothing exceptional.So why would I give 8 stars? Well the plot works fine, acting was good, except for some scenes a bit clumsy, like the fat girl in the restaurant, charming a sunny boy, or the scene before the bank, where the two policemen talk about who owns the land, describing the bankers as robbing the properties of people as the colonists robbed the Indians. Pathetic comparison, we hear it since 2008, nothing new since even before 1900.But then the end scene between the retired policeman and the bank robber is so great, so well played and original in terms of words, so true, that it makes this movie stand out.And the blues/country music adds to it too.",

Loved the performances, the characterization, the subtle and poignant atmosphere, and the cinematography. I don't think this would have had a similar effect at all if this was set in downtown Manhattan. Location adds so much to this film. Always knew Chris Pine as the good-looking Wonderwoman's boyfriend but he was so much more in here. Jeff Bridges was also very impactful whenever he appeared on screen. There were many complex and emotive moments - notably between two people like the rangers, Toby and Tanner, Toby and his son...etc. It's definitely one of the most beautifully told bank heist stories ever. The final exchange between Hamilton and Toby was intense but it also showed a level of respect for one another. Toby, a clean man, committing crimes for his children and Tanner, sacrificing his life so that his brother can live. Although the movie was about bank heists, it never felt like it as the heist was just a means to get to the main point - the meaning of fatherhood and brotherhood.",

Two Texas brothers on a bank robbing spree with Texas rangers and other law enforcement in pursuit. There are a few things that make this film stand out from other modern crime films. The motives of the protagonists are unique. They have a plan and a time limit. The locale FEELS authentic.The Production Design and Cinematography (Tom Duffield & Giles Nuttgens, respectively) are GREAT. I was immersed in the story and the world that was displayed on the movie screen. Also...I have to give credit to Nick Cave for the music. I'm not a Country music fan by any means. But all of the music choices worked seamlessly.This movie balances action, tension and drama quite well. There is a pace. And at times, unfortunately, a bit of a languid pace. Especially in the middle of the film. This didn't bother me too much as this gave room for the characters to develop. I cared for all of them. From the major leads to the minor ones who walked in and out of the story. All of them felt real. When the action does pick up again for the climax, was quite impressed.Hell or High Water is on my Top Ten list for 2016. No doubt whatsoever.

Robbing banks to take care of your family makes you the good guys, if you're white, and until you kill someone. Whatever opportunity the movie creates to have a meaningful discussion about the ownership of capital is surely, sorely lost somewhere in the perfectly plaited folds of Chris Pine's grease-bomb hair.It is perhaps rather unfair to watch Hell or High Water and constantly think of better Texas-noir flicks, like No Country for Old Men or The Counselor. Regardless, there are a handful of well- played moments, especially as the townsfolk chase the brothers en masse, posse comitatus. The Howard brothers are playing a dangerous game, seemingly with nothing to lose, because they would rather die fighting for what they believe in than play the crooked capitalists' game.Then again, the whole movie is based on their desire to preserve their childhood home in order to exploit the oil reserves within, which in turn, when burned, will increase the temperature of the planet and kill us all.Who's the good guy now?",

It harked back to some of the feel of 70's thrillers like Thunderbolt and Lightfoot but was its own film entirely. Jeff Bridges is interesting to watch even if he is getting up from a chair! Chris Pine also holds his own. Special mention should go to the cinematography and location work. It really captured the downtrodden locale and empty landscapes well. I also enjoyed a lot of the bit parts in the film, which seemed to be particularly well cast.Ultimately it was just a solid script and direction to match. See on a big screen!",

            "content": "This is an absolute brilliant masterpiece. The fact that this film did not win an Oscar is just beyond me and just goes to show Oscars is more about political and cultural snobbery rather than objectively rating a film. This movie is so good that it made me create this account just to share my take on how good it actually is and how much this film can do. Sicario didn't appeal much to me, but i absolutely love this.Let me start off by saying that the story in the movie is not a \"deep\" story, its not trying to do what Shawshank Redemption did with the story, its not trying to spoon-fed you popcorn, this movie is more about showing some of the best acting you will ever find in a movie. Ever. Its so good your biggest struggle in this film is finding out who does the better job out of the three. The dialogues in this movie is outstanding, i was so hooked on the small talk that in most movies seems redundant, in this movie i was sucking it all up and i was buying it all. The cinematography was great. The acting is incredible. The characters are awesome and they bond so well, you get so committed to these characters you have a feeling they're all your best friends, you have a feeling you're watching a 7 season long TV series, its incredible what this does.This movie is by far the best movie in 2016. One of the best movies of all time in my opinion. The best acting you will ever find. Never liked Ben Foster, considered Chris Pine a Hollywood pretty-boy with a small acting range, my opinion on those two flipped on a plate. They are so great and the synergy between them is off the charts. Jeff Bridges is good 'ole Jeff Bridges. Hes a great actor with character and this role fit him perfectly, he just does what he does best and it comes so natural to him you cant even tell hes acting. He reminded me of a mix of Jeff Bridges in Arlington Road (a very underrated movie ahead of its time sadly) and a bit of Harrison Ford in The Fugitive.Jesus Christ this movie is too good. The story in the movie isn't an invention of the plate, that means everything else has to be great in order for this to be a movie to remember; the acting, the characters, the dialogues, the cinematography its all absolutely outstanding. You have to watch this if you haven't. Incredible.",

            "content": "Jeff Bridges does it again. Another outstanding performance from one of the great actors of our era. Ben Foster is quickly becoming one of the best supporting actors in the business. Chris Pine delivers what I would consider the best performance of his career. The plot revolves around Pine's attempt to divert an endless cycle of poor, West Texans who seem to work their whole lives in a small, blue collar town with nothing to show for their hard work other than a slow, painful death after 50 years of struggle. Pine's character is driven by his love for his two sons and will do anything to keep them from having to work the dehydrated farms that are now a burden to those who own them. This scenario is called out in a great interaction between Bridges and a local rancher herding his cattle during a brush fire. Ben Foster creates a character so deep that you are able to both sympathize with him and yet loathe his actions at the same time. This polarizing performance is full of genuine passion that could have only been garnered by someone who feels true empathy for the character he portrays. The setting in West Texas plays a key role in the movie. The townspeople keep to themselves and support their local boys against big business much like you would see in the Irish communities of movies based in Boston or the African American communities in movies around Detroit, Baltimore, or the deep south. When the brothers start stirring up trouble, the old-timers just keep to themselves and gives the local Texas Rangers the cold shoulder. There are three points that bring this movie down from a 10/10 to a 7/10. First, there is a lack of plot commitment. There are several sub-themes for the movie without one taking the leading line. On the surface level this movie is about a young man trying to do the best for his sons. Sub-plots consist of the relationship between Bridges and his Ranger partner, the relationship between Pine and Foster, small town vs. big banks, and then of course the common crime dramas and westerns. The second part that took this down a point was how the movie spends a lot of time building empathy for certain characters and then forces you to turn on your opinions. When I watch a movie or show, I don't want to feel betrayed by my emotions for characters. Finally, I felt the ending came up short of being definitive. I understand it was left for somewhat of interpretation, but it didn't need to end there. I really hope this wasn't a re- write to allow for a sequel. I think this movie could have easily been a 10-12 episode show on your favorite streaming website. Overall, great acting, a solid story and some great action scenes give us a breath of fresh air during a summer of sequels and remakes. We should all enjoy performances from Jeff Bridges while he is in his prime and revel in watching Foster continue his consistent, solid performances. Pine delivers his breakthrough performance while transitioning from heartthrob eye-candy to a solid, leading man. This is one of the best movies of the summer of 2016.",

Its about two brothers trying to make money by stealing money from banks. Bad boys vs. Police. Its nothing new. My hope was, that the actors would make at least the story better. But doesn't come true at all. The two brother brings an emotional depth into the story that are rare in the genre.I still really like the first half of the movie, which brings back the old western mood. Quiet and unexpected situations. Dialogues sometimes to long but memorable. I loved to watch it but felt bored in the second half.",

            "content": "Taylor Sheridan is one of the most fascinating screenwriters working in contemporary Hollywood, and until SICARIO 2: SOLDADO he had pretty much scripted a trio of very good thrillers that touched on the sharp end of the US political embrace of neo-liberalism. David Mackenzie followed Denis Villeneuve in working closely with Sheridan (who has a small cameo in the film as a disconsolate cowboy), crafting the kind of film that supposedly doesn't getting made in Hollywood any longer: mature, gritty, character-driven and political. Built around three performances that all have deliberate differences in pacing, Mackenzie's considerable technical ability gives Bridges, Foster and Pine the perfect platform to deliver superb character work. What really stands out though, is the way in which the film gives over running time to perfect little portraits of disenfranchised America, from the waitresses who will not give up their tips, nor tolerate dissent from the menu, through to the bank clerk who just wants to get on with their day, this is a film saturated in local knowledge and a strong sense of place. All the more commendable when it is considered that Mackenzie and Sheridan aren't Texans. This is probably Chris Pine's transitional performance, as he shifts from more mainstream pretty boy roles to grittier character work. It is also Bridges best performance in at least a decade, as he gets caught up in just one last chase before retirement. Ben Foster continues to deliver incredible work on the periphery of Hollywood and must now be considered one of the most underrated actors of his generation. This is a film that baldly directs an attack at the greedy neo-liberal capitalism that propels the US relentlessly onwards, and it must go down as the most sustained and strident critique of the banking crisis and its fall-out. It is also a fine heist western, in the mould of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, or THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT.",

            "content": "David Mackenzie's neo-western is a eulogy on the death of the American west and the last of the cowboys. There is a wistful mood and a mournful tone, with a sense of loss at the heart of the piece, and in many ways the film is all about loss - the loss of family, the loss of time, the loss of money, the loss of dignity. It's a remarkably understated crime thriller that uses the architecture of the old cat-and-mouse chase formula to sketch a surprisingly realistic picture of criminality and desperation.A lot of this film's success can be credited to both Taylor Sheridan's lean but muscular screenplay and the wonderful cast of character actors performing his matter-of-fact dialogue. Chris Pine escapes the bland movie star folly of his career thus far and completely disappears under the skin of a wounded farmboy-turned- man-of-the-house, providing the pathos and heart to the story, while on screen brother Ben Foster's fraught energy provides the conflict and volatility. And then there is the ever dependable Jeff Bridges who mumbles and grumbles his way through a performance that feels completely authentic and effortless as he doggedly pursues the brothers while looking every inch the aged cowboy. It's a shame then that his character wasn't given more meat to his bones because, regardless of Bridges' low-key brilliance, the cop-in-pursuit subplot is where the movie is fundamentally lacking. At no point do our sympathies diverge away from the outlaw brothers to the Sheriff, unlike in Michael Mann's 'Heat' where both cop and robber were portrayed in equally sympathetic and interesting ways. Therefore, there is very little conflict within us come the inevitable showdown(s) between them and that robs us of experiencing the full breath of dramatic tension and emotional impact in the third act.There is still much to like in this film, even with a somewhat insubstantial subplot. To think that a simple story about cops and robbers can still work so well in these post-modern audience aware times is actually a testament to its level of craft and execution. I thought everything about the sub-genre had been pretty much exhausted, but 'Hell or High Water' proves, much like Bridges' grizzled performance, that there is life left in this old dog yet.",

Toby ( Chris Pine) lives in Texas, is divorced, has two little boys, his mother just died and to make things worse he is totally broke. He also needs to pay back a loan taken against his ranch. When his brother Tanner ( Ben Foster) is released from jail, both brothers hit upon a plan to rob banks to overcome their financial problems and gift the ranch to the two boys for their future. They carry out a series of bank robberies getting away safely on all occasions. This then is the setting for this movie. But where there are robbers, there will be cops to complete the picture. So Texas ranger Marcus( Jeff Bridges) who is due to retire in three weeks is asked to investigate along with his deputy Alberto, a native American.Director David Mackenzie had a well knitted, taut screenplay in his hands which he has converted into an engaging movie having excellent performances by the three actors. It is a western in a different format. Skillfully photographed to bring out the dusty plains of rural towns of Texas and smartly edited to give it pace, it keeps the viewer engrossed throughout. A few songs are nicely interwoven in the narrative and there are some nice scenes of humour in addition to intense drama. Worth mentioning are the scenes of pranks between the brothers and the teasing of his native deputy by Jeff Bridges. Jeff waits patiently opposite a bank branch to catch the brothers red handed. There is a thrilling, edge of the seat climax to end the gripping story. A few one liners worth mentioning. First,Tanner is fond of beer, so one afternoon he says \" It's now beer'o clock.\" Second, The waitress says keeping in mind the one item menu says \" Order what you don't want !\". And third, on a serious note Marcus mentions \" The things we do for our kids \" which is what this story is about.",

The acting is nothing less than superb: Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster and Chris Pine perform at their best.

When ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is charged to chase them down, he and his partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) find they're having a harder time in catching the cons than they expected.The buzz surrounding this film since it came out has been unbelievable so when I finally got the opportunity to screen this film I was beyond excited, especially considering the talent involved and how much I have loved some of the films that have come out in the post-Western genre, which has come to establish itself in the last decade. \"Hell or High Water\" fits right into the very best the genre has to offer and might even have consolidated this new genre by itself, yet even considering that I must declare myself partially underwhelmed by the lack of adrenaline and drama that I was able to grasp from the film. This is a very solidly crafted movie, but not one that I would personally call a great of the year. I am almost sure that when looking back to this era of cinema in the future and when it will be taught in film schools, \"Hell or High Water\" will be one of those films to be quoted a lot. It really does have an aesthetic that has been prevalent in the last few years: from \"No Country for Old Men\" to \"True Detective\" you can see where the film is coming from, but what is truly remarkable is how this one manages to distinguish itself from everything it came before and establish its own beautiful visual rhythm with some splendid long takes and a very specific color palette that does not deprive itself of bright tones, giving us a look that we have not quite seen done this way before and giving the story new meaning by doing so. One should talk about the four great performances that are at the heart of this picture and how each of the actors manages to disappear in his role with flawless accents, yet what truly sticks out here and what is the takeaway from the feature is just how beautifully it is crafted, how it flows from start to finish without ever giving the audience a moment of dullness even in its very calculated and slow pace and just how incredible the cinematography is, from the great landscapes to the kinetic action sequences, my breath was taken away at what I was beholding. Now, whilst the writing does do a great job in the world-building, giving secondary characters important roles and relevant commentary, in being darkly comedic to the perfect edge and using dialogue to reveal character, I can't help but notice a big void in the emotional connections and payoff the film gives. Just as its landscapes it really is a little stale. Now, Taylor Sheridan is probably the biggest upcoming screenwriter in Hollywood and I owe him nothing but admiration and respect, I only think that whereas is something like \"Sicario\" the archs of the characters were clear and when you were hit with payoffs it carried weight and emotion, here Sheridan's craft leaves you a little behind in feeling or taking away much. Still this is by no means a bad script and MacKenzie's prowess in filmmaking, his sheer power in communicating with visuals is so majestically on display here it is hard to come out without having something to think about.",

Though the film is set in West Texas, it was apparently shot in New Mexico, and to great effect. The flatness of the landscape and its small towns are one of the films best features.",

Want some Texas atmosphere? Watch \"The Last Picture Show\" - which incidentally is set in the very same town as the first two robberies of this movie. Nice, Jeff! Seriously, this movie tries - and fails - to achieve the level of greatness or niche of film legend as those movies previously mentioned. Its a compilation of Texas things we have seen and done before. There is almost no action and what is here you could safely let your children watch on Sunday mornings.There is no furthering of the dialog, plot or even sensibilities. Its as though someone tried to take all the cool parts of bank robbery movies and put them together while making sure they wouldn't be accused of plagiarizing the films that have gone before. Its a safe movie. It entertains but it won't blow you away or make you think. Which is a shame for all involved.",

Although it succeeded in providing a character driven, atmospheric film, it's glacial pacing really began to drag a bit, and the predictable excitement was saved for the climax, per formula, and then it got pretty lively. The Clint Eastwood film Unforgiven came to mind for some reason, after looking at the critical raves that it drew, and the accolades it gathered, it is not one of my favorite westerns, and I do love westerns. Perhaps I have been watching films for too many years, and have a rich trove of favorites with which to compare any of the newer offerings. Maybe old eyes just see things differently. Jeff Bridges is always fun to watch, and the film is otherwise well cast. So I would recommend it, while I go and dig up a copy of Hud, or The Last Picture Show, or something with the Duke.",

No, me either, until I realized that's exactly what I was watching... Story about two bank robbing brothers, Tanner and Toby Howard, raising enough cash to keep the bad bank man from taking the farm. Ya see, they struck oil on that land, not much, but enough to get by. Toby is the smart one, doing bad things for good reasons. Tanner is the wild card, doing bad things just to do bad things, but deep down, doing it for his brother! But coming up quick behind them is the law, Texas Ranger kinda law!! The old sheriff, Marcus Hamilton, just about to retire, and through pretty much intuition alone ends up in the right places at the right times, and with Marcus his Native American partner, Alberto, who is assaulted by the racist humor of the sheriff all day, but deep down, there's a bromance going on! And as Tanner and Toby continue their bank robbing ways, Tanner gets a little cocky takes on a bank full of people, shots fired, they barely escape with their lives, the townsfolk round up an armed posse to go after them chasing them up the road, but right around the corner is the sheriff, because deep down he knew where those pesky Howard boys were gonna strike next leading up to the ultimate showdown between the Texas Rangers and a couple of law breaking cowboys!! So this takes place in modern day, but it had the classic western set up. So if you're looking for a modern day western, go for it, looking for Heat, or Point Break, i'd say probably not.

            "review_title": "A Surprise at the End of the Summer",
            "content": "Hell or High Water kind of snuck up on me. I had seen posters for it since the beginning of the summer and never really paid them any mind. Maybe it was having just seen Chris Pine in Star Trek: Beyond but I felt like I started to see this movie pop up more and more, and my interest grew. Finally having seen Hell or High Water I can say that while it does satisfy, I don't think it lives up to the lofty hype it has accrued.Hell or High Water tells the story of two brothers(played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster) who for reasons stated later in the movie find themselves robbing west Texas banks. They are perused by a near retirement Texas Ranger and his partner(played by Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham), both of whom don't seem to like each other very much. While the brothers use traditional bank robbery techniques such as cleaning the money at a casino and ditching get away cars, they also buck some of the normal bank robbery trends which makes for a more interesting and original movie.The thing that is truly the hands down best part about this movie is the writing. Taylor Sheridan who also penned 2015s Sicario may have somehow outdone his previous work. While I love Sicario, there is very little personality in that movie, not just in the characters but in the overall dialogue in the movie. It all feels a little robotic and plot oriented, well Hell or High Water is almost the complete opposite. This movie is brimming with character, most specifically Texan character. As an east coaster Texas has always sort of been almost a different country to me, and I never really found the whole Texan thing to be in any way endearing, more silly than anything else. Hell or High Water made me change my mind and really have a respect for the Texan attitude. There are so many great lines in this movie, that don't feel added in or punched up. You also get a better understanding of the characters from these little phrases and one liners and the actors seem to give better performances because of it.Speaking of the acting it is for the most part really good. Jeff Bridges is so perfectly cast for this role that you would think this is the way he is all the time. Chris Pine lets himself get a little dirty in this movie and i think he is the better for it. I have been waiting for the role that would show me Pine is more than just a good looking leading man and this I think is his best performance yet. Full disclosure before I get to this next part, I have a problem with Ben Foster. While I have not seen every movie he has appeared in, I can't say I have ever liked him in a movie. That being said he is not nearly as bad as I expected in this. He gets to be crazy which seems to be his only level of acting and even with his over the top southern accent, he is fairly toned down here.The directing of David Mackenzie is pretty unexciting here and I think the movie could have used a few more original ideas as far is directing is concerned, but it really does not hurt the movie. You are shown the events that unfold but there are not any scenes that are incredibly well directed, even when there was the potential for it. The movie is paced really well until the last 15 minutes or so when they can't decide how exactly to end the movie. Overall a pretty good viewing experience that was not often boring and did not feel like took up half of my day.The thing that makes Hell or High Water as good as it is, is that it knows what it is and does not try to become something more than that. It is not a complicated movie or one with a twist, you know where everyone stands at the end of the movie and in a day and age when so much emphasis is put on sequel bating or cliffhanger endings, Hell or High Water smartly avoids this. You are going to get some bank robberies, some shootouts, some cowboy hats and some good ole fashioned Texan charm and all fairly well put together to make a great end of summer movie.",

            "content": "Mackenzie helms his best film to date. Sheridan's screenplay is flawless. This film has excellent direction, cinematography, screenplay, settings, score and acting. Pine, Foster and once again Bridges deliver superlative performances. This is a virtuous drama / thriller set in modern day Texas. Pine and Foster portray two characters at the opposite sides of the spectrum but whose brotherhood outweighs all else. Toby is a divorced honest father and his older brother Tanner is an ex-con. The film starts out explosive as the two brothers set out to commit a series of bank robberies in order to save the family ranch. Toby is in it strictly for his family but Tanner is in for more. He is a thrill seeking reckless outlaw. The brothers pull off a series of daring well planned robberies which catches the eye of a Texas Ranger. Bridges portrays Marcus, a cunning retiring Texas lawman whose seen and done it all. Marcus' innate abilities quickly put him on the trail of the bandits. The brothers have laundered the stolen money, buried the getaway car and returned to the family ranch. They ingeniously have a check made out to the bank that holds a mortgage on the ranch which has now been discovered to be rich in oil. Toby is hell bent on keeping the ranch in the family so that his ex-wife and children can live comfortably. The plan is to now rob one last bank which is a branch of the bank that holds the mortage that they deposited the check into. It is a brilliant duplicit act of justice for the brothers. Eventually Marcus, having the gut instinct to be at the right place at the right time, catches up to the brothers after the heist goes awry and innocent people are killed by Tanner. An epic western showdown occurs with only one brother surviving. Marcus visits the ranch at the end, which is now producing more money in a month from it's wells than all the robberies combined. He has a candid conversation with the surviving brother and the brother suggest they continue their conversation soon which leaves the ending ambiguous. In this viewer's opinion Marcus and Toby will meet up again come hell or high water. It's a masterful examination of the lawless versus the law. This film is intense, gritty, raw, blazing, realistic, violent, poetic, memorable and has a cathartic ending. This is a bravura work of art and one of the finest films in it's genre.",

All the actors were phenomenal. I loved Jeff Bridges performance and everyone else in the cast Gil Birmingham, Chris, Pine, and Foster ... they all had chemistry in their respective roles, even the waitresses at the diner all the characters were believable as real people.

But I have been a fan of Ben Foster's since I first caught him playing a mentally challenged student in the pilot episode of \"Freaks and Geeks\" almost 20 years ago. And he also was stellar here as an ex- con with a grudge and ultimately a death sentence on his agenda.So sit back and watch some modern day \"Old West\" bank robbers tear it up in the good old dusty Southwestern U.S. of A.

So it's kind off ironic that the money stolen from them is going to pay the debt off.Bring in a fab actor Jeff Bridges and throw him into the mix as an old law enforcer and a good story and you can't go much wrong.The film is action packed, a bit of dark humour, a surprise end and it really is a good entertaining film.

They need to come up with a certain amount, and then they'll be done and will no longer have to worry about money \u2014 the family ranch has been found to contain a tremendous amount of oil that would provide an income to the owners of about $50,000 a month. Using multiple vehicles to do their illegal transfer of wealth, Pine and Foster attack the banks early in the morning to minimize resistance and witnesses. But Foster, an ex-con, has a wild streak; and he may be the one to provide the mistake that a Texas Ranger (played by Jeff Bridges) is depending on to get an edge on apprehending the brothers.My most memorable, movie moment of \"Hell Or High Water\" is the scene when Pine and Foster are being chased by armed civilians after the brothers robbed a bank \u2014 this takes place in Texas, by the way. Sick of running, Foster stops his vehicle, grabs a fully automatic assault rifle, and just lights up the vigilantes. It is an awesome display of firepower from just one rifle and one man who knows how to use it.\"Hell Or High Water\" is a good drama/action/suspense movie that will have some people rooting for the bad guys. The constant reminders of unemployment, billboards of \"easy\" loans and debt relief to those desperate for money, and of course, what we know of the government's and big banks' roles in the great financial collapse a few years ago\u0085it's easy to want Pine to get away with what he is attempting. Foster's character, on the other hand, is different animal.**SPOILER ALERT** I would have given this movie higher marks, but the shenanigan of Pine getting away with everything he's done is just too much to let go. The story offers a detailed but unsatisfying explanation as to why Pine remains free at the end, and it just does not ring true. With so much damage done, no way the law would allow this to be swept away and be happy to pin it all on Foster.\u2014 M",

There a lot of moments in this film that are truly beautiful, one moment comes to mind in which Jeff Bridges, restless, gets up out of bed, wraps a blanket around his shoulders, and walks out into the windy road with the blanket fluttering behind him like a cape. It is a stunning image.And this film is full of stunning images. The overall package is satisfying, but there is a lot missing. Too many shots linger on characters as they narrow their eyes in thousand yard stares. It seems like Chris Pine does more posing in this film than a model, while the camera lingers on him and Ben Foster as they say nothing. There is a lot of nothing happening, and that's where the films narrative fat comes from. This is not an exceptional genre picture, there are two interesting set-pieces but not much more in the way of thrills (anyone who tells you this is a suspense movie is exaggerating). But I don't think this is an exceptional drama film either. The characters are paper thin, what resonates more is their interactions, but that has as much weight as quippy dialogue in a buddy cop movie. Even the films message is underwhelming and has been done so much during this decade. Just last year we go 99 Homes and The Big Short. It seems to me that this is the type of movies that critics love. The slow burn genre film with political commentary. They distinguish this kinda thing from regular thrillers, which they dismiss as meaningless fun, by commenting on the fact that these types of films transcend the genre that it is in. For the most part, films that \"transcend genre\" tend to be slower paced, have more artful shots, and have an obvious message like, 'violence is bad.'This film doesn't say anything new about predatory lending, or the death of small towns and small town industries, it just uses them as set dressing.",

They needed to convey the real fear of taking a few rounds - not edging slightly to the comical. The ending comes with a slight twist and a certain fearsome gravitas that makes you think a while. Several smaller roles - the customers in cafes - or a lawyer or banker - are presented by actors who have a command of the style of movie. They add an authenticity to a film based in Western Texas.I recommend it.",

Typically you may look at his portrayal as a little over the top, but I think he nailed it.The movie was the right amount of tense, drama, and interesting.

            "review_title": "Reinvigorating the Western Outlaw, come 'Hell or High Water'",
            "content": "\"3 Tours in Iraq and No Bailout for People Like Us.\" These words, spray painted along the side of a stained brick wall, tell the audience who the villain of Hell or High Water is and where the motivation for two brothers to tear through West Texas towns that are all but deserted. Boarded up storefronts, abandoned gas stations, debt relief and fast cash signs peppered with bullets, sand blasted homes for sale; the vast and sepia toned landscape that is West Texas seems all but abandoned save for these two outlaws, the lawmen that chase them, and the citizens who are protecting whatever they have left.Hell or High Water tells the tale of Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster, respectively), two brothers that go on a bank robbing spree across the plains of West Texas to save their family's land from being seized by the very banks they are robbing. The lawmen charged with hunting the Howard brothers down are a pair of Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). Chris Pine's Toby Howard takes no joy in the path he's chosen in this time of desperation. It's a choice he struggles with and feels guilty for up until the final moments of the film, but the position he's in doesn't provide an easy out to his problems. With the burden of providing for his family and keeping his brother Tanner from going off the reservation, Toby understands that if he falls apart so does the plan to ensure his families safety. Even if it means sacrificing his own. Ben Foster shines as Tanner Howard, the unstable wild card to Chris Pine's careful but calculating Toby. Foster has always excelled as a character actor and his portrayal of the life long West Texas cowboy convict is done so with excellent emotional range and comedic wit that steals the movie away from his little brother, the just as voracious yet clich\u00e9d character of Marcus Hamilton that Jeff Bridges plays, and the emotionally grounded punching bag that is Gil Birmingham's Alberto Parker.The biggest success of the film comes from the comedic back and forth between the competing duos; it provides some much needed levity as you are beaten over the head with the environmental and orchestral storytelling of how desperate the wild plains of West Texas have become in a post-recession world. Foster and Pine's big brother/little brother relationship is believable and relatable through excellent shared storytelling and good natured ribbing. On the right side of the law, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham provide the perfect yang to the bank robbing brothers yin; their particular brand of good natured ribbing is steeped in Marcus's desire to stay attached to the life he's about to retire from and Alberto's desire to show respect to this ranger that he doesn't feel comfortable with but respects and needs to finish this job. Writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario, Sons of Anarchy) figured out how to weave comedy back into an old west style cop & robbers film that takes place in modern day. The banter in Hell or High Water provides the audience with a movie that feels like something old given new life.The characters on screen entice the audience to not take a side, to root for good to triumph over evil and for evil to escape the good. Similar to playing cops & robbers when you were a kid, the audience can easily switch sides after the first act, the second, and the third. To walk away from the experience understanding and appreciating the effort of the filmmakers to make you feel satisfied with the outcome, regardless of who your favorite was.The film also takes care to make the Howard Brothers into West Texas Robin Hoods; a point made clear halfway through the film when the attorney handling the money the brothers steal stating \"to see you boys pay those bastards back with their own money? Well if that ain't Texan I don't know what is.\" Even Alberto, the half-Native American, half-Mexican ranger points out to Marcus at one point, while the pair stake out a bank, that \"a long time ago your ancestors was the Indians. Until someone came along and killed em. Broke em down, made you into one of them. 150 years ago, all this was my ancestors land. Everything you could see, everything you saw yesterday. Til' the grandparents of these folks took it. And now its been taken from them. Except it ain't no army doing it. It's those sons of bitches right there\" as he points to the very bank they are protecting.That's the charm of Hell or High Water. The moments of contemplating the right and wrong of the two outlaw brothers actions. Two other examples of this occur early on in the film; a working mom name Jenny Ann (Katy Mixon) protects the handsome stranger who gave her a $200 tip that's half her mortgage while at the same an old timer (Paul Howard Smith) is trying to make sense of the actions of these outlaws. \"Seems foolish, days of robbing banks, trying to live and spend the money? Long gone, long gone for sure.\" In this film, it's back to basics. Two men, two guns, some getaway cars, and a simple plan.It's that back to basics approach, along with a fantastic original score and soundtrack provided by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, that keeps the tension level high for the entire 102 minutes of the film.Hell or High Water is a thrilling, western crime story about the desperation of the outlaws to save what's theirs and the duty bound lawmen trying to hunt them down. For all the ambiguity and slow pacing of the story, the film ends with a clear winner and loser and leaves you wanting another old west tale.",

Caution for those that have not seen the movie as there are spoilers that follow.If I were a Texas Ranger I would be flabbergasted at the portrayal of their inability to solve the case and find the second bank robber. Here are some pretty obvious clues for the clueless Rangers. Knowing the entire family history, how could the Rangers not stumble on the fact that the family farm was in foreclosure? Foreclosure would have required all sorts of public filings readily available to anyone who looked. Even the Midland Bank officer comments on the timely last minute payoff of the loan and back taxes. One look at the check from the casino, made out to the bank, would have solved the crime as there are countless camera in casinos, particularly at the cashier windows.In the shootout with the townies, Tanner strolls down the middle of the road firing an automatic weapon that rips into the townie vehicles. There are at least 10 armed men who never get off even a shot despite Tanner taking the time to drop his clip and reload, twice. The townies are shown running around their vehicles instead of taking cover and returning fire. What an insult to the armed gun loving males of Texas. Ballsy enough to give chase but so inept in the use of their weapons as to lack any credence.While chasing Tanner, is it possible that all the townies and all the cops didn't get the license plate of the getaway truck before it explodes in flames? That piece of info would have led the Rangers to the used car lot where Toby takes the truck for a test drive linking him to the crimes.And finally, the Rangers KNOW that a waitress in the diner just prior to the 2nd robbery and a table of three men can identify Toby while he was in the diner. One of the men even describes what Toby looked like (cowboy-like) to Marcus Hamilton (Bridges) . Hello? The plot is so incredible that it compromises the ridiculous ending to a slow moving character study of some of the dumbest characters in the history of westerns.And before you get all misty about the amazing West Texas scenery, not a single shot of the movie was filmed in Texas.",

In a reverse mortgage, the owner is payed a monthly amount BY the bank (rather than paying money TO the bank, as in a regular mortgage), while continuing to live in the home. At the end (usually based on the death of the owner), the home becomes the property of the bank. In this case, the family had a brief window in which to buy back the home, after the death of the owner, which was to expire within a few days of the robberies (hence the rush to get the money).Of course, the goal of the buyback was not to \"save the farm\", but to have the family gain from the very lucrative oil lease payments.",

But, it's not the only thing. There are endless number of great films with plots that either make no sense, are hyper-inflated, are just plain silly or are just not plot-dependant. In the end, it doesn't matter, because story-telling is not about plot.

Each set meets the same fate, and we're left with a set that may have finished their jobs but are not really done yet.Highlight of the movie includes the cinematography (it's nice to see America beyond the usual NY or LA backdrops, reminded me of 2013 Best Picture nominee 'Nebraska') and the banter between the characters of Best Supporting Actor nominee Jeff Bridges and his American Indian sidekick Gil Birmingham.",

This film reminds me of the good old days when movies used to have balls, it gets straight to the point from the get go but at the same time give enough time to develop it's characters. The cinematography captures the roughness of the American south and even though I know for a fact that this film is going to get no love from the academy awards but This cinematographer deserves some attention. On the other end of the camera Mackenzie manages to pull out some great performances from his cast, especially the always underused and criminally underrated Ben Foster who manages to completely steal the show here, Chris Pine who plays the good Brother gives a career best performance imo, managing to show some acting range. Jeff Bridges plays a racist cop on the verge of retirement, I really liked the way his character is developed and the interactions between him and his half Native American half Mexican partner. I think this is probably the best film I saw this year, It works so well on every level thanks to a solid script, top notch performances and McKenzie's brilliant direction, he is a really good under-appreciated director check out his previous films especially Perfect Sense and Starred Up.",

But the reason it was really good was made even more clear that it was the work of an ambitious team of producers that truly had an end in sight and decisive means to get there through a deliberate plot guided by action-packed scenes and great dialogue. Jeff Bridges did his normal overacting, which is a great method for an anti-hero sheriff whose character was written as though it was made for a Clint Eastwood.

            "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed Hell or High Water.A modern day western of sorts, it masterfully mixes American folklore with the realities of today. Set in present-day Texas, this movie follows the brothers Toby and Tanner as they rob a number to banks, laundering the money at a casino to eventually pay off the existing debt on their family ranch, recently identified as containing rich oil beneath. The landscape is barren, and the only real colour is the billboards along the roads advertising debt refinancing and bank services. Even when the brothers succeed in robbing several banks, many civilians applaud them, or refuse to give a description to the investigating Texas Rangers, because they side with these men over the heartless banking corporations.These Rangers, Marcus and Alberto, follow the robberies with a cynical eye, doing their best to anticipate the brothers' next move. They are the modern day Lone Ranger and his sidekick Tonto to the Jesse and Frank James robbers of Toby and Tanner. Every resident, waitress, cattle rancher or otherwise bemoans his or her station in life, granting sympathy or respect to these brothers who, as it is eventually revealed, want to secure the ranch for Toby's sons. In one scene, Toby (Chris Pine) admits to his elder son that his own actions shouldn't be emulated, but that he wants his son to create a new path in life. Alberto expresses his derision of how his people (Native and Mexican Americans) had been marginalized and forgotten, and now, thanks to banking greed, most Americans face the same fate. Toby sees his destructive looting as a way to finally move his own family out of financial hell and into new freedom. The ethical waters become quite muddy as violence increases with each robbery, but both brothers stay the course.As with any idealistic plan, things don't end quite so happily. The Lone Ranger, days away from retiring, loses his steadfast partner, Tonto, in a shoot-out. Tanner, the more reckless of the James Brothers sits atop a desert cliff for once feeling he is king of the plains, like a Comanche, only to catch a bullet through his temple. Toby grinds onward, securing the ranch home for his sons and estranged wife, while Marcus knows he is complicit in the carnage left behind the robberies and shooting deaths. There are no easy answers in this film. Where is the country financially and how do people get out of the hell they are in? How does a cattle farmer still have to deal with wildfires in the 21st century? This anachronism is as out of place and time as Jesse James and the Lone Ranger are, and yet it is a reality. There is no pretty bow to wrap things up completely, but the story, brought to life with wonderful performances by Pine, Foster, Bridges and Birmingham, is well worth the ticket price.",

Also, no silly car chases and people being hit 20 times and still standing. This movie was a breath of fresh air and I wish other directors would take note - not all of us are kids. The average becoming adult now must think cars can survive the chases they go, through blow up as soon they touch anything, or people with guns can shoot a penny/cent a mile off with a pistol. So much cow dung out there!You felt for the criminal and the lawman in this film. I am so glad I watched it. Please let see some more of this director ' David Mackenzie'Acting was spot on and accompanied by some dark humour.I do like action, but real action that could be possible, believable, not the likes of Bourne, fast and furious, they are well past there sell by date.

            "content": "Hell or High Water is a solid film that I believe many people will enjoy and relate to.PROS:\nGood acting. Good casting (mostly). Decent writing. Great action scenes! Good cinematography. Good character development. The old man (with a gun in the bank) made my day! You readily understand each character and their moral compass. Overall this is a very good package. I grew up in a major city. Yet the film is so well done, I quickly related with every character even though I have never experienced living in rural America.CONS:\nPace is a tad too slow in some scenes for my taste, which could have been corrected by removing a little time from the final cut. I also think they spent too much time showing the bond between the brothers at their home. It was more like reading a book where you need detailed descriptive scenes to imagine the moment. Thanks to the writing direction and acting, I quickly understood the Meir relationship and I became emotionally vested in their dynamics. I did not need constant drawn out reminders of the brothers' nuanced relationship. After a while, I wanted to tell the writers \"Okay! I get it! They are much closer now and there is some negative history there. Can we please get on with the movie?\" Great films with similar pacing would be the old 1960s Bonnie and Clyde movie, Cool Hand Luke, or No Country for Old Men. These hit the mixture of pacing on the head.This film is definitely worth watching. I did not feel like I was cheated out of my time or money. For me, the rating is a tough call between seven and eight stars. Shawshank Redemption, Saving Private Ryan, No Country for Old Men, Terminator 2, etc., are the films I rate as nines and tens. This film is close, but not quite at that level. However, it is still a very good film.Therefore, this film is a seven or eight, which is still very good on my scale. I try not to give away nine and ten star ratings like candy.If you prefer films filled with non-stop gun-play and carnage, you may not like this one as much as I did. If you appreciate good writing, and a decent amount of action, especially toward the end, you should enjoy this film.",

What results is truly riveting with each lead getting proper treatment as both Pine's character and Bridge's character converge. When they do finally meet, it's cinematic gold. Some clich\u00e9s hold back the characterization just a bit (all banks are evil, all Texicans are gun toting nuts, poor people are always held down by \"the man\") but they in no means derail the movie.A must watch if you're a film fan.",

            "content": "Hollywood Westerns are not gone, they just underwent a new tone and identity to fit with the times. We do not see any more of those shoot-em-ups against the \"Injuns,\" but instead a blurred line between sheriff and outlaw. Yet most noticeable of all, it takes place in the here and now, rather than the turn of America's economic structure.Hell or High Water, written by Sicario's Taylor Sheridan, shows some of those gritty details that breathe life back into the shallow, feel- good classical genre. Here, we see what Texans under the law truly act like: they use a bulldozer to bury their P.O.S. car under dirt to hide any evidence, and they throw their chips in poker to increase their luck, all with the right rationalizations explained about their backstories to help you understand their turmoil. The two black-masked thieves we focus on here, played by the greatly underrated Chris Pine (Into the Woods, Star Trek) and Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma, The Messenger), make a living out of hopping from bank-to-bank as the only means to financially secure themselves. You normally wouldn't want to care for a couple of crooks like them, but once you learn their background, you'll understand.Sheridan's plot is not a terribly original concept for a modern-day cowboy movie, virtually copying the same tone and concept as the brilliant No Country for Old Men. This Western only sets itself apart from others by its lack of international relationships.Even so, the hearts of all the men living here will haunt you. Each of them abuses their second amendment rights, even the filthy-rich passerby at the gas station carries firearms at all times. The town by no means chose to side with these crooks, especially not the near-retiring sheriff, played with a compellingly rich voice by Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Crazy Heart). Despite his wishes, he sets off a cat-and-mouse chase to restore integrity to these disturbers of the peace. Think of it like a Bonnie & Clyde type of thriller, except without the fun, gore, and romance. Or better yet, a Thelma & Louise type of criminal's sympathy story, except without any strong female characters.Yeah, hate to break it to you: Westerns today still don't contain enough girl power like we'd expect from them by now. The female characters are either dead mothers we never meet, moral support for the main characters, or bankers who get harassed by the two crooks. If these otherwise talented actresses were made somehow more active, then greater dimension would have been added to make the script strike closer to home.Although the widely unnoticed director David Mackenzie deserves recognition for his compelling creation of Texas' true culture. In his view of the dead south, automobiles display the ultimate sign of one's wealth, and oil mines can be found in an average man's backyard. Although everything looks like the everyday mundane life for these inhabitants, several signs still connect Mackenzie's imagined world with the works of John Ford. A field fire seen in the distance from behind a herd of frightened cattle heightens the highly-saturated look of the picture, and the dusty texture of the art direction reflects the complexion of the men unqualified to protect the people. You even get a new take on the classic showdown between sheriff and outlaw- with a new psychological twist.Hell or High Water will last as one of those pictures made by men from the old days for men from the old days. Not everyone will come out from the experience satisfied, but for the thinking-type of viewer, Mackenzie's new take on a familiar concept will knock 'em out dead.",

I was hoping for a little more than just a cut and paste job from other films. We've seen so much of this countless times before and for me this just didn't stand above any of the other heist/chase films. One of the biggest issues for me was that the film requires so much suspension of disbelief in order for you to go along with what's going on that by the time it hammers its point home you just don't really feel emotionally invested. It's still good; the acting is solid and the cinematography is stunning, there are a few funny moments and what little action there is is well handled but overall I didn't think it was extraordinary like some other people have, so my advice is if you like the trailer, watch it, if the trailer didn't entice you then don't rush to it.",

Warnings against usury go back to Exodus 22:24, and there are dozens of other scriptures with the same message._Hell or High Water_ addresses the effects of usury in a parochial setting (rural West Texas), but considering the mortgage crisis of 2007-08 and the ensuing market crash and government bailout, it delivers a universal message that we non-members of the \"one percent\" can all relate to.Therefore, we have a large degree of sympathy for the two brothers who rob branches of the bank that is about to foreclose on their ranch, to raise enough cash to pay the place off. Both actors, Chris Pine and Ben Foster, are perfect in their roles. They're an odd couple: Pine's character is thoughtful and cautious, but Foster is manic and likes robbing banks a little too much.On the other side, there is another odd couple, the sheriff and his deputy--ironically, a cowboy and an Indian--who are chasing the robbers around west Texas but are always one step behind. Jeff Bridges, as the older, wizened, close-to-retirement sheriff, has never turned in a better performance. And Gil Birmingham, as his half Mexican / half Native American partner and foil, grabs us from the first scenes and keeps us hanging on. We like him so much, we suspect that he's going to be a tragic character, and we're right.There are shades of _Bonnie and Clyde_ and _No Country for Old Men_, but this film stands firmly on its own, due its depth of characterization and its political message. It's not about crime; it's about people who are victimized by a merciless system.Extra kudos for the supporting cast: Katy Mixon as a saucy waitress in a Texas cafe, Margaret Bowman as the most obnoxious waitress of all time, and Buck Taylor as the old man in the bank who tries to shoot the robbers as they escape.In some movies, it seems that the actors know they are doing something memorable, and they perform to their utmost ability. This is one of those occasions.I guess there's there's no such thing as a perfect movie, but this one comes damn close. Everything is here: Intelligent scripting, great acting, emotional impact. You will not be disappointed. The ending is amazing!",

Yet, his character seems to be unaware that he is part of the machinery that keeps the status quo in place. While Bridges sits on the front porch in an old wooden chair, his partner asks what he's doing, and Bridges replies, \"I'm practicing my future,\" by which he means his soon to be retirement.

Then reality set in, I recalled SO many roles like his through the ages that never did, they were just accepted for what they were. Great actors that were under appreciated. Then I thought... well.... the \"award\" is for \"best in THAT year\"? and if \"they\" keep creating junk as they do, well, sure then, hey...

And that's true friendship right there.\nAnd when his partner gets shot at the end, damn.. I felt that loss. And the shock and sorrow was written all over Bridge's hard edged face as if it were real, with a dishevelled manner and appearance shortly after the incident only solidifying the performance as a whole.Also includes one of the better ending for this type of film.\nInstead of leaving us with a predictable gun-firing last showdown, we have a mild and civil conversation between the two remaining protagonists (rivals) - one retired and mourning his friend and partner, the other mourning his brother and racked with guilt. Both now have nothing to lose. Both willing to avenge the death of someone they were close to.\nIt's a possible future showdown that we, the audience, don't need to witness.I love a film that's this good which can also surprise me along the way.",

I've shown this film to at least 10 people and everyone has said they thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch again. Ben Foster has been one of my favorite actors for a couple years now and he is fantastic in this movie as the Alpha type of brother who can't help but always pick a fight. Jeff bridges and Gil Birmingham are hilarious together, their chemistry was surprising but refreshing in a movie that I was not expecting any humor from.

            "content": "This one has all the bases covered: well written, well paced, well shot, well acted. It doesn't even overstay its welcome and ends at just about the right time. An almost complete absence of a heavy hand anywhere, down to the score which does the best thing it can do and blends right in. No attempt is made to overstate anything, and the scenes flow from one to the next with a masterful hand keeping the rhythm. The standout moments will depend on what each viewer reacts to, whether it be the scenery, the action setups, the comedy relief or the human drama. It's all there to be found, thanks to solid performances and good editing. I would argue that Chris Pine delivers more than anyone had a right to expect and almost steals the show. But the overall standard of acting is good enough that every interaction feels genuine and each character pulls more than his weight. You could argue that the experience lacks a little sparkle, and it certainly feels a galaxy away from the avalanches of special effects and color explosions we have had to endure. But the complete absence of glitter suits a movie so uncompromising. The land is hard, it's people are tough, the choices are difficult. The movie makes the right one and builds on people and their struggles and not on the fireworks. As such I expect it will satisfy mature audiences more readily. Having said that, some fireworks do go off, and quite the impact they have too. One thing to note is that some viewers will struggle to understand some of the dialogue, simply because of the accents and pronunciation. It takes a while for the ear to adapt and settle.More than anything though this movie is an ode to Texas and the far West, to the survival of a resilient people through adversity, and to the classic Western. You could see a bank robber fleeing on the highway with cars chasing him, or you could see a posse of vengeful gunmen galloping after an outlaw. The drought is financial, the old mine spews oil and the riders mount trucks, but the deal never changed: gold or lead.",

Who really carries the bulk of the blame for this movie not rising to what it could have been falls squarely between the writing and, perhaps moreso, the directing. I mean, I get it, very few filmmakers are the Coen brothers, but sometimes imitation, while still flattery, also only serves to remind the audience how far you've fallen from the real thing.

By robbing banks, the bank line that is trying to steal their farm.Hot on their trail is the old weathered Texas Ranger with near psychic powers, Jeff Bridges in a solid performance.Look for spunky Katy Mixon, unzipped for tips, playing the flirty diner girl who takes a shine to the Pine.

            "content": "Hell or High Water is a very good film, but it isn't for everyone. Everything from its dialogue heavy scenes, to its casual, calm pacing could alienate many viewers. Director David Mackenzie navigates a relatively simple story with highly complex characters very effectively. Hell or High Water is the type of film that doesn't drag you along with it, you choose to go along and can get off at any time, but by watching the whole movie will prove much more rewarding.The direction is impeccable, as it showcases the beautiful but scary American desert and explores the evil actions of men who aren't necessarily bad people simultaneously, creating a powerful and interesting atmosphere throughout the film. Great cinematography helps create this atmosphere, while also generating the tense and exciting scenes that make this movie very strong visually.The acting is stupefying from all members, in particular Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges. They bring to life the three dimensional characters that shine on screen, and bring the vivid story to life. The screenplay is very strong, with particular praise having to go to the originality of it. On paper, it seems like another bank heist gone wrong type of movies, but it really isn't, thanks to the proficient acting and suburb character writing. There are some issues however. It was a very dialogue heavy film, which is fine, considering the dialogue was very good. But it sometimes seemed inaudible what they were saying, or it became easy to tune out what the characters were saying, even though it was important to the story. Perhaps it was a bad sound mix, or the southern drawls were too thick, or the fact that Jeff Bridges was in it, but it was far too easy to miss the dialogue which ended up effecting the overall quality. The pacing was also a bit of an issue. It was very different from most films, and was quite relaxed for a lot of the film, which led to a few dull scenes in the middle. On top of the mumbled dialogue, the pacing made the story more complicated than it needed to be. None of this, however, deterred how good a film this was. Hell or High Water had an amazing screenplay with terrific direction to bring it to life. The originality of this heist gone wrong story and its excellent acting and cinematography make it a stand out film. Some poor pacing and inaudible dialogue dragged Hell or High Water, but it still came out on top.3.5 / 5",

This is a modern western that revolves around two brothers (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) who try to save their farm from the bank, and an old grizzled lawman (Jeff Bridges) who tracks them to a bloody finale. Foster is the crazy one, who has done a lot of time and is reckless beyond all reason. Pine is the seemingly stable, law-abiding brother who is trying to keep the farm for his children, and is the mastermind. We are thrust into the bank-robbing action at the start, and it takes awhile to figure out what they are doing. In the meantime we are introduced to Bridges and his partner Alberto, engagingly played by Gil Birmingham, as their sleepy routine is interrupted by a string of robberies. There is nothing new in the action--except perhaps the rather open-ended conclusion--but the whole of it is done so well (acting, directing, cinematography) that it is a pleasure to see it get some traction at the box office.

This movie is slow paced but gives us a great insight into lives of people living in the rural Texas, USA. As someone coming from Europe, fact that almost all citizens carry guns with themselves at all times is both intriguing and terrifying. Would you feel safe, for example, drinking at a bar knowing every customers has a loaded revolver at their side? Although not as good, or as complex, as Sicario, this movie makes me want to look out for any new releases written by Sheridan. Direction (David Mackenzie, known for Starred Up) is very solid as well. In my opinion, ending is well executed as well as all the action sequences.In the end, I would recommend this movie.",

Hell Or High Water manages to tell quite the compelling story despite trudging through the usual Western tropes thanks to a brilliant script written by Taylor Sheridan that fully fleshes out the characters thanks to the necessity of their actions being pushed forward due to dire circumstances. Chris Pine gives the best performance of his career and Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster follow closely behind. The music brilliantly sets the mood for a western Texas ravaged by depression and characters that aren't happy with their lives, I'd highly recommend listening to the score. The sound design and the shoot-outs and set pieces within the film are beautifully crafted almost as beautiful as the film's stunning choreography. Overall, despite the occasional trope or stereotype this film manages to do largely everything right as a film and is definitely one of the better westerns I've seen in recent memory.",

However, the way the movie started, who would have thought this movie would slow at all. It is not full of action; it is a movie with very good dialogue and a simple plot. They need money to secure a life for their loved ones, and they ain't gonna earn it by working! When the movie starts, you think it's gonna be the wild wild west. Then it turns to this thought provoking, moody movie. The movie becomes a vehicle for the sheriff \u2013 Jeff Bridges. He's a better actor in his older age. All the actors are excellent. Chris Pine's range is a surprise. Ben Foster is great as usual. His Oscar day is coming. Nevertheless, make no mistake, this is a vehicle for Bridges and he delivers. The movie has great action when it has action, great dialogue first and foremost, and pretty good cinematography. However, it's being held back by the pacing and the ending. The movie should have gone all the way, a little more action, a little more suspense, danger and an ending that shows instead of imagines. A final showdown would have been nice.

The fact, that every male from young to old is not only carrying a gun, but also willing to make use of it, is fascinating and scaring me at the same time. \"Hell or High Water\" is set in a world, where everybody could be killed out of nowhere by some random guy, you happen to bump into at the gas station. Every character in this movie has an aura of suppressed aggression, that is just waiting to be given a valve. The astonishing thing is: Nobody is actually questioning that and realizing the consequences, that come with this situation. Quite the contrary is true: Even the Texas Rangers, who are tasked with law enforcement, have no problems with civilians trying to hunt down heavily armed and dangerous bank robbers. They even borrow a weapon from them, if their own equipment appears not to be suited for the situation. In that sense, this movie is a fascinating insight into the nightmare, the American Dream has turned into. It reminded me strongly of \"Out of the Furnace\" from a couple of years ago. Both movies deal with self justice and governmental institutions, that fail to protect the weakest of society. Which in return leaves them no other option than taking matters in to their own hands. Based on the positive reactions to this movie, I assume, that American audiences really appreciate, how this movie depicted contemporary America. A story like this could never unfold in the same way in Europe. That alone makes \"Hell or High Water\" well worth a watch, because it does something, that all great movies should do: It opens a door into a world, you otherwise could not experience in your own life. Put this together with great performances and a fantastic cinematography and you have all the ingredients for perfect film experience.",

The music is good too which is why i say this is a well put together film and well acted by Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges. Now i get to the down side. I feel the film was slow paced, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but without much in the way of suspense i felt it was a little boring at times. The main hook of the film is really the relationship between the two brothers, the rest is pretty much standard bank heist type stuff. There are a few humorous moments throughout the film which gave a bit of comic relief from the pretty heavy story line but overall i felt a little disappointed.

Mackenzie's direction matches perfectly. The film is tense, and often times darkly humorous. It's not an overly violent film, but the moments of violence explode off of the screen. I also feel compelled to mention the wonderfully De Palma-esque opening sequence. This film reminded me of the American New Wave in many ways.

Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster have been in roles in like this before and they continue to be the embodiment of actors who love their profession. The true surprise of the film is Chris Pine. I've always liked him in his other films. However, it seemed he was becoming a typecast actor with action and comedy films. He was truly remarkable and more than held his own against Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster. He most definitely shot to A-list status. This film deserves Oscars all around, from the screenplay to the actors. Can not wait to see this film again.",

Like many classic westerns it is written so well with just enough words for the actors to work their craft, it seems effortless as the story unfolds. Years from now I shall play the DVD and still enjoy it. Chris Pine and Ben Foster have quickly become indicators that a movie is worth paying to go see. Both have an excellent body of work in different genres. Beau Bridges has been so for quite a while now. All the bit parts are well played so that this movie has nothing in the way of weak links or flat spots. Gotta love the grumpy old waitress. And Ben Foster is absolutely the right age if anyone is planning a movie about Custer. Aside from being a western Hell Or High Water plays nicely alongside 99 Homes, Money Monster and Killing Them Softly. All these films are concerned with Americas economic problems and peoples feelings of despair and abandonment. Crime is usually the solution closest to hand. The movie drives through run down Texas towns with scenes of failed businesses, while Foster and Pine crack wise in the style we liked so much in the first Magnificent Seven film. Think of Brad Dexter and Steve MacQueen. The soundtrack follows the images beautifully, the tone of Hell Or High Water is pitch perfect and I haven't met anyone yet with a bad word to say about it.",

            "review_title": "Brotherhood's Role in Humanity",
            "content": "FAMILY. THEFT. JUSTICE.Hell or High Water can be summarized by these three words. Directed by David MacKenzie, Written by Taylor Sheridan, and starring veteran actors Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Gil Birmingham this film was nominated for four different Oscars and received multiple other awards from various film festivals. Taylor Sheridan's original screenplay was one of the aspects of this film nominated for an Oscar and it was deservedly so. Every piece of dialogue in this film is essential either to the characters' development, further enriching the world the film takes place in, or helping to keep the plot moving forward. An interesting aspect of the writing for this movie is that many of the best lines are in fact ad-libbed and Sheridan purposefully left many scenes open-ended in order to allow for the actors to add their own flare to the characters. When a writer does this, it can either take the film to an entirely new level or sink its chances of every getting off the ground. Much to the relief of the filmmakers and joy of the fans of this movie, the scenes that do sport unplanned dialogue only complement the lines written. Chris Pine and Ben Foster star as Tanner and Toby Howard respectively, two brothers who were forced to grow up depending and protecting one another from their harsh reality. Taking inspiration from classic Western leading men, Chris Pine plays Tanner Howard as a closed-off, cautious, desperate man who says more with his body language and facial expressions than with his voice. Ben Foster embodies Toby Howard as the exact opposite of his little brother, a recently freed felon who is completely comfortable with who he is and indulging in every whim that crosses his mind. After spending every last cent his family didn't have on treating their mother's cancer, Tanner is desperate to keep the family ranch out of the hands of greedy bankers looking to seize upon his family's misfortune. This desperation is furthered by the discovery of liquid gold, oil, on the property and Tanner realizes that if he doesn't pay back the loans owed to the bank, his sons will be forced to live in the same poverty he and his brother grew up in. Together they come up with a plan to rob branches of the very bank threatening to take their land and after they successfully complete their first robbery they are set on a collision course with the two other main characters of the story. Jeff Bridges takes on the role of the gruff, shrewd Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton, a man staring down the long, lonely barrel of retirement forced upon him by his superiors. Bridges masterfully steps into the literal cowboy boots of Hamilton, bringing to life not only the aging Ranger's desire for one last hoorah but also showing the character's calculating lawman side honed by years of facing the worst of humanity. Gil Birmingham fills out the main cast as Texas Ranger Alberto Parker, the long-suffering half Comanche, half Mexican partner to Bridges' Hamilton. Birmingham and Bridges play well off of each other, the banter between them coming across as not only natural but believable. Ranger Parker is the assigned partner of Ranger Hamilton and finds himself having to deal not only with Hamilton's off-color jokes regarding his heritage but the man's assured nature stemming from the Ranger's many years of experience. Taking his barbs good-naturedly, Parker gives just as much as he gets and although he butts heads with Hamilton, he respects the man and his knowledge of how to anticipate the criminals' next move. These two sets of brothers are set on a colliding course, one defined by blood, the other defined by friendship and mutual respect and the only way it ends is with blood. After successfully robbing a number of banks, the Howard brothers come across the last bank they will need to hit, the largest of their list of targets. Unfortunately for all of those involved, they charge in while the bank is packed with patrons. As they rush to grab the cash they will need to complete their plan, a security guard they don't initially see and an armed citizen shoot at the brothers, prompting Toby to kill both men and drag his shell-shocked brother out of the bank with the bag of money. Finding themselves surrounded by armed Texas residents, the brothers evade capture but not before Tanner is shot in the side. After an emotional goodbye, the brothers separate, Tanner going to exchange the money at an Indian Casino across the state line in Oklahoma while Toby leads their pursuers on a wild chase through the Texan wilderness. Rangers Hamilton and Parker arrive on the scene as Toby uses his higher vantage point to rain down rifle fire on those chasing him. In the crossfire, Ranger Parker is shot and killed instantly with a shot to the head. Seeking justice, Hamilton jumps into a truck with one of the locals still chasing after the Howard brothers and enlists his help in flanking Toby. With his full attention kept in front of him, Toby doesn't realize the danger at his back until it is too late. Taking a 500 yard shot, Ranger Hamilton shoots Toby through the head, killing him where he sits. Both Tanner Howard and Marcus Hamilton are forced to deal with the deaths of their brothers, living in grief and feeling as though they no longer have any reason to carry on. Tanner pays off his family's debts and the land is saved, oil drills quickly popping up to pull up the source of his family's salvation. Now officially retired, Marcus can't ignore the fact that the case will forever go unsolved so he resolves to pay Tanner a visit. What follows is one of the best acted and most tense scenes in the film as both men, both of whom have lost so much to each other, discuss the aftermath of everything. With the arrival of Tanner's ex-wife and sons the tension is broken temporarily, until both men promise an end to their entanglement should the other wish to visit where the other lives, gun in tow. Family drives many to do things they never thought they would do. The theft and changing of hands of the land, from the Native Americans to the homesteaders responsible for helping settle the United States, to the farmers and landowners being forced to foreclose and return the land they poured their blood, sweat, and tears into back to the bankers who loaned them the money for said land. Finally, the justice of taking the life of the man who killed one's own brother, an eye for an eye, a life for a life. David Mackenzie, Taylor Sheridan, and composers Nick Cave and Warren Ellis craft an incredible tale of just how far two brothers are willing to go in order to provide for their family and the two brothers willing to stand up for the law. Everything about this film fits together seamlessly, from the direction to the writing to the use of music and song to help portray the emotions seen on screen, Hell or High Water is a stark look at what it means to be human and how much or a role brotherhood plays in defining humanity.",

Bleak scenery telling an intriguing backstory that tugs at viewers sympathies. A \"last job gone wrong,\" involving death and conflict. Stop me if you've heard it all before. I feel like I have.There's nothing terribly original here, nor is there anything terribly bad either. It's an average movie with decent acting, unoriginal (and often way too slow) dialogue, and an ending that leaves you wanting much more, like a final act that seems promised but never arrives.

Similar to Fargo and No Country for Old Men, this film completely nails the landscape (although filmed in similarly looking New Mexico), along with the charm of its people, albeit sometimes sarcastic charm. I loved Sicario, so being penned by the same writer, he deserves some tangible credit as both are solid, captivating, character driven films. I actually laughed a lot and didn't really expect it watching the trailer. There are so many original and heartfelt funny scenes in the film that don't feel forced or contrived, but truly genuine. ALL the actors were perfectly cast and did an outstanding job. Katy Mixon and Gil Birmingham really stole the show for me. Some of the pacing was a little off at times, and the backstory could have been a little more fleshed out, but overall, this was a beautifully shot, beautifully acted and original film that should be seen and remembered...especially considering the endless dross that's stained the retinas of late.",

So, this film has something to say about that, which I could relate to.There was a road trip aspect to the movie, which I also liked. This reminded me of my own journeys along the Texan highways, and although I've never been west of Austin in a car, I really appreciated some of the scenery shown here.The characters are all strong. Many people here mention the great jobs done by Ben Foster, Chris Pine and, of course, the always-watchable Jeff Bridges. However, fair credit must also be given to Gil Birmingham, who played Bridges' put-upon partner. I had downloaded this movie on Amazon Prime as something to watch on the train but I wished I'd seen it first in the cinema. The Western does seem to be making a comeback and if they can't be laugh-a-minute (e.g. The Hateful Eight) then they need to be intelligent and observant, like this one! I think it has something to say about the consequences of violence as well, although the writers are smart enough to leave things hanging so that you have to draw your own conclusions about the rights and wrongs of what the characters did.But very nice effort!",

You get to see the perspective of 2 criminal brothers against 2 ball busting rangers. The relationships between the characters makes this movie what it is, they all feel so real and carry so much weight. I really enjoy the story of the movie, it is simple yet effective and done very well. Everything is believable and it isn't one of those magical movie worlds where actions don't have consequences. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for something to watch, it will not let you down. Perfect length as well, it is wrapped up exactly when it needs to be and addressing everything it needed to. I simply have no complaints, 10/10!",

            "content": "This movie is very enjoyable. It is, however, not as stellar as I expected from the glowing reviews and raves. Maybe it's because I am from West Texas, where this movie is centered, and the way Hollywood thinks this place works is only a few notches ahead of your average Western. Jeff Bridges is excellent, although his character swerves into caricature a time or two (or three). The plot is good, maybe a little too simplistic when its all said and done. Bridges Texas Ranger is a little too racist, even when they are good natured jibes at his half Mexican, half \"indian\" partner. Texas is basically half Mexican at this point, and people in West Texas also respect the native American culture more than most, because a lot of us have native American blood. In 44 years, I've heard only a handful of jokes about \"Indians\" and Bridges character utters them three or four times. But, Hollywood. Chris Pine was excellent in a subdued role. Ben Foster played an interesting character, but more Rambo and less of a believable Ex-Con. Neither of their accents were believable, and it took a little away from it for me. Some of the bit actors had a better grasp of how the characters should talk and sound. Other than that, a good little tale in the western tradition. The final scene was my one of my favorites.",

            "content": "The film has certain elements of the western genre but nothing pretentious in its narrative and technical aspects, it presents the story of two brothers against authority but all justified in favor of his family.The film begins in the middle of the action presenting the first robbery as the initiator of the story, setting elements such as the uncontrolled character of Tanner (Ben Foster), the focused attitude of Toby (Chris Pine) and the conservative and authoritative personality of the Ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges). The three characters represent a psychological confrontation throughout the film between a person's desire, duty and purpose.The conflict or duality between right and desired is present from the beginning and reflected in all the characters of the town, such as the waitress capable of collaborating with the law but taking advantage of the crime of others. For this is how the main characters of the brothers are presented in an impoverished town and frustrated by the limits imposed on them to take advantage of the wealth under their feet, these brothers are the enlightened ones able to camouflage themselves in a system to take advantage, robbing banks of the same chain with those who will then make deals and practically, although unintentionally, mobilizing the people.We see the family commitment of both characters from the beginning for the death of their mother, it will be for the children of one of them that they going to steal again. Everything is controlled by the authority represented in a Ranger with a great ideal of commitment to justice, although rather it represents the ashes of a system that tries to maintain order.\nThe film continues its course focusing its intention on discovering the purposes of this triad of men, this will lead us to the climax of the film where the three intentions collapse staging with the last robbery. During this a hierarchy of the three characters is generated with their intentions.Tanner (Ben Foster), the character who steals for pleasure, accepts his sacrifice for duty with his brother. Ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges) ends up disgusted even when he defeats his enemy and gets justice. And Toby (Chris Pine) who plays with the purpose of helping his family is the hero who does not seek his benefit and who manages to turn the system to the aid of others and for his survival.",

            "content": "This movie is about much more than two brothers on a bank heist binge or than an old time sheriff and his Native-American partner. It is about the inevitable- it's about the way life continues on a bound circle. It is a nod of the hat to the struggles that we all undoubtably face in our lives. Wither its financial struggle, coming to the end of an era, death, or even that we are all under the influence our human desire to have more power-- there are some things in this life we just can not avoid. Hell or high water, they are bound to happen.The movie bases its story on the inevitable problems of money and debt. No matter who we are or where we are from, money will always be a factor. Though this creates the plot of the film, I do not believe it to be the over all arching theme to be strictly about money.Much of the plot is also based on the idea of ending era's. This is most obviously noticed with the intrinsic struggle of sheriff Hamilton and his fear of retirement.Death is another large part of this film. As a certain character in this film meets his death (I will not reveal who dies exactly to avoid large spoils), it feels as if it was meant from the begging. As if no matter what, this character was set on bound tracks to an early death.Finally, the most sneaky nod of the hat to the inevitable, the constant undertone of the human desire to have more power. This is most obviously noticed in the constant references to the Native American people and their stolen land. This is well portrayed by Alberto; who explains that the power struggle was once between the Native American's and the white people, but now the power struggle is fought between the everyday working person and the bank.Outside the hidden meaning of the script, this film has much to applaud-- Jeff Bridges being one of them. He not only transforms so brilliantly into a modern day Texas sheriff, he successfully pulls on the heart strings of everyone who watches this movie. He is truly one of the greatest actors.Director David Mackenzie masters the \"long take\" in this movie by letting the camera go on continuous shots, thus letting the actors create a realistic scene (the opening scene being a great example).The film's sets and locations make the audience feel as if they were actually there. The light blue Texas sky matched with the sun faded colors of the surrounding buildings make you feel like you are really in the heat of small town Texas. The worn out towns shot in motion as the characters drive effectively create the back drop for this story of small town suffering.The only noticeably negative aspect of the film is the cheesy feeling given off by one or two smaller role actors.Over all, I give the film a 7.7. I love the writing, I love the films meaning, I love Jeff Bridges as well as the other leading actors, and I love the Texas style realism. I give this film a high recommend.",

I was totally unaware and am still unaware of the Brazos River running through Archer County, Texas, but my buddy said it could have been sarcasm.

Secondly.. the way Hollywood depicts West Texas is so grossly ridiculous. You would think everyone is white.. or total trash..with thick ridiculous accents. Unreal.. and no wonder people hold Texas with such contempt if this is all they see or are exposed to is this type of characterization. It is akin to an African American actor in an urban setting speaking constant Ebonics with a 4th grade vocabulary, sure they are there..but it would be a gross stereotype casting that PC types would go nuts over. The story is refreshing in it's simplicity. Bridges is good, even though he epitomizes the problem I listed above... Those comparing this to No Country for Old Men are FAR off.

I don't think I'm the only one who gets Coen brothers vibes from this movie, or generally speaking, from a certain genre which is thriller/western drama with an old ranger who's not very enthusiast about his impending retirement and a couple of spoiled thieves, one smart the other one crazy. Nevertheless, characters - especially in the second half of the movie - begin to look more and more tridimensional, and more than once Taylor Sheridan's screenplay surprised me, not only for a smart and quite subtle way of showing the main themes of the movie, such as Texas' citizens economical issues and the even more interesting father's responsibilities and his duties, but especially because it didn't lack of a huge amount of suspense and unpredictability - and honestly I was quite worried about that. Pine gives a surprisingly real performance, while Ben Foster is simply exquisite and charming in his craziness, and the relationship between the two brothers is as genuine as the two lawmen's, Marcus - an amusing Jeff Bridges - and Alberto. The final showdown between the good and the bad (what's the difference anyway? but most of all, there's one?) is thrilling and totally not what I was expecting.

I lived near this area years ago and though the accents aren't spot on, the attitudes and characters are pretty accurate to what I experienced around the Red River area.

It is hard to believe how well this movie was cast; it's perfect. The relationships are developed well and so are each of the characters. There are moments of true drama and moments of pure comedic genius. The cinematography is awesome. It really sets the stage for the action of the film and provides incredible context for the story that unfolds. The music, too, enhanced the film and added to the depth of the story. The entirety of the film transports one into the world that the characters inhabit.Jeff Bridges performance is spot on.

Although the films admitted slow pace for the first 40 minutes it used that time to develop characters. Speaking of the characters, the preformces in this film are stellar, and the world around them feels loved in and real. I agree that this film is incredibly inspired by the Coen brothers masterpiece \"no country for old men\" I feel like this has different very different motivations behind the characters. Not to mention the incredible cinematography. Not to touch on spoilers but the last 30 minutes in this film is some of my favorite moments of film in the last decade, but not just the least 30 more specifically the last five minutes which a conversation between two characters that floored me. If I am going to complain I think it has little rewatch value and the slow place in the beginning although important got a little boring. In conclusion a great film and is on Netflix right now if you want to watch it.",

The story is equally powerful - a clever and creative take on the bank heist trope.Had some issues with direction.

            "content": "When I started to watch this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. The opening sequence answered all those questions for me.I was sucked in immediately. The bank robbery was done so well. It felt realistic. No pointless explosions or unbelievable action sequences. The men doing the robberies immediately had you asking why they were doing this. The victims had realistic reactions; the feisty older woman, the scared teller, the old man with a gun and nothing to lose. The background of these two men come out shortly after the opening sequence. At that point I was all in. Everything just fits. The music matches up with the scenes. The choices for the roles were perfect. The colors and scenes make you feel like you are in a small town in the middle of nowhere out west.The action scene at the gas station had a punch that looked so realistic. I think scenes like that were why I enjoyed this movie so much. It felt real.The police officers story line is also very well done. It is a good cop, bad cop scenario, but not in the typical fashion. They make you almost not know who to root for, the robbers or the cops. It really is quite amazing how well the director and writer put you in an argument with yourself on who you want to come out the winner.There are so many great scenes in the movie. The father-son talk just before the final robbery. The scene with the officers talking, and it almost appears to dawn on them that the bank is almost the real enemy, the cause of so many of society's problems. The brothers wrestling while a country music song plays in the background.You knew how the last robbery was going to play out, yet it was done so well it was still perfect. It still had a twist that was unexpected. There was a death that shook you no matter what side you were rooting for. And the emotion that came immediately after was so passionate. I loved this movie. It is one of the best I have scene recently. It had a great story, one that had you rooting for all involved. You felt the pain and the struggle behind the robbers choices, the love they had for each other, the pain on how life played out. You also felt the the fight the officers had in wanting justice, the respect between them almost identical to the brothers.",

Film was written well with a good storyline but i found some parts predictable. Both lead male roles did a good job portraying their Texas characters and the Texas landscape scenes were good in showing the vast empty land mass that is 'middle TX'. The ending was abrupt could of been better. Also, they never go into the Family story of why he's divorced, and why they only show a scene with 1 son and not the other was odd.

            "review_title": "A Must-Watch Post-Western Epic About Two Brothers on Redemption's Trail",
            "content": "Two brothers of contrasting personalities set out for a similar goal, yet with differing motivations. They are: Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster) - the smart and the stupid - the cerebral and the primal; the brothers team up to rob some banks, consequently for another duo on the other side of the law - Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) - to chase after them for a run time of less than 1 hour and 50 minutes, of slow, but thrilling sequences delivered with witty, comedic and sometimes, sentimental dialogues without any lack of the gun-banging that is typical of westerns. However, this is no typical western; a cynical take on the genre, quite akin to the modern classic - No Country for Old Men - despite the differences in themes both represent, both were nurtured by the blissful hands of excellent cinematographers, capturing shots of sweeping landscapes and intense, nail-biting scenes - complementing the surprising, but fantastic performances from Pine and Foster and a resembling re-enactment of the legend himself, Bridge's famous roles, which is not a disadvantage to the film, especially not when paired with Birmingham's wry portrayal of an Indian character - who has to live through Marcus' constant spews of racist jokes, but not without Alberto flinging them back at him, which makes for some comedic back-and-forth-s that are much needed following somber moments. They share an interesting dynamic, however, the sentimentality of it all seeps through the brothers more often - not solely for the fact that they are brothers, even if it is a major contribution to my experience. I relished the subtlety of the performances, having them to transcend the film to an emotional family drama. Director David Mackenzie has been successful at creating this magnificent modern and realistic representation of the post-western genre that would not have been a likely possibility if well-reputed screenwriter, Taylor Sheridan wasn't at the helm of this script. Alas, it is a product assuredly deserving of its praise and your time.",

            "review_title": "Phenomenal Film",
            "content": "The once peaceful lands of Western Texas have been surrendered into the control of the Texas Midlands Bank; forever dominating the people's wealth. A family's ranch is in jeopardy when tough circumstances meet brutal enforcement. Brothers, Toby and Tanner Howard must face the debt their mother leaves behind to keep their ranch. Beneath the land lies black gold which will end their poverty. Before they can progress, they must satisfy the bank's demands whether or not their methods are legal.Many and if not all of the best criminal films do not compare to the dry and dire nature that Hell or High Water depicts. The movie starves itself from the traditional happy-go-lucky plot leaving a crude and lawful journey to follow. In comparison, Escape from Alcatraz also depicts the dependability of family and the desire for change that drove the inmates to commit crimes. Hell or High Water challenges typical crime films with a different approach at success; sacrifice to break the shackles of poverty.\nGenerally, crime is one of the most difficult genre to depict in a film without excessively including fatuous events, characters, and plots. Many crime films obsess with including comedic and impractical scenarios that spoil the thrill of a crime film. Tom Cruise's\n\"American Made\" was a true disappointment because the realistic events beneath the film held great potential; a common airline pilot recruited by the CIA in order to bring down the Medellin Cartel finds a new interest in the commission from smuggling drugs. Historically, the twisted events of Barry Seal's recruitment would appear fictional and that is exactly how it is depicted in the film. Likewise, Clint Eastwood's \"Escape from Alcatraz\" took a mushy approach representing the infamous convicts who escaped the inescapable. \"Escape from Alcatraz\" and \"Hell or High Water\" share the same grand scheme plot but only one of them captures the anticipation and excitement of the process. Furthermore, the advancement of the film industry allowed Hell or High Water to nail criminal films spot on by making the audience feel like they're in the moment. Somehow a sense of connection develops as you learn the principle of the film and witness the phenomenal acting.What makes Hell or High Water unique is the storyline that is told in a duel perspective. Throughout the film we see the Sheriff and his Deputy pursuing Toby and Tanner after they blow their cover. Generally, law enforcement is seen as a side or background aspect to a criminal film that appear when convenient. However in the virtually lawless land of Western Texas it's the Sheriff's personal conquest to glorify his last days with his badge. As for the Howard Brothers they have one goal in mind; keep their ranch and ensure a wealthy life for their family. The wholesome plot of the film makes Hell or High Water change how we see crime and the importance of family to some.Mackenzie, a relatively new director, makes a return since his last hit: \"Starred Up,\" which follows a young offender through his timeline in custody. Prior to Hell or High Water or Starred Up, Mackenzie has only directed 6 other films none of which affiliate with crime. However all his films share the surreal realism of the stagecraft and portrayal of characters. CGI is praised for its tactility in portraying situations such as firefights, explosions, narcotics, and decent size land modifications. Yet CGI adds a cartoony aspect to a film that is supposed to feel live action. Mackenzie cleverly avoids using CGI making the film incredibly realistic. Gunfights in the film follow the stereotypes of Texan gun owners but in a way that adds to the story showing the feral turf of Western Texas. Additionally, the entire process of Toby and Tanner's heists is shown with minimal offscreen assumptions unlike other criminal films. In the end Hell or High Water does a spectacular job with its acting which makes me crave a sequel.Hell or High Water deserves a showtime for everyone even those with little interest. Ridded of cliche plots and CGI overkill, there is a laundry effect from the first to the last minute of the film. This film is remarkably a token of Mackenzie and a valid landmark for his 10th film. Rather than settling for big name faces and over advertised films experience crime without greed and glory instead for a greater purpose.",

            "content": "A brilliant neo-Western for the ages.\n\nDirector David Mackenzie's neo-Western crime drama Hell or High Water (2016) remains the best Western film of the past decade to me. His haunting shots, darker characterizations, brutal sudden violence, quiet tension, flawed heroes, and desperate villains ensure Hell or High Water is truly suspenseful. I continue to find Mackenzie's direction utterly riveting. Editor Jake Roberts' sleek cuts and steady pacing makes Hell or High Water's 102 minutes feel like a brief moment in time.\n\nWriter Taylor Sheridan's story is interesting and original with deep character studies of these four main men. Sheridan's realistic writing gives each man believable motives for how they act and think besides their backstories that make each guy unique. I just keep thinking about how he separates men by their choices as every guy could potentially get desperate enough for cash to rob a bank in Sheridan's world. Hell or High Water's true grit brings the heat in the unforgiving red Sunlight of Texas.\n\nCinematographer Giles Nuttgens finds fascinating framing for cars speeding down the desolate highways or men facing each other down in tense personal close-up shots. Hell or High Water is full of vast wide expanses of oil fields, gas stations, casinos, banks, and diners. Nuttgens shoots these stunning wide shots with sweeping wide shots and visceral close-ups that hang onto these hardened men. You never know when they'll just make a snide remark or get up and fight a man like Chris Pine defending his brother at the gas station from an angsty metalhead in a green sports car. Hell or High Water makes Texas look desolate and lonely.\n\nChris Pine is amazing as neo-Western villain Toby Howard. His smart, cautious, charming, and suddenly vicious bank robber is fascinating. Hell or High Water is Chris Pine's best acting performance ever. I wish he got an Oscar for Best Actor for his gritty turn as Toby Howard. He's ready for a fight, but actively trying to avoid violence and confrontation, whether it's with security guards or ex-wives. Pine feels thoughtful with an inner burden and sorrow that he's carrying around with him. Marin Ireland is pretty and great as Pine's ex-wife Debbie Howard. Her worn down expressions imply how tired and sick of Toby's lack of child support payments or fathering his sons. Her scene is memorable.\n\nBen Foster is absolutely unhinged as the violent bank robber and ex-con Tanner Howard. He feels dangerous and ready to pounce on anyone who threatens him. He'll feel disdain for his mother, hate for his father, loyalty to his brother, and even charm a casino clerk girl. Foster delivers a fierce co-lead performance unlike any of his acting work since his ungodly gunslinger Charlie Parker in 3:10 to Yuma. His machine gun volley sets flying a hail of bullets on the highway to detract the local posse and state rangers hunting him. It's terrifying and exhilarating like Val Kilmer firing his machine gun in Heat during the legendary bank robbery sequence. His sniper rifle farewell scene is outstanding and fearsome.\n\nJeff Bridges is subtle in his understated supporting role as elderly Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton about to retire. Bridges is funny with his smart wit, revolting with his casual racism, intelligent with his shrewd criminal insights, and cool with his fatal sniper fire and suspenseful final confrontation. Jeff Bridges was born to be in Westerns and totally earned his Oscar nomination for Hell or High Water. He should have won.\n\nGil Birmingham is sympathetic as Texas Ranger Alberto Parker, who has to take his partner's racist remarks against Native Americans in stride in order to hunt down bank robbers. He feels professional and by the book with an amiable attitude. You really care about this guy Alberto. Gil Birmingham should be appreciated more for Hell or High Water as I think he's often overlooked simply because Jeff Bridges just outshined him with a gripping character study right next to him. Gil's monologue about Native ancestry and banks taking money is fabulous and understated. You never suspect his ending is coming.\n\nAmber Midthunder is wonderful in her cameo as the pretty shaken Vernon Bank teller who gets robbed. Midthunder is lovely in Hell or High Water and feels authentic with her quiet teller, nervous with every carefully chosen word. I'm overjoyed that since Hell or High Water, Amber Midthunder has starred in Legion and Prey. Screenplay author Taylor Sheridan himself cameos as the cowboy herding cattle away from a brushfire by the highway.\n\nKaty Mixon is excellent as the Vernon waitress Jenny Ann, who flirts with Chris Pine and refuses to give Jeff Bridges her $200 tip as evidence because it is half of her mortgage. Dale Dickey is very nice as the blunt bank teller Elsie at the Howard brothers' first bank robbery in Hell or High Water. She tries talking them down in an unexpected dialogue. Kevin Rankin is good at the Texas Midlands bank account manager Billy Rayburn, who hates what the banks did to the Howard family.\n\nCanadian actress Melanie Papalia is very sexy and sweet as the nameless hooker in the casino, who flirts with Chris Pine. Margaret Bowman is a riot as the rude T-Bone Waitress that does not take any flack. William Sterchi's agreeable bank manager Mr. Clauson is a fun bit. Alma Sisneros is very cute as the affectionate clerk who sleeps with Foster's Tanner.\n\nProduction designer Tom Duffield creates little diners, quaint small town bank layouts, and dusty wooden Texan homes. Art director Steve Cooper highlights barren plains with few grasses or animals except the metallic beast of oil rigs blackening the horizon. Set decorators Wilhelm Pfau, Scott Christopher Clark, James Duddy, and Chris Painter put financial papers in the banks, hearty steak meals in the diners, and just piles of clothes and beer in the houses to keep with that impoverished aesthetic. It all looks very grounded and realistic. Visual effects artists Dave Kim, Eric A. Kohler, and Dane Allan Smith create a massive fire in the distance, an explosive car bomb, furious gunfire, and a bloody sniper rifle headshot for Hell or High Water with total realism.\n\nComposers Nick Cave and Warren Ellis create these charming and sullen folk tunes for Hell or High Water's sorrowful soundtrack. Nick Cave's lyrics bring a melancholy to his sonic Americana. I love the mournful tone to Cave and Ellis' Hell or High Water soundtrack. Sound designer Frank Gaeta lets the gunshot break the quiet small town silence with louds bursts of fire that echo out into noisy chaos.\n\nCostume designers Malgosia Turzanska, Leila Heise, and Jane Day rustle up ranger uniforms, blue jeans as far as the eye can see, and every ten gallon cowboy hat in Texas for Hell or High Water's striking rustic fashion. All the shirts have nice designs or style for Chris Pine and Ben Foster's outfits, while Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham's ranger fits humorously match each other. Make-up artists Janeen Schreyer, Tarra D. Day, and Karla Muenze give each guy long, unkempt hair and gruff facial hair for a hardened look. The actors must all have grown their hair just for Hell or High Water's tough guy aesthetic.\n\nIn all, Hell or High Water is sad, exciting, and often funny with its brazen bank robbers and quirky rangers on the chase in a deadly game of cat and mouse. I simply adore this gritty neo-Western.",

Hell or High Water explores the slowly rotting corpse of small town America and the changing tide of cops vs. robbers. Thematically speaking, this is a less effective No Country for Old Men. It is gripping in its action and dialogue and Jeff Bridges steals every scene he is in. I think a lot of people view Chris Pine as just another good looking actor guy, but I'm consistently impressed by him in the right roles, and man he's good in this one. It's pretty easy wax poetically about the headier aspects of this movie, but when it all comes down to it, it's just a cool movie: something that every good western needs to be.",

The plot is also pretty realistic and ends up creating several thought-provoking themes. The characters were also done pretty well, mainly due to the incredible cast behind them. The soundtrack felt fitting for the whole atmosphere for the movie, and the cinematography was done extremely well to give it the Texan atmosphere. There is also a number of thrilling moments that keep you on the edge of your seat, and the third act provides a wild, action-filled conclusion.

This is the bar to try to reach when making modern day Western movies. This movie was thrilling, captivating, absolutely hilarious at moments, emotional, and action packed. It has a short runtime for a movie and it even felt shorter due to how much I was enjoying the movie. Chris Pine, Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham all put on showstopping performances. The relationships between the two brothers of Pine and Foster as well as the two cops looking for them in Bridges and Birmingham are very well presented and you can feel the chemistry oozing of the screen.\n\nI love how they showed the intentions these robbers had and that the film took time to delve deep into the lives of the robbers. By the end you are wanting all the characters to live and find resolutions. It isnt towards a climatic breaking point near the end until you can really say you hope they get caught and I love that about this film. I thought that the humor was really authentic and well placed in the film and while it was funny it didn't take from the overall drama the film had nor the story. \nI felt so many different pieces of this film worked and felt cohesive. I love how small scale and grounded this film felt and that the filmmakers took the time to make the story actually make sense. A lot of times you watch dramas and you can't relate and feel a disconnect from what is happening in some scenes. No scene in this film broke my connection to the characters. The thrilling aspects near the end of the film ramp it up to 11 and it's very moving and engaging.",

Foster was excellent as the \"selfless\" brother who martyred himself for his sibling.  The ending left a lot to the imagination but seemed \"right\".",

This movie was really fun. First off, Chris Pine and Ben Foster have so much chemistry, which is absolutely crucial for a movie like this. The acting overall is also great; I haven't really seen a weak link anywhere. The story is gripping enough to keep me interested throughout the entire movie, and the ending is as perfect as it could have been, in my opinion. Nothing extreme, but rather grounded and realisitc. You have two unlikeable characters trying to be stopped by other two unlikeable characters and somehow, you like all of them. This is when a movie really clinks for me, and this one sure did. Ben Foster's character is this hardened criminal, who has done it all, and acts without really thinking much of any consequences, and mostly does it for himself, when Chris Pine's character is the exact opposite of that, he has never killed someone, he never acts outside of what he has planned, and he does it for his family. In my opinion, this movie is close to being perfect.",

Jeff Bridges, Chris Pine, Ben Foster and Gil Birmingham are excellent, with special kudos to Chris Pine for holding the screen with a muted and introspective performance.  There is a lot of sensitivity, humanity and even firm social commentary in this movie, and it anchors the story and creates a counterpoint to the violence and aggression that ultimately comes.",

            "content": "Jeff Bridges has made a career out of playing genial, likable slackers with a surprising amount of depth and hurt behind their seemingly complacent facades. I wouldn't call him my favorite actor, I think that the affection many have for his public persona cause them to overrate his abilities but he is right at home in a minimalist western like this one and his grizzled presence brings about a Larry McMurtry-esque tone. I wasn't totally infatuated with the film as I felt that it covers similar ground to many other westerns that go deeper in their exploration of poverty's effect on families and the importance of father figures. Fans of the genre should rejoice in finding a film that actually has something to say as opposed to The Magnificent Seven (2016).\n\nDowntrodden Texan Toby Howard, Chris Pine, is divorced from his wife Debbie, Marin Ireland, and estranged from his children. He wants to ensure that they will be financially secure in the future and wants to continue to own the ranch that his mother left him after her death but a mortgage from a cruel local bank makes this difficult. In order to finance his ambitions he teams up with his loose cannon brother Tanner, Ben Foster, to carry out robberies of various local banks and later launder their money through a casino before depositing the money in the bank that plans to take their ranch away from them. Chasing them is aging Ranger Marcus Hamilton, Jeff Bridges, who keeps up a friendly rapport with his partner Alberto Parker, Gil Birmingham, while considering his impending retirement and ability to do his job successfully. Tanner's volatile personality leaves the brothers vulnerable and even as they begin to pay off their debts they have serious doubts about their ability to stay alive.\n\nWhere the film excels is in capturing the poverty of the area subtly as it is never overplayed but there is a desperation to all of the characters that is driven by their economic concerns. Director David Mackenzie allows the camera to linger on tagging around the various small towns that the brothers pass through that gives the sense that people there have nothing to live for and no real way to express their outrage. For the brothers we understand that this ranch is what little they have left and to them the bank, an institution that could take their only remaining asset away from them, is a major enemy. The inhabitants of these small Texan towns also seem wary of institutions as they are not forthcoming with information about the robbers for the police. In one fascinating scene a sweet waitress refuses to give up $200 given to her by the robbers because it is the only thing that will allow her to pay her mortgage. We are left to imagine how her and countless other struggling men and women get by without miraculous donations such as this one.\n\nThere is also the usual infatuation with the big skies and flat plains of the Texan landscape and while the film never quite reaches the level of Hud (1963) in how beautifully open and natural the area is at night Giles Nuttgens tries his hardest to imitate James Wong Howe. Foster and Pine give fine performances as two brothers trying to make their way in the world as they don't over do the accents, i.e. Kenneth Branagh in The Gingerbread Man (1998), and imbue their characters with varying degrees of intensity. Foster is known at this point for his manic performances as men angry at the world whether it be in Alpha Dog (2007) or Ain't Them Bodies Saints (2013) and he replicates his act to good effect here as he is believably unhinged. Pine was more of a question mark heading into the film as he is best known for his role in Star Trek (2009) and had not been known as an actor of dramatic heft by this point. He is a compelling lead as while he might be a little too glamorous to be believable in the role he is restrained and contemplative enough to successfully play off of his showy counterparts.\n\nThe film is worth a watch because while it may not necessarily have spoken to me that strongly because I don't love westerns it boasts more than the average genre film.",

No, me either, until I realized that's exactly what I was watching... Story about two bank robbing brothers, Tanner and Toby Howard, raising enough cash to keep the bad bank man from taking the farm. Ya see, they struck oil on that land, not much, but enough to get by. Toby is the smart one, doing bad things for good reasons. Tanner is the wild card, doing bad things just to do bad things, but deep down, doing it for his brother! But coming up quick behind them is the law, Texas Ranger kinda law!! The old sheriff, Marcus Hamilton, just about to retire, and through pretty much intuition alone ends up in the right places at the right times, and with Marcus his Native American partner, Alberto, who is assaulted by the racist humor of the sheriff all day, but deep down, there's a bromance going on! And as Tanner and Toby continue their bank robbing ways, Tanner gets a little cocky takes on a bank full of people, shots fired, they barely escape with their lives, the townsfolk round up an armed posse to go after them chasing them up the road, but right around the corner is the sheriff, because deep down he knew where those pesky Howard boys were gonna strike next leading up to the ultimate showdown between the Texas Rangers and a couple of law breaking cowboys!! So this takes place in modern day, but it had the classic western set up. So if you're looking for a modern day western, go for it, looking for Heat, or Point Break, i'd say probably not.

Nor did Chris Pine.  I thought it was a good twist on an old theme, but it felt and looked jumpy, as if there was too much to fit into a short time frame.  As the plot unfolds, we catch a glimpse of why the brothers are robbing banks, but it just didn't catch me in a way I thought it would.  The ending was hacky.  I doubt seriously the Ranger could have made that shot from the position he was in.  And the very end, the confrontation, over done I think.  I understand some lawmen can't let go of the job, and I understand the motive of the Jeff Bridges character of wanting revenge for the death of his partner, however, the shooting on the mountain was a bit too cut and dried, and the confrontation at the end seem strained and forced at best.  At worst, It's a convenient vehicle for the viewer to guess what may or may not happen next.  ",

That's not to see it betrays it's genre for an action movie trope or something, it's still moody and atmospheric in it's western tropes, it's more in the spirit of the film, the heartbeat of the film that the energy comes through more than any action on screen.

Well, here I am, standing corrected. He absolutely brings it in this film. Also, Ben Foster...i can't describe how scary it is at the accuracy he portrays a west Texas/Oklahoma boy. As an Oklahoman myself, I know about 10 different guys who act just like his character. Typically you may look at his portrayal as a little over the top, but I think he nailed it. \n\nThe movie was the right amount of tense, drama, and interesting. Often times I find my biggest complaint to be that a movie is too short, that they didn't stretch out a storyline enough, but this script hit all the marks for me in the amount of time it was offered. \n\nAmazing, absolutely will watch again.",

Nonetheless, the true power of this rugged genre effort comes from its stars and its attention to both atmosphere and character detail. As yin-yang siblings compelled to embark upon their mission by need, fury, and inherent recklessness, Pine and Foster share a compelling chemistry. And they're complemented in the charisma department by the always great Jeff Bridges. As the just-about-to-retire sheriff hot on their trail, Bridges delivers one of his finest performances, radiating both wit and regret as an old-school relic cop. This film had some of the best performances of the entire year. Definitely one of my favorites of 2016. ",

Chris Pine (Toby Howard) gives what is arguably the best performance of his career. He's likable and plays well off his brother. Ben Foster (Tanner Howard) is almost unrecognizable as his ex-con brother. He might be the show stealer, playing an unhinged man who is hell bent on helping his brother, even if it means sacrificing himself. Jeff Bridges (Marcus Hamilton) is his usual great self. There's a sense that he's kind of a jerk, but there's heart behind what he does. The bank robbery scenes are well done without going over the top. The tense scenes, like Toby getting stopped at a roadblock or his conversation with Marcus at the end of the film are both brilliantly handled. There's not a lot of effects used, but when we do get them, it looks great. There's a specific gunshot that looks phenomenal late in the movie. The direction is top notch and the script allows for some deep moments among the characters.\n\nWeaknesses: The plot is ultimately very simple and straightforward. It's not a flat out bad thing, but it shines a light on the fact that this movie could mean more if things were laid out a bit differently. Along with that, some of the characters are kind of stereotypical and not fully fleshed out. We have the father trying to do right by his kids, the raging ex-con, etc. Another issue is some of the pacing. Points of the movie seem to drag. \n\nOverall: Once you get past some pacing problems and some of the simple stuff, you find yourself watching a well-acted, engaging film with some great emotional beats.",

And I guess paying the bank off with their own money would make it more interesting? I don't know. It's never even clear who planned this whole fiasco.\n\nThe characters aren't much better. Tanner and Toby are cardboard cutouts painted with stereotypes. Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is nothing more than a rehash of every sheriff in every Western ever filmed. Except with more mumbling. The only remotely interesting character was Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), and he is criminally underdeveloped and underutilized.\n\nSpeaking of Alberto - his death is unearned and feels cruel. Maybe that was the intention, but it leaves the viewer with a bad taste. The fact that Marcus, who spent the entire movie mumbling racist jokes at his good-natured partner, hardly even seems phased makes the circumstance even worse.\n\nThe best part of Hell or High Water is the commentary on the changing way of life and how that affects people in the poorer parts of the United States. Toby has an excellent quote towards the end of the movie about how being poor is like a disease, and it infects and corrupts generations of people.\n\nOverall, Hell or High Water is a film with good ideas and intentions but, ultimately, falls flat on the execution and presentation.",

For them, the hold-ups are just part of a last-ditch scheme to take back a future that seemed to have been stolen from under them. Justice seems to be theirs, until they find themselves on the radar of Texas Ranger, Marcus (Jeff Bridges) looking for one last grand pursuit on the eve of his retirement, and his half-Comanche partner, Alberto (Gil Birmingham). As the brothers plot a final bank heist to complete their scheme, and with the Rangers on their heels, a showdown looms at the crossroads where the values of the Old and New West murderously collide.\n\nThis was an interesting film. It has been two years since this movie has come out and considering it garnered a lot of buzz at the Oscars (which I don't care about), I'm surprised it took me this long to watch it. It's just been sitting on my shelf for a while now and just until recently, I hadn't plopped it into my Xbox One. Then, my friend came over and we decided to watch \"Hell or High Water\" on one of our many movie nights. It was a really solid ride overall, even if I may not have fully been able to appreciate it the first watch-through. \n\nOne thing fantastic about this film was the talent. Chris Pine and Ben Foster really took charge and put on great performances in this film. Their overall talent and ability to work together gave something very interesting. However, am I the only one who saw them and thought of Sam and Dean Winchester? I don't know why, as they didn't necessarily match those same personas, but I just thought of those two. Anyways, the characters they played were characters with opposing personalities, which gave them a lot of clash, but a lot of work well also. \n\nOverall, I felt like this movie was just really tense. It wasn't necessarily this adrenaline pumping thing, nor was it slow. It was in the middle, setting up its scenes with these really deep, intellectual conversations and moments. Especially the ending, I really enjoyed a lot of the moments in this film that spoke so much without necessarily saying a lot. \n\nIn the end, \"Hell or High Water\" was a solid film with some great moments. It had great cinematography, great acting, solid characters, and a good story ark. Overall, a solid watch.",

The themes that paint the narrative range from right to conceal and carry, to the dichotomy of big city Wall Street to small town Main Street. Posing questions but allowing the audience to come up with there own answers. I think 10 different people could see the movie 10 different ways and all enjoy it.\n\nIt's, far and away, Chris Pine's best performance as a leading role.  All of the characters are uniquely human with these wonderful lines of ambiguity. Sure, Pine robs banks, but he is in touch with his morality and even burdened with guilt, and Ben Foster is most definitely a villain but he has such love for his brother. And Jeff Bridges! God love the good ole cowboy hat wearing, mushy-mouthed Jeff Bridges. Fully devoted to and talented at his job but again, not without his own flaws.  His relationship with his partner, Gil Birmingham, is one of my favorite aspects of the film, and its culmination turns the grumpy \"I'm too old for this shit\" trope on its ears. They get along but probably wouldn't if they weren't partners. Bridges is a bit difficult to be around, but he shows love and respect in a certain way, and it's the only way that he knows how.  Even the superb performances of the bit players gives the setting such an authenticity. Having grown up in Texas I feel like I've met many of the supporting characters (for better or worse).\n\nHell or High Water also makes such great use of the emptiness of west Texas. Everything is timed and paced and laid out so well that there are periods of time that highlight how boring open space can be, then jolts you to life with these crime scenes that are reminiscent of Michael Mann's Heat.",

            "content": "West Texas seems a burnt out place in this moody thriller (of sorts) from writer Taylor Sheridan and director David Mackenzie. The soundtrack by Warren Ellis and Nick Cave adds dramatically to the effect alongside a well-chosen selection of country twang that fits the West Texas setting.   The plot unfolds slowly with an easy-going air of simplicity.  Two brothers (Ben Foster and Chris Pine) are robbing banks to raise some money for an unknown reason. Two Texas Rangers are tracking them (Gil Birmingham and Jeff Bridges).  The film takes the time to show us their relationships in enough detail so that we see their differing personalities.  But the overall effect is of patient and economic storytelling. Director David Mackenzie (although a Brit) captures the despondent ethos of the local area, where banks and their greed have helped to create and perpetuate poverty and anger.  Eventually, we find out the motivation for the younger brother (Pine), even as we realise that the older brother (Foster) is a psychopath.  Bridges and Birmingham don't have too much to do except to exchange (loving) insults.  Yet, the result is watchable and rewarding on a sort of primeval level, even if the film doesn't have too much to say didactically. (An interview with the director and cast suggests they were trying to present reality as ambiguous).  In the end, you probably wouldn't want to live there but it's a pleasure to absorb the mood for a couple of hours.",

Though the robberies are well-planned, Tanner's wild nature leads to him to take unnecessary risks, frustrating Toby. Two Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), are on the case. Hamilton, who is close to retirement, quickly determines the brothers' methods and personalities. Meanwhile, Tanner robs another bank while Toby unknowingly waits at a nearby diner. They take the stolen money to an Indian casino in Oklahoma to be laundered. They exchange the stolen bills for chips, some of which Tanner uses to gamble. Toby then has the casino convert them into a check made out to the Texas Midlands Bank - the same bank they robbed. With untraceable funds and gambling as a cover for how they were acquired, the brothers head back to Texas.\nIt is revealed that the brothers' mother died recently, leaving their ranch in debt due to a reverse mortgage provided by the Texas Midlands Bank. If the debt is not paid off in a few days, the ranch will be foreclosed. Toby is determined to pay off the mortgage to ensure a comfortable life for his estranged sons because oil has recently been discovered on their land. They rob Texas Midlands as a form of frontier justice. Hamilton and Parker has to anticipate the next move of the thieves to catche them...\n\n\"Hell or High Water\" received critical acclaim, with many praising the film as revitalizing the western genre. Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads, \"Hell or High Water offers a solidly crafted, well-acted Western heist thriller that eschews mindless gunplay in favor of confident pacing and full-bodied characters. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying, \"In ways large and small, Hell or High Water is a movie so beautiful and harsh and elegiac and knowing, the moment it was over was the moment I wanted to see it again.\" IGN reviewer Samantha Ladwig gave the film a 9/10, saying \"Hell or High Water surprises with its complex narrative, stuns with its cinematography, and makes up for this summer's shortcomings.\" Tom Stempel of Creative Screenwriting praised Hell or High Water as \"a fresh, smart, bank robbery-character study and one of the best screenplays so far this year.\" The film premiered at the Un Certain Regard section of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on May 16, 2016, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 12, 2016. It received critical acclaim and grossed $37 million. The American Film Institute selected it as one of its ten Movies of the Year, and it was nominated for numerous awards, including four Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Bridges), Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. It also received Golden Globe nominations for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Bridges and Best Screenplay.\n\n\"Hell or High Water\" is really nicely directed by David Mackenzie with great cinematography and editing, we get great performances from Pine and Foster as the leads, Bridges is however doing the same mumbling Texan type he did in \"True Grit\" and \"R.I.P.D.\" which is getting a bit tiresome as he is such a versatile great actor. The plotline with the \"bad guys\" (the bank in this case) and the \"good guys\" (Howard and his brother trying to save their childhood home ranch) is hardly unique, but the build up between the protagonists and the antagonists is the interesting part creating empathy and sympathy for the characters on both sides of the story. I like as well the homage to the western genre and it being a modern time western. And I also like the quite slow pacing that sometimes explode in mayhem and violence.",

Small, seemingly insignificant moments become monumental decisions. A brunch at a diner becomes a fork in the road when one of the brothers notices a branch of their despised bank across the road. Will they or won't they try to rob it in broad daylight? \n\nThe soundtrack, mostly country/rock ballads and guitar gems adds considerably to the experience.

When we know what chases after us we don't help and helps us we help back any way we can. When all to do is chase the leads and follow the clues to get closer to the chase. When we can't resist the chase when other chasers excite us when it's gambling and lust. When all we can do is keep up when some place chase after us in what we owe and what we can't afford and what's leftover. When we chase after a life we either stick around or leave when its either us or it's not. When not many things stick out that makes some chases harder to reach when in the middle of nowhere there is not much to see. When we are all just chasing after something, whether it's the end or the beginning of the end.

When some chases need to be split up when one needs to get out and another needs to stick around and fight. When some chases don't end when others don't see what they are chasing that we slip through. When what see we chase after when some chases end we got them out numbered and cornered.  When we see other chases have been going longer than others when they have a history and record that chases after them and leads them stray. When others chase after what is owed and rightfully ours. When we are always going to chase after something we know we ought to be chasing when justice demands it and we seek it out to the end. When we see we have a history of chasing after a life that comes so scarce and hostile that we are tired of the way life is. When we provide for our family a life they don't have to chase for until the oil runs dry. When we and our family will always be chasing for peace and not getting it when some debts are owed to us and whether we stick around is matter of the fight.",

Toby (Chris Pine) is the younger brother, and Tanner (Ben Foster) is the older brother who has recently been released from prison. On their tail is a pair of Texas Rangers who want to put an end to the brothers  crime spree. The head Ranger is Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) who is nearing retirement, and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), a Native American who somehow tolerates Hamilton s racist banter.\n\nGREG: The brothers have a scheme to rob the Midland Bank of enough cash to pay off the debts of their mother s reverse-mortgaged ranch. The brothers are following Toby s plan, but Tanner is a loose cannon and strays from the plan. This leaves enough clues for Hamilton and Parker to predict their next heist. It s a game of cat and mouse as the Rangers close in on the brothers in a tight spiral.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, I ll just come right out and say it. Hell or High Water is one of the best movies of 2016. How refreshing it is for a film released in August to boast a rich and nuanced screenplay coupled with memorable and multidimensional characters. This movie held me in rapture, from the opening scene to the closing scene. The film opens with a bank robbery but in the background stands a church with three prominent crosses on the wall, foreshadowing the later deaths of three of this film s main characters. In the concluding scene, Hamilton moves away from the camera while the camera hits the dirt, suggesting that he is, in fact, the third casualty. This movie compels you to see things and to see people at a deeper level, a human level. The four main characters have an unusual strength and depth to them, a multi-dimensionality that I havent seen in the movies in years. Jeff Bridges didn t just portray a Texas Ranger; he was that Ranger. It s Oscar time for him, for sure. Every character inhabiting this film came alive on the big screen, made me laugh, made me cry, or repulsed me. The film is a true gem, a throwback to a bygone era of filmmaking when character development mattered.\n\nGREG: Part of the pleasure of this story is that it s a mystery. The mystery is: why are these cowboys robbing these banks? We re fed clues incrementally, just as the Texas Rangers discover them. So, despite the fact that we re following the brothers closely, we don t know the reasons why until nearly the third act. This is a great anti-villain story cut from the same cloth as Bonnie and Clyde and The Sting. The lead characters are villainous as they are on the moral high ground. In our book Reel Heroes & Villains we talk about anti-heroes. They take on the characteristics of villains but are the characters we are rooting for. Contrariwise, the Texas Rangers are anti-villains. That is, they are the good guys in the story, but are the antagonists for the leads. It s a great structure. But what makes this film work, more than anything else, is the depth of the characters portrayed. I had to do a double-take because I thought this might have been a Coen Brothers or Weinstein film (both producers of great character-based films). But no, this one was penned by veteran television writer Taylor Sheridan (Veronica Mars and Sons of Anarchy). I was blown away by the combination of action, suspense, and great character detail.\n\nSCOTT: You re so right, Greg. The hero s journeys are nontraditional, with the Howards voluntarily moving into the dangerous unfamiliar world while pulling the Rangers in with them. Tanner performs the ultimate (anti-) heroic act of sacrificing himself for the success of the mission, and Alberto does the ultimate heroic act of sacrificing himself, albeit involuntarily, for the success of the Rangers  mission. We have parallel anti-hero and hero stories with no real transformation, only adaptation to circumstances -- which can be considered a type of transformative adjustment heroes need for success. The mentoring is equally rich and unconventional. Older brother Tanner takes the physical lead role in being badass and anti-heroic, but it is his younger brother Toby who masterminds the entire caper. Among the Rangers, it is Marcus who mentors Alberto in the dress code and in doing detective work, but in the end it is Alberto s quiet dignity that exerts a great emotional impact on Marcus. Toby also plays an important mentoring role with his older son -- or, rather, an anti-mentoring role, as Toby cautions his son not to be like him. While the Rangers serve as anti-villain characters, it s also pretty clear that the biggest villain in this story is the institution of banking. In our most recent book we discuss how institutions can take on villainous roles. Usually these institutions are societal scourges such as racism or sexism. In this film the villainous institution is clearly the financial industry that conspires to squeeze every cent out of society s most innocent and vulnerable people. In doing their noble anti-villainous work, the Rangers encounter obstacles in the form of popular disdain for the banks that are being robbed. The robbers, in effect, take on folk-hero status. So the villain in this story, the banking industry, ends up hindering the anti-villains  ability to carry out their mission while having a slightly facilitative effect for the anti-hero brothers. In all it s a fascinating triad of anti-heroes, anti-villains, and institutional villain.\n\nGREG: Hell or High Water is a cleverly draw tail of modern-day anti-heroes. Everything in this film is excellent: the acting, the cinematography, the story, even the scenery. Often in the movies I m distracted by the execution of the  seams  of the standard plot points. But Hell kept me in suspense with it s unspoken mystery of why these brothers were robbing banks. I can t imagine anything that would have made this film better. I give it 5 out of 5 Reels and I expect an Oscar nomination for the film. The brothers are classic anti-heroes in that they are making morally wrong choices, but still we see them as heroes because they are subverting the evil banking institution. They are chased by the virtuous (if albeit cantankerous) Rangers as anti-villains, trying to thwart the brothers  goal of robbing the bank. In the end Tanner martyrs himself, which is a selfless act, but kills Ranger Parker in the process, cementing his anti-hero status. I give this hero structure 5 out of 5 Heroes. We re witness to some fine mentoring by the venerable Ranger Hamilton upon the younger Ranger Parker. Although Hamilton insults Parker, he lets us know that it s a friendly way of acknowledging and (in a strange way) respecting their differences. We also see cross-mentoring between brothers Toby and Tanner. Tanner advises Toby in the ways of bank robbing while Toby shares his intelligence and values with Tanner. It s wonderful mentoring throughout which I award 5 out of 5 Mentor points.  Movie:  Mentor:  Heroes: \n\nSCOTT: Ditto, ditto, ditto, Greg. By hell or high water, this movie had better garner some Academy Award nominations. This film is a true cinematic achievement and boasts the complete package -- a meaty script, memorable characters, marvelous acting, a socially relevant message, and a surprising twist or two in the closing act. Jeff Bridges is especially brilliant; I ll never forget his complex emotional reaction after his successful sniping of his prey. I have no hesitation in awarding the film the full 5 Reels out of 5 here. Our four main characters represent the finest combination of heroes and anti-heroes we ve seen in the movies in several years. As you ve noted, Greg, each pairing has its own unique dynamic of power, influence, and communication. The Howard brothers have a lifetime of chemistry to draw from, and the Rangers are in the process of developing theirs. In the end, there is an unshakeable bond within each pairing, and it s a true tragedy that only one of the four walks away the rubble of this tragic story. For giving us fabulous characters with moral complexity whom we can really sink our analytic teeth into, this ensemble easily merits a rating of 5 Heroes out of 5. We ve talked at length about the complex and nuanced mentoring that goes on within each buddy hero and anti-hero pairing. We re also treated to a rare episode of anti-mentoring going on between Toby and his son. The father-son relationship is actually the catalytic epicenter of the entire robbery spree. As with everything else in this film, the mentoring is exceptionally interesting and warrants a rating of the full 5 Mentors out of 5. Movie:  Mentor:  Heroes:",

However I cannot agree with the majority opinion here.  \"Hell or High Water\" is not a terrible movie by any means.  It's just mediocre.  Very mediocre.  It has a main story that is unoriginal and also very predictable.  It also makes no bones about ripping off other movies.  The scene where Toby Howard (Chris Pine) is speaking with his son and telling him that he does not want his son to live the same life as him was recycled right out of \"The Godfather\".  I was waiting for Toby to say he was hoping his son would have a career in politics.  The movie also recycles quite a bit from 1995's \"heat\" the scene where Toby gets past a roadblock with a fake driver's license is a good example for that.  I was looking for Ashley Judd in that scene.  The film's final scene recycles the diner scene from \"Heat\" as well.  The one positive thing to say about the movie is the very strong performances by Chris Pine and Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges.  They are what carry the movie for me.  I did not care for Ben Foster's performance as Waingro.  Wait.  I'm sorry.  I meant Tanner Howard.  His character was too cliched and formulaic for me.  The last year or so has given us a fairly large amount of overrated movies.  You can add \"Hell or High Water\" to that list.",

The plot is about two brothers, the upstanding and law-abiding Toby (Chris Pine, Star Trek franchise), and the combustible ex-convict Tanner (Ben Foster, ) begin robbing bank branches in various quiet towns throughout the remote deserts of Texas to get money for a somewhat good cause. They are pursued by an elder Texas ranger near the end of his career, played brilliantly by Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Crazy Heart). The plan designed by the brothers is devilishly clever and their reason for breaking the law is something that everyone can understand and sympathise with, and the characters and their relationships are extremely enjoyable to watch as the film explores them. The film mixes some heart-warming and uplifting moments with some real heartless and tense scenes that keep you on your toes and guessing what's gonna happen next. Director David Mackenzie uses the arid and huge landscape to his advantage, and really captures the immense size and scale of the Lone Star State, and the relative emptiness of some of it. The film is great to look at, the story is as gripping and entertaining as any out there, and the performances are brilliant.

This bank is about to foreclose on the mortgage on their ranch and claim the property, and robbing the bank to pay its own loan seems appropriate.  On the trail of the brothers is a Texas Ranger, Marcus Hamilton, with only a few weeks to retirement.\n\nInteresting idea, clumsily written and so-so in execution.  While the whole idea of robbing a bank to pay off a loan to that bank is wonderfully, wickedly poetic, here it is turned into a ideological, political sermon.  So rather than a decent crime drama, the movie gets turned into an attempt to be something bigger, and it fails at that, taking shots at things clearly troublesome to the writer, but not necessarily to anyone else.\n\nAdd in much fake atmosphere - mournful music, long shots of Texas vistas - just to make the movie seem more profound than it is, and you have case of style over substance.  It was as if director David MacKenzie was trying to emulate the Coen Brothers' Fargo, but then didn't have the story to go with the atmosphere.\n\nIt's not all bad though.  Jeff Bridges is great as Marcus Hamilton and there are a few good action scenes and funny moments.  I found the proliferation of guns a great, often funny, indictment of American gun culture.

            "content": "I had such a great time with this movie!  \n\nAnother reviewer wrote \"The best movie the Coen brothers never made\", and I laughed out loud.  Perfect!  The cinematography and feel of this film reminded me of No Country For Old Men in all the best ways possible.\n\nNormally, plot holes and small continuity errors drive me crazy, but this movie was so much fun it just didn't matter to me.  In the third act it becomes apparent that the entire premise of the film is ludicrous, but it didn't bother me one bit.  I'll discuss it later in the spoilers section.  The last time I enjoyed a movie as much as this one that had so many plot problems was Denzel Washington's The Equalizer.  Once he and the terrorists started battling it out in the home center, I realized I was watching Die Hard In A Home Depot, and just relaxed and enjoyed myself.  To this day, I can't walk down any aisle in a Home Depot without noticing all the ways I could kill people with what is on the shelves.  \n\nAlso, if you ever find yourself needing to launder any money, PLEASE don't use this film as a \"how to\" guide.  You'll be in cuffs before you get out the door.\n\nSo, I really enjoyed Ben Foster's and Chris Pine's performances.  I've never really been a fan of Chris Pine's work, but he shows real range here in his understated performance, and he got the West Texas accent right!  The interplay between Pine's Toby and Foster's Tanner is well-written and excellently acted.  You'll believe they're brothers with a lifetime of love and hate and respect and torment between them.\n\nThe high point of the film though, is Jeff Bridges' Ranger Marcus, and the banter between him and his long-suffering, but subtly counterpunching Alberto, played with an understated brilliance by Gil Birmingham.  The older Bridges gets, the more interesting he gets, in my opinion, and this may well be his best.  If you enjoyed his interpretation of Rooster Gogburn in the remake of True Grit, you're gonna love him here!\n\nThere wasn't a bad performance in the film, and several of the bit players were amazing!  Katy Mixon's pragmatic waitress Jenny Ann was an absolute delight, and Margaret Bowman stole the show as the waitress at the T-Bone Steakhouse (guess what they serve there?).\n\nI also absolutely LOVED the way the film ended.  It had a little touch of Coen brothers, except you could understand it.  I'm not gonna say any more, I don't want to give even a bit of it away.\n\nI simply cannot understand how this film didn't do better at the box office.  I just punched myself in the face for not going to see it in the theater.\n\nSPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** \n\nSo, the primary premise early in the film is, the Texas Midland Bank screwed their mother on a reverse mortgage and is about to foreclose on it, so they're robbing Texas Midland branches, only so they can pay it off with Texas Midland money.  Great premise.  Frontier justice.  The little guy fights back against The Man.\n\nLater, we learn there's oil on the land, and Toby wants get this done to set his sons up Jed Clampett-style.  That kills the entire premise.  The oil on the land  opened up so many other ways they could have gotten the ranch out of hock that didn't involve robbing banks.\n\nThey could easily have negotiated an advance out of the oil company.  Even if the oil company decided to wait them out in the hope of getting a better deal from Texas Midland, they only needed a hundred grand.  They could easily have found a bank to take their future oil revenues from that deal as collateral on a loan, and if not, investors would have lined up around the block to do it.  \n\nSomeone I was discussing this said doing it my way wouldn't have given them the revenge they desired.  That's true, but Toby's primary motivation was to set his sons up.  Doing that without the risk of getting killed (and failing to set the boys up) is a much smarter play.  Then, with the boys playing around in their new Jethro Bodine cement pond, there's plenty of time (and funds) for revenge.\n\nYou know what?  I don't care.  The truth is, I don't think they even needed the whole oil thing.  If they'd just had  Toby and Tanner's mother leave the ranch to her grandsons, getting their birthright out of hock and getting revenge on the bank for screwing their Momma would have been more than enough motivation for the brothers; maybe even a better, more hard-bitten one.  Put Toby's sons living with their mother in a dilapidated trailer house and that ranch looks like a big step up.  Anyway, that's why I gave it to them.  It's a detail the rest of the story needs to work, and the rest of the story is so damned good I just don't care.\n\nThe next big hole is how they laundered the money through the casino.  I work in a casino, and I promise you, everybody with some money needin' a little washin' has thought of walking into a casino, buying a bunch of chips, waiting awhile, then cashin' 'em back out.  It would be spotted instantly.  You can't move anywhere near that kind of money through a casino with IDs being required.  Reports would be made.  There are cameras EVERYWHERE, and it's the first place law enforcement would look.  \n\nThey needed it to make the story work though, so I gave 'em a pass.  I look at it like going to a strip club and having a triple-D stripper with crossed-eyes coming up and offering me two-for-one table dances.  Let's just say I'm not going to be spending a lot of time looking at her eyes.\n\nThere's more.  Burying the stolen cars they used in the robberies is a guarantee of being caught.  You don't think the cops might have a question or two about that big, car-sized newly filled-in hole on the property at the heart of this?\n\nStill it was a neat visual, and it helped establish the amount of planning that went into what they were doing without taking up a whole lot of time, so again, I gladly give it to them.\n\nThey got all the big stuff right, so it's easy to give 'em a pass on the little stuff they got wrong.\n\nGreat movie!",

The movie is very good indeed in every cinematographic aspect.\nMarcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) is on the hunt after bank robbers, who occurred to be two brothers: Tanner (Ben Foster) and Toby Howard (Chris Pine).\n\nTanner is a convict that was just recently released from prison for bank robbery. It turns out that he killed his father as a teen too. Tanner is a very impulsive man, who just likes the drive, adrenaline and fun that he receives by living a criminal life.\n\nToby on the other hand is a person that destroyed his own family, however he chose the path of redemption. He came up with a very wit plan that will allow him to guarantee a problem-free life for his kids and wife.\n\n?I would say whole movie is based on the evolution of relationship between two pairs: 1) Marcus Hamilton and Alberto Parker 2) Toby and Tanner Howard. They argue, joke and respect each other.\n\nSoundtrack is also marvelous. Original music is written by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis.\n\nSome may say that movie lacks something original moves in script. I completely disagree with this. Even if you do not see any surprises behind each turn the movie is not predictable and it has quite a few things to say about modern world and human nature.\n\nThe film is absolutely worth watching if you enjoy solid westerns about ordinary lives and not some glamorous empty trash.",

            "content": "Every now and then a movie comes out of nowhere that rises far beyond the usual conventions and limitations of its genre, and completely defies all expectations that might be placed on it. Hell or High Water Made is one of those movies. Made on an extremely modest budget, it tells the relatively straightforward tale of two small time bank robbers and the Texas Rangers chasing them. But it's as far above your average cops and robbers movie as the French Connection is above the standard buddy cop flick. \n\nThe robbers, down on their luck brothers Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster), are as different as can be. Toby is a former family man, and the brains of the pair. He's soft spoken, has an obvious aversion to violence, and would never be doing any of this if he wasn't trying to save the family ranch from foreclosure. Toby, on the other hand, is the loose cannon. Brash, impulsive, and with a strong violent streak, he has a rap sheet a mile long and clearly enjoys every bit of what he's doing. \n\nThe brothers are no masterminds, but they're no dummies either. Inexperienced as they are, they know exactly what their doing, hitting the smallest banks with the least security, taking only the cash that's easily at hand, and splitting before the cops know what's happening. They're also smart enough to know that they can't keep this going for long, but they have to hope it will be long enough to get the money they need.\n\nThey're pursued by rangers Marcus and Alberto, played by Jeff Brides and character actor Gil Birmingham. Both men are grizzled old hands, though Bridges is the older and by far the more grizzled, and the blunter and more cynical as well. The relationship between him and his half Comanche partner is just like Hank and Gomi from Breaking Bad: plenty of sarcasm, put downs, and occasional slur masking their deep respect and friendship towards each other. For all their rough edges, they're professionals: they have a good idea what kind of suspects they're chasing and what their plan is, and they're never more than a few steps behind.\n\nThe true measure of this movie's brilliance is how much It makes you root for both sides. You want the brothers to get the money and save the farm. But you want the Rangers to catch them just as much. I won't spoil how the movie manages to solve this dilemma, but it's nothing short of masterful. \n\nThe whole movie is masterful. There's dialog here worthy of Tarantino or the Coen Brothers. The final conversation in particular is wonderfully subtle and open ended. The visual aesthetic is magnificently sparse, with many long, unbroken shots of the desert and prairie, or the dusty streets of small town West Texas . The filmmaker's also have a real knack for using natural light to achieve high contrast, through the shadows cast by a sunrise, or the midday sun streaming through the windows of an unlit diner or motel room. The effect is beautiful yet deeply down to earth, adding to the authentic feel.\n\nAnd make no mistake, Hell or High Water is one of the most authentically Texan movies in years. It may not have been filmed on location in Texas, but it's made by people who know Texas: the land, the people, the culture. Writer Taylor Sheridan and director David Mackenzie clearly understand and sympathize with the farmers and ranchers, the waitresses and out of work drillers just barely getting by. They perfectly capture the open ranges and dusty small towns, bringing a sense that we're on the edge of civilization, and in the shadow of better times. \n\nIn terms of mood and visual style there's a lot that's reminiscent of this Last Picture Show. And in terms of style, structure, and craftsmanship, this could easily be a companion feature to No Country for Old Men, to which it clearly owes a great deal of influence. It may not be as well known, but Hell or High Water belongs firmly in the Texas canon alongside these greats.",

The film has a great dynamic for the most part, with the two brothers picking off small time banks, and Bridges' and Co one step behnd, till things inevitably hit the fan to bring the adventure to an inevitable close.\n\nIf you get the chance by all means check out Hell or high water, it isn't an adrenaline packed thriller but will keep you on the edge of your seat from immersion alone. You will certainly see why it managed Academy award nominations, and disappointed it walked away with none.",

I understand the merit of older westerns, but nowadays, they tend to just seem dated. But something about Jeff Bridges in a Texas desert seems right. I'm also a sucker for a good screenplay and some risky robbery scenes, and right off the bat this film lets you know that is what you are in for. The contrast between the four main characters, the two brothers and two rangers, drive the narrative to a point to where you aren't sure who you are rooting for by the time the climactic scene begins. So if you like bank robberies, Chris Pine's eyes, and dramatic scenes of cars being buried, you should check this out. 8.7/10",

The more Bridges ages, the more I seem to loved him in films he does.  Like True Grit, Crazy Heart and even TRON: Legacy.  Hell or High Water is Bridges' movie and a movie that only stands out because of him.\n- The last quarter of the film sprung upon by the shocking shoot out.\n\nThe Not So Good:\n- Everything else is just bland, blas\u00e9, and a protypical \"poor man fighting for his family against the monster monoploy of the financial system.\"  Better done in larger scope The Big Short.\n- Acting by both Ben Foster and Chris Pine (not quite sure who does better) if fine, but nothing exceptional.\n- Definitely not a Best Picture film.\n- Heist bank scenes are not rivetting nor gusto guns blazing exciting.  Which contributes to the tone being very \"dry\" - as the locations look - dull, and dragged on.\n\nLasting Remarks: \nWithout Jeff Bridges, Hell of High Water would have been turn-offable.",

The film tells the story of Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster), two bandits who make assaults on bank boxes and their executioners, the film works on this quest for cat and mouse of the two nuclei . The film tries to pass a moral about not being villains or good guys, in the western, these concepts does not exist, there is only who draws the gun first, the film is great at doing this, even if it happens in the current times, we also have brushstrokes about seeing all Points of view and a criticism of the abandonment of the cities of the interior that are still sunk in the economic crisis of 2008. The photography is great, full of aerial plans, with a palette of colors that pulls red, the climate is hot, photography Is urban and at the same time gives a complete sense of solitude, with a spectacular soundtrack, full of country, you want to pack and move to texas, the track gives the tone of the movie several times, can even play once or Another at wrong times, but it is always a treat anyway. Chris Pine does a good performance, nothing special, he fulfills his role, Ben Foster is well out of tune, his performance is bad and it is not the movie, the gold here is Jeff Bridges, who Acts more physically with his face, full of postures, while sitting, walking, looking, he is a legitimate cowboy, does not deserve the Oscar, but deserved the indication. And a compliment to David Mackenzie who knows how to record moving scenes like no one else. Finally \"At any cost\" is a good movie, for the lovers of the western has a much more special taste.",

We follow a pair of bank robbing brothers and the lawman pursuing them across the dusty landscape of West Texas and the Texas plains. Hell or High Water doesn't reinvent genre, but it doesn't need to; it's executed extremely well. \n\nChris Pine and Ben Foster play the outlaw brothers, Toby and Tanner, respectively. Pine's Toby is the quiet, more reserved brother. Foster's Tanner, recently released from prison, is the more volatile one. There's more to their plan than just grabbing as much money as they can and going on the run. They have a specific amount to rob from a specific chain of banks, Texas Midlands Bank, which is set to foreclose on the family home. They will pay Texas Midlands Bank with money they robbed from its own branches. Toby wants to make sure that his ex-wife and children will have enough money for a secure future. Tanner wants to help his brother, and if that means robbing banks, he's completely willing. \n\nJeff Bridges is the heavy hitter among the cast. It's good to see Bridges give a great, solid performance in a role that is befitting of an actor of his talent, instead of the cartoonish roles he's taken in recent movies. That's not to say that Bridges doesn't bring a certain amount flair-or the tough, western man equivalent-to Marcus Hamilton, a surly Texas Ranger on the brink of retirement. He's smart enough to catch on to the brother's plan and crafty enough to use patience as his method for capturing them. He'll figure out which branch they'll rob next, then sit back and wait for them to mess up. Working with Hamilton is his half-Mexican half-Native American partner, Alberto, who is the subject of relentless racist teasing from Hamilton. Bridges, however, is adept at portraying Hamilton as a man with an underlying, genuine affection for his partner that he has to mask with sarcasm. His Oscar nomination for Supporting Actor comes as no surprise.\n\nThere's a lot of great acting in different styles from the leads. Bridges and Foster are ostentatious; Pine is more subdued and pensive. The screenplay by Taylor Sheridan has rightfully received an Oscar nomination for Original Screenplay; it creates full-fledged characters and successfully divides our sympathy between both cops and criminals. The climatic confrontation is intense and thrilling. It's an action sequence the film earns by firmly establishing what's at stake and building the characters. I wanted Toby and Tanner to get away as much as I wanted Hamilton to catch them. British director David Mackenzie seems to be the perfect fit for this modern day western. He doesn't mythologize or glorify the setting or the characters. These are everyday people dealing with extraordinary circumstances and the final result is an extraordinary film.",

I've probably seen this same scenario a number of different times, but the reasoning behind it is what brings Hell or High Water (2016) into a different category. There have been tons of heist films, and often the robbers have a tight connection, like that of brothers. Heck, The Blues Brothers (1980) essentially did the same basic plot but with \"putting the band back together\" as their way of \"saving the ranch.\"\n\nPartly because this film seemed so quintessentially Texas, I couldn't help thinking it was a toned down version of another Best Picture Oscar winner No Country for Old Men (2007). With last year's Best Picture Oscar nominee, The Big Short (2015), showing how many honest Americans were swindled by the greed of banks, it's no wonder that this year we would see the more down-to-earth side of this financial fiasco. Not only are these robberies meant to save their home, these brothers also wanted to \"stick it to the man\" that put their family in such dire straits to begin with.\n\nIn the end, Hell or High Water is a pretty standard plot and it's pretty predictable from the beginning to the credits. However, when the citizens of these towns aren't concerned that their banks are being robbed and they begin to side with the robbers, you know there's something wrong with the society. Granted, this society in Texas was hit hard by the recession, so it's no wonder that they don't trust the banks that are being knocked off. It's realizations like this that help to show why a presidential candidate practically backed by big banking did not win last November.\n\nA modern twist to a standard bank heist archetype, I give Hell or High Water 4.0 stars out of 5.",

Bank Robbers vs. the Sheriff and the Law. I've seen this before and in lots of movies, a storyline like this would be boring. Fortunately, Hell Or High Water has a tight script with some great dialogue and a great cast. All the performances are suburb and all the actors have charisma! Chris Pine does a good job, but the two roles that are Oscar worthy are Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges. I know Jeff Bridges is up for an academy award this year, except I believe Ben Foster should have been in the same category. Ben Foster has come a long way from being the shy, dorky kid from Get Over It back in 2001. He plays the washed up, red neck, bank robber so well. I also love the world that this movie is set in. It feels so much like a classic western, except Texas'a Wild West is full of Dodge Ram Trucks, machine guns and technology. What this film also does well, which reminded me of a Tarantino movie, is that the writers really have an eye for how people in this setting talk. All the little quips from various townsfolk are great and fit the world perfectly. There is a great scene where Jeff Bridges and his partner try to order some food and the waitress comes up and asks, \"Well, what DON'T you want?\" Nothing to do with the rest of the movie, but just a nice world building moment. Another note worthy thing is the action. There isn't much of it, but when it goes down, it goes down! It reminded me a lot of the missions out in the desert of GTA V. Definitely has a Grand Theft Auto vibe to it. Now, I can officially say that there are two movies I'd would rather see win Best Picture other than La La Land. Nothing against La La Land, just saying that Hell Or High Water is a damn good movie!",

To save their family land from being foreclosed on two brothers go on a bank robbing spree, drawing the attention of the Texas Rangers.  Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Jeff Bridges lead the cast and deliver strong performances.  And the film takes on some very topical issues, such as the mortgage crisis and the cycle of poverty.  The robberies and chases are also shot incredibly well, and are intense and suspenseful.  Additionally, the music and cinematography do an excellent job at capturing the look and feel of the American west.  Hell or High Water isn't quite as provocative as it thinks it is, but it does address some prevalent social issues.",

Wonderful acting Bridges, he has the perfect portrayal of his character, utterly watchable, believable, sympathetic and I would love to see more and more of these kinda of roles for him. The portrayal of Texas is realistic, not over the top...everyone in Texas really does pack a gun! Wonderful start of the third Act, everyone in the bank of the last and final hold up was armed and started shooting back...riddling Toby and Tanner Howard's 4 wheel drive truck with bullet wholes(that's right you in Texas).  Finally it is an easy movie to watch, this concise plot moves at the right pace, the whole ensemble are watchable realistic characters, characters that hold your attention and seem real and honest.

Writer Taylor Sheridan continues to slowly make a name for himself in the industry with yet another powerful crime drama following his work on Sicario. Hell or High Water is less tension based than that film, instead choosing to serve as a slow-burn character study with plenty to say about the current state of the country. It's nothing particularly unpredictable in terms of how everything plays out, but Sheridan's work with these characters and their dynamics is solid enough to ignore that. The two lead characters in said character study are played brilliantly by Chris Pine and Ben Foster; the former shows a darker passion that we haven't truly seen from the charming leading man, while the latter's wild intensity is truly mesmerizing. Jeff Bridges takes up supporting duties, and while the character feels very reminiscent of another western character he played not too long before, Rooster Cogburn in the Coen brothers' True Grit remake, but he's simply too good an actor for that to be a major distraction. David Mackenzie directs the film with a deliberate sense of slowness that really gives the big setpieces a bigger punch. When a bank robbery goes down, it feels explosive, but never gratuitous in its violence. Too much of the gunplay and the film becomes a typical action flick: instead, Mackenzie keeps the gunplay on the down-low, and it pays off beautifully.",

It's a very fast-paced film and it really is a great story about two brothers who are also bank robbers. It was written by Taylor Sheridan who wrote \"Sicario,\" which was also a masterpiece. You are really invested in the characters and the plot from the very beginning of the film and it just takes you on a ride that doesn't end until the end credits hit. The film has one of the best endings I have ever seen; it features so many emotions and so many great small stares between the two characters in the scene. There are great performances, especially by Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges. Foster gives the best performance of his entire career, while Bridges gives a performance that we have never seen before. He is the best thing about this film. There is one downside, and that's some of the characters. They really seem like cartoon characters and I didn't know what they were in this film.

I love heist films and I'm not a huge fan of Westerns, so this has been a difficult film for me to assess.  The story is clever, the characters are dynamic, the acting is solid, and the cinematography is beautiful.  On the other hand, I believe that the film would benefit from a faster pace.  It wasn't my favorite but I would argue that if this is the future of Westerns, we are headed in the right direction.  It has a \"No Country for Old Men\" feel to it from the very start.  It got to the point where I kept expecting Tommy Lee Jones to walk into each scene and couldn't help but picture his face behind Jeff Bridges' sunglasses and the brim of his hat.  Bridges offers a strong \"old man\" performance that combines the strong will of a weathered lawman with the tiredness of a near retiree.  It is memorable but I wouldn't consider it to be a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination.  Chris Pine has some impressive moments and plays well off of Ben Foster, who finds the right balance between being despicable and likeable.  My favorite performance actually comes from Margaret Bowman as the old, sassy waitress.  The t-bone steak scene was probably my favorite part of the movie and a well-timed moment of comic relief.  The heist is well constructed from the selection of banks to the use of a casino for money laundering.  Visually, the interesting camera angles and filming locations perfectly capture the Western setting.  I don't believe that \"Hell of High Water\" will win any Oscars (in fact, I believe that there were better candidates to have nominations in the categories of Film Editing and Supporting Actor) but its interesting bank robbery story and modern take on a Western are worth seeing.",

            "content": "\"3 Tours in Iraq and No Bailout for People Like Us.\"  These words, spray painted along the side of a stained brick wall, tell the audience who the villain of Hell or High Water is and where the motivation for two brothers to tear through West Texas towns that are all but deserted.  Boarded up storefronts, abandoned gas stations, debt relief and fast cash signs peppered with bullets, sand blasted homes for sale; the vast and sepia toned landscape that is West Texas seems all but abandoned save for these two outlaws, the lawmen that chase them, and the citizens who are protecting whatever they have left.\n\nHell or High Water tells the tale of Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster, respectively), two brothers that go on a bank robbing spree across the plains of West Texas to save their family's land from being seized by the very banks they are robbing.  The lawmen charged with hunting the Howard brothers down are a pair of Texas Rangers, Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham).  Chris Pine's Toby Howard takes no joy in the path he's chosen in this time of desperation.  It's a choice he struggles with and feels guilty for up until the final moments of the film, but the position he's in doesn't provide an easy out to his problems.  With the burden of providing for his family and keeping his brother Tanner from going off the reservation, Toby understands that if he falls apart so does the plan to ensure his families safety.  Even if it means sacrificing his own.  Ben Foster shines as Tanner Howard, the unstable wild card to Chris Pine's careful but calculating Toby.  Foster has always excelled as a character actor and his portrayal of the life long West Texas cowboy convict is done so with excellent emotional range and comedic wit that steals the movie away from his little brother, the just as voracious yet cliched character of Marcus Hamilton that Jeff Bridges plays, and the emotionally grounded punching bag that is Gil Birmingham's Alberto Parker.\n\nThe biggest success of the film comes from the comedic back and forth between the competing duos; it provides some much needed levity as you are beaten over the head with the environmental and orchestral storytelling of how desperate the wild plains of West Texas have become in a post-recession world.  Foster and Pine's big brother/little brother relationship is believable and relatable through excellent shared storytelling and good natured ribbing.  On the right side of the law, Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham provide the perfect yang to the bank robbing brothers yin; their particular brand of good natured ribbing is steeped in Marcus's desire to stay attached to the life he's about to retire from and Alberto's desire to show respect to this ranger that he doesn't feel comfortable with but respects and needs to finish this job.  Writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario, Sons of Anarchy) figured out how to weave comedy back into an old west style cop & robbers film that takes place in modern day. The banter in Hell or High Water provides the audience with a movie that feels like something old given new life.\n\nNowadays, in most crime films, directors and writers are too quick to lay out the story and motivations of the characters.  Leaving little to the imagination of the audience, causing disinterest by the third act as the audience impatiently waits for the conclusion they see coming a mile away.  The film is methodical in its storytelling, and a reminder of films from a different time.  Each scene in Hell or High Water adds a new wrinkle to the main story and to the character(s) of this part of the United States, which much like this type of cops & robbers tale, is being left behind.  By the end of Hell or High Water, you understand the motivations and personality of each character and of those of the towns that are visited throughout.\n\nThe characters on screen entice the audience to not take a side, to root for good to triumph over evil and for evil to escape the good.  Similar to playing cops & robbers when you were a kid, the audience can easily switch sides after the first act, the second, and the third.  To walk away from the experience understanding and appreciating the effort of the filmmakers to make you feel satisfied with the outcome, regardless of who your favorite was.\n\nThe film also takes care to make the Howard Brothers into West Texas Robin Hoods; a point made clear halfway through the film when the attorney handling the money the brothers steal stating \"to see you boys pay those bastards back with their own money?  Well if that ain't Texan I don't know what is.\"  Even Alberto, the half-Native American, half-Mexican ranger points out to Marcus at one point, while the pair stake out a bank, that \"a long time ago your ancestors was the Indians.  Until someone came along and killed em.  Broke em down, made you into one of them.  150 years ago, all this was my ancestors land.  Everything you could see, everything you saw yesterday.  Til' the grandparents of these folks took it.  And now its been taken from them.  Except it ain't no army doing it.  It's those sons of bitches right there\" as he points to the very bank they are protecting.\n\nThat's the charm of Hell or High Water.  The moments of contemplating the right and wrong of the two outlaw brothers actions.  Two other examples of this occur early on in the film; a working mom name Jenny Ann (Katy Mixon) protects the handsome stranger who gave her a $200 tip that's half her mortgage while at the same an old timer (Paul Howard Smith) is trying to make sense of the actions of these outlaws.  \"Seems foolish, days of robbing banks, trying to live and spend the money?  Long gone, long gone for sure.\"  Most modern cat and mouse, cops & robbers movies have gone too high tech.  Robbing a bank in modern movies involves elaborate over planning, augmented reality floor and security layouts, degrees and experience in technical wizardry.  \"Only assholes drink Mr. Pibb\" is an apt line from Tanner Howard that best describes this.  In this film, it's back to basics.  Two men, two guns, some getaway cars, and a simple plan.\n\nIt's that back to basics approach, along with a fantastic original score and soundtrack provided by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, that keeps the tension level high for the entire 102 minutes of the film.  This prevailing sense of tension is encapsulated during the same scene where Alberto pontificates on the state of life in West Texas; Marcus says something that at first seems like a throwaway line.  However, taken into the context of modern cops & robbers tales that allow the outlaws to have multiple small mistakes that don't fuck up the grand plan or prevent them from getting to the final score, Marcus says \"we're just waiting for them to make a mistake.  They haven't made one yet, but they will.\"  That's what makes this movie thrilling.  The stakes are always high; especially since it was established in the first 15 minutes of the film that each bank they enter has the chance that someone in that bank is packing heat and is more than happy to dispense vigilante justice.\n\nHell or High Water is a thrilling, western crime story about the desperation of the outlaws to save what's theirs and the duty bound lawmen trying to hunt them down.  For all the ambiguity and slow pacing of the story, the film ends with a clear winner and loser and leaves you wanting another old west tale.  Perhaps this movie will reinvigorate writers and filmmakers to realize that sometimes the most compelling cat and mouse game is the one that occurs in a box.  Less Mr. Pibb, more Dr. Pepper.",

            "content": "This is the type of movies I want to see Ben Foster in. Not in Warcraft with that golden wig and casting spells. Felt really good to see Ben Foster in this movie. Many might give this one a miss because of the mellow trailers but it's a good movie. No doubt about that.\n\nSTORY & SCRIPT - The story revolves around two brothers who are planning to pay their debts by robbing banks and two ageing officers who apparently are the only ones following this case. Jeff Bridges' character, Marcus Hamilton wants a last swan song to end his career with, due to which he is hell-bent on catching these mystery robbers who are going from one bank to another. Toby and Tanner are polar opposites of each other. When one is hot-headed, the other is smart and cool but both of them are sincere about their family. The story has a very slow pace and after the consecutive robberies the movie almost comes to a halt. It allows the dust to settle before the final showdown. The ending in particular was beautiful. It had me engaged about what was going to happen and when the credits rolled I was left thinking what will the final confrontation between Toby and Marcus will be like and that's what a movie should do.\n\nDIRECTION - It was bold of the director to maintain such a slow pace to such a simple movie. We could see the ending right after the halfway mark but do you know what kept me interested? The characters. The interactions. Most of the times in movies when I see two characters interacting, I feel like people don't like like that. At that moment the movie just looses me. In this movie, the interactions felt natural. There were silent moments which left room for character building. The racial undertones in the characters didn't stick out. It felt rather natural because unlike Tanner, Marcus was racist just to tease his partner. That scene when Marcus finally gets his revenge got to me. Not kidding. Every character felt well-rounded from start to finish. Right from the waitress(both of them) to the main characters. I liked the final reveal of Marcus' body and you hear a rattling noise and you see that death was right at his feet. Just the bearer of it changed.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY - Let me get rid of two minor gripes. One was the sky at the beginning of the movie. It felt very artificial. Second was the fire. The CGI was really off. Probably due to budget constraints. Other than that the landscape shots and action scenes were very well shot. The bleak tone of the scenario was very aptly captured. As the movie was not rushed you have the time to actually take in the scenery, making the scenery a character of the movie.\n\nACTING - Ben Foster was the highlight of the movie and I am happy that he was. Blunt, brute and stubborn but with a heart of gold. He felt like he had dug his hands deep into this character and he delivered perfectly. Chris Pine also showcased the finer side of his acting prowess after starring in cheesy roles and of course as Captain Kirk. Jeff Bridges, was also in his comfort zone and boy was this a step-up from R.I.P.D.\n\nFINAL VERDICT - A very mellow and probably underrated too but a must watch for people who love a slow paced movie. Due to the movies grounded tone, I felt fresh because lately I have been seeing all these cheesy movies with weak scripts botched by production houses. Very few times a movie with such a cast delivers and I can say this that this movie delivers and delivers well.",

Jeff Bridges comes in also as the comic relief in the movie providing some well needed humor in this neo crime western thriller. The chemistry between all characters in the movie is great. The soundtrack is also great featuring many poignant country songs.

Its about 2 brothers, Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) and Toby (Chris Pine), who go around robbing banks, to try and save there families land, after there mother dies. Tanner is the ruthless brother, who has just been released from jail and has a dodgy past but Toby has a clean record, and has spent time looking after his mum before she died. Whilst going through a separation with his wife, Toby plans to leave his kids there land, which has oil beneath it, but they have to buy the land before the bank takes it away from them. Whilst going on a robbing rampage, Texas ranger Marcus (Jeff Bridges), makes it his goal to catch the thieves before he retires, with his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), who questions his methods. When Marcus finally works out there pattern, the rangers finally come face to face with the robbers but Toby manages to get away. With the case closed, and the blame fully on Tanner for the robberies, Marcus works out that he wasn't working alone but there isn't enough evidence to takedown Toby, who played a big part in the robberies. It's quite a basic plot, with no thrills or twists, so I was surprised that it went down so well with audiences. The cast played there roles extremely well, and the chemistry between the two brothers is very believable but it seemed very one toned in my eyes. There is some enjoyable wit, especially between Marcus and Alberto, which lightened up the intense mood but I still was expecting more from this western. Watchable!\r\n\r\nRound-Up:\r\nThis movie was directed by David Mackenzie, 50, who also brought you The Last Wilderness, Young Adam, Asylum, Hallam Foe, Spread, Perfect Sense, You Instead and the great Starred Up starring Jack O'Connell. He certainly has covered many genres throughout his career, and he was a surprising choice to take on a western, because he is born in Scotland and his last film was a prison drama. He done a good job with the script, which was written by Taylor Sheridan who brought you Sicario, and he put together a great cast, who were perfect for there roles. At 67 years old, Jeff Bridges has proved, time and time again, that he still has it, and with a role in the upcoming Kingsman sequel, Kingsman: The Golden Circle, and another 4 projects in the pipeline, he certainly isn't planning to stop acting any time soon. Anyway, I can understand why people enjoyed it but I still preferred No Country For Old Men.\r\n\r\nBudget: $12million\r\nWorldwide Gross: $27million\r\n\r\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their crime/western/dramas, starring Ben Foster, Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, Gil Birmingham, Katy Mixon, Dale Dickey, Buck Taylor, William Sterchi, Kristin Berg, Jackamoe Buzzell. 5/10",

Meanwhile, Jeff Bridges plays the burbling racist Ranger on their tail - or, at the very least, sitting around at the next potential crime scene hoping they'll show up.\nFamily politics and anti-capitalism pretend to play a part, too, but are drowned out by pitch black comedy and the gleefully chilidish chase at the film's heart. Hell or High Water is at its best when it delivers facetious laughs and surprise sucker punches. Its at its worst whenever it pretends to be anything more than a bit of good ol' dusty fun.",

            "content": "Scottish director David Mackenzie has steadily been making a name for himself over the years with some strong, low-key work in his native Scotland; Hallam Foe, Young Adam and, especially, Perfect Sense showcased his obvious abilities. It would seem that it was his superb prison drama Starred Up in 2013 that caught everyone's eye, though. Hell or High Water now sees him taking his first venture onto American soil but it doesn't hinder his abilities in the slightest. If anything, it has proven that Mackenzie is a director of genuine quality. \n\nPlot: Needing to pay off the reverse mortgage on their recently deceased Mother's ranche, brothers Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) target several branches of the Texas Midland Bank to raise the money. This invites the attention of Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) who is doggedly determined in tracking them down and putting an end to their spate of robberies.\n\nIt doesn't take long to realise that Hell or High Water is a very different type of western. It's one that, for obvious reasons, has been labelled as a \"neo-western\" but it's contemporary nature is the very angle in which it's able to fully explore its themes. The west has changed and the end of its way of life is fast approaching the characters of Taylor Sheridan's dense script. He makes regular mention of the passage of time, ever changing landscapes and epoch's; if it wasn't the white settlers taking the land from the natives then it's the banks foreclosing on it, forcing families into debt and desperation. \n\nThis is ultimately the motivation that drives the antagonists as other subtle hints on the state of the American economy are delivered under the guise of a crime/heist film. What we see on the surface of Hell or High Water doesn't begin to describe the many layers underneath. And that's ultimately what sets it apart from most other films of the genre. \n\nAs mentioned, Sheridan's script is multilayered and he also incorporates the themes of brotherly love, loss, family responsibility and ownership which are demonstrated through crisp dialogue and genuinely dramatic (and sometimes darkly humorous) exchanges between the mismatched characters. \n\nSpeaking of which, the characters are authentically drawn while also excellently played by the three leads; Pine exudes a brooding intensity while Foster is allowed more room to explore the unhinged sociopath. Now that Bridges is getting older, he has pretty much mastered the surly old-codger routine and does so again with great authority and panache. \n\nThere's a deliberate pace to the film, so those expecting tension filled bank robberies and high speed chases will have to be patient. These moments are provided but they come at the cost of investing your time in the characters. And it's an investment that pays off. \n\nIt also helps that's its beautifully shot by Giles Nuttgens and Mackenzie makes good use of the photography and employs a meditative approach to the proceedings while showing an assured confidence in his direction. \n\nA rich and rewarding western crime story that delivers on many levels. It's broad strokes signify a maturity and that maturity is tied up with a very satisfying conclusion.\n\nMark Walker",

Its a story about a man who loses his mother to cancer & he goes to rob banks to help pay off the land to give it to his sons. Not being a criminal, he asks his career criminal brother to give him help while fending off 2 best friend Texas rangers. The performances in Hell or High Water were great. From Chris Pine to Ben Foster to Jeff Bridges to Gil Bermingham, all fantastic & this film is very character driven. The cinematography was also so beautiful, a lot of earthy tones. The writing & the story is so compelling & sucks you in all the way through the film. Hell or High Water is amazing.",

Brought to life by the directors of little seen but solid Citadel, Hell or High Water is a solidly crafted and comfortably familiar cat and mouse bank heist film in said neo western vein that is very enjoyable despite being nothing overally new with solid dialogue and great performances, Worth a look for sure ;)",

            "content": "\"I've been poor my whole life, like a disease passing from generation to generation.\"\n\nOne of the great aspects of film is its unpredictability in what will or won't be a great film. Every year there seems to be one or two films that no one believed would be any good yet somehow result in being one of the most acclaimed films of the year. This year that film was Hell or High Water. Directed by David Mackenzie, this modern day western stars Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Jeff Bridges and outlines the story of two brothers who are attempting to rob banks to pay back the bank that is cheating them out of their late mother's farm and the lawmen that are chasing them. It is extremely interesting how this film had little anticipation or hype surrounding its initial release but, after it was released, it was shown to be one of the best films of the year. The directing of this film is innovative and involves both the foreground and the background of shots. Its editing is static for most of the movie with level camera shots. However, this is effective since when the camera shots are tilted, they evoke emotional responses. There are also many engaging car chases and gun fights that are both exciting and have some somber or deadly moments to it. This incorporation allows for the film to have a good balance of quiet moments and intense action filled moments, some even at the same time. This duality also is conveyed through the great performances of the main actors. While I am normally not a fan of his acting, Chris Pine does a great job as the younger less experienced brother. His constant justification of his actions and his overwhelming fear of being caught is conveyed through his expressions and acting abilities. Ben Foster also shines as the older brother to Pine. His insanity yet charm is expressed at different times and this duality makes his character interesting. Both of these actors also have chemistry together as a brotherly bond. A similar chemistry of brothers forms between Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham. Jeff Bridges is able to make his character more than the generic older cop. He has a fear of retirement and uselessness and he conveys this in friendly insults and jokes at the expense of his sidekick. Bridges is also shown to be clever, capable, sympathetic, and friendly. Birmingham is also great with a sympathetic view of the world and the way he as a Native American is treated by others. Birmingham's description of hi people's treatment connects to the main and interesting themes of the film. The film conveys a message on how Native Americans were driven off their land by those more powerful than them. This message is compared to the way many poor farmers and smaller businesses are driven away by big and corrupt businesses. This comparison and the subtle way it is expressed makes the film interesting. This film actually has few flaws in it. The pacing does drag at times. While the quieter or character based moments are welcome, they sometimes go on too long or seem unnecessary. Additionally, despite an engaging, entertaining, and a technically beautiful opening scene, the beginning of the film includes a great deal of poorly delivered exposition, However, these faults do not completely hinder the film. Overall, Hell or High Water is a western crime film with interesting characters and messages on businesses. I would recommend it to fans of modern westerns, crime movies, or strong and subtle acting.",

            "content": "Falling into the category of \"neo-western\", Hell or High Water manages to play with some familiar western tropes. Landing us square in the open Texas landscape, the imagery immediately positions itself as a leading character in the film, contrasting debt relief signs and poverty amongst pictures of oil rigs and prosperity. it's bleak but beautiful, and intentionally complex, and it lends perfectly towards three great on-screen performances by Pine, Bridges and Foster. \n\nPine and Foster play two estranged brothers who are reunited by the death of their grandmother and the ensuing fight to save their family ranch. Bridges plays a sheriff who is facing retirement but finds himself pulled into the case of a string of robberies that the greater law enforcement sees as too small to warrant attention. \n\nThe film opens with a scene of a small, unpolished robbery sequence that introduces us to the fact that it is the two brothers that are committing the robbery. The real question of the film is why they are robbing the banks, and this question is probed throughout the duration of the film. It is this question that also provides the nuanced moral landscape that pulls us back and forth from good intentions to questionable choices. In this way, the film toys with the romance of the outlaw, which is really where we find the true brilliance of the film. The story is simple, almost familiar, but it is the feature-length character study  that makes the story so intriguing and watchable. There is no clear-cut redemptive story at play here, and no clear-cut villain or hero.\n\nIt would be hard to speak of this film without mentioning the obvious. There is a sort of dark humor at play, particularly in the performances, that warrant comparisons to the Coen Brothers (particularly No Country For Old Men). But the film is more than just a copy of their familiar literary style, and the performances ensure that Hell or High Water paves it's own path. What is most interesting about the performances is the way it taking actors (certainly Pine and Bridges) most accustomed to lead roles and playing them off each other in three supporting roles. No single character is asked to carry the film, and while this might diminish the ability of the film to represent a single, stand-out performance, what it does is open the door for the actors to truly engage their roles without the added pressure. We see this mostly in the down and gritty performance of Pine, who plays the more grounded brother (Foster is the more off-the-cuff character most likely to make the questionable choices along the way) who becomes less grounded as the story goes on. Pine really offers an intriguing character study as one who must navigate his character with subtle purpose as he moves back and forth between this complicated development. Bridges is equally good in his role, and is offered an opportunity to engage a performance that is a bit more straight-forward and on the surface than Pine's, which shows to be a nice fit (and requires equal balance) for a man who is used to giving everything to characters that require an immense level of depth. It is nice to see him give a performance that is so relaxed. \n\nHell or High Water is set in an age past, but it feels incredibly in tune and relevant as a piece that seems adept at giving a nod to the coming future.",

Two brothers rob banks, that are, in a way, robbing them (and us).  Love the use of the billboards as signs of the times!  And the musical score is perfect - is it a deep violin or a cello? - just perfect!  As good as the acting is, two supporting characters sort of just up and steal their respective scenes!  The old man in the bank and the old rattlesnake waitress (who, in my opinion deserves to get the Oscar as best supporting actress going away!)  I love the pace and tenor of this film and I could probably watch it all day!  And the ending is perfect!  Great film!",

            "content": "Today I'm going to give you my review of the 2016 film Hell or High Water. This movie is about a couple of brothers robbing banks to raise money that they owe to a bank. I don't want to tell you why they owe money exactly, because I feel like the story is better off if you find out while watching it, like I did. This movie is honestly my favorite that I've seen this year and today I'm going to tell you guys why this movie is such a classic.\n\nThe biggest thing that stuck out to me was the performances of all the actors/actresses in this film, so I'll just go through the list. First off, Chris Pine does an absolutely amazing job in this movie, even though he was great in Star Trek and pretty good in this years Finest Hours, I would say this is the best performance he has given this year, and maybe even the best in his career. One thing I really loved about this performance was the accent that Chris Pine used in this movie, it was very very believable. He also brings a dark and realistic tone to this movie that really sets the tone for this movie and drives the story to be more believable and more relatable. Now Ben Foster in this movie really is unbelievable in this movie, he really embodies this role, while I was watching the movie I couldn't even tell that it was Ben Foster, he does a great job in every way, all in all it was a perfect performance, and I really hope to see him get at least an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. Now another actor that I firmly believe should be nominated for a best supporting role was Jeff Bridges, who plays this sheriff who is on the verge of retirement and this is his last rodeo, he spends most the movie trying to track down the two criminal brothers. He adds some comedy to this film that fits in perfect, there is not too many jokes and they all seem to hit at perfect times. Jeff Bridges just like Chris Pine gives a great accent that is very believable and feels real. The chemistry between him and Gil Birmingham was perfect, their dialog felt so real it left me wanting to see more of them two together. At the end of the day the performances of this movie were amazing everyone in this film does an absolutely incredible job!\n\nAnother thing I really loved in this movie was the music, it really fit so perfectly with the film. The score has kind of a western music theme to it, and it fits so well. The music was so subtle and it just makes you feel more connected with the world, just like every musical score should do.\n\nI also believe that David Mackenzie did a great job directing the movie, every shot felt so real and it felt like it really fit with the tone of this film. David Mackenzie is really a great up and coming directer and I'm excited to see what he does next.",

The so called bubble, make home owners unaware of the major treat of banks taking advantage of their costumers and scamming to the point of foreclosure. Is hard to say how many families were hurt by this, but the idea of someone taking the law in their own hands is another story.\n\nToby and Tanner Howard brothers living in a rural town in Texas, are holding a big plan to rob several branches of Texas Midland Banks in the early morning. Toby (Chris Pine) a divorced father and Tanner (Ben Forster) an ex-con mother passed away recently, leaving their ranch in a debt due to a reverse mortgage,Toby thinks this is the best way to find the money to pay the debt.\n\nTexas Rangers Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alrberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) are assigned to the case. Hamilton is close to retire, he figure out the plan of the brothers Howard set in motion a plan to catch them with the help of Arlberto Parker. \n\n\"Hell or Highwater\" is considered by a neo-western film, because all the elements used to tale the story as well of the esthetics and look of the cowboy movies. After careful analysis you can tell the director David Mackenzie and writer Taylor Sheridan dig deeper into western movies to metaphorically represents two cowboys robbing banks looking for poetic justice, been chased by the sherif who is sure from the very beginning who is the mastermind in this crime. \"Hell or Highwater\" have several connotations of the struggle of the good vs evil, bringing the enigma of who is the real bad guy, like in Clint Eastwood \"Unforgiven\" as well social criticism to private institutions who sometimes are not the good guys, but the bad guys, just ripping people off, as a consequence there is a quest for full revenge.\n\nThe all star cast deliver a great performance and Nick Cave & Warren Ellis presents one of the finest original score on screen.",

While it offers nothing new in terms of plot, narrative or screenplay - it more than makes up through confident direction, well defined character arcs and excellent performances throughout. \n\nToby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster) are estranged brothers who led completely different lives - one (Toby) as a doting son, caring husband and father, while the other (Tanner) has been on the wrong side of the law from the beginning who has spent most of his time in various prisons for petty thefts and robberies. When the bank announces to foreclose their property due to unpaid debts just when Toby discovers oil in their farm, he is desperate to get possession of it before it is reclaimed by the bank forever. Toby comes up with a plan to rob the same bank (multiple of its branches) and seeks assistance from his brother Tanner who regularly agrees. What happens when the plan is set in motion and a retiring police chief Marcus from a small town starts investigating.\n\nChris Pine was a revelation in this role. While it is not intense or award worthy, he does complete justice by portraying a stubborn, meticulous and sometimes desperate man to get over with what they started. Jeff Bridges has some of the best lines though they range from being insensitive to downright racist - he surely offends Indian tribes, blacks, mexicans etc. along the way. But the dry humor he evokes along with his Indian partner are worth a second watch. The screenplay plays down many intense sequences to ensure they do not get sopped down or become melodramatic which would be inconsistent with the overall theme. \n\nThe setup, the screenplay that reveals the plot without the characters saying it as a narrative shows the ability of the director about the confidence and the intensity shown in the 2013 'Starred Up' was a testimony to his talent. Jeff Bridges is one of the better contemporary Hollywood actors and his choice of roles has always been that extract maximum performance within the mainstream cinema. Ben Foster plays a very generic not so bright but trigger happy ex-con which has been played over many times but still done as good as it could be.\n\nSometimes innovation is not the only answer to standout. Perfection and old school intensity does work too.",

This is the story of two brothers and their series of bank robbery job. They are doing it for a reason, but on the other end, two cops make their effort to find who they are and nab them red handed. So when they meet, that's where the story gets to its end part.\n\nIt has a strong opening, then slows down. Actually, it was approached like a classic crime film, which mean no high-tech. The story was a one liner, but the events in that story were extended. A simple screenplay, yet very effective presented on the screen. Of course the story ends with this film, but feels like there's more. It is very unlikely, though I'm thinking of a sequel.\n\nThe people will remember this film for Ben Foster and Chris Pine. One of the best duo on the screen. Easily one of the best films of the year, but just it is a different theme and genre. I watched it not knowing the meaning of the title, and then I googled it. It is nothing like a must see, but I believe that you might regret if you miss it or delay your watch. So I suggest you make a right choice.\n\n8/10",

            "content": "Desperate times. \u00a0So this is about a pair of brothers in West Texas (Chris Pine, Ben Foster). \u00a0They're not professional criminals, but that doesn't change the fact that they are robbing small banks so as to raise the money needed to save their family ranch. \u00a0I love a good crime story. \u00a0The easiest way to make this type of story accessible is to make the criminals intelligent, but novices. \u00a0This way, you, as an audience member, can put yourself in the shoes of the protagonist, and you can picture yourself being able to pull off a heist if you ever became all out of options in your own life. \u00a0Hell or High Water does exactly that, and this is a riveting and compelling crime drama.  Now this is not a very complicated story. \u00a0It's men at the end of their rope, being forced into a crime that they otherwise wouldn't commit, all the while the law moves in closer and closer. \u00a0What makes this movie so good and the reason why this is being considered for Academy Awards is due to all of the attention to detail. \u00a0This is the most Texas movie since There Will Be Blood, and after\u00a0all\u00a0is said and done, you really feel like you've taken a personal trip to the state where everything's bigger, and not to its nicer, more progressive side. \u00a0I feel like I learned two things about Texas from this movie, the first item being that open carry is in full effect, and everybody in Texas is packing. \u00a0It helps add to tension in scenes being that you know that so many civilians could potentially pull out a gun and make the situation go from bad to worse. \u00a0The second item is that everyone's a little bit racist in this state. \u00a0Jeff Bridges gives a terrific performance as a Texan detective that is close to retirement. \u00a0He still has a little bit of that True Grit accent left over, and every other sentence out of his mouth is something racially offensive, which isn't aided by the fact that he has a Native American partner. \u00a0It's almost on that level of Gran Torino where you're unsure if this is a man who just thinks racial humor is funny, or if he could potentially be the biggest racist you've ever laid eyes on.  This movie would pair terrifically with No Country for Old Men. \u00a0It is well made and character driven, and you are always interested in how it will play out. \u00a0It's all about just how quickly a simple plan can go south, and you're rooting for these guys to succeed in addition to rooting for Jeff Bridges to catch them, so it makes for an intriguing dynamic. \u00a0There's some very appropriate music featured from Nick Cave, and every time there is a showdown, you hold your breath. \u00a0It's a good, simple movie, and I will always love a movie for getting the terrific Ben Foster more work.",

In fact much is conveyed without words at all rather simply a look - you know, acting.  The setting and cinematography perfectly reveal the nature of windswept poverty, with the legacy of struggle so deep that is at once both invisible and pronounced in every character in the film - serving as backdrop and impetus for the characters of Chris Pine, Ben Hogan, and Jeff Bridges to intersect.  Beautifully directed - think Lasse Hallstrom combined with the Coen Brothers.  Highly recommend.",

Their banter is often times hilarious and feels like something real brothers would say to each other. Foster is particularly amazing at portraying Tanner as an \"aw-shucks\", charming yet lethal ex-con bank robber.  The audience can't help but like him, even though he can be a cold-blooded killer. Bridges and Birmingham give great performances as laid-back but serious Rangers on the trail of the two brothers. They are cool as beans even under gunfire. Badasses, without any posturing.\n\nThe plot is pretty straight-forward. The two brothers come up with a plan to rob from the very bank that is foreclosing on their family ranch. So they rob banks in order to come up with enough cash to pay off the bank. The story is simple but the great acting captures your attention and never lets go. Highly recommended.",

Chris Pine gives one of his best performances as one brother, and Ben Foster's performance is arguably his best. Echoing a very similar outlaw in the remake of 3:10 to Yuma, Foster does a great job of playing an unpredictable, unhinged sociopath. The performance is Oscar-nomination worthy at the very least.

            "content": "I know the comparison will not be seen as favorable to some, but elements of this movie sure do remind me of No Country for Old Men.  And I mean stylistically speaking.  Thematically, they're both very different movies, because this one tells a more personal tale of two brothers trying to fuck over the banks who fucked over their mother by giving her a loan that she could not pay back.  They do this by stealing from several of the branches that fucked their mother over and using that money to pay the bank back, which is pretty clever if you actually think about it.  And it would be cool if someone could actually do that.  And maybe someone already has, but, of course, it's not something I would go around publicizing.  I think both movies do share some thematic elements as well, such as the old ranger close to retirement finding one more chance for a last hurrah after a series of bank robberies break out reminding me of Tommy Lee Jones' character in No Country.  And the cat and mouse game that ensues as both search for their respective suspects.  One of the, many, things I like about this movie is the fact that it all seems to be heading to one direction.  There's no real deviation from that main narrative path with subplots.  Nothing to distract you from the fact that the brothers and the rangers are on a collision course.  It's just a matter of time before they find each other and all hell breaks loose.  I know it's something very simple and something that, really, every movie should do.  Just focus on exactly what you want your story to be and how you want your characters to get there.  And I realize that a lot of movies do this, but it somehow doesn't feel as focused as it does in this movie.  There's a clear endgame in sight for the story and these characters and it's just a matter of seeing how they get there.  The film is definitely very confident in the pace that it wants to tell its story.  They do not rush through any scenes and everything in the film serves a purpose, there's no wasted moments here.  All of it works to add up to the climax, which you know will be bloody and you know people will die.  So, yea, I really liked that.  Do I feel that the movie was great?  I don't know, I honestly don't feel like it was.  I think it was missing something.  While I do like the fact that the brothers pay the banks back with their own (stolen) money, I feel that the movie pretty much hit every plot point I could have reasonably expected from them.  I don't wanna say it's completely predictable, but you can see where certain things are headed before they happen.  I did like the fact that the reason Chris Pine's character did what he did was to avenge what the banks had done to his mother, but also to give his sons a future where they wouldn't have to worry about money because of the oil that was found on his land.  I liked all of that for sure.  I also thought the writing was strong and the acting was excellent.  Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges really are phenomenal here, but, to me, Ben Foster steals the show.  Ben is as underrated as they come and this is just another feather in his cap.  I can't complain about the acting in the slightest and anyone who does is clearly looking for something, anything, to hate about this movie.  But, as I said, there was just something missing that would have pushed it past the great level and maybe made it a modern classic in a couple of years' time.  I can see how people might already see it as a great movie, but I just don't.  That's not to say it isn't a damn good movie that you should see, because it is and I would definitely give it a recommendation.  But just go in with tempered expectations.  Great acting and strong writing, so, yea, you can't really go wrong here.",

            "content": "'Hell or High Water' is a Western Crime Drama that substitutes the large scale chaotic shootouts for great character depth and exploration of character relationships. Starring Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, and Ben Foster this film follows two brothers Toby (Pine) and Tanner (Foster) robbing banks to set up a better future for themselves, but they soon find themselves being tracked down by rangers Marcus (Bridges) and Alberto (Gil Birmingham) who are going for one last hunt before retirement. Performance-wise this film shines above most others to have released this year, as you completely bought into the characters at the forefront of the film and you believed the authenticity and history of their relationships without seeing any of it. Pine and Bridges especially are the standouts on either sides of the law. From a story perspective it was great to see a contemporary Western film take advantage of the characters they have and really delve deep into who they are and let those relationships and actions drive the course of the film. Because without engaging, and entertaining characters there is no reason for investment in any shootouts that may or may not occur.\n\nThe character centric nature of the film is what makes it so compelling for so long. On one hand, following the lives of these two brothers and seeing how they connect and clash with their different personalities and values offered a very complex look at these characters. Are they good people? Are they doing it for good reasons? Are they hurting people for the fun of it? Exploring all of these questions throughout the film put you on a journey with these two who you may grow to love or hate with time. And then you also have the film focusing on Marcus and Alberto and their journey just casually investigating some bank robberies and tracking down the brothers. This was a relationship that was also just as interesting as that between the brothers but for very different reasons. The way these partners go back and forth, throwing friendly insults and butting heads but ultimately tolerating each others company was a nice comparison and contrast to the relationship being shown with our bank robbers. \n\nThe slow, gradually intensifying pacing did a good job at keeping you interested for the majority of the film but could have done with a little bit of a kick somewhere in the middle of the film. It noticeably slows down for a 20 minute interval around half way through, and some of that period of time did have some interesting character dialogue happening but it was starting to lose me a little. It does then pick back up and finish very strong which was really good to see it not continue to slow down and fizzle out in the end which was a fear for around 10 minutes.\n\nAs i mentioned the performances in this film are definitely some of the strongest of the year, and although it may be a little early to tell, i wouldn't be too surprised if one of them gets a nod at the Academy Awards. Chris Pine for me was the strongest of the bunch, seeing him play a very subdued role and a different role to what he is typically cast in was very refreshing. He didn't once break character and when the movie started i thought i was going to be distracted seeing him in this Texan role but he worked his magic and i completely bought into him as this character. Ben Foster also should be recognised because he plays well together with Pine and the back and forth conversations they have are interesting on their own. Jeff Bridges is playing a character that he has more or less played in many other Western/Crime films but he is just so good in the role that you wouldn't want anyone else. \n\nSo 'Hell or High Water' is a really solid film that is very well crafted and features great all round performances and a very compelling character centric story. You get on board with these characters and are on a journey with both sides of the law so you feel a connection with both sets of characters making pivotal moments in the film that much more intense. \n\n8/10",

With the help of his other brother, Tanner (Ben Foster: OSCAR WATCH), Toby takes to robbing small-town banks. A law enforcement officer (Jeff Bridges) and his partner (Gil Birmingham) try to catch the criminals.\n\nI read about this movie in a magazine this past Summer before its limited release and was intrigued by the idea of Chris Pine starring in a small-scale independent film. The magazine praised his performance almost as much as they praised Ben Foster's, and other reviews for the limited release echoed these sentiments. Finally, the movie was released digitally, so I had an opportunity to see what the hype was about. Hot damn, was this movie fun!\n\nThis is a drama first and foremost. As much as we all love shoot-em-ups, it's good to see a crime film with such richly developed characters. Ben Foster has never been better - watch out for him come awards season for Supporting Actor. His troubled past and care for his younger brother really define him. Chris Pine came to play, too. We know him for his blockbuster hits like Star Trek, but he showed that he can tone it down and deliver an emotional performance as well. Jeff Bridges is exactly what you'd want Jeff Bridges to be when portraying a southern cop; his relationship with his partner reminded me of Hank and his partner from Breaking Bad, and both of their characters had depth beyond chasing the crooks as well. David Mackenzie is not a name I'm familiar with, but he really crafted something big here. The beautiful scenic shots of rural Texas, in addition to the perfect film score, really gives this setting an authentic feeling.\n\nOverall, this movie has everything I want from an independent drama: solid writing, outstanding acting, and emotions. Hopefully this marks a turning point in the two young stars' careers.\n\nFinal grade: A\n\n-Ben\n\nOverall, this movie has everything I wa",

            "content": "Hell or High Water is an amazing and gripping western heist film. It stars Chris Pine, Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges, and Gil Birmingham. Chris Pine and Ben Foster play brothers who start robbing banks for a personal reason. Chris Pine and Ben Foster both deliver career defining performances and have great on screen chemistry. Chris Pine delivers a subtle and emotionally reserved performance, that really cements him as a great dramatic actor. Ben Foster turns in what I think is the best performance of the movie and his career. He plays an unpredictable, charismatic, and borderline-crazy ex-con. His character commits horrid actions towards the end of the movie, and other things he's done are hinted at, but he's so likable thanks to Foster's performance and the script, that it's extremely difficult to dislike or root against him. Jeff Bridges play's an aging soon to retire texas ranger, who takes on one more case before leaving the force for good. He delivers a performances akin to True Grit (2010) and Crazy Heart (2009). He turns in a great performance, one that deserves a spot on his decade spanning filmography. He has great chemistry with his partner, played by Gil Birmingham, and it was fun to watch them interact and try and track down the bank robbers (Pine and Foster). This film has great direction, and thats thanks to David Mackenzie. He previously directed Starred Up, one of my personal favorite films of 2013. He's great at directing characters, scenery, and action. The script was written by Taylor Sheridan who has a great track record, this being his second script after Sicario, which was one of my favorites of 2015. Here he crafts great dialogue, interesting and believable characters, and is able to mix in elements of comedy, with creating an inconsistent tone. The score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis is great, and really helps set the scene, set the tone, and build tension. Finally the cinematography by Giles Nuttgens is great, and there are some really good shots in this film. I'd say this a must see, and I'd recommend watching it as soon as you can.",

And the remainder of the film, all the way up until the bittersweet closing shot, doesn't disappoint. The story is set in a post-GFC West Texas and follows two bank-robbing brothers who have underlying motives to their unlawful actions (to tell would spoil the narrative's wonderful drip-feed style), whilst also tracking the soon-to-be-retired Ranger who's seeking to finish his career on a high. Taylor Sheridan's screenplay is remarkably simple yet effective, wisely resisting the temptation to resort to thriller-ish tropes despite ostensibly playing like one. He allows the multi-layered characters to do all the heavy lifting and is rewarded with a cast that absolutely nails it. As polar opposite siblings who share an unbreakable bond, Chris Pine and Ben Foster are magnetic; the former a level-headed brooder with the weight of the world on his shoulders, the latter an unpredictable live wire who would gladly kill for his younger brother. On the other side of the fence, Jeff Bridges brings his A-game as a sardonic law-enforcement veteran who is equal parts intelligent and stubborn, terrifically supported by an understated Gil Birmingham as his oft-tormented partner. Most impressively the film doesn't seem to pass judgment on any of the characters (or at least not until late in the piece), allowing them to exist without labelling them good or bad; they all have parts of themselves that fit into both categories. Director David Mackenzie also deserves a lot of praise, as he sublimely balances the need for a tight and tense plot whilst simultaneously allowing his characters ample room to breathe and grow. Mackenzie also gets the very best out of his cinematographer Giles Nuttgens who delivers bold, sharp and stylish camera movements in addition to a level of photography (i.e., lighting and framing) that is as good as you'll see this year. Narratively powerful, visually mesmerising and backed to Nick Cave's transcendent soundtrack, Hell or High Water is one of the finest motion pictures of 2016.",

After I left, it is possible that some strong women characters suddenly materialised but it would have been too little, too late.

About two brothers, one a divorced father, Tanner, played superbly by Ben Foster and the other Toby, played impressively by Chris Pine in a scene-stealing performance, who is a hot-headed ex-convict with a lose trigger finger. Both Foster and Pine share great chemistry as brothers who plan a series of brazen robberies against the bank that is about to foreclose on their family ranch, to make a better life for Tanner's young son and themselves. But standing in their way is Marcus, played brilliantly by old pro Jeff Bridges, a crafty, hardened veteran Texas Ranger about to retire in a few weeks. As the brothers prepare for their final heist, they must also get ready for a showdown with this relentless lawman. Astute direction by Mackenzie, who gives his wonderful film suspense, humor and some heartfelt tragic moments. Gorgeous cinematography by Glles Nuttgens, and a perfect original score by Nick Cave & Warren Ellis. An engaging modern western. Highly recommenced.",

The start had no speaking just music (great musical score), of driving down a rural West Texas highway and the problems that plague the local population of farm owners by showing billboards of bank acquired land for sale accompanied by area economic collapse. Then it pans to two middle aged men who quickly mask themselves and walk into a small town bank. The two men, Chris Pine (Star Trek) and Ben Foster (3:10 To Yuma) play \"The Howard\" brothers who live very different lives (one a jailbird and the other a family man rancher), but have an unbreakable bond towards family and will do anything to preserve their home, culture and life by robbing small town banks to pay off their recently deceased Mothers mortgage on their land. The viewers soon learn that this is a last option for the brothers, knowing that they need to pay back the banks within a week. They soon rob many banks quickly in the area and get the attention of the local Texas Rangers office and their old/ready to retire head ranger Jeff Bridges (Crazy Heart) who signs up using his experience as a detective to catch the local bandits. This movie becomes a cat and mouse game of bank robbers who have a running clock towards losing their home and an old Texas Ranger who wants one last hoorah before retiring. One side is going to win. Small characters like Katy Mixon, Marin Ireland, and Gil Birmingham (mostly television work) also portray their characters to perfection.\n\nChris Pine, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges all should win an Academy Award for their performances and this movie should at least be nominated for the best of the 2016-2017 season. Please go see it! Thank me later.",

            "content": "Bank heist suspense thriller is the best film so far in 2016\n\nFew films can deliver everything to moviegoers seeking the most bang for their box office buck.  Drama and comedy, perhaps.  Maybe even some sentimental chick flick mixed in with a thrilling suspense story.  Now toss in a modern Western cowboy feature with risky bank robberies in the Lone Star State.  For a motion picture to invoke each of these film genres in the same movie, airtight scripts must come alive through magnificent screen performances.  \"Hell or High Water\" powerfully achieves both and is by far the best film I've seen this year!\n\nThe shear strength of \"Hell or High Water\" resides in one of the strongest ensemble casts of 2016 and an authentic, captivating story to tell.  Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges stars as a long in the tooth Texas Ranger named Marcus Hamilton, who desires to bring swift justice to the pair of bank bandits before his pending retirement. \n\nBridges may be the film's most accomplished and notable Hollywood face, but his performance is matched along every stretch of west Texas highway by a very formidable Ben Foster (\"Lone Survivor\"). Riding shotgun to Foster's volatile Tanner Howard character is none other than \"Star Trek Beyond\" captain Chris Pine, portraying Tanner's younger brother Toby.  Together this trio play a game of cat and mouse, with viewers hoping no losers emerge in the end.  Credit the veteran Bridges for bringing out the career film bests for both Foster and Pine.\n\nThis film may be promoted as two brothers robbing banks, however, it's more about two give-and-take relationships.  These dueling bonds consist of one representing the law with Bridges' and his Texas Ranger sidekick, the other a brotherhood of outlaws raised in an abusive household.  One rapport the culmination of years serving together and the other a result of years spent apart.\n\nWielding a razor-sharp script from Taylor Sheridan (who wrote last year's phenomenal \"Sicario\" screenplay), \"Hell or High Water\" backs up to their getaway car with deeply satisfied theater audiences in close chase.  And combined with remarkable cinematography brandishing vast lands and small town life, \"Hell or High Water\" has confidently ordered all other 2016 films to get down on the floor and not move. At least for now.  \n\nIn 2012, \"Hell or High Water\" earned The Black List award for the most liked motion picture \"screenplay not yet produced\" from voters consisting of studio and production company executives. Historically, over 25% of the screenplays making The Black List have later earned an Oscar nomination, including; \"Argo\", \"American Hustle\", \"The King's Speech\", \"Slumdog Millionaire\", \"Spotlight\" and \"The Revenant\".  Not bad company.  \n\nIs \"Hell or High Water\" a shoo-in for an Academy Award nomination come January?  You can bank on it.\n\nGrade: A+",

The style, writing, cinematography, and script definitely owe a lot to films like Blood Simple and No Country For Old Men, but it certainly stands on its own! The film centers on two brothers, played brilliantly by Chris Pine and Ben Foster, who begin robbing the banks that have screwed their family over in an attempt at a Robin Hood-style revenge while a grizzled, Texas Ranger played by Jeff Bridges, pursues. Chris Pine and Ben Foster have immaculate chemistry together and though it's great to see a rougher side to Pine, Ben Foster steals this entire movie as the unstable side of the equation who's already done time in prison and will not go back. Jeff Bridges is also the best he's been in years here, using a Southern drawl not dissimilar to his delivery in True Grit, and his best moments are the playful banter he has with his partner, played by Gil Birmingham who is definitely the break-out actor here! The film is directed by David Mackenzie, who's made a couple films prior, but this will clearly be his break-out film and he deserves much praise for crafting an air-tight film that never stopped surprising me. The script is written by Taylor Sheridan, who also wrote Sicario, and features much of the same grit and realism while crafting some truly bad-ass scenarios for the characters to take part in. This is not a super fast-paced film, it spends time developing its very strong characters, but when the bullets do fly, the tone completely shifts and you will be holding your breath during the shoot-outs, car chases, and pretty much the entire climax. I absolutely loved this film and it really proves that the script is key, and you don't have to to attempt over-blown action and A-list movie stars to get the job done. Hell or High Water is a flawless film that will stand out for years to come, and I cannot wait to watch it again!",

Firstly the portrayal of west Texas as a region suffering from decay and predatory banking is astonishingly irrelevant to modern day - a period of intense growth and low unemployment in the state.  Worst of all, the film's \"solution\" for the protagonist's poverty revolves around the discovery of oil on his property.  This is 2016!  Oil prices are so low that existing oil wells are shutting down...not opening up to make new millionaires.  Also the big oil industry is in North Dakota now.   Why on earth is this film set in Texas 2016???  If you want to write a sob story about Texas, then make it about bad traffic or set it back in time 100 years!",

Jeff Bridges plays Marcus Hamilton, a wily Texas Ranger who is about to retire, hunting two bank robbing brothers, Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Payne and Ben Foster) who are hoping to raise enough money to save their family farm which is under threat of foreclosure from the bank they're robbing.\n\nPine and Foster are a superb double act as chalk and cheese brothers but the pair are eclipsed by Bridges who puts in a career best performance for which he's likely to get nominations come award season. In addition to some memorable supporting roles, edgy script and dark humour; the striking visuals of long flat landscapes, empty skies and hardscrabble communities together with an expansive, melancholic soundtrack, beautifully depicts a blighted Texas and of an age gone by.\n\nWhist the plot is pretty conventional, grizzly cops and outlaw siblings with violent tempers are hardly a novelty, Hell Or High Water is a riveting heist movie with action and drama that maintains the suspense with the audience never knowing where they stand. One of the best films of the year, a new Western classic and an award contender.",

            "content": "The modern American western film has got a makeover over the past decade, with works of art like 'No Country for Old Men' earning praise from critics and attendance at the box office. In CBS Film's 'Hell or High Water,' the best and worst aspects of West Texas are highlighted as two brothers rob banks and make bank.\n\nChris Pine and Ben Foster tag-team as amateur bandits in the film, cruising through dusty plains in search of easy target branches of the Texas Midlands Bank. The reason? To grab enough cash to ensure their deceased mother's ranch does not fall into foreclosure and be claimed by the bank. The plot is a great example of the dog-eat-dog cycle that can result in this kind of a \"wild wild west,\" \"anything goes\" environment, and the accompanying screenplay clearly conveys this. The aforementioned actors bring their A-game, with Foster giving a particularly convincing performance thanks to his 'bad boy' persona. But it is the legendary Jeff Bridges who steals the show as his role as nearly-retired Lubbock sheriff Marcus Hamilton.\n\nIn addition to the solid story and potentially award nomination-worthy acting, 'High Water' is a classically told drama that benefits from its simpleness. At the heart of the film is the concept of family, and the lengths to which some will go to ensure the lives of their children are better than their own are. Pine's character helps this come across, as he is seen as a sympathetic figure despite his criminality. Also, the duality between him and his brother is stark, which is perhaps the reason they make a successful team. But it is the dialogue that really brings everything together, with Bridges' quips and rifle barrel banter adding enough flare.\n\nWhile 'Hell or High Water' likely won't win many awards thanks to a likely crowded field during the fall and winter, it's a strong, small-budget effort that should be highly regarded.",

I realize now that it was intentional. You get a feel for the pace and tone as the movie goes along.\nI will say the pace is....Texan.  Not slow, but a bit drawn out, and since it's set in Texas, this too must be intentional.  Beautifully calculated mixed with the most unusual yet stunning music, scenery, and humor.  I was laughing at some very inappropriate jokes, but I couldn't help it!  They all had some memorable and witty one liners.\nDid I mention the scenery?  The sky. I've always said the best thing about Texas is how huge the sky is.  You can see this in the film, several times.  That with the sweat, flies, music, and bank robbing, make it a real \"western\".\nOh, the acting-I almost forgot to talk about it because it was so good, I didn't feel like any of them were acting, I just felt like I was there. Taken from my real day to day crap and plopped in the middle of Texas on a hellish day 'bout ta have me sum fun.  And that's all and everything I want in a movie.",

            "content": "What defines a \"western\"? Is it cowboys? Guns? Horses? Boots? Or is it its morals of American masculinity itself; a study of what does, and what should, make a man? No matter what the criteria, Hell or High Water fits. Sure, it's not the typical period piece fare we normally get from the genre, but it's a wonderfully old-fashioned yarn that would've been a hit in most bygone eras. Only an \"indie\" by the most basic description, its qualitative and crowd-pleasing reach much exceeds its financial grasp. Boasting funny, enthralling, and character-filled fun from start to finish, this unconventional cowboy chronicle is the movie we've wanted all year.\nIt's the story of the bank-robbing Howard brothers (Pine, Foster) and the nearly-retired lawman (Bridges) who's hot on their tales. The script is perfect, from the dialogue to the plotting to the characters to the themes. The simplicity of its cat-and-mouse setup allows the thematic and ethical complexities to unravel as the story does, instead of forcing it through hackneyed exposition. Touching on topics like the dangers of nostalgia, flawed justice, colonialism, and western heroism, its thematic richness is only matched by its penetrating visuals.\nWith anti-hero films filling the cinematic landscape nowadays, this is more a \"pro-human\" film. We find ourselves \"rooting\" for everyone, not because they're necessarily \"justified\", but because we know them. Director MacKenzie is a proven actors-director, and the performances here are utterly naturalistic and masterful. Along with a wonderful soundtrack and grimily stellar sets and costumes, it's an enveloping viewing experience you feel like you're living. As entertainingly cool as it is penetratingly artful, HoHW is far-and-away my favorite film of 2016.",

It had a Western, Neo Noir feel.  Great acting throughout led by Chris Pine, Ben Foster, Gil Birmingham and the great Jeff Bridges.  They bring their characters to life and help make the story more believable and real.   \n\nThere were some great comedic spots, mainly between the marshals, mixed with some thrilling action sequences.  It had a gritty, real-life feel thanks to the setting of a dusty, small town in West Texas.  The cinematography was great, with more than a few wonderful shot selections.\n\nThe only thing I disliked about this film is that it felt like something was missing.  I can't put my finger on it, but to me the film isn't perfection.  I had the same issue with Sicario also; maybe I should check out some more films written by Taylor Sheridan and see if I have the same feeling.\n\nWith all of this said, I would most definitely recommend Hell or High Water.",

            "content": "This is the second movie I have seen by writer Taylor Sheridan who also wrote the best film I saw last year, Sicario. The film is as dusty and desolate as the west Texas towns it features. It stars Jeff Bridges as a ruggedly ragged, past his prime Texas Ranger who needs the thrill of one last manhunt before he is put out to pasture. His performance is subtle and powerful, proving again that he is one of the best actors working today. Chris Pine (Star Trek's Captain Kirk) plays Toby, the older and more rational brother of thrill seeking Ben Foster's Tanner, two men forced by the many failures in their lives into robbing banks.\n\nThe brothers are on a desperate quest to steal and launder enough money from several small town bank branches to pay off the reverse mortgage their dying mother took out before the bank repossesses their family ranch and the rich oil deposits that lie beneath it. The brother's know their mother was taken advantage of by the same banks that they now steal from. Toby's meticulous plan to rob the banks is slowly unraveled as his uncontrollable brother ratchets up the violence and risk after each successive robbery.\n\nThe cinematography is unflinching in showing us a dying American culture.  Small towns are filled with payday loan stores, shuttered businesses and the hopelessness of people with no future. The only ones profiting from this desperation are the financial institutions that use poverty to their advantage to squeeze the last remaining value out of people with no other options.\n\nThis film is a metaphor for the struggle between the ever declining American middle and lower class folks who slip deeper and deeper in debt and the financial institutions who legally shake them down for every last nickel and then leave them destitute. One steals with impunity and is protected by the laws it pays politicians to write, the other steals for survival and faces certain death or imprisonment if captured.\n\nIt is ultimately a story of brotherhood, both blood and badge, of failure and redemption, and of repayment of debts owed. It is a modern day Robin Hood tale without a happy ending. In a season of sequels and blockbusters, this small, quiet film portrays the despondency of small town America and it's need to grasp onto something, anything, that gives it hope. Even if that hope is in the form of yet another smooth talking rich guy who will smile and shake their hands while he steals their future and pads his own pockets (Yeah, I figured out a way to criticize Trump with my review).\n\nHell or High Water - A",

Things quickly turn serious as they are hunted by the area sheriff Marcus (Jeff Bridges) and his partner Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham). While I wasn't quite as in love with it as the critics' consensus, the film holds it own with solid quality.\n\nWatching Hell Or High Water wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable without the solid cast. Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster were amazing bringing in some of the strongest performances I've seen this year. Bridges' character Marcus is on his way out the door as sheriff, but you get the feeling he's been doing nothing but speaking his mind (in a non-pc way) long before he knew he was retiring. He's extremely stubborn, not knowing how to let things go. Five minutes with Marcus on-screen and you can probably name someone in your life just like him. He's relatable while Foster's character Tanner is completely off his rocker. He's the guy you see coming and you cross the street, that person you know that asks you to hang out but you avoid them at all costs because you know how the night's going to end up. While Tanner is the type of person that has never run across any trouble that he didn't like, he's also endearing to a certain extent as his sole purpose is to help out his brother.\n\nMy one gripe with the movie is that the action fizzles in certain spots. Mind you, it's not supposed to be an action movie so I wasn't grossly disappointed, but I expected slightly more from a movie that has a lot to do with bank robberies. Again, not the end of the world, I just want to make sure I tame expectations ahead of time.\n\nAt the end of the day, the movie is not about the action but about the relationships between brothers and cops which you come to learn isn't really all that different. Brothers, just like cops, always tend to have each others' backs even when one hates what the other does. In one scene, Tanner finds himself in trouble with two guys at a gas station. Toby scolds Tanner for putting himself in such a position, but not before he beats the crap out of one of the guys and causes the other guy to run away. Meanwhile, Marcus' constant ribbing of his partner Alberto is a typical sign of love and respect. At first you think Marcus is a flat-out racist, but you quickly come to understand that he's trying to pass the sheriff torch in his own way. The insults he throws at Alberto are not just funny, but, in a weird way, a little touching.\n\nHell Or High Water is highly entertaining even without big-budget action sequences. I give it an 85.",

The thing that Hell or High Water had in spades, that every other film I saw in a theater this summer lacked, is well-developed interesting characters. They managed to make me care about every single main character, and sympathize with them all. There are few stories that I can remember where one character is pursuing another and I both want the pursuit to be successful, but also don't want the targeted character to get caught. That kind of internal conflict is such a complex and fascinating combination of emotions, that it takes a truly special film to give me that experience. The plot itself is revealed slowly, which keeps you dialed in and watching intently for what will happen next. I love that the movie found it more important to spend the early scenes establishing why we should like Chris Pine and Ben Foster rather than why they are doing what they are doing. It's a clever plan when they finally reveal everything, and it helped me to connect with them even more. Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham were spectacular, and their teasing banter back and forth was delightful. In many ways they act like a set of brothers, in order to perfectly mirror the brothers they are pursuing. The relationships between all of the characters comes across as very authentic, because this is how real people act with their coworkers, family, and so forth. When I left the theater I thought \"Man, that was a good movie.\" But as I've had more time to sit with it I keep recalling scenes that I loved, moments that impacted me, lines that made me laugh, and so much more. Hell or High Water exceeded all of my expectations and is easily one of my favorite films of 2016.",

It says a lot when a movie really takes  a hold of you, even though it is based in the West Texas wasteland and the action is very limited.  This works because the movie is really two stories about two partnerships, one between brothers and the others between partners.  I like how unfair the movie ends up being to those in it that really shouldn't be the ones getting the short end.  I'm not sure if this will end up on any Oscar lists, but the acting is top notch and so is the writing.  Jeff Bridges can't seem to play anything but an old wrangled up weird talking southern dude anymore, but it works for this flick that is for sure.  Life has tons of regret attached to it, and man does that come forward for all of these characters.  I guess that is what happens if you live in West Texas.",

The performances of Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster were solid, but everyone else seemed a bit unsure of themselves or who their characters were supposed to be. There were also a few jarring changes of pacing and tone that stood out, and scenes where you could see what kind of tension or suspense they were going for, but for some reason, it just doesn't quite land.

            "content": "A damn near perfect film from talented director Mackenzie and writer of the similarly confident, slow-burn thriller Sicario. It's the voice of of the characters that really sets the film apart. So few film writers have the same level of voice as do playwrights. It is due to that voice that this film about two bank robbing brothers stands out and above any bank heist or Western genre films from recent memory. Set in the recession-plagued dust of West Texas two brothers set to robbing branches of the bank that is set to foreclose on the land they grew up on. \n\nFoster has the showier role as the loose-cannon brother with a criminal history. He is afforded shades of character in both his love for his brother and the unexpected backstory that conflicts with his love of crime. Foster has a tendency to overact and that is still true here, but Mackenzie keeps him reigned in enough so that he doesn't topple the deliberate pace of the film. Pine plays the other brother who is motivated by love of family. It'll get less attention, but Pine turns off the smarm and seems lived-in with his soft-spoken Toby determined and cautious as the jobs grow more dangerous.\n\nThe authorities are hot on their heels, as the brothers only rob drawers in denominations of 20 and under. The cat and mouse factor is keyed in by about to retire Jeff Bridges. One last case and all that jazz. The trickiest part of the film is balancing the humor (because it does have a few good laughs) from Bridges' politically incorrect Ranger without it becoming a distraction. His partner is Mexian and Native American, and nigh a scene goes by without Bridges' character making a crack about it. It seems that it's there to make a point about these old ideas and old places dying away. His partner Alberto, is shown being hurt by the comments, and in turn Bridges seems hurt that his \"humor\" isn't found funny. It does enough to humanize Alberto (and the added bonus of a strong performance from Birmingham) that it plays as a critique of Old West dying in the face of New West.\n\nAs Toby and Tanner close in on their final goal (which isn't fully revealed until well into the film) everything culminates into one very well-staged shootout. Real stakes are present, and the filmmaking never falters. Mackenzie's opening long-shot is a panoramic beauty, and really sets the stage for the intentional pace and explosions of unexpected and visceral violence. And for a Scot he does a great job of making Texas a character in the film. From the vistas and dust to the running gag of everyone having a gun. Throw in a score from Western specialist Nic Cave & Warren Ellis and you have familiar elements rearranged just enough, and with enough expertise it feels new and exciting.\n\nOutside of some obvious ADR and the wince-inducing racist jokes, there is only a few other passages of dialogue that hit a bit on the nose (white people taking Indian land, banks taking it back). It also sticks the landing in the fatalistic ways you expect, and in a way you may not. It's a gem of a film that deserves to be more than an indie favorite. A victory for mid-budget adult-film making.",

            "content": "Awards season has truly begun now, Hell or High Water is about two brothers robbing small bank branches whist being pursued by two rangers across Texas. This film was not in my anticipated list at all, I was not even remotely excited to watch this when the first trailer came out...then the reviews came in. With such high ratings, I had to see what all the fuss was about and I can honestly say the high ratings are justified. Hell or High Water is so close to perfection, so close! What brings this film to those heights you ask? The acting. All three main actors in the film are perfect and to be honest all deserve nominations for atleast\u00a0one award in any ceremony. Jeff Bridges? A Legend. Chris Pine? Finally getting a chance to show his acting chops. Ben Foster? Whoa now, completely transformed himself (2016 has not been a bad year for him). What helped them was the script which had me transfixed from the first section of dialogue, it had everything from witty humour and banter between the characters\u00a0to emotional tension between the brilliant brotherly bond (dare you to say that ten times in a row!) of Foster and Pine. The direction from David Mackenzie was solid and the cinematography was sublime with some really creative shots when following vehicles. Excellent wide shots to let the audience take in the Texan environment. I won't spoil the film, but there is a scene in the movie that is what I call an \"Oh My God!\" moment (a scene so shocking, I\u00a0literally mouth those words out), did not see it coming whatsoever and I don't think anyone else did, brilliantly executed. The score was also appropriate, with country vibes that suit the Texas locale.\u00a0I say it\u00a0is close to perfection, the only flaw I found was that the script allows the characters to have too many conversations that do not further the plot. Whilst this is good for character development, too much of it and it starts to slow the pace down. Overall, Hell or High Water is a near perfect crime/drama with powerhouse performances (particularly Ben Foster) and a sublime script, even if the dialogue is bit excessive at times.\n\n- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",

The film really takes you to an interesting, if not exotic place in America.\nFilm reminds me very much of the morally ambiguous desperation of Bonnie and Clyde, this time in post-2008 recession times. \n\nThe film moves thoughtfully and I think realistically through its story.  Thankfully, for my tastes, it substitutes gratuitous movie violence for a very believable realistic series of events. \nHell or High Water will probably go down as one of the top 5 most critically acclaimed films of 2016.",

It takes about 10 minutes for the film's plot to kick in, but once it does, it's a manic ride from start to finish. The plot goes pretty deep, clawing at you with questions about our social landscape pitting the rich versus the \"99%,\" what's (morally) right versus what is \"just\" for someone else's situation, and how loyal one could be to a loved one's cause. Almost all of the performances across the board in the flick are unanimously praiseworthy, in particular those of Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges. I have never been a big fan of Pine's work in the past, but I have to give him many props here for pleasantly shocking me with his role. Jeff Bridges is in fine form, as well (and hopefully, another potential Oscar nomination won't be ruled out). Ben Foster is a little over-the-top, but provides a nice counter balance to Chris Pine's calm, levelheaded characterization. It is definitely worth your time to check it out if you are interested at-all in seeing this movie, and comes with a high recommendation from myself. The flick is one of my favorites of the year (only behind another recent hit, \"Captain Fantastic\").",

Scenes of his bantering with his deputy (played by Gil Birmingham) are funny, heart-warming/breaking and pay off towards the end of the film in an emotional and poignant fashion. Deliberately desolate and desperate yet peppered with astute observations of our times, the beautifully crafted film admittedly has a few wobbly or \"posey\" moments but in the end I found myself totally invested in a film that was written, directed and shot with a poetic and picturesque sentimentality that never boils over into hysterical melodrama.",

There is somewhat a lame attempt in  subplot to connect the awful wall street bailout with the working class poor living in Texas- willing to do anything to pay the mortgage- but let's face it- the brothers played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster would have probably robbed banks with or without the bailout- if they didn't- you wouldn't have a movie. If this film had been released in the '70s with a lower budget and a bunch of unknown actors- it would have been a fairly average drive in film-nothing more. You add the great Jeff Bridges to the mix and the sadly underused Gil Birmingham and you might have something. Of the two brothers Chris Pine gives a great performance as the moody younger brother. His performance is even keeled and convincing- especially in the last scene.  Ben Foster on the other hand, I did not feel was convincing at all. I have sadly known too many excons who have done 10+years in prison... and Ben Foster just did not have it down. He was too wild- too free with his movements.  People who have been locked up that long- do not wear it like a badge of honor. They generally are instutionalized and cagey and their movements are more measured and precise. They can instill fear without having to act all badass. They don't have to prove anything. I think this movie would have been better if PIne had played the moody excon and Foster had played the younger brother. Pine had it down and was more believable in his role and would have portrayed an excon more accurately. That being said- the movie is worth seeing for the last 15 minutes where Bridges demonstrates once again his versality and skill  as an actor- even playing the cliched wrinkled southern lawman. A better film with him in it would be 1992's American Heart- a much more powerful film with an even better performance. Compared to most of the crap released this summer- Hell of High Water soars.",

The easiest way for me to describe it would be: \"No Country for Old Men meets The Big Short\"...\n\nThe acting in this movie is excellent. From the leads, to the supporting characters, everyone is fantastic. There is also great chemistry among the two main duos that are portrayed in this movie. The brothers, played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster, feel like they are actual brothers. They tease, they banter, they hoarse around, with the realism of real brothers. There relationship is well fleshed out, and our attachment to them grow as the movie progresses. The other amazing pair is Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham, as Texas Rangers. Their exchanges and interactions are captivating and fun to watch, which also makes the viewer grow more attached to them. While everyone performs well, special mention should be given to the Jeff Bridges. His presence and charisma were magnetic, and make every scene he was in twice as enjoyable.\n\nThe script is also excellent. It deals with themes that are rarely talked about, both in movies and in the news, but that has a devastating and sometimes deadly effect on people's lives: predatory loans and poverty. This movie treats these themes very cleverly, and brings into the spotlight issues that needs to be addressed. In addition to it's main themes, this movie also tackles other obscure topics few people speak of such as the savage treatment of the native Americans, or the less savage but still terrible treatment of war veterans. All these elements combine to deliver a story that draws you in and has you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next.\n\nFinally, what would be a movie without great cinematography. The camera flows smoothly, making everything easy to follow, it offers some beautiful views of the New Mexican country side, it all just... works. There is no choppy editing, no shaky cam inferno, it's just perfect.\n\nConclusion: I could write for several paragraphs how amazing this movie is, but I'd rather forgo that and just tell you to GO SEE IT. This is a beautiful and powerful movie on a subject that is rarely touched upon, and performed by actors who draw you into story. This is a film that will no doubt receive Oscar nominations. If you appreciate good films, Comancheria is for you.",

This was way too good of a\nfilm to not be in top shelf movie watching mode.\nProbably not an original premise of family members going\non a crime spree to save the family farm. Set in destitute\nWest Texas, surprisingly divorced calm & kind brother played\nby Chris Pine and his wild, ex-con, living on the\nedge brother Ben Foster, are the ring leaders in a\nlocal bank robbing spree. These brothers are as difference as\nnight and day in every sense but clearly love each other which\nadds nicely to the movies tension.\nThe family homestead which is owned by their recently deceased\nMom and the home to Pine's (brother Toby) ex-wife and 2 kids is\nnear foreclosure. However, the brothers also learn that the\nland is loaded with oil and the selling of the rights can\nyield a lifetime of comfort.\nSo the brothers set off to knock off several smaller branches\nof the local (Texas) Midland's bank who happen to hold the\nloan papers on the farm. The notion of robbing the same bank\nthat is trying to screw them out of the family homestead helps\nthem stay focused.\nBut not surprisingly wild brother Tanner just keeps pushing\nthe envelope and clearly has a death wish. The lead Texas\nRanger following them is brilliantly played by Jeff Bridges.\nYes, he could have doubled as Dick Tracy foil \"Mumbles\" but\ncandidly, it was tough to understand a number of the characters\nand their heavy west Texas, stiff lip talking styles. Bridges is\nan olde time Ranger with excellent instincts, patience and\nvast experience dealing with locals (and anticipating their\ntendencies).\nBut at the end of the day, a brilliant sound track and rich\ncinematography of the folks and the terrain, create a special\nfilm that will generate lots of buzz.\nThis was a very well constructed movie and script that has\nlots of upsides and will generally be enjoyed by most. Highly\nrecommend seeing on a big screen. At 102 minutes, a\nspecial cast and a tight story, this film is a winner.",

            "content": "This film kind of came out of nowhere, only seeing the trailers for it a couple of weeks ago, but the immediate hype was intriguing so I was eager to watch this as soon as it was released. First thing I do after watching this is head straight for the shop and grab myself some bottled American lager (well, brewed under licence but it's the closest I'm gonna get.) I get home, crack one open and sit there thinking about what I've just seen. \n\nFirst and only film I've seen of director David McKenzie was his grim British prison drama, Starred Up, which was incredibly good. And I was mesmerised by last year's Sicario which is written by the same Taylor Sheridan so it's a win-win combination already without adding the cast. \n\nThe story delves deeper than a couple of brothers committing bank robberies across west Texas, it's almost political and opens the field to a broader history in a realistic manner, but leaves you sitting on the fence with regard to who's the bad or good guy and in fact, proves either can be both giving the circumstance. \n\nWe follow the Howard brothers Tanner and Toby, Tanner played ruthlessly by Ben Foster as the impulsive, trigger-happy ex-con and Chris Pine playing Toby, the struggling, better, younger brother. Foster being a worn monster truck of brutal force whilst Pine is a filthy aged muscle car. \n\nHot on their trail is soon-to-be retired Texas ranger Marcus Hamilton played masterfully by Jeff Bridges, and his partner, who Hamilton continually ridicules about his heritage, Alberto Parker, played by Twilight's shape-shifting wolf, Gil Birmingham. \n\nThe relationships within both pairs are highly captivating and with a strong sense of realism. Their performances being some of the best I've seen all year, and yes, Bridges ultimately delivers but that's expected, Pine is equally amazing, shredding all skin and hint of Capt. Kirk but Foster is the star here. Maybe slightly biased, liking Foster since 3:10 To Yuma as Charlie Brown, his portrayal is ferociously compelling. You can't help but like the character and I suppose that's the beauty of this film, all the characters have they're own likability, making it harder to choose who's side you'll be on just hanging in there for the outcome. \n\nThe script is amazing, superbly written with some classic clever quotes, giving Ben Foster some of the best lines in the movie, actually providing elements of comedy. The confrontations in particular are enthralling, making great cinema. Tense, powerful with a perfectly balanced contrast between the action and downtime, the only constant is the dusty ambience that leaves you with a gritty taste, I could almost feel the dirt on my skin. \n\nIt's excellence doesn't end there, with a flawless choice of veterans of west American dramas Nick Cave and Warren Ellis who's collaboration has been on Lawless and The Proposition; and independently Ellis doing an eerie score for The Road and Cave composing a haunting one for The Assassination of Jesse James by The Coward Robert Ford. The perfect pairing of score and soundtrack gives the film an air of melancholy, a sober tone that belongs to this story. \n\nGreat cinematography, especially the panning shots, superb script writing and brilliantly violent. Accompanied with an excellent score and great performances from all. Perfectly paced from start to finish. This is a modern western, a must see movie, Hell or high water. \n\nRunning Time: 10\nThe Cast: 10\nPerformance: 10\nDirection: 10\nStory: 10\nScript: 10\nCreativity: 8\nSoundtrack: 9\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the outstanding performances from all four!

            "content": "Hell or High Water is getting way over-hyped... Chris Pine's blank stares into the distance and Jeff Bridges' unfunny jokes getting lauded, yet Ben Foster had the only good performance among the major characters. Almost all the banter and folksy aphorisms felt contrived. The cinematography is brilliant at times, but does not offer much food for thought outside the heavy-handed, repetitive conceit of decaying blue collar America. \n\nA pretentious, grossly overrated knock-off of the Coen brother's modern western it's getting compared too... speaking of western, the gunfights were awful, often poorly shot (despite much of the rest of the movie's cinematography being admittedly brilliant), and barely believable at the best of times. I don't need lots of gunfighting in a western, but there is an expectation for the slow build to the big gunfight to pay off in a spectacular way, a la Unforgiven or Butch & Sundance. No Country for Old Men broke from this trope in the death of Llewellyn and the retreat of the far better Sheriff character, Tommy Lee Jones, but it was unsettling and interesting--this climax is predictable and serviceably shot at the best of times, however Ben Foster plays it very well, like everything in the movie, actually--again, people are way off the mark in my opinion heaping all their praise on Pine and Bridges.\n\nA good looking drama with mostly decent performances despite the often unnatural aphorism-laden back-and-forths, but a standout picture in a couple respects--it doesn't take much to stand out this season I guess.",

It has a  nice, gradual build of tension throughout, and although it has many of  the tropes of the genre it's more that it acknowledges them rather than  uses them blatantly as they never make the film predictable.\n\nThis is the best Chris Pine performance I've ever seen, and he and Ben  Foster have excellent chemistry as the bank robbing brothers.  Balancing  that out are Jeff Bridges's sheriff and Gil Birmingham deputy. Their  dynamic is interesting, as the deputy's respect for the sheriff always  shows through despite the later's near constant racism which itself  balances carefully on that thin line of not being hateful, just grossly  misguided.\n\nThe score is maybe a little heavy handed at times, but  the cinematography is gorgeous, with not a single wasted shot in the  film. While always tense, there's a surprising amount of well placed humour as well so that tension never overwhelms. Simply put, this film is highly recommended.",

Rooting for these guys is similarly problematic, but this is a tale with even deeper shades of gray. There are so many surprises. One violent altercation inadvertently provides a cogent defense for carrying a concealed weapon. The mentality of the vigilante perspective is presented so rationally, I was a bit taken aback. There's sort of an odd mix of emotion that fluctuates wildly between compassion and disgust for these lawbreakers. Sympathy turns to aversion over the course of the narrative. It's the way these little unforeseen vignettes plays out that make this character study so captivating.  One of the most noteworthy dramas of 2016.\n\nfastfilmreviews.com",

Chris Pine, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges are all absolutely incredible and they all give some of the best performances of their careers. Chris Pine and Ben Foster are incredibly talented, and it's on full display here. it's very solidly crafted, tense, taut, exciting and just an incredibly made film. David Mackenzie, who is the director, has a real attention to detail and is an immense talent to watch out for. it doesn't let up from its first shot until all the way to its final shot. with that, it's incredibly well paced and I was never bored throughout the entire movie. also, the scenery of Texas worked so well for the movie, it felt like I was in the Texas heat with these characters. the script by Taylor Sheridan, (who also wrote the fantastic Sicario), fleshes out this story with well developed characters and rich, interesting dialogue that kept me invested. the violence is brutal and all of a sudden and when it happens, I was actually disturbed by it because I felt so much for these characters and when something happened to them, I actually cared which I haven't been able to say for a lot of movies this year. Hell Or High Water is an impeccably made, brilliantly acted and written, modern style western thriller that is easily one of the greatest films I've seen all year.",

Jeff Bridges seems to be mailing it in, never really coming close to Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, which was clearly the inspiration for the character.\n\nAll in all, \"Hell Or High Water\" is a superficial sort of film which successfully captures the look, but not really the feel or the essence of rural, blue collar, gun-toting \"real\" [sic] America.",

I enjoyed all three performances from the leads and loved the dialogue, especially from Jeff Bridges.  Taylor Sheridan, who wrote this and Sicario, is becoming one of the better new writers in Hollywood (he was also great as an actor in Sons of Anarchy) and I'll look forward to more films from him.

            "content": "This movie was very very good. However, in my opinion it has a major flaw or two. They didn't need to rob banks to pay off the ~$40,000. Even if we assume that everything happened all at once (the mom died, they found oil the same day, and the money was due in just a few days.....which I would argue is unlikely) they still could have gone to a private investor for a loan, hell even another bank. They could've probably negotiated with PayDay loans or any number of institutions. Since they're expecting $50,000/month of income, it would've been easy to secure a loan with their proof of accounts receivable plenty of time to spare. And they make Chris Pine out to be a very intelligent man (even clever enough to file his son's trust with the very same bank he owed money to so that the bank would be less cooperative with authorities). If Chris Pine's character is as smart as they make him out to be (the mastermind of the robberies, he definitely would've thought of that. And I don't even think it's fair to argue that even if they thought of that, that they still wanted to stick it to the bank for trying to \"rob\" them of their family's farm. Ben Foster's character--yes-- I could see him wanting to stick it to the bank, but not Chris Pine's character. There's a scene at the end where he tells Ben that he loves him, and I'd argue that Chris is too level headed and wouldn't put anyone he loved in a situation like that unless it was absolutely necessary. So this made me like the movie a little less. Chris is either smart or he isn't. Clearly he is. So he would've known to get a second financier, not a gun to rob banks.\n\nOne other problem is that during the last bank robbery, Chris Pine's character is shot, and would've definitely left behind blood at the crime scene. They could have compared the blood found at the crime scene to Ben Foster's character's blood. Simple DNA testing would quickly prove that the blood found at the scene of the crime would be a sibling of Ben Foster's character. (Siblings have extremely similar DNA). Then they could've gotten a warrant to check Chris Pine's characters blood to prove he was the other robber, and then he'd be in jail. The only way around this would be that it was sort of hard to see exactly when Chris Pine's character was shot (so maybe...maybe... he was shot in the truck, which was later lit on fire). So maybe there's no blood at the crime scene, but I think that's a stretch. So this is super nitpicky, and I will say I loved the movie. I just hate the fact that there's some big errors.",

            "content": "The summer movie season has never been known for its smaller films, but this summer has been pretty weak, as far as quality. Moviegoers began to hope for the more independent films to get wider releases in order to rejuvenate their love of film. Maybe it is just the fact that this summer has been so dour, but seeing Hell or High Water to cap off the summer of 2016 may just be the best thing for you. With a little bit of The Town and No Country For Old Men, this is a film that every movie lover will enjoy. It is small films like this that remind me why I love the film industry and that even the most under-the-radar films should be given a chance. Here is why I believe Hell or High Water to be one of the best films of the summer.\n\nStarring Chris Pine (Star Trek) and Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma), Hell or High Water follows two brothers that rob banks in order to raise money to keep from losing their family ranch, after the passing of their mother. Divorced and wanting to take care of his kids, Toby (Pine) has many more things on his mind than just saving the ranch. This may seem like a been-there-done-that premise, but the fantastic performances truly make you buy into the harsh reality that these characters are facing and the chemistry between Foster and Pine leaps off the screen in a big way. From beginning to end, this film had me either on the edge of my seat or feeling emotional toward their next decision.\n\nWith a very quite tone throughout the course of this film, it all comes down to whether the editor holds long enough on certain takes and whether or not the performances are aces. Luckily, with a very slim score and editing that is perfect for the tone of this picture, Hell or High Water feels unlike any films I have seen this year. Sure, most of the great stories about bank robbers will eventually have down time, leaving room for character development, but there was just something about this script that felt very soothing when there was no high-octane action in play. That being said, when the action hits, it is incredibly engaging.\n\nWhile this film is more about building its characters than it is focussing on its action sequences to keep its audience entertained, Hell or High Water does have its share of thrills. From well-shot chase sequences to intense shootouts, everything you hope to see when going into this film is definitely present. Once again, the action in this film is elevated by the great character development throughout the film, making you actually care who lives and who dies in the final act. Almost everyone in this film is a crooked, but they all have their reasons for doing what they are doing, and it all comes to pass in the climax.\n\nIn the end, Hell or High Water benefits from a strong cast, including some great supporting roles from Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham. To some, this film may suffer from being a little too calming at times, making it feels slightly longer than its mere 102 minute running time, but its all worth it when the final act begins. Overall, this is a much better film than I think anyone was thinking it would be. Filled with terrific performances, thrilling action scenes, character development that feels real, and a score that is almost non-existent, making audiences quiet down as if they are actually sitting in a room with these characters, completely invested in their conversations. I loved every moment of Hell or High Water, even though it may have a few pacing issues here and there. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "Bank robberies always make for a good movie opening. No matter how many I see, it always strikes me as just the right kind of jolt to kick a movie into gear. Ben Foster (Six Feet Under) and Chris Pine (Star Trek) play brothers Tanner and Toby Howard, respectively. Their targets are the Texas Midlands Bank snatching the front drawer cash from each one in the area. It makes for a simpler and quicker in and out versus hitting up the vaults. Tanner is the ex-con who was recently released from jail for shooting and killing their father. As you may assume, he's a bit reckless and sloppy when it comes to the heists. However, he's merely along for the joy ride. This is all Toby's idea. He owes child support to his ex-wife for their two sons. To top it off, Toby and Tanner's mother recently died. Mortgage payments need to be paid off on her ranch, which also happens to lie on an oil bed. Toby's not about to let her house fall into the hands of the bank. Hot on their trail are two Texas rangers. Marcus Hamilton (Bridges) is near retirement and sees this as his last big career achievement. He's partnered with Alberto Parker (Birmingham) whose Comanche heritage doesn't sit well with him.\n\nIn a summer full of blockbusters, sequels, comic book films, and plenty of others that just feel like rehashes, it's refreshing to see something of a limited budget rise above those films and reign as one of the summer's and year's best. On the outside, it looks like just a typical type western. I thought as much throughout the beginning wondering where the hook was and how is this any different. Then it dawned on me that that is the how it's different. We rarely see a western on the big screen anymore. It's almost like a dying breed of a genre. One of the last main stream westerns was True Grit, also starring Jeff Bridges. Hell or High Water is that old-fashioned cops and robbers type story, but the execution is done so simple and to the point, making it all the more effective. Unlike other bank robbery or heists type movies, this isn't about drugs or a larger government cover-up. It's a family story involving the love between two brothers and the love a father has for his two sons hoping to give them a better life than the one he was handed. Writer Taylor Sheridan (Sicario) always keeps the family dynamic at the forefront. He also plays into the old stereotype of cowboys versus Indians regarding the back and forth partnership of agents Hamilton and Parker. No specific time frame is given to suggest that it isn't a contemporary look at the racism that still permeates in these small towns.\n\nDirector David Mackenzie (Young Adam) has a top notch cast with no weak link among them. Ben Foster has played his fair share loose canons. Tanner Howard fits so well into that description that Foster can tap into that side of him so easily. He can let loose and make Tanner that fearless, loud, and unpredictable force of nature. Jeff Bridges also plays right into his wheelhouse. He fully embodies that aging and overweight sheriff out for one final take. He makes it so easy to hate the variety of racial slurs that come out toward his partner. Bridges has been playing these types of Southern characters his whole career, but they are roles I love seeing him in.\n\nEven though Foster and Bridges give exceptional performances, Pine slips in under the radar and gives the best performance of his career. He begs you to take notice, especially when you don't expect that next to the other two. It's easy for him to rely on his charm and dashing good looks in the Star Trek movies or even Into the Woods. When he tries to go outside of that it doesn't always work out. He led the true story, The Finest Hours, earlier this year from Disney, and it was a total bomb. Ben Foster also appeared in that, and I'm glad they were able to work together again in something far better. Sometimes I get the impression Pine tries too hard to shed his image and it doesn't always work. Hell or High Water is that exception. His character, Toby, is a rugged and simple kind of guy. Pine really sticks to that and keeps that motivation of providing for his sons at the heart of his character's journey. Toby and Tanner could easily be two stereotype characters, but Pine justifies his character's actions throughout the entirety of the film making the audience really root for him in the end.\n\nThroughout Hell or High Water, I kept thinking that this is such a simple concept but it's so engaging at the same time because David Mackenzie keeps it that way. There are no twists or turns, and he keeps things flowing very naturally. It's a slow burn type of movie that leads into a very intense climax. I forgot that Texas is a concealed carry type of state, which doesn't always bode well for our two bank robbers at any given point of the film. The score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis perfectly compliments the tone bringing you further into that lonesome desert feel. I've been disappointed in so many movies this year, but Hell or High Water is worth recommending for a wide audience. It's more than just a western as that family bond lassos you in. Despite the A-list cast, it needs that positive word of mouth to continue bringing audiences out to the theater. There were roughly forty to fifty people in the theater when I saw it on a Saturday afternoon. My husband went and saw Sausage Party at the same time, which played to an audience of ten people. That should give you some indication of how well it's doing.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Go see it, and I bet you'll be surprised at how much you enjoy it by the time the end credits roll.\n\nRATING: 4.5 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

            "content": "Following in the vein of Cormac McCarthy's post-modern westerns, Hell or High Water is a thoughtful, tense, and bloody elegy about two small time bank robbers in West Texas and a mirror pair of Texas Rangers who pursue them.  Despite the similarities and comparisons to No Country for Old Men, High Water has more in common with Killing Them Softly, as both are about two desperate men who make questionable robberies, experienced and cynical professionals who pursue them, people dying for relatively small amounts of money, deliberate and glacial storytelling, all to the backdrop of post-recession blue collar America in the midst of its death throes and plenty of blunt commentary blaming banks and the financial system for game of death we are currently witnessing.  But on a visceral level it manages to be quite engrossing and the stuff of solid adult entertainment.  Ya know?  The kind of movie we all claim to want more of in theaters but never actually bother to see or support.  Chris Pine plays a salt-of-the-earth everyman with a touch of cleverness.  Ben Foster has the most fun as his reckless, but lethal brother who epitomizes the soul of the movie.  In perfect casting, Jeff Bridges is an aging Texas Ranger with laconic wit and an able investigative mind.  And Gil Birmingham has his moments as his long suffering partner and is more pivotal to the message of the film than one may initially suspect.  All of the characters are immensely likeable and interesting, which makes it all the more tragic when it's time to kill a few of them off.  Hell or High Water is a badass movie that will manage to stick to your ribs long after you've seen it.  Highly recommended.",

This movie is about 2 brothers who rob banks in the west for a living. You probably think these guys are pricks and well, one of them actually is, they do it for a good reason. Since the banks have been ripping people off or ironically, \"robbing them\" as one character puts it. A small time sherif and his partner are after these brothers which make a very cool Bonnie and Clyde set up. Despite all of said so far, there is a surprising amount of humor in this movie, mostly from the sherif played wonderfully by Jeff Bridges, and the older brother. Please, if by any chance someone took the time to read this review, do yourself a favor, and see this movie.",

            "content": "Two brothers are on the run in the new independent film Hell or High Water, a film that defines the reason why we go to the movies in the first place. With a tight knit story, award worthy performances, surprising amount of comedy, and an emotional payoff all make this one of the best surprises in recent years.\n\nSo much goes right in this film, but the main thing that makes this movie work is the writing in both story and dialogue from screenwriter Taylor Sheridan. The story here follows two brothers who are robbing banks and two Texas rangers are hunting them down. Sure, this is a vague description, but trust me when I say that a small description is all this needs. The story is fast paced and for once the dialogue actually means something. All the characters have lines that develop them, the setting,and further the story and make this movie more rounded and more fulfilling than you would think. There is a moment in this film that everyone in my theater audibly gasped and really showed how much you care for these characters Not only that but the ending of the film is very rewarding and well fitting, fully rounding out this film.\n\nThe cast here is also fantastic and is surely going to get accreditation towards award season. Chris Pine and Ben Foster play the brothers and they are absolutely phenomenal together, counteracting each other's weakness perfectly. Pine plays the more reserved brother as Foster is more outgoing. Their duality is flawless and both show how talented they are as actors. Jeff Bridges plays Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton and delivers his best performance in years. Bridges is so hilarious and equally heartbreaking that you can't help but cheer for him even though you love Pine and Foster's characters as well. Gil Birmingham plays Bridge's partner and he is just as fantastic as everyone else, delivering hilarious moments as well as deeply dramatic dialogue.\n\nThe direction in this movie is flawless and really makes this movie feel authentic. This film is directed by David Mackenzie and though you may not have heard of him before, you will after this movie. Every scene looks beautiful and crisp, complementing the setting and solidifies this as a modern day western. On top of that, Mackenzie shows his eye for action and suspense. there are moments in this film where you are on the edge of your seat and are at his mercy, waiting for the next plot twist. He structured this film in a way that you never get tired and are always enjoying this film. Basically, Mackenzie has made a huge statement here. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that this movie accomplishes something that not many do: an emotional payoff through its actors and storytelling. There are some deep thematic elements here that you notice the first time you see it and stay with you. Albeit certain mannerisms in the characters or the pitch perfect ending, but this movie genuinely takes you on a journey and once you see it you feel like you just saw something special.\n\nAll in all I adored Hell or High Water. This is a very small film but mighty in it's accomplishments on all fronts. This is a serious, exhilarating, often times funny, modern day western that makes you remember why movies are so great. I can not praise this enough and strongly urge everyone to find a theater this is playing and experience it for yourself.",

There were plenty of opportunities to do just that but the story stay glued to the plot, stayed true to the characters, didnt waste time lecturing us, and doesnt insult your intelligence. The film makers just lay out the facts & tell the story. And they leave the judging to us. Highly Recommended.",

            "content": "A good man does bad things for a good reason; a bad man does bad things for a good reason;  a good man whose morals doesn't allow for bad things to happen for any reason, don't we all love films of this kind? Director David Mackenzie's latest film, feels like one of those films. Every once and a while a good crime drama that involves cops and bad guys who do robberies comes along and it entertains and thrills and you the viewer love seeing the chase and the blood that is shown and most of these type of pictures spill acts of heroism and vigilantism so well and with this independent entry, it pretty much covers all of what I just said. This is a simple meat-and-potatoes tale of bank heists and blood brothers, the sort of story that great directors from Kubrick and Altman to Arthur Penn and Tarantino have made their staple at one time or another. Like recent westerns such as The Rover, Slow West and True Grit, this film takes some interesting and unique approaches to this old genre. The story follows two brothers - an ex-con Tanner Howard (Ben Foster) and a divorced dad Toby Howard (Chris Pine). Toby has meticulously planned out their bank robbery spree. Tanner's goal is to save his family ranch from being foreclosed by the bank, so his boys and ex wife Debbie (Marin Ireland) can escape the \"disease\" of poverty. Tanner is along to support his brother and probably because he just enjoys the adrenaline rush. Soon enough, aging Texas Ranger Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is on the trail of the boys, and his highly developed instincts and gut feelings annoy his mix breed partner Alberto (Gil Birmingham) almost as much as Marcus' incessant and insensitive racial teases - a reminder of the days when buddies would verbally jab each other without the risk of class action lawsuits. One knows, amid the gunfire and violence, the cost of living in the fast lane is past due. There are no easy answers in this film. Where is the country financially and how do people get out of the hell they are in? How does a cattle farmer still have to deal with wildfires in the 21st century? The film is perfectly paced, as the narrative hits the nail & culminates in a crisp 101-minutes run time. The film begins with a punch & ends on the very same note. I was thoroughly engrossed by the story & how well it progressed. Working from a screenplay by Taylor Sheridan (scribe of last year's popular Sicario), Mackenzie sets his film in the Texas midlands, the last frontier against \"progress,\" as the few scattered denizens would call the encroaching destruction of their old-fashioned way of life. This is a film born out of people's hate for financial institutions. The great majority of us are in debt, fighting liens, repossessions, and looking on while the same companies that inundate us with statements get bailouts. Director David Mackenzie effectively captures the desperation of America's poor with his stark images of a Texas wasteland. Large billboards about mortgages and loans dot the dry rural landscapes, nicely filmed by Giles Nuttgens. Mr. Mackenzie's film is a poetic mood piece with intricate plotting and a narrative structure that keeps one riveted to the characters and their actions. There's some graffiti sprayed on the wall early in the film in a dusty town in West Texas that reads \"3 Tours in Iraq; no bailout for me.\" While I initially loved Sicario, there is very little personality in that film, not just in the characters but in the overall dialogue in the film. It all feels a little robotic and plot oriented, well this film is almost the complete opposite. This film is brimming with character, most specifically the Texans. There are so many great lines in this film, that don't feel added in or punched up. You also get a better understanding of the characters from these little phrases and one liners. The story itself puts the film in action/adventure territory with more than a hint of crime drama, so one's classification of the picture with the Western genre is probably more so by association with its West Texas and Oklahoma locations than the cowboy roots of the principals. The same could be said of \"No Country for Old Men\", so there's another likely comparison. There is a grim edge to the film, but it refuses to wallow in it. Instead, it is bleakly funny, fraught with little character foibles sure to get a chuckle or two out of any audience. Even in the tensest moments (and there are more than a few, be forewarned), there is a nevertheless a laid- back undercurrent. In large part, it's due to how easy the three leads slip into their characters and convey decades' worth of life and experience in their performances. It sounds odd in a gritty crime drama, but this is also a deeply funny film.  The relationship between the two rangers is fantastic and there are a few moments in the film so absurd and surreal that you can't do anything but laugh at the characters trying to adapt to the situation. It's also the sign of a brilliant script that laughter can be turned to shock and tears in the snap of a finger.  Also, I have to say, the writing for the side characters, some of whom are only in the film for their respective scenes is even better. This is the first time I have ever cared about some random waitress who is only in the film for 90 seconds because their writing is masterful. West Texas is a character unto itself with massive poverty, oil pumps on the horizon, dusty streets, rickety fences, and gun-toting citizens everywhere. Each of these elements is beautifully captured by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens (Dom Hemingway), as are the actual bank robberies and the quiet moments between brothers and Rangers partners. The cinematography captures the desolateness and sadness of the area of West Texas that the film is set in. There are also many wide shots, which looked like they were filmed with drones which also added to the beauty of the filming. The music also adds to the western feel of this film. Yes, the plot is predictable, the set-up contrived, and the film is a tad too leisurely told from the outset. But the haunting images and true-to-life characters are heartfelt and linger long after the film ends thanks to a terrific script, and taut direction. It's one of those films that's so finely crafted that you don't really notice its issues. The thing that makes this film as good as it is, is that it knows what it is and does not try to become something more than that. It is not a complicated film or one with a twist; you know where everyone stands at the end of the film and in a day and age when so much emphasis is put on sequel bating or cliffhanger endings, the film smartly avoids this. The performances are all excellent. Jeff Bridges has been nominated 6 times for an Academy Award (winning the Best Actor Oscar for Crazy Heart) and he just might be in line for his 7th nomination (and 2nd win) here. His Texas Ranger character is just one fascinating, wonderful character. Here he steals the show as the senior Texas ranger, who's sly sense of humor with his Indian partner (a fabulous Gil Birmingham) & skill to put things together & get to the criminals, is delightful. Bridges gets his character spot-on & proves once again, that he's among the greatest we've ever had. Chris Pine & Ben Foster are in top-form. Pine is a revelation, delivering a mature, restrained performance, while Foster, an actor whose potential isn't new to know, continues to astonish, with his enviable talent for playing unpredictable, unlikable characters. Also, the on-screen chemistry between Pine & Foster, appears real & affecting. On the whole, 'Hell or High Water' is a terrific film that offers a solid story that is sharply written, expertly directed & very strongly acted. Must Watch!",

            "content": "A distinctive worldview triumphs over worn-down storytelling tropes any day of the week. Hell or High Water isn't an innovative, twisty piece of storytelling, but it has an eye for its rural Texas setting that sets it apart, populating it with interesting characters top-to-bottom and with a political sensibility that it neither condemns nor condones, but sympathises with. It paints rural Texas as reliving it's days as the Wild West, abandoned by the country as a whole, a place where most folks carry weapons to settle their own disputes. It's hard for me, a Canadian who hasn't seen any of Texas outside of the Dallas airport, to say how close to the truth this is, but it's specificity creates a vivid world. When someone whose car choice clashes with the idea of the world being somewhat run-down enters the frame, its as a prelude to sudden violence when they mess with the wrong locals. The people here aren't villains, but they don't react well to being antagonised either.\n\nHell or High Water has a fairly classic setup, following two sets of partners. Brothers Toby and Tanner Howard (Chris Pine and Ben Foster) are taking up bank robbery to make some quick cash.  Texas Rangers Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) and Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham) are on their tail. There's no big twist behind this setup. Hamilton is even a couple weeks from retirement. But it's used to great effect to examine how the plight of the working class has left a vacuum for Wild West tendencies to sprout up again, while also pointing out the limitations of the analogy. The days where you can expect to rob a bank and get away with it are long gone, muses one diner patron, and the next generation won't be interested in playing cowboy, notes a rancher escorting his cattle from a brush fire. It can be heavy-handed in its musings at times, but it has clearly thought about to how to apply Western tropes to the modern world, and mostly succeeds wildly.\n\nWhat makes Hell or High Water such a standout is how it takes care to create good, distinctive characters. It's fringes are an embarrassment of riches, with numerous character actors making one-scene appearances to make tellers, waiters, and citizens pop with charisma (Dale Dickey, Kevin Rankin, and Katy Mixon all show up briefly). Bridges' Hamilton is a bit more cantankerous than world-weary, but his chemistry with Birmingham goes a long way, and his less-than-subtle and less-than-appreciated racial jesting towards his Comanche/Mexican partner comes across as more annoying-uncle than heartless-bigot. Ben Foster, about twenty pounds heavier than last seen, hopefully gets a major career boost from this, as his portrayal of Tanner avoids short-fuse stereotypes while still coming across as dangerously unstable. It takes most of its running time to set up its world and its centre foursome, and when it comes time to bring the pieces together, it does so in a way that's immensely satisfying on a visceral and narrative level. If the Old West is pretty much dead, Hell or High Water shows that the neo-Western still has blood left pumping.",

            "content": "First Hit:  Very well acted Texas Ranger crime story that evokes the old west while resolving a modern day problem.\n\nBrothers Tanner and Toby Howard (Ben Foster and Chris Pine respectively) are two bank robbers who clearly have a plan. During the robberies they take only loose cash, only what is in the teller drawers, and only from the small Mid-Texas Midland Bank branches. As the story evolves the audience learns how Tanner has been a trouble maker his whole life while Toby has been walking the straight and narrow path. So why are they doing this? We eventually find out and that is what makes this story work. Because the amount of money they are taking are small, the FBI isn't interested in finding the robbers, so the Rangers get the assignment. Marcus Hamilton (Jeff Bridges) is a near retirement Ranger who is a little long in the tooth while being old time smart and is very loyal to his job. His partner, Alberto Parker (Gil Birmingham), is a younger man who is also Indian. The running jokes in the film is that Marcus cannot help himself about making racist and pointed jokes about Alberto's heritage. However, the audience also sees the love and respect Marcus has for Alberto. In the pursuit of the robbers the audience learns about each of the characters and the story of the ranch Tanner and Toby are trying to save. The script does a great job of defining the characters and letting the story unfold.\n\nPine is wonderful as the thoughtful smart brother who finds a way to help his family. Foster is perfect as the on-edge bad-boy brother who wants to help and support his brother. Bridges embodies the old west in the new world with this role. He's amazing. Birmingham is fantastic as Bridges' partner. A shout-out to Margret Bowman who plays a waitress in a restaurant. Her 2 minutes on the screen were brilliant. Taylor Sheridan wrote a very strong script. David Mackenzie did an excellent job of directing the actors through this story. The small Texas town feel was very well done.\n\nOverall:  This was a very entertaining film.",

Reason for that was, I wanted to explain, that everything in this movie is so interconnected, it is so difficult to focus on the just main characters.\r Now that I have set the premise for this review lets talk about the main driving force of this picture.\r THE CAST\r The main cast of this movie entails of  : Jeff Bridges,  Gil Birmingham as the Texas Rangers and Chris Pine and Ben Foster as the bank robbers. The main thing to say in this review is to say, it is really hard to establish exactly who stole the show in this movie. The entire cast had such fantastic chemistry on the screen.\r Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham's scenes portray that these are the people that knew each other seemingly their entire lives. The friendly jabs toward each other, they way they deal with situations, everything is portrayed so smooth, you forget these are the actors, especially since they truly show you how different their characters are, and how they would  approach certain things. It is still early talk about Oscar Nominations, but everyone in this movie at least deserves up most consideration, especially Jeff Bridges.\r On the other hand we have the brothers.\r Ben Foster and Chris Pine. Without spoiling any of the movie, but just to establish my point here, the movie right away focuses on these characters, and their chemistry, their reasoning and their genuine love for each other. For any doubters out there that Chris Pine cannot act, those fears are completely unfounded here, as I would say he brings the possibly career changing role in this movie. Ben Foster is equally brilliant in the role, and as I have mentioned and I keep bringing this point home, as it is well deserved, the movie ultimately works because of the chemistry between the characters.\r This type of movie, its an experience, it is not everyone's cup of tea, its not super action packed with ongoing explosions, no superheroes or tornadoes or aliens, or natural disasters. It's a classic movie, that I mentioned before they don't make anymore. Actually, I should rephrase that, that mainstream studios don't make anymore.  And I am going to do something that's going to pull some hate, but this movie I would declare BONNIE AND CLYDE for the 21st century. It is just that good.\r 4 out of 4 stars.",

Feels like a modern western kind, because of where this story takes place, I mean Texas. There's no digital world like phones, computers et cetera, just an old fashioned storytelling. This is the story of two brothers and their series of bank robbery job. They are doing it for a reason, but on the other end, two cops make their effort to find who they are and nab them red handed. So when they meet, that's where the story gets to its end part.It has a strong opening, then slows down. Actually, it was approached like a classic crime film, which mean no high-tech. The story was a one liner, but the events in that story were extended. A simple screenplay, yet very effective presented on the screen. Of course the story ends with this film, but feels like there's more. It is very unlikely, though I'm thinking of a sequel.The people will remember this film for Ben Foster and Chris Pine. One of the best duo on the screen. Easily one of the best films of the year, but just it is a different theme and genre. I watched it not knowing the meaning of the title, and then I googled it. It is nothing like a must see, but I believe that you might regret if you miss it or delay your watch. So I suggest you make a right choice.8/10",

Set in current day rural west Texas, the movie paints a bleak landscape of small towns with vacant store fronts and ranch lands dotted with For Sale signs.  Average citizens struggle to make ends meet, and not a single character in the movie has a future to look forward to. Their lives twist slowly in the wind, and the slow pace of director David Mackensie\u2019s movie left me feeling much the same way. The economic disparity between the Haves (banks and the oil companies) and the Have Nots has become so burdensome that Toby (Chris Pine) and his ex-convict brother Tanner (Ben Foster) have nothing to left lose by going desperado.  Jeff Bridges plays a deft and skillful sheriff on the verge of a retirement that he\u2019s not looking forward to.  He jokes to his partner about going out in a blaze of glory.  His fatal flaw is a lack of cultural sensitivity which, when combined with an unalterable sense of right and wrong, make it impossible for him to comprehend the cultural and moral schism that is occurring.   The story embodies the kind of social injustice message that Hollywood loves.  Yet, this movie can\u2019t be dismissed so easily.  The message is delivered with more subtleness than blunt force, and the ending is not what you would expect. The acting is solid on all fronts, and there are some guilty pleasures to be had in watching the vigilantes take in on the chin.  Plus, you can psychoanalyze your female friends by asking them if they would do what the waitress did.",

While tentpole films are fun to see because they are events, films like Hell or High Water harken back to when filmmakers were more concerned with telling interesting stories, instead of making easy money. Hell or High Water is engrossing, tells its story with depth and smarts, and features really well-rounded characters. This film is truly a great film in almost all aspects, and will likely get a ton of recognition during oscar season.\rFrom the opening scene of this film, the film is gripping, using both intrigue and acting to its advantage.    Much like many other great films, this film begins with a bang and holds the audience\u2019s attention throughout. Chris Pine has proven that he\u2019s a talented actor over the years, but this film is a major step up for him, that being said the show stealers are Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges. Foster has had amazing performances in the past, but this stands as one of his best, and Bridges plays a role that fits him like a glove, and he does it perfectly.\rThe actors are notably great, but the film is gripping because the story it tells is interesting. The story doesn\u2019t feel like a rip off of other films, and even more impressively tells it\u2019s story with depth and smarts. Nothing in this film feels like it\u2019s unrealistic or bombastic, every action in the film is well thought out and makes sense, that being said the film has a decent level of emotional depth. The impressive thing about Hell or High Water is that it\u2019s not overly sentimental, but it\u2019s the kind of film that still evokes an emotional response.\rPerhaps the biggest reason that the story is interesting, and emotionally gripping is because the characters are so well developed. From the onset all characters come from relatable places, and have plenty of layers. Above that the characters are funny and at some point they simply begin to feel like real people just being captured on film. That being said every character\u2019s conflict hits even harder, because the characters feel so relatable.\rFinding something wrong with this film is extremely hard, and in a day and age with so many films coming out in conjunction that\u2019s rare. Hell or High Water is well acted, gripping, funny, features great characters, shows an impressive amount of emotional depth, and never needlessly substitutes action for smarts. It seems safe to say that this film will get a lot of attention during Oscar season, especially for it\u2019s screenplay. If you\u2019re a fan of westerns, heist films, thrillers, or just in general like great films this film is a good choice.",

This film immediately introduces two brothers, who create such a brilliant on screen chemistry, that it guiltily forces you to almost root for these characters, despite the crimes they are committing, which at first almost brands them as general criminals who have the urge to rob and go with the excitement of a heist \u2013 but as the story progresses in its brilliant pace, they\u2019re fleshed out as humane, definitely selfless, and with one of the brothers, regrettable in their actions. Though this film succeeds in its full-bodied character development and emotion resonance with the film following the brothers, its Jeff Bridges and his partner who really add that special extra something. The sense that this may be his final police job due to his many years on the job, and the fact he\u2019s physically weaker than he used to be, could of shifted the genre of the film into a more serious drama, however, a great amount of humour is used between Bridges and his partner \u2013 and is done so well that it comes off very unique, and adds the understanding that there is really no villains in this film, and so when the film dramatises involving the main characters, it\u2019s unlike any action scene in other modern movies, because you don\u2019t wish to see any of the characters hurt in anyway. Also, this film carries Texas once again onto the silver screen in great fashion, this film is a brilliant display of the culture in the state, so with all those reasons, despite the rating saying it\u2019s an 8/10, this film gets from me, an 8.5/10 - 88%",

There is also a lot of give and take between Jeff, who will soon retire, and his Mexican-Comanche partner Gil Birmingham plus the bank robber brothers Chris Pine and Ben Foster.\r The screenwriter Taylor Sheridan offers sharp dialogue between the various 'couples', including an exchange between another waitress played by Katy Mixon who is flirtatious with Pine and then haughty with Bridges who wants to take her $200 tip as evidence. Where the screenplay goes astray is when it delves into the why of the bank robberies and leaves the clever based dialogue.\r The chemistry between older 'black sheep' brother Foster and the 'baby' Pine works from their first appearance to the end and Pine does clean up handsomely! The chemistry between Bridges and Birmingham is just as important between as it is between the brothers and all 4 pay off.\r There is no 'love interest' per se but both Bowman and Mixon women steal the movie from the more 'important' roles of the men. After that hour and 15 minutes of the set up the last 27 minutes grabs you and will surprise the most avid movie goer.\r \"Hell and High Water\" is a low keyed Western thriller cowboy movie  but that scene with Bowman is sure to remain in your herad long after the movie does.

While they go from bank to bank, the sheriff (Jeff Bridges in a crotchety comic role) pursues them with quiet patience and logic.

With terrific performances from Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Jeff Bridges, Hell or High Water isTexas fried to its very core, Hell or High Water is a film with a deep Southern fried aesthetic from its look, feel, and killer soundtrack/score. With terrific performances from Chris Pine, Ben Foster, and Jeff Bridges, Hell or High Water is a thoroughly unique family-fueled crime film. It may be a touch heavy-handed at times with its anti-bank mentality, but this is more than overcome by its terrifically crafted characters. The brothers are very multi-dimensional, as though they may be criminals, we feel for them deeply because of their circumstances and hope they can get away with it all. That said, even the cops are well developed. Bridges' character and his relationship with Gil Birmingam's character is terrific. Not only is their banter hysterical, but for friends and fellow cops, they are given a shocking amount of depth. In addition to its terrific writing, Hell or High Water is a sturdy film that defies expectations, as is tradition with David Mackenzie's films. He takes typical premises and more than just spruces them up. Instead, he reinvents it and turns it into a fully nuanced and powerful film that explores family relationships and how far you will go to help your family. Even more, it explores the violent nature of man and how thin the line between life and death is and can be. The film's cinematography is also terrific with some seriously beautiful shots strewn through this film. Not only did it capture the Southern aesthetic as previously mentioned, it really captured the look and feel of the towns it was set in. This is also heavily due to the film's terrific production and set design. Overall, Hell or High Water is a real gem set to go down as one of the very best releases of 2016.",

We do not see any more of those shoot-em-ups against the \u201cInjuns,\u201d but instead a blurred line between sheriff and outlaw. Yet most noticeableHollywood Westerns are not gone, they just underwent a new tone and identity to fit with the times. We do not see any more of those shoot-em-ups against the \u201cInjuns,\u201d but instead a blurred line between sheriff and outlaw. Yet most noticeable of all, it takes place in the here and now, rather than the turn of America\u2019s economic structure.Hell or High Water, written by Sicario\u2019s Taylor Sheridan, shows some of those gritty details that breathe life back into the shallow, feel-good classical genre. Here, we see what Texans under the law truly act like: they use a bulldozer to bury their P.O.S. car under dirt to hide any evidence, and they throw their chips in poker to increase their luck, all with the right rationalizations explained about their backstories to help you understand their turmoil. The two black-masked thieves we focus on here, played by the greatly underrated Chris Pine (Into the Woods, Star Trek) and Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma, The Messenger), make a living out of hopping from bank-to-bank as the only means to financially secure themselves. You normally wouldn\u2019t want to care for a couple of crooks like them, but once you learn their background, you\u2019ll understand.Sheridan\u2019s plot is not a terribly original concept for a modern-day cowboy movie, virtually copying the same tone and concept as the brilliant No Country for Old Men. This Western only sets itself apart from others by its lack of international relationships.Even so, the hearts of all the men living here will haunt you. Each of them abuses their second amendment rights, even the filthy-rich passerby at the gas station carries firearms at all times. The town by no means chose to side with these crooks, especially not the near-retiring sheriff, played with a compellingly rich voice by Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski, Crazy Heart). Despite his wishes, he sets off a cat-and-mouse chase to restore integrity to these disturbers of the peace. Think of it like a Bonnie & Clyde type of thriller, except without the fun, gore, and romance. Or better yet, a Thelma & Louise type of criminal\u2019s sympathy story, except without any strong female characters.Yeah, hate to break it to you: Westerns today still don\u2019t contain enough girl power like we\u2019d expect from them by now. The female characters are either dead mothers we never meet, moral support for the main characters, or bankers who get harassed by the two crooks. If these otherwise talented actresses were made somehow more active, then greater dimension would have been added to make the script strike closer to home.Although the widely unnoticed director David Mackenzie deserves recognition for his compelling creation of Texas\u2019 true culture. In his view of the dead south, automobiles display the ultimate sign of one\u2019s wealth, and oil mines can be found in an average man\u2019s backyard. Although everything looks like the everyday mundane life for these inhabitants, several signs still connect Mackenzie\u2019s imagined world with the works of John Ford. A field fire seen in the distance from behind a herd of frightened cattle heightens the highly-saturated look of the picture, and the dusty texture of the art direction reflects the complexion of the men unqualified to protect the people. You even get a new take on the classic showdown between sheriff and outlaw- with a new psychological twist.Hell or High Water will last as one of those pictures made by men from the old days for men from the old days. Not everyone will come out from the experience satisfied, but for the thinking-type of viewer, Mackenzie\u2019s new take on a familiar concept will knock \u2018em out dead.",

It takes great elements from a huge variety of sources and recreates them in it's own, small world while providing only a minimum of context.

The entire movie feels like West Texas written and directed by a NYC film student who knows the geography and people only through watching other movies set in the same location.

Once in a while I wished for there to be no music so that I could decide myself on the mood of a particular scene. The recurring billboards on the side of the road are about as subtle as a Roadrunner cartoon. There is absolutely no chemistry between Pine and Ben Foster (his movie brother).

What a let down considering the great word of mouth, solid cast and welcome genre.  Jackass critics over-praise yet again here doing nobody but the makers and themselves a favor!  The idiots obviously grade on a curve.  Do they give this mild effort a break only because everything else is so piss poor?  They're unfit to be giving their worthless opinions on anything.\rJeff Bridges is a very fine actor and one of the great contemporary movie stars.  Lifelong fan and he's in my top three favorite movie stars.  He's good here and all the funny lines are delivered by his character, but that's about all that's good in this film.  The script is weak on story.  Low stakes, high boredom with contrived characters in clich\u00e9 circumstances that have been put on screen countless times.  The motivating family backstory is not going to be bought by a thinking audience.  Obviously the writer and director were trying to comment on the modern West (actually its Texas here) with their dissertation in the forefront, and the lame story taking the backseat.  Major mistake and it never works.  If you want to do that then go make a documentary, write a book or become a painter because Hollywood movies should always be about strong narrative.  Any kind of message on the nature of things should be sub-text, always!  The audience needs a good story and the rest can filter through sub-consciously or even overtly, but the priority must be on story.  The rookies behind this either don't get that, or just couldn't come up with the goods.  (\"Sicario\" was a pretty phony and thin movie for that matter.)  The tone and craft of this movie are fine and that's what the sheep critics are all flocking around because they are very easily fooled.  It's a slow slog building up to nothing much.\r Also there is a ridiculous logic flaw in the plot, what little plot there is.  And not a flaw but maybe more troubling is a lack of moral subjectivity by the authorship of the film.  The anti-hero is nothing new.  What is are today's Leftist amoral filmmakers who don't pass judgment on extreme violence but show it matter of factly which is more realistic (except for the ubiquitous blood splatter now in shows and movies which is not realistic most of the time and in some ways the old code movies completely devoid of it are actually more realistic), however less reasonable for an audience looking for meaning.  The tone shifts from buddy joking to cold blooded killing by characters the filmmakers intend you to like.  That's not the problem.  The lack of more of a moral payoff is.  The danger is a culture heading for a complete lack of morality in the arts.",

It tells the story of two bank robber brothers, facing the old, fat and decaying hand of the law. Few things happen across the movie, making it very hard to follow, the beginning being the worst part; the western characteristic that defines the film is only noticeable in the climax (and the music), a bit more thrilling and enjoyable. The three main characters are poorly defined mostly superficially. One brother short tempered, not very smart and of unpredictable behavior; the other representing the brain of the gang, with an admirable objective but incoherent parenting; and the near to retirement ranger that wants one last glimpse of adventure. A thing to highlight is the process of recognition that two of these characters go throw as the plot cultivates, and that creates a different outcome however different not in all cases means good. Above all, the performances are interesting, especially Jeff Bridges and Ben Foster, also the photography is classy; but it\u2019s not enough.

The police spend most of their time engaged in idle banter and do virtually nothing that might be described as \"police work\" or \"investigating\" unless you include making wild guesses.  The justification for the two brothers committing all kinds of mayhem is slim at best and boils down to the argument that they will lose everything if they don't pay off the mortgage on time.

It is going to be controversial because as far as I am concerned, most people like this movie and the casts are famous. (but that does not change how I evaluate this movie)\rFirst of all, spoiler alert. This movie's plot is about someone robbing a few banks and manage to get away from it and be rich at the end. And giving a reason (for his kids) so it can be justified. Basically casually robbed a few banks, killing a few civilians and policemen, and sacrifice his brother. If a lot of American like the plot, I am not surprised why plenty of people support Donald Trump. It is no way this concept make any sense to the rest of the world (America is not world if someone is confused).\rBack to the plot, how Toby not being recognised, the cafe lady and 3 cowboys were in the cafe. I could understand the cafe lady might pity Toby by Chris Pine good looking, but surely the 3 cowboys would have recognised him. The car dealer would have recognised him. And the police would also found out he was crossing somewhere very close to the incident where his ID was checked. And only the ranger thinks Toby is the suspect. Anyway, let's settle with the plot.\rActing, the most remarkable actor would be the actress who sold T-bones. The ranger, he is ok, did his character of being a dick, bullying his colleague (again in a justified way so his Mexican colleague would remember him), and he felt sad and joy to take revenge for his death colleague. I suppose there would be some feelings for the ranger character when he went to Toby's place to confront him. Because the ranger thinks and believes Toby is the mastermind behind this thing and should be responsible for the death of his colleague. There might be some acting on those conflicts of the emotions although I could not quite see it (100% because I am not expert in acting).\rAbout filming, the place looks quite pretty, or cinematographic. I suppose I could relate this movie to the style of Revenant. Many pretty sky and landscapes pictures. Unlike the majority preference, I do think the storyline and/or the message behind the movie is more important than those graphics around it. I mean it is nice to have it around. For example, nba2k has good graphics, but gameplay sucks. Hence, nba2k is a **** game. Same principle apply when I watch movies. Nothing against graphics, good to be there, not really upset if it is not there, unless I am watching a documentary.",

The movieI went into this movie with very high expectations. I have just seen it even though it had been out for nearly half a year, and have gotten countless recommendations for this movie, as well as seeing lots of positive reviews for it. The movie had also gotten an Oscar nomination for best picture, increasing my expectations. Sadly, I was left unsatisfied.Characters/Acting: The acting was well done; Chris Pine did an excellent job of portraying his character, better than I had expected. I'm looking forward to hopefully seeing him in more dramatic, Oscar-worthy performances in the future. Ben Foster did a good job as well, but Jeff Bridges, in my mind, seemed a bit overrated. He played a very Jeff Bridges character, and though he did have a good range of emotions in a few scenes, he didn't do much throughout the movie. I also didn't feel like there was enough of a connection or comparison between the two pairs of characters (Pine and Foster as brothers and Bridges and Gil Birmingham as the 2 cops). They barely even met, and I didn't feel a good comparison between the two kinds, if that's what the movie was going for.Cinematography: Throughout the duration of the movie, there are countless, and I mean perpetual, endless shots of the small, depressed lands of Texas that the movie takes place in. Eventually I found the shots boring and repetitive, to the point where I was almost saying \"if I see another shot of a barren wasteland in Texas, I'm going to throw my remote into the television.\"Overall, the movie isn't necessarily bad; it's an okay way to kill two hours. If I didn't have such high expectations from what I had read and other people suggesting it for me, I may have knocked the rating up to a 7.Also, whenever you see it, stick around for the T-bone restaurant scene, it's the best and funniest scene of the whole movie.",

I wanted to get that out of the way because I have a serious complaint about this film. Hell or High Water spends most of its time in a realistic place. It paints a picture of two brothers who have a realistic life with believable relationships with both each other and the world around them. It also paints a realistic scenario that, while not without holes, certainly gives a purpose behind the bank robbing and other shenanigans. Hell and High Water is also a fable. Not quite of the Magic Realism kind that one easily could have seen this film drift into but of the wish fulfillment kind. The kind one would expect in a children's adventure. In other words the ending of The Goonies. Now one could easily argue if The Goonies ending worked for well The Goonies but it simply doesn\u2019t strike true to a film that admittedly was getting looser with reality as it went along. Upon reflection one certainly, could imagine that the writer or director was well aware that they were drifting into fable territory and simply loosened the rules of the world of the film as events progressed. I certainly am willing to give this finely crafted film this. The ending just seemed too clean for a film so otherwise grounded. The equivalent of a ghost pirate ship drifting in the background.Speaking of endings souring an otherwise fine experience. The inclusion of a blasting Black Sabbath song at the end of the first Iron Man worked because well it's and Iron Man movie and it's an Iron Man song. This film is drifting quietly into the sunset and suddenly we are blasted with this loud obnoxious country rock song (Outlaw State of Mind by Chris Stapleton) that doesn\u2019t fit the scene, or mood and honestly at that point doesn\u2019t fit the film. The film overall is great, The acting is more than solid all across the board and the film spends the vast majority of its running time in a good place. Like I said a very good film overall.",

The cinematography and score are excellent, and all of the performances are polished and well executed. The script is brilliant, and the storyline is a stark critique of an America which has neglected its poor for too long. The social commentary isn't subtle, but this adds poignancy given the current debacle being played out in this election cycle, and the subtext won't be lost on anyone following the political upheaval which backgrounds the film. This is a fine film that is well worth your time. 8.87/10",

The slow and methodical cuts add richness and realism to the dialogue scenes, whilst the setting is authentic and complements the tone of the film. The small doses of humour spread throughout this film are surprising, yet come across as incredibly genuine and natural.
