            "content": "SPOILER: At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival the film \"ROOM\" won the People's Choice Award today. It tells a story of a young woman and her five year old son who have been held in captivity in a confined and windowless living space for six years. Brie Larson stars as Ma and her son named Jack is played by Jacob Tremblay who is so believable that you will feel empathetic towards their captivity but relief as to how Ma convinces Jack that their little world is real and is wonderful. As Jack grows he starts to ask questions about their isolated lifestyle and we the audience anticipate that Ma must try and escape with young Jack but how?The story draws similarities to the actual events that were Jaycee Lee Dugard's true life story which occurred on June 10, 1991, in South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard was 11 years old at the time she was abducted from a street while she was walking from home to a school bus stop and she was held captive for the next 18 years in a concealed back yard in a make shift shed. There is also some resemblance to the kidnapping of Amanda Berry who had a child fathered by her kidnapper Ariel Castro. This film was titled Cleveland Abduction and it was released in 2015. It tells the true story of three girls who were held captive for over 10 years by Ariel Castro in his home with no one aware how close the girls were to their own homes and families.The film Room focuses more on Jack and Ma's awkward adjustment to life outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six years. There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing all-star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son. There are some scenes that are so heartwarming that it will be difficult not to find yourself becoming emotionally involved. In one particular very touching and loving scene, Jack asks his Grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick Ma so she can return home from the hospital. Jack who understandably is initially withdrawn from anyone other than his Ma simply tells his Grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. This loving scene between Jack and his Grandma will stay with me forever. Jack and Ma's is a story of isolation, fear, hopelessness versus hope and most importantly a film about redemption and the family bond. Room is deserving of an Oscar nomination for best picture and nominations in a few other categories as well such as best actress, best actor and best director. I give the film a 9.5 out of 10 rating. This film is terrific!!",

            "content": "Room (2015/I) was directed by Lenny Abrahamson. It stars Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother (\"Ma\")The situation becomes very clear early in the film. Jack and his mother are held captive by a man who has kidnapped her, raped her, impregnated her, and uses her as his sexual slave. Jack and his mother have lived in a small, locked shed, which they call \"Room.\" Jack's mother has lived in \"Room\" since she was abducted seven years earlier. Jack has lived there for all of his life--five years.By incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from realizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that anyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe that his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept it.What happens next is pretty well known, but I won't go into it because it might decrease your enjoyment of the movie. It's dramatic, frightening, and, heart-wrenching, all at the same time.Brie Larson does a wonderful job as the mother, and Jacob Tremblay has to be the best child actor we have. He is absolutely brilliant. Director Abrahamson must be an extremely talented man to draw two such great performances from his actors.This is a must-see film, but it's not easy to watch. Even though Room wasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of cases of warped men who have kidnapped and enslaved women. It's hard to think about the lives of those women without becoming depressed. We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Given the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie, it will work on the small screen as well. Seek it out and watch, but prepare yourself mentally before you begin.",

            "content": "Lenny Abrahamson's Room opens in a 10 x 10 room that has no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that provided by an overhead skylight. Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a slight five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up each morning as he has all his life, saying hello to his world. He says hello, not to the sun or the grass outside his front door where he can run and laugh and play but only to the objects which is all his world consists of: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds with some pleasure.Not that he lacks for companionship. Ma (Brie Larson) is with him and their endless days consist of cooking, reading, and watching TV where Jack is told that what he sees on the screen is not real, only pretend. All he knows of the world is what he sees in front of his eyes. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) brings food and other household items but when he comes, Jack has to hide in his wardrobe, out of sight. Ma, we find out, has been kept prisoner and used for sex by the hulking man who comes every night and we know that Jack is a result of his mother's rape. Jack is the focus of the film and we see everything from his point of view, with the help of his sometime narration but we can also get into his mother's mind and feel her pain and live her dreams.There is never any doubt of his mother's love though the obvious strain of keeping herself from crying out every minute is painfully obvious. To Jack, she is the center of his world and his reason for being. When the second half of the film takes a surprising turn and shifts 180 degrees, Jack and Ma are not prepared for what awaits them. Even when an alternative is suggested as possible, he doesn't want to hear anything about a different world with blue sky and rivers and trees. Room is a tense and compelling film in which Brie Larson more than fulfills the brilliance that she showed in Short Term 12 and should make her an Oscar contender. Tremblay is also superb.He lives his character and makes him come alive, even though he is only nine years old. Supporting roles by Joan Allen and William H. Macy also contribute to the film's second half but it is always Larson and Tremblay that carry the day. The film is not mawkish or sentimental even though the soaring score by Stephen Rennicks comes close. While there are has some plot implausibilities, the film is a tribute to the resiliency and the dedicated love of a parent for their child. It is also a teaching experience. Like many who are walled off from each other and think the box they are in is all there is, the film can give us the combination to open the locked door, if we take the risk to turn the key.",

            "content": "Based on the novel of the same name by Emma Donoghue, 'Room' is a challenging, unsettling, harrowing film, that leaves you disturbed. But that is its sheer power. The Incredible Performances only add to the film's hefty nature.'Room' Synopsis: After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery: the outside world.'Room' is a disturbing story about bad things that happen to good people. But its also about hope & fighting back. Its shocking to see the protagonist, a child, discover the world along-with his brave mother, who survived a harrowing experience. I was engrossed & often disturbed by the narrative, especially after the son & mother escape. The series of events that follow are so gut-wrenching, I almost broke down.'Room' is masterfully penned by Emma Donoghue herself. The Writing is consistently powerful & the dialogue are realistic to the core. Lenny Abrahamson's Direction is first-class. He has handled this dramatic, unsettling tale with complete flourish. Cinematography is perfectly claustrophobic. Editing is razor-crisp. Art Design is skilfully done.Performance-Wise: Brie Larson & Jacob Tremblay deliver incredible performances. Brie is astounding as the tormented, yet brave protagonist, while Jacob steals the show with a flawless performance. The child does wonders & makes 'Room' unforgettable. Of the supporting cast, Joan Allen & The Always Solid William H. Macy leave a solid mark.On the whole, 'Room' is a must watch! Its certainly unsettling, but its power is undeniable.",

            "content": "That review summary may sound very oxymoronic, but to me it applies to a film such as 'Room'. A film with a difficult subject, that is the stuff of nightmares, but tells it so beautifully with an interesting approach that works better than all the potential traps that films of its genre could fall under.What could have easily have been told in a lurid, gratuitous way (being inspired by the true-life case of Josef Fritzl) is instead told in a careful and restrained way. There is even an innocence in 'Room', due to its very fascinating decision to tell it from the viewpoint of a five year old, in this case Jack, one that comes off very movingly and gives a sense that there is a little ray of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. The source material, equally brilliant, is to be thanked here, its author Emily Donoghue adapts it to screen here and none of its power is lost. Really appreciated the careful and restrained approach to the storytelling in 'Room', and for me and many others it was something different considering the subject. It does though affect some of the pacing in the middle act, where a little of the tension seen in especially the first part is lost a little. For my tastes too, though it probably did fit the film's younger and more innocent viewpoint it's told from, the music score does lay it on too thick with the treacle.However, loved how the story was told and its approach. What 'Room' also strongly benefitted from being told this way was that the mother and son relationship was able to shine through and really resonate, which it may not have done as effectively with a heavier tone. And shine through it does, with great charm and poignancy. Also appreciated that none of the characters were painted too black and white, even Old Nick. Production values are effectively claustrophobic and the nocturnal parts chillingly nightmarish. 'Room' is beautifully directed by someone who understood how claustrophobic thrillers worked, how mother and son bonds do in dire situations do and the ability to combine both to ensure a powerful experience. A directing job that's both unsettling and empathetic. Similarly 'Room' is written with effortless skill and deft thoughtfulness. Can't find anything to fault the performances. The superb one of Brie Larson, that was a very worthy Oscar (Golden Globe and Bafta too) win in her category, is an obvious starting point, but one mustn't overlook the beyond-his-years turn of young Jacob Tremblay, one of the best child acting performances in recent years, and William H Macy and Joan Allen both giving some of their best work in years. Sean Bridgers also gives much more to what could have been a standard clich\u00e9 role.Overall, great powerful film but the somewhat fascinatingly unconventional (for the genre) way the story was told won't work for some. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "Awesome film - shame about the trailer",
            "content": "Room, based on the book by Emma Donoghue, starts on young Jack's 5th birthday. He gets a birthday cake from his mother (but no candles); a visit from his father; and a gift, albeit belatedly. This would all be perfectly normal except that all of this takes place within 'Room' - a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life examples such as that perpetrated by Josef Fritzl in Austria. Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in 'TV land' and unreal. Will Jack and Joy survive and ever see freedom again? And that's where I'll leave this synopsis, since (if you've been lucky enough to avoid the trailer) there is a tense cat-and-mouse story to unfurl here.This is an absorbing, although slow-moving, film that builds to some truly nail-biting moments. The screenwriter (also Donoghue) and director (Irishman Lenny \"Frank\" Abrahamson) are to be commended in keeping the story and drama really well-grounded and un-saccharined. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the 'evil kidnapper', is not painted as some predictable monster: he is even portrayed to be kind and caring at some warped level. And there is no gratuitous sex: we are in effect seven years into the story and the abnormal is now completely normalised.The film is told primarily from the viewpoint of Jack (Jacob Tremblay) but we also get under the skin of Joy (Brie Larson) and her emotions in trying to mentally deal with her ordeal. Looking at a picture of her with her school friends she bitterly comments that \"Nothing happened to them - - they just got on with their lives\".The acting is superb. I made the mistake of voting for John Boyega for the BAFTA Rising Star award before seeing this film (you can cast your vote here http://www.bafta.org/film/awards/ee-rising-star-award-in-2016). Not that Boyega isn't great, but Brie Larson really REALLY delivers here. She obviously won't give a hoot if she wins the Best Actress Oscar! And for me, for this award, she shines out in what I would perhaps see as one of this year's weaker Oscar categories. Jacob Tremblay is also exceptional as Jack - and it would be nice (rather than try to compare young performances with adult ones, as per Anna Paquin) if there was a special awards category for actors and actresses under 10. If there was, then Tremblay would storm it! You seriously forget that this is a child acting a part. He is totally connected to the role and these two core performances lock in your belief in the story.Supporting the cast are the ever reliable William H Macy as Joy's mentally tortured father, Joan Allen (Pamela Landy from the \"Bourne\" films) as her equally distraught mother and Sean Bridgers as the kidnapper.At 2 hours long some of the scenes in the middle of the film made my attention waver a little. But my main criticism is in the trailer and marketing of the film. If ever there was a need for a true 'teaser trailer' this is it. I never know who is responsible for putting trailers together - whether the director has the final say or whether its some nameless marketing bods in the distribution company, but whoever it is they should be taken out and 'given a good talking to' for this travesty. It's like putting all of the twists in films like \"The Crying Game\", \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"Gone Girl\" in their respective trailers. I've gone so far as to create my own One Mann's Movies cut of the trailer, just for you good people, which I have included with my bob-the-movie-man.com version of this review.A leisurely, nuanced and effecting drama, this is not for fans of \"Die Hard\" or \"Fast and Furious\" fans. But for everyone else, this should be a must see.Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review. Thanks.",

            "review_title": "A non-traditional thriller with another brilliant turn from Brie Larson but an even better one from Jacob Tremblay.",
            "content": "Room is a harrowing thriller, but not in the traditional sense of the word. It deals with a dark subject matter and the first half of the film can be quite disturbing. Yet director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion thanks to two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks and surprise at every turn.Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, Room introduces us to Ma and Jack, a mother and son held captive in a garden shed. As we learn more about their captivity, their world becomes clearer and clearer to us. They live by a routine, have names for every object in room, and Ma must be careful as her son grows older and more curious.The film is structured into two halves, and by now it's no spoiler that the second half deals with their readjustment into the outside world, and Jack's first time outside of room. The film is thematically complex, yet never overwhelming. At its core it's about motherhood, but Jack's unique upbringing complicates things.Director Lenny Abrahamson is no stranger to the strange, and with Room he's made a masterpiece of filmmaking. The entire idea of 'room,' the abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. What I loved about the book was its focus on Jack and how he adjusts to seeing this new world for the first time, and the movie never loses sight of that.I wrote about the pressure placed on child actors in my review for the incredible Beasts of No Nation, and Jacob Tremblay fits like a glove. Like Abraham Attah, he isn't a child actor, but an actor who just happens to be of a younger age. His wide eyes and expressive thoughts are very believable, and when he sees the outside world for the first time, it's a thing of beauty. Tremblay has brilliant chemistry with Brie Larson, and for one second I never doubted her devotion to him. As Ma faces frustrating upon leaving room, from her parents, doctors, and the media, she never forgets her son Jack, and always puts his wellbeing first. Larson taps into this character, one that undergoes a stunning transformation as she basically lost seven years of her life being locked up. Her performance will blow you away.The best actors are the ones able to transport you into their characters' own universes, no matter how isolated from society they happen to be. Larson, Tremblay, and Joan Allen all have a tremendous range of emotional ability and are able to sell you on their story not just for two hours, but for an entire lifetime. With Room, Abrahamson goes the extra mile with his direction, and director of photography Danny Cohen keeps all eyes on Jack. The film asks us to examine how we view the world and how this viewpoint is shaped by our nurtured upbringing. The result is a breathtaking experience brought to life, one you won't soon forget.",

            "review_title": "This one is gonna stick with me",
            "content": "\"Room\" is an adaption of an internationally best-seller novel written by Irish playwright and novelist, Emma Donoghue. This is her first book to be adapted into a major motion picture and I have to say that it is a rather impressive one. I have not read Emma's novel yet, but I can only guess that this movie sticks to the novel's roots, considering that Emma decided to write the screenplay herself. Room is a story about a women who was kidnapped during her high school years and locked in a shed for 7 years. She was impregnated by her kidnapper in this room and was locked inside with the child. The child grows up and around the age of five is when the movie picks up. Throughout this entire movie we are taken through this story strictly from the Jack's (the child) point of view. Even though this story is experienced through the lens of this child, the story is in no way filtered or gussied up. It is this intimate and raw story about a child and his mother spending a hugely relevant portion of their existence stuck in this dull, dirty and claustrophobia-inducing shed. This shed contained one small window that emits a tiny portion of daylight into the room. To me, this represented a light at the end of the tunnel. Sort of like a tiny glimmer of hope in a deep and dark abyss. Throughout this entire movie, Jack narrates his experiences as he embarks upon the world. Jacob Trembley portrays this character with such a sense of wonder and innocence that every single narration that I hear from this boy is just heartbreaking. Every time Jack takes away something from the world, he takes it in as something new and exciting even if it is scary. They are things that everyone takes for granted everyday: trees, dogs, the sky, etc. You would think that the dramatic climax would be at the beginning when Jack gets out of the tiny room he has been locked in his entire life, but after-wards, this film just drags in one dramatic scene after another in a way that turns this film into one big heartache an experience. I do have say that Jacob Trembley and Allison Brie's performances carry a lot of the weight of this film. Allison gives a very natural and organic performance. You never catch her overacting or being too stiff during any scene in this movie. Jack Trembley gave one of the most, if not the most, impressive performances of the year. Not just because of his age, but because of how well of a dramatic performance that he gives without over or underacting in any of his scenes. He seemed to take his role with a very adult-like seriousness that translated into a lot of the movie's themes of innocence that are chased by the persistent and harsh reality that Jack and his mother are facing. The directing and cinematography in this film are beautiful. The film's intense theme is complimented with a variety of out-of- focus and close up shots that highlight the child's immediate consciousness as he takes the outside world with fresh- eyes. Many of the scenes are also complimented by a beautiful and breathtaking film score composed by the award-winning Stephen Rennicks who has been crafting soundtracks in the indie film world since 1997. Overall, this is a film that I won't be forgetting for the rest of my life. Mainly because it is a film about escaping outside of the room that you have been stuck in your whole life and discovering a world that has been hidden from you. I know that sounds kind of cheesy but this film does it in the most grounded and intense way possible. Not to mention that it is dosed with themes of abandonment, human-kindness, and media exploitation. I don't usually give films a 10/10. As a matter of fact, I could probably count the films this year that I do consider 10s on one hand. The films I consider perfect are life changing in some way or benchmarks in cinematic history. While this film will probably be washed away by the ever expanding ocean that is cinema, it is not a movie that I will be personally ever forgetting. I can't remember watching a film that made me feel so grateful for just being alive.",

            "content": "There is a lot to admire about this film. The direction in the first hour and the final minutes, especially gets the most out of the concept and manages to make a 10 by 10 foot space seem like everything and eventually nothing. Likewise, the direction leaves much of the horror to the imagination and it is all the more chilling as a result. The screenplay is sparse and spartan in the way real life is around such horrific events. I like that several of the tensions in the story, i.e. grandfather's inability to deal with his grandson, are left unresolved. Finally Larson gives one hell of an understated, yet raw, performance that elevates the already strong material.But much credit has to be given to Jacob Tremblay as well as the director for producing one of the finest, if not the finest, child performances of all time. I haven't seen a child actor as natural and real since at least Justin Henry in Kramer vs Kramer 40+ years ago. Tremblay has no artifice or pretension at all. Jack isn't cloying and so much of the emotional power comes from that character. It would be a remarkable performance no matter what but Jack is a hard character to play. Strictly speaking, Jack is the protagonist and it is his story-the movie at its core is a coming of age tale (abet a messed up one). The scenario that Jack is in is just hard for any person to really sell, let alone a child actor. It is a very good performance.This is a good movie. It is hopeful in the end but it is intense.",

I'm just at a loss for words and struggling to describe how truly powerful and heart-grabbing this story was. I'll go so far as to say that if you don't cry, shed a tear, or feel the urge to weep profusely after (or while) watching Room, you don't have a heart. The mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay, 9 years old!) carry this entire movie. The beauty of Room is in its bare rawness, realness and universally relatable nature. What can I say? It tapped into something deep, deep, deep within me and just ripped my heart to shreds and had me in tears; sometimes tears of sadness, and other times tears of heavenly joy. It made me smile at times and even laugh. But most of all, it always had my eyes glued to the screen and my soul enthralled by what I was witnessing. This is one of the best, truly real stories ever told and one of the best uses of cinema I've ever seen. ...Try not to read much/anything about it before going in to see it (and yes, definitely catch it in a theater near you ASAP). Go in and be engrossed and moved (in ways I can't describe) by this experience. 10/10 *Hands down* the best film of 2015, and the single best thing I've seen in years. :')",

Brie Larson deservedly won an Oscar for her performance in this, but Room should've swept the board in every category.The film centres on a Mother and her five year old son, living inside just four walls, and it slowly transpires that she has been held captive for seven years, and had a child by her kidnapper. She creates a world for her son within their confines, not telling him the truth about their situation and what's outside until he's old enough to understand. After failed escape attempts in the past, but now with the help of her son, she gives freedom another try.There were moments in Room that were so intense that I barely breathed. It never feels inauthentic, and thanks to incredible acting, it's always believable. If you want a straight-up thriller of 'bad guy commits crime, bad guy gets comeuppance', you'll be disappointed. This is about human resilience, the bond between Mother and child, selflessness, and finding your place in the world after having your understanding of it flipped upside down.",

            "content": "Room is based on the 2010 novel of the same name by the Irish turned Canadian novelist/playwright Emma Donoghue. The film has already garnered accolades from almost all critical quarters with heaps of approbation for its lead actress, Brie Larson. It's a rather uncomplicated story with a plot that is broken up into two distinct parts.For the first 45 minutes or so, a young mother, Joy, and five year old son, Jack, appear trapped in a small room where they've been residing for quite a long time. Eventually it's revealed we're watching a horror story: seven years earlier, when Joy was 17 years old, she was kidnapped by a neighborhood pervert, Old Nick, who has kept her prisoner in a shed next to his house. Old Nick makes what appear to be weekly visits bringing groceries but also rapes Joy whenever he comes over. There's no escape from the room that only has one skylight window since Old Nick is the only one who knows the numbers to the combination lock to enter.Jack is born as a result of Old Nick violating Joy and it's her son that's the only thing keeping her alive. The child does remarkably well despite growing up in such a deprived environment. Joy teaches Jack how to make a birthday cake and he plays with the limited amount of objects found in the room\u2014occasionally Old Nick might bring the boy a present (such as an electric model car). There are of course tensions between mother and son\u2014Joy doesn't react well when Jack throws a tantrum for example.The best part of the picture is the way in which Joy and Jack are rescued from this abominable situation--but unfortunately it's not all that believable. Joy's plan is to have Jack pretend that he's dead and instruct him how to escape from inside a rolled up rug after Old Nick drives away in his pickup to dispose of the \"body.\" The entire escape is predicated on Old Nick's decision not to check to see if Jack is really dead\u2014as the scene plays out, Old Nick inexplicably backs off after Joy screams at him not to look at Jack because (as she explains it to him), she can't stomach the idea of the pervert touching her dead son. The subsequent way in which Jack miraculously escapes from Old Nick's truck and the heart- pounding way in which the police figure out where the little boy came from, make up for the slow-moving turn of events in Act One.The second half of Room does not have the rising tension found in the first. The focus on how all the family members adjust is what the second half of Act Two is all about. Joy returns home to find her mother Nancy divorced from her father Robert, and now married to Leo. There is an underdeveloped subplot involving Robert who is repulsed by the idea that Jack was conceived through rape and that his father was pervert Old Nick. Robert goes home to an out of state residence and his catalog of resentments remain unexplored.A better subplot involves the intrusion of the media upon Joy and the rest of the family. Joy agrees to give an interview to a reporter for money and she asks her painful questions about what went on with Old Nick and whether she made the right decision in raising Jack and depriving him of a normal childhood (the suggestion is made that she could have convinced Old Nick to leave the newborn Jack anonymously at a hospital). Conflict develops between Joy and Nancy and eventually there's the rather predictable trope of Joy attempting suicide. Most critics found Jack's acclimation to his new found world to be touching and cathartic. When he bonds with Leo's dog and a new pal next door, all seems right with the world. And even Joy is seen getting herself together at film's end.So what is one to think of all this? It's a story that I suppose holds one's interest to the end; although the central twist (i.e. the escape), feels contrived. While the young Jacob Tremblay did a fine job playing Jack, his successful adjustment to the outside world feels to me much more schematic than cathartic, as many critics insist. As for Brie Larson, calls for her to win an Oscar for best actress seem misplaced--although her performance is fine given the pedestrian script.In the end, Room rises to the level of an average Lifetime movie, with a few interesting twists and turns here and there but more predictable elements making up the bulk of the overall proceedings.",

Ma finally tells Jack that her name is Joy Newsome and she was taken when she was 17 some 7 years ago. Jack angrily disbelieves at first. Joy comes up with a daring gamble to escape back to her parents (Joan Allen, William H. Macy).This is a star-making role for Brie Larson. Her performance in 'Short Term 12' is amazing but little seen. She once again delivers a top-notch performance. She has inner strength and humanity. Jacob Tremblay is a wonderful discovery with his squeaky little voice. It's an almost perfect little film.

But this is about survival and hope, neither of which comes without agonizing risk. It's also about how people deal with things for which they have no true appreciation. I refer to two characters. The first is the father of the young woman. He must deal with what he sees as the devil's spawn. The second, a reporter that begins to malign her because she hasn't done what \"she\" sees as heroic.

            "review_title": "2 great performances and a captivating story",
            "content": "\"Room\" is an American 2-hour movie from last year. The director is Lenny Abramson and writer is Emma Donoghue, who actually adapted her own novel for the screen with this one. Both scored Academy Award nominations for their work with the Best Director slot certainly being the more surprising feat. The movie also got in for Best Picture and won lead actress Brie Larsen an Oscar, just like basically all precursors. Jacob Tremblay, however, was the real lead here and it is absolutely ridiculous that he was nominated for so many supporting awards. Voice-overs are usually a good indicator who is in the center of the story and we hear him at the very beginning and end for example. Also there are key scenes where we still find out about him while his mother is out of the picture, such as the successful escape or after his mother tries to commit suicide. But this should not mean that Larson isn't lead. She is as well, but only the second lead despite being credited first.I believed this film delivered on many areas, such as emotion and drama most importantly. The escape inside the carpet was downright thrilling from start to finish until the very moment we realize he succeeded. But even the tension stays high as we do not know what happened to his mother. Did he kill her or not. The consequence of these scenes is also the emotion in here. The moments when Larson's character runs towards the car with her son inside is really moving and there are more scenes like that, such as the way they meet the grandparents or also the scene with the boy and the dog towards the end. You will be amazed by these and it is really difficult to hold the tears back.This is a very tragic, yet very uplifting film at the same time, but certainly more of the latter. The scenes early on in the prison do not seem as sad as they really are as we see everything through the eyes of the son. It starts right away inside the shack and I initially thought the woman actually has a mental disorder because of which she won't leave the place and the guy coming occasionally is somebody who provides them with the necessary items in exchange for sexual pleasure. It is seen a lot more as a prison when the action moves outside, which is roughly the entire second half of the film. I personally think that there are a couple scenes that don't add that much really and could have been left out. It is also difficult to say if this film had worked even better if it would have ended with the reunion of the two outside, but I guess it would have been a major (maybe impossible) challenge to make it work for 100 minutes or so. I guess it was best this way. Another flaw I saw with it was the attempted suicide scene I mentioned earlier already. It felt a bit unrealistic drama at this point. Yes it was all too much for her, but she fought for survival for 5 years and then she would do something like that. Of course, the reason was that she had doubts after the reporter asked her why she did not give up on her son inside. But this also would have been her surrender I guess as she certainly would never have gotten outside without him. But yeah, the way the press was depicted in here was generic and standard in a negative way. They could have dealt better with that situation.But despite these criticisms, these almost 120 minutes were a captivating watch and truly flew by. I can see why the Academy turned out to like it that much. Larson and Tremblay shine a lot and it was impossible to say who was better. Okay, I could have done without some parts I mentioned already and also the mother-daughter argument, but these are just minor flaws. In the grand scheme of things, this film worked extraordinarily well and was extremely tense and touching at the same time. I command you to check it out. Highly recommended.",

I was just well bored, almost bored to a brain-killing stupor. The young kid played his role not bad but if I compare him with the little girl from the movie Hidden (I know, I know, different genres but at least the location/space/set for acting is comparable)- he's just okay. The one thing I was the whole time wondering - why the woman didn't just kill the guy in his sleep. Well I heard about Stockholm-Syndrome, but the woman didn't behave imo like a person with that \"kind of state\" would, but Iam no specialist here. Well, so many ppl praising and liking that movie so tbh they can't be all wrong - so just try that movie and see what kind of movie Room is for you. Btw - one very weak point of the movie is for me that I didn't attach to the mother and his son at all - I watched that movie with no sympathy nor dislike for them. Well, I rated it 1 because of all the legions of 10s, my \"real\" vote is a 4 but no more.I re-watched the movie and I must say I even do like it less, if it's possible. I realised why I don't like this movie at all: Room tells us the typical Love-Conquers-It-All-Narration but if u have ever known/met a person or worked with a person who was sexually or otherwise traumatically assaulted you know that just love doesn't heal everything. Lots of ppl just never really leave behind the trauma, the trauma is a big part of their life. So this movie is kinda Disney-life and has not much to do with real life. Room is the typical sugar-coated version (and the book also if it has the same conclusion) of a Love-Conquers-It-All-script - it happens in real life yes, but this kind of story is told countless times before on screen and in real life rare. Many real good stories hurt reading, but Hollywood gives you 9 times out of 10 cotton-candy at the end. So does Room. Btw - the boy almost shows no sign of disturbance in his behavior whatsoever. If u see pictures (or meet them in real life) of e.g. war-traumatized kids you understand how dumb this is. If I compare this movie to The Lovely Bones with Saoirse Ronan, Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz u also see that the actors are just mediocre. And whereas The Lovely Bones is really heartbreaking and got suspense and is told poetically superb, Room has nothing of it to offer. Or watch Chained with Vincent D'Onofrio as a sick, emotionally dead serial killer. To watch D'Onofrio's superb play was shocking good. And the relationship between Rabbit (Eamon Farren) and his captor Bob (D'Onofrio) beats everything Room provides easy. Chained is shocking good. Room is shocking naive and boring.",

I was expecting something special what with Brie Larson winning the Oscar for her performance and the numerous good reviews, but I wasn't prepared for how powerful, emotional and moving this film was.Room is such a whirlwind of emotions, from utter despair to hope this will have you feeling everything. I was in tears for near enough a whole 10 minutes in the middle due to the swell of emotions. The plot is perhaps one best left to experience yourself, so I won't go into any depth, but suffice to say it is devastatingly heart-warming (despite the paradoxical nature of that statement I believe it's apt!).At the heart of this film was the beautiful, close yet complicated relationship between Ma and Jack, portrayed so incredibly well by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. I can't emphasise enough how astoundingly good both of them were. The character of Ma was so well written, with so much depth and nuance. Her interactions with Jack were so captivating and engaging, I almost want to watch Room again straight away to experience them again immediately.I'm always in awe of films which manage to draw so much out of such a small space, and the way that the confined environment of Room was used and explored was magnificent. It's a real lesson in cinema and technically its a spectacular film, as well as being so visceral.Room has to be one of the best films I've seen in recent years. I've called a few films a 'must see' before, and the term gets bandied about perhaps a bit too loosely at times, but it could not be more apt when it comes to Room.

Not having read the book or really heard anything specific about the film, it did catch me off guard in a small way, since I had come into the film with the specifics of the situation in mind. The first half of the film does make it more than this though, because I was drawn into a relationship which was emotionally raw and compelling. The film uses the limits of the room really well, focusing on the mother/son relationship and making us care about it while also being horrified by the specifics.The second half of the film manages to maintain that engagement, while flipping the characters in such a way that made the drama work in a much different way, and cast a different light on the first half of the film. It is tough in terms of subject matter, but at the same time it is easy to watch because of how well the film draws you into caring about the lead two characters. A big part of this is how well both Larson and Tremblay delivery; they are organic and natural performances, and are supported equally well by the likes of Allen and Macey.

While he may not quite get past the whole \"kid actor\" stereotype he is admittedly better than almost every other child actor out there today. Both of these actors are receiving some serious awards buzz right now, as is this film in general. This may be due to the odd nature of its plot line. A mother and child are stuck inside a room for at least five years of their lives. Trapped inside never once going out to see or experience the world. So, when they get out we watch as this child gets to see everything for the first time.Yes it's an interesting plot that hasn't really been done before but it can't really pull it off. It's odd that it struggles so bad with making this a worthy adaption of the book seeing as the author actually wrote the film. Much like last years 'Gone Girl'. However 'Gone Girl' actually had a good director.The one other film this director had done was 'Frank'. So I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, he may have proved to us that he is a one hit wonder. Because this film is not near as good as everyone is saying. This mainly steams from sloppy writing. Writing that would've probably worked in a book format. In that format you are able to show characters thoughts and feelings far easier than in film so you have to write accordingly.But this doesn't happen. This is really the only reason this film fails. But it fails hard. From the first scenes of the film it was pretty clear that not enough thought went into making this a piece of cinema. Characters actions and reactions to everything feel absurdly artificial. Like a cop figuring out where the room they lived in was from one extremely vague sentence. Or how the film seems to pretend like these two had never made one single escape attempt.Literally the second escape they try gets them out. I couldn't help think that they had never actually tried, because the guy didn't even hesitate to buy into their trick. In fact not one person in this film reacts naturally. Everyone was an extreme version of a normal person and it made nearly everyone in the film super unlikable. Especially the main two characters. They did virtually nothing aside from scream at whoever they wanted for no apparent reason. Almost every conversation ended in an annoying screaming match between random people. A screaming match that either made no sense or just made you dislike the characters. So, when these two get out it's hard to legitimately care about them. You don't know anything about them other then the fact that they liked yelling for no reason.'Room' may have strong performances and an interesting idea to back it up but not much else. It has a hard time making you actually care about its characters. No one reacts like a human being but instead yells at each other when ever they feel like they need to. It wastes its best qualities with a limp and lifeless script that fails to appropriately adapt the acclaimed novel.",

Just the initial plot - a mother and her son imprisoned for several years and how they escape - was original enough but then we have the psychological and emotional implications of returning to society (or, in Jack's case, joining society for the first time), and this takes the plot to another plane. Jack being confronted by and adapting to his new world is wonderfully and very sensitively told. His mother having to deal with all her doubts regarding Jack adapting, and any residual guilt she feels from their time in captivity, is a great, and quite natural, story line too.Great, emotional ending that perfectly ties up the movie.Brie Larson got a Best Actress Oscar for her performance and deserved it.

I found the first half actually set in the room to be nearly unbearable. I'm a father of young boys and trying to imagine the scenario set up in the book made me almost physically ill. I'm not sure I could have read the whole thing if the mother and her son had not escaped from their captor, but once they did, I felt like the air went out of the book and everything that happened after was much less compelling.The movie spends much less of its time in the room itself, because what takes pages and pages to describe in the book can be conveyed much more quickly with a few carefully chosen images. Therefore, more of the film takes place on the outside, but the filmmakers do a better job of making that the compelling narrative. The movie becomes a tribute to the resilience and adaptability of children, and captures that feeling parents experience when the world and all it contains once again becomes a wondrous place because they're seeing it through the eyes of their children.Brie Larson won an Oscar for her performance, and while I certainly don't begrudge her the win, I didn't feel that her performance was necessarily the slam-dunk best of the year that her dominance of the awards circuit suggested. The one who amazes in the film is Jacob Tremblay, playing Jack.

For Jack, every step and every breath outside is a wholly new experience. Ma, despite having lived for 17 years before coming to Room, encounters different obstacles \u2013 the world has moved on, and she doubts her own ability as a mother to Jack.I had been expecting a suspenseful drama-thriller about a daring escape, given the various synopses I'd read. (The movie is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue, which is itself loosely based on real events.) Much of the first half of the film, though, concentrates on life inside Room for Ma and Jack. Ma uses her strong will and infinite patience to convince Jack for five years that all is well and that what they have is a normal life, that what they see on television is not real, but everything from the single bed to the lidless toilet tank is definitely real. Ma sacrifices as much as she can to keep Jack happy and (relatively) safe, even to the point of giving herself over to her captor on a regular basis in exchange for food and other items for Jack and herself.To say that this first half moves slowly would be to understate things. We don't just get a slice of the life that the duo leads; we get the entire pie, and most of it just isn't all that exciting or intriguing. We do get to see a little into the characters of the characters, pardon the phrasing. We see that Jack doesn't like to not get his way or to have his worldview challenged. Then again, who does at age 5? We see that Ma is often calm but firm with her young charge. It's a small Room, after all; no need to go nuclear when there's really no point to it. In any event, much time is spent watching their everyday sheltered lives. Because the general plot involved their lives beyond Room, I began to grow impatient: Were they going to spend the entire movie in Room, only to escape in the final minutes? Why wouldn't anything happen? The fact that Ma and Jack would eventually escape left the first half of the movie perfectly devoid of suspense. Although still waters do often run deep, I didn't really feel like I was getting a lot out of watching a whole lot of nothing.Once they do escape, though, things pick up. The focus quickly shifts from a struggle for survival to a struggle to understand. Ma's parents, played by Joan Allen and William H. Macy, have different reactions to the return of their daughter and the arrival of their new (to them) grandson. In the five years since Ma's abduction, her parents have separated; her dad lives on the other side of the country now, and her mom lives with her friend Leo (Tom McCamus). With Ma's return, there's a lot of media hype, and lawyers, atop a potent array of stress factors. Escaping may have been the easy part.The acting is uniformly terrific. Larson's work is powerful, evocative, and heart-wrenching, and it's definitely award worthy. Allen and Macy also excel with perhaps the best work in their respective careers, and that's saying something. Young Tremblay is also very good \u2013 as is his character, a plucky, long-haired cherub who's more at home in Room than in the outside world (and with good reason).But the acting cannot overcome what's basically a very turgid script. Room is punchless at its core, and it would be a total waste if it weren't for the Herculean efforts of its talented cast. When there is no action, I look for meaning. When there is no meaning or action, I look for the exit. Room suffers from spending too much time contemplating things and not enough time doing them \u2013 or at least discussing them. Forget the action, I wouldn't have minded seeing more reaction. The first half of the movie could have been subtitled \"A Series of Plodding Events.\" The second half goes a long way toward saving the first, thanks in part to additional characters and a fresh setting, but it's not enough to save the entire movie.",

            "content": "A young mother with a son, Jack, lives in Room. It is literally that, a room with a bed, TV, sink, miniature stove, table, bathtub and a closet. They are seemingly a very loving little family with no other figure in their lives except for one person. This leads to questions which leads to further discovery of what is really going on with Room. I will leave this plot synopsis at that as I discovered this film without knowing nothing about the plot and was extremely grateful to see this uncovering what Room was.Room is a movie that really surprised the world. Brie Larson took home the academy award for best actress in a leading role and rightfully so. Her performance is utterly breathtaking and a risk taker as you find out the situation she is in and admire that she has created this magical world for her son while she's in a deep depression and put through the ringer almost every night. The major shock is that her co-star Jacob Tremblay was not nominated as well as this is one of the best child performances I had ever seen on film. The interaction between the two is absolutely memorizing, giving the clear message of how love can heal a tragic situation. Jacob does not come off as too cute or too annoying, but as a normal child. He gets happy, gets scared and hides in his mother's arms, he gets angry and yells, gets frustrated and denies problems like a child would. Joan Allen gives a great performance as well as Brie's mother, conveying the love, confusion and frustration of how to handle something wonderful coming back into your life but under tragic circumstances. It truly is an actor's film and the casting director couldn't have had more spot on.The direction is also very good, Lenny Abrahamson has this film almost 100% perfect. One of the things I really appreciated about Room is that it reminded me of what being a child is like. The first time we discover things and how your parents are your world. As you discover how large the world is, it feels like the knowledge is endless and you want to consume more and more. The scene where Jack sees the sky I will never forget and I couldn't stop crying that I had to pause the movie. So many things that we take for granted we see it through the eyes of a child and that's the best way to view things at times. Also through Brie's eyes as she comes back into the world after being gone and not feeling part of it as well. It shows truly how great the story was written and followed with a solid script.The one flaw I found with the film, which is a nitpick, I would have had William H. Macy in it a little more. He plays Brie's father and does a very good job and the scene at the dinner table where he cannot even look at Jack and Brie just breaks down begging him to accept her son. He leaves and it's heartbreaking but also human and you can understand why as frustrating as you want him to stay and be there for his daughter. A small spoiler, Brie ends up in the hospital again, but he's not even mentioned. He seems like a loving father who genuinely wants his daughter in his life, wouldn't he be a least a mention as to why he's not there? It's a small nitpick, but a legit question.Other than that, this is a terrific film and is my favorite of 2015. I highly recommend watching it without knowing too much about the plot as more is revealed, you get the true emotion the writer and director had intended you to connect with. It is a very emotional movie as well, I cried at least 3 times, so have a box of tissues ready.",

The film is about a young mother, being held captive in a locked single-room, with her 5-year-old son. The boy has never known life, outside of the room; so his mother creates a complete alternate reality, inside the room for him. It stars Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob Tremblay, as the kidnapped mother and son. It also costars Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen and William H. Macy. The film is predicted to be a likely Oscar contender, come awards time, and it's received almost unanimously positive reviews, from critics. I liked it.Jack (Tremblay) is five-years-old, and he's been locked in a single- room, with his mother Joy (Larson), all of his life. He's never seen the world, outside of the room, and his mother has taught him 'room' is all there is. We later learn that Joy was kidnapped when she was 17, and her captor impregnated her, with Jack, five-years earlier. As Joy becomes even more desperate, to escape, she finally enlists Jack's help, in a dangerous plan. The film is really dark and depressing, but there's also a slight bit of hope (in the darkness). Larson is fantastic in the lead, and Tremblay is also amazing (especially for an actor so young). The movie is very moving, intense and heartbreaking; it's beautifully directed by Abrahamson, and brilliantly written by Donoghue. The film is basically everything you'd expect from a critical darling 'Oscar hopeful'. It's pretty hard to watch though, at times, but it's worth it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/MylbbGyo_MU",

The woman concocts a plan to smuggle the son out in order for him to find help and free them. After the plan is successfully executed, we follow the two in the aftermath of the ordeal, struggling to retrieve the life that was previously stolen from her.The film is repetitive and annoying. At no point is the captivity nor the woman's response to the situation believable. It's just a garden shed located in some suburb instead of underground. The woman's not shackled and can virtually escape every time the captor enters the room. Relying on child actors is a notoriously shaky endeavour and again the constant whining of the kid and the way it talks, is grating and tiresome. There also seems to be no real connect between the first and second act. The 7 years she previously spent in the room might just as well have been a written premise at the start of the film. With no deeper layers to the film and with no character really fleshed out, the film feels aimless and not well thought-through.3/10",

            "content": "Prepare to cry, to feel, to be angry, and to cheer. This is one of those kind of films that will stays with you long after the credits roll. It's captivated. Not to confused with the awful bad, 2003's The Room, 2015's Room is an admittedly unsettling adaptation, based off, the novel by author Emma Donoghue of the same name. Room tells the story about two people: 5-year-old Jack Newsome (Jacob Tremblay) and his Ma, Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) living together in a single room. Told from Jack's point of view, the movie makes it clear that he's used to the idea of never going outside. What the audience knows that Jack doesn't know, is that he and his mom are prisoners, by a serial rapist, named Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). Now, on Jack's 5th birthday, Ma must finally tell him, the truth, so that they can siege the dangerous and heart breaking opportunity for her and Jack to escape. Can Jack cope with the decision of life outside of his own four walls; or will the room continue to be, his inner sanctum? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, Room really hit close to home. I had known people that went through similar trauma like this. While, this movie is hard to watch, it's a movie that needed to be seem, as it shows how to cope with the rest of your life after going through life changing event like sexual, mental, and physical abuse. Indeed, there is something worth discovering, outside, beyond these 4 walls. The movie is beautifully acted. Brie Larson is a tour de force. By far, one of the best acting of my generation, I have saw from an actress in recent times. You feel the love, angry, and dramatic heartbreak in every scene, she is in. After all, she essentially missed out on her formative adult years and was forced instead to raise a child in inhospitable conditions. You sense every emotional range of a mother whose young life was drastically altered at age 17. Not only that, but Larsen, well-mastered acting gives strong testament to the unsinkable bond between a mother and son, whose love propels them to rescue each other. I have to give credit to the young Jacob Tremblay, as well. Tremblay, in particular, is mesmeric. He has a lovable charm about him. I really felt like he was a son, I never knew, I had. That's how close, I got with his character. Both Larson and Tremblay make a remarkable duo. Another thing, I love about the film, is how accuracy closed, it was, to the source material. Screenwriter, Emma Donoghue didn't change much of anything from her novel. Inspired by real-life kidnapping cases like the Fritzl case, & the Jaycee Lee Dugard case, author Emma Donoghue was able to use symbolism, themes, and metaphors, from both real-life news, and classic literature to make a very well-written film. I love all, the references to Count of the Monte Cristo, Alice in Wonderland, and the Book Thief. Not only that, but all the Religious symbolism ranging from Sampson's hair to the villain, being called Old Nick, help make the character development of Jack, being told here, very believable. If the movie had any fault about Jack's story, it's the fact that many viewers were confused by, Jack's appearance. He had very long hair and very soft voice. Because of this, there has been elaborate and incorrect theories speculating that Joy is pretending that Jack is boy, to hide it from her captor. While the first half of this film was entertaining, it still lacked a lot of logic. Like, why didn't they just smash the window and climb out using their table and chairs? Also, how come Old Nick didn't see Jack when he was sitting straight up in the truck? Why would Old Nick just drop Jack like that? Those are really big jarring questions. If you think about it, it's something worth debating about. Thinking outside of the box. Another fault of the film is how it does feel a bit disjointed. It's kinda like watching two different movies. Filmed in two parts; the first half, is learning to survive and escape, your torment hell. While, the second half is learning to cope after the trauma has happened. Yes, I know, a lot of critics might think the second half, might had gone a little too long, and repetitive, but I believe, the movie is well-paced. After all, you rarely see films tackle character study after a horrible event. This was something new to me. Another person that deserve some credit, is director, Lenny Abrahamson and cinematographer, Danny Cohen. The movie is well-shot. I love the scenes where they showing time has changed. A good example is how the camera focus on, the skylight of the room. Another great shot, is the whole rug sequence. Wow, that was really intense. In my opinion, while, this movie is Rated R. I didn't see anything that was graphic. Most of the rape scenes, were not shown, and the film had no nudity. Even the violence, was tame. If anything, it's just the dark subject matter. However, I saw harsher films rated PG-13 that dealt with a similar concept. So I don't get, why this movie was Rated R. It makes no sense to me. Overall: This haunting and disturbing movie is amazing. Worth the price, checking out. I hope, many success for it, during Oscar season.",

Joy begins to hatch an escape plan with Jack's help in the hopes that they may finally escape the living hell they have suffered for so long.There aren't many films that have made me genuinely feel like crying or have left me feeling upset after watching it. But Room is one of those movies that really pulls at your heartstrings especially if your a parent or have personally been the victim of abuse. I honestly found myself in tears at certain points in the film as I wanted desperately for things to turn out ok for the films characters.Room is superbly written and directed in a way that connects with it's audience in a very real way. Brie Lawson gives an outstanding performance that feels very real and genuine making you feel so much for her character throughout the entire film. Jocob Tremblay also gives an amazing performance especially when you take into consideration both his age and the subject matter.I definitely recommend watching Room (2015) it's one of the best films of 2015.

(Cross him in the least and there's no electricity or heat.) At the start, Joy's son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), is angry and semi-feral yet quite content following silly rules in the only world he knows. Their pointless days come to an end when Joy contrives Jack's death forcing the psycho to bury the allegedly dead child. Well-rehearsed, Jack escapes and the dominoes fall leading to their escape to a world that has passed by Joy and one in which Jack has zero knowledge (a first encounter with steps mystifies him).Yellow ribbons and celebrations follow. With opposite effect. Joy's parents have divorced, high school chums have moved on. A formative slice of high school track star Joy's life is missing. Joy's biological dad harshly judges her; mom and daughter fight at the same level of a rebellious teen railing against parental control.Due to his age, Jack is 'plastic', his societal integration much easier. Soon he's knocking around a ball with neighbor kid. But, a reporter's insensitive question causes Joy to break down which leads to a brief institutionalization. And she's released all better.However, the treatment of an inherently dramatic subject matter of abduction and reintegration here falls short. The sunshine and rainbows, feel good ending, while moving, is mawkish. Everyone is healed and the horror of what was lived through for nearly a decade is forgotten. It is also a cheap device when children are wiser than adults. All these problems of the script.The balance of the failure of this film rests squarely on Brie Larson's shoulders. Her portrayal, as others, is at arms length with the character and hit a wall keeping her from connecting with feelings. Many crow her portrayal is spectacular. For her it is. In the annals of effective acting it is middling. Therefore, this is her tour de force - by default.\"Stockholm, Pennsylvania\" took the protagonist's story to a far more logical, satisfying and shocking conclusion. On the base, sensational end of the spectrum, TV's \"Cleveland Abduction.\" Find \"Room\" between the two. Either a good movie-of-the-week or poor indie sidestepping, and in some ways trivializing, a horrific subject.Watch \"Stockholm, Pennsylvania\" instead.",

I believe that it is not a perfect film, there are some flaws and weaknesses in the script, if we have time to analyze it more deeply. After some reading I realized that the film is based, very vaguely, on a real situation that occurred in Austria just over fifteen years ago, and that it was a true horror film turned into reality.The film is profound and touching in many ways. First, because it brings us a cruel history of deprivation of liberty, rape, abuse and suffering. Second, because it tells us all this from the innocent perspective of a child who has never seen the world beyond the room where he was born, and where he lives imprisoned with his mother, at the hands of a cruel man, who is also his biological father, but that the film will make clear that he is not the boy's father. And in fact, what father would deserve to be treated as such after doing something like that to a son, isn't it? The film is truly beautiful and elegant, and wonderfully harmonizes the child's perspective, who sees the world and things in his own way, and the mother's perspective, which is basically ours too, and who has a clear sense of what is happening and the drama they're experiencing.Despite the harshness of the story told, the film never assumes itself as a thriller or a drama. In fact, there is a touch of fairy tale that greatly softens the tone and ambience. At no time did we feel truly tense, despite the situation of the characters being tense and not envisaging much success. The second half of the film is even smoother and more luminous, and shows how mother and child will try to rebuild their lives and their families after all that tragedy.The film does not have a big cast, and the characters have plenty of time to develop and take on complex psychological nuances and contours. The most developed and interesting are clearly the Mother and her son, Jack. And Brie Larson was amazing at how she brought this desperate and brave mother to life. She was capable of one of the most breathtaking and professional dramatic and interpretive works I have seen in some time, and deserved the awards she received for this film in all fairness. Jacob Tremblay, who brought Jack to life, also deserves congratulations. Apparently, and despite his young age, he already had some experience as an actor when he made this film, but there is no doubt that we rarely see actors so young shining so completely. He did a better job than many adults would have done, I am sure of that. And the way both actors interact in front of the camera is magnificent, dignified, credible and genuine. I also really liked the work of Joan Allen and Sean Bridgers, although the film does not reveal what happens to the villain, who just disappears.Technically, it is a superb and intelligent film. One thing that I observed carefully, and that I did not want to miss, was the quality of the dialogues, in particular Jack's monologues, in which he makes very pertinent and intelligent observations to the world around him. It is wonderful to enter the child's mind and see the world through his eyes. Cinematography is equally extraordinary, especially in the first half of the film, due to the way the camera manages to convey the feeling of being in such a limited space. The setting and the smallness of the entire physical filming space clearly helped and the construction of the whole set and costumes was also a smart bet on the part of Lenny Abrahamson, who ensured the direction of the film. It is a slow-paced film, with time for many reflections and ramblings that never seem to be too much in the film. The soundtrack is quite good, but it does not distract us from the essential, which is the story told and the relationship between that mother and her child, and between that child and the new world that opens up for her.",

            "content": "Generally-speaking, I have a bit of a bias against movies that aim high and don't quite square up a bullseye. In other words, I'd rather a film know what it is and play to that as opposed to biting off more than it can chew. \"Room\" is somewhat an exception to that personal philosophy, however, in that while it doesn't nail every topic it brushes up against, it comes so close (and features such sincere acting performances) that I still find it emotionally moving.For a very basic overview, \"Room\" tells the story of Ma (Brie Larson) and her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). When first introduced, the pair are being held against their will in a small bunker-like space. While Jack's only reality is \"room\", Ma was abducted by a male predator and has been captive for seven years. After finally devising a successful escape plan, however, Ma & Jack realize that revisiting the \"world at large\" will hold challenges every bit as daunting as those faced in \"room\".\"Room\" is a very unique film in that the expected climax (\"the escape\") happens roughly half way through the runtime. This is--or should be--a fairly dead giveaway that escaping capture is not the overall point of the experience. Instead, Emma Donoghue's screenplay and Lenny Abrahamson's direction tackle the more personal/societal issues in play. Things like the nature of captivity (especially from an innocent child's perspective), re-integration into a society, the essence of motherhood, and long-term family dynamic changes. Those ideas are much more important to \"Room's\" overall structure than the action itself.Do all those ideas hit perfectly? No. Truth be told, \"Room\" may actually be a little over-extended in the \"themes\" department. But the acting is so superb that any shortcomings can almost completely be forgiven. Larson deserves some gold hardware for her stunning, emotional performance, while young Tremblay is remarkably apt as a little boy going through something that few can even imagine. There isn't a wasted scene or line in the entire film--every character interaction and nuance is imbued with significance and deep emotion.Some praise must also be given to the cinematography here, especially the ways in which the camera plays with the notion of space. At first, \"room\" seems like a cramped-but-livable space. But as the character horizons expand, \"room\" shrinks in equal amount. A scene towards the end of the film is jarring in pointing such a thing out to the audience. Such subversion of perspective and mindset is a credit to Danny Cohen (DP).So, while \"Room\" may not expertly land every maneuver it attempts, it comes close enough to be a moving, unique movie experience--equal parts mind-stretching, emotional, funny, and tragic. It also will hold up to multiple viewings, as certain details are made clearer when full knowledge is gained.",

            "content": "There has perhaps never been a more obvious metaphor in cinema for the loss of childhood innocence and the sudden arrival of the big, scary, grown-up world out there, but Irish director Lenny Abrahamson, who helmed 2014's magnificent Frank, translates Emma Donoghue's internal monologue-heavy novel of the same name with tenderness and care, successfully avoiding sensationalising the horror at its disturbing core. Room is one of the year's most complex and awe-inspiring films.Five year-old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) has never left the place he knows as Room. To him, the tiny shed he has lived his entire life is the whole world, with the pictures on the television screen beamed in from some distant galaxy. He and his devoted mother Joy (Brie Larson) spend every day in a set routine, with Joy using every waking moment to tend to her son and shield him from the terrible situation they're actually in. We come to learn that Joy has been locked in Room for seven years, taken a long time ago by a man she only knows as Old Nick (Deadwood's Sean Bridgers), who routinely re- ups their supplies and rapes Joy while Jack peeks through the cracks of his wardrobe.Larson won an Oscar for her performance here and rightly so. The relationship between Joy and Jack is more than simple mother-and- son, as it comes quickly to light that the boy is the only thing keeping her alive. Still, she struggles with his energy and growing curiosity of things he cannot comprehend, until one day she decides to tell him the truth and plans their escape. Her depression is becoming overwhelming, to the point where she may commit suicide, and then what then for her son? If you're unaware of the plot then don't read any further, for it is the moment Jack finally breaks free, followed shortly after by his mother, when the film moves into different territory altogether - Jack coping with this mind-blowing revelation. There now exists things he has never seen before, such as other people, other places, and the sky.Tremblay is equally as good as Jack with arguably a more complex character. It's appalling that his name was missing from the Academy's line-up, as this is the finest male performance of the year (as lovely as it was to see Leonardo DiCaprio receive his long- overdue award). His experience of this new, massive planet is amplified by some intelligent camera-work from cinematographer Danny Cohen, who films in sparse wide-shots to heighten the scale, and employs intense close- ups during the early scenes in Room to almost offend your sense of space. Yet its the two leads and their natural chemistry that really assist Room in delivering its intended emotional wallop. Whenever they're apart, you feel the tear and their need for each other. This is powerful, intelligent film- making, with a real hint of the greatness that could come from Abrahamson in the future.",

On one hand, it is certainly one of the must-see movies of 2015, but on the other, you've surely heard the buzz by now, and don't need an IMDb reviewer to tell you. Further, it's a movie you ought to know as little about as possible before watching.I will say that Jacob Tremblay, the actor who played five year old Jack, deserved an Oscar nod. Being that they are always in such close proximity, you can't help but compare the work of Brie Larson with Tremblay. He should have gotten a nomination at least. I feel that there are many other actresses who could have done what Larson did, but not many more who could have played Jack.",

            "review_title": "ROOM is an Emotional Juggernaut; One of 2015's Top Films",
            "content": "Lenny Abrahamson directed one of the best hidden gems of 2014 in FRANK, a strange little film starring Domhnall Gleeson and Michael Fassbender about an indie band getting an unpleasant taste of mainstream success. It was a dark comedy with some real emotion sown into it. A year later, Abrahamson returns with a new film where he goes straight for the heart with a vengeance in ROOM. This man is one of the best directors I've found for emotional impact, keeping in mind I've seeing nothing else of his work but the two mentioned. But there is no denying the emotional gut punch you get watching ROOM. Based on a source novel from author Emma Donoghue (who also penned the script), it's a disturbing (and eventually uplifting) tale told primarily from the perspective of little Jack (Jacob Tremblay). As the movie begins, Jack is awakening for his fifth birthday in Room, the only world he knows. He was born in Room lived in it all his life with his mom (Brie Larson). He's a relatively happy child who believes Room to encompass the entirety of the world. Except, now that he's five, his mom believes it's time for him to know the truth. Seven years prior, she had been tricked and abducted by the man he knows only as Old Nick, the mysterious visitor who comes at night while Jack's asleep to bring food and supplies. Old Nick locked Jack's mom in the little 11' x 11' garden shed and she's been trapped there ever since. Now that Jack is getting older, his mom wants him to help them escape to freedom.ROOM is divided into two distinct halves: inside Room and outside Room. The first half of the movie is arguably the best material in my opinion. It paints a picture of daily life for Jack and his mom, giving the audience a glimpse into their meager existence. Ma tries to make the best of a bad situation for Jack but there's only so much she can do. Until now, Jack has had zero knowledge of a world beyond the walls. He believes TV shows are from other planets, believes common things like trees and dogs are make-believe, and addresses every item in Room as if it were one of his best friends. While Ma has done her best to keep Jack somewhat normalized and happy, she isn't faring as well. She's been beaten, tortured, and raped. She's been trapped in this room for seven years with only a small skylight in the ceiling giving her a glimpse of the natural sky. There are days when the pressure just gets to be too much; Jack calls them her \"gone days\" when she lies in bed, not moving or speaking a word. It's a nerve-wracking first half to a film and ramps up to the eventual escape planning. Again, the emotional gut punches keep coming as Ma realizes she will likely have to put her son in mortal danger if she ever hopes of getting him out of there with the chance of a normal life. Meanwhile, Jack is confused and scared out of his wits. His mom has turned his entire world upside down with talk of how there is an enormous world outside the four walls and how all those things he believed imaginary are real.The second half of the movie loses a little steam because we don't have the built-in tension that comes with a captive and her son living in a box with an unstable kidnapper, but it delves into life after Room. It shows how Ma and Jack begin to adjust to the real world. To Jack, of course, this is more than his mind can process at first. I mean, the kid has never seen a horizon before and now he's faced with new environments, new experiences, and new people. While Jack does have his own troubles acclimating to the new life, Ma seems to have it worse. She seems all right at the start, relieved to be free and happy to return to normality, but after seven years of that sort of tortuous existence, normal doesn't come easy. Her parents have since divorced and her own mother has an old friend as her new live-in boyfriend. Her father has moved away and returns to reconnect with his long-lost daughter, but he has trouble accepting Jack and his\u0085well\u0085origins. Brie Larson does a phenomenal job with this material. Ma is a complex, deeply troubled character and Larson positively nails it with a very natural, genuine performance. She deserved every award she brought home for this role. Equal accolades belong to young Jacob Tremblay. In my experiences, the grand majority of child actors turn in stiff, unnatural performances but there are exceptions and Tremblay is top of the list. I believed every moment of his performance in ROOM and it's a real accomplishment for both him and director Abrahamson. ROOM is undoubtedly one of the best movies from 2015 (again, my opinion but I strongly believe so) and it comes with a strong recommendation from me. You'd have to be pretty dead inside for this movie to have not even the slightest emotional effect on you.",

            "content": "Based on a best selling novel, \"Room\" chronicles the story of a lady and her son held captive by a kidnapper, who actually is his biological father, in a shed comprising merely a 10 X 10 room. For the boy, the room is the only world he has known. The only medium he can see outside is the skylight in the room. The story may sound a nerdy fiction; but the film focuses much on the psychological aspects and discovers the story of desolation and motherhood which comes vividly alive on the screen. There are few scenes in which the boy and the mother have screamed to each other which could have been avoided alas they were like the scenes demanding the Oscars. Nevertheless, the film won an Oscar for the best performance by an actress. The film avoids big star cast or sets; but still the film is rich in emotions, performances, and beauty. The film just beautifully portrays the perspective of a five year old boy who doesn't know the world for real except for what his mother has told him or what he has seen in the TV screen. The emotional attachment portrayed between the two is awesome. Brie Larson's performance doesn't yet equal the winning Oscar performances from Julia Roberts or Hilary Swank, but still she appears stunning and well portrays a petrified lady held captive for six years. Few sequences are pretty familiar, but there are certain moments in the film for which you are drawn to it.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",

It's a powerful, unforgettable, and emotional experience that hits home in every way you can think of. There is no doubt in my mind that Brie Larson deserves every award she got for this film. Some people criticize her online for her acting being dull, similar to what people did earlier in the career of actress Jennifer Lawrence, but after watching Room there is no doubt in my mind that she was perfect for the role and is capable of so much when it comes to work on the big screen. Jacob Tremblay also provides an emotional and core performance to the film as her son, Jack, and perhaps provides the best performance I've ever seen of someone of such a young age. His character can be a bit predictable at times, but Tremblay brings a life to it that would have otherwise been missed. The direction can be a bit broad or dull at times, but due to Donoghue's terrific screenplay and all the talent involved the film transcends its flaws and makes for quite a brilliant and very memorable experience.\nMy Rating: 9.75/10",

I must admit that I went into this movie with high hopes and they were not only met but easily surpassed. Director Lenny Abrahamson once again shows that you don't need a one hundred million dollar budget in order to make a great film. No, ROOM shows what great directing, great acting and a great story can do.What really amazed me about the film is the way Abrahamson was able to make you feel trapped by the surroundings. The first portion of the movie all takes place inside this small room and this room is really a character of its own. What makes the film so special is the fact that you get accustom to this small room and you can feel for both of the characters and understand what they're going through. This first portion also works as a terrific mystery because you don't know why they're in this room and slowly the mystery is revealed.The film turns into a remarkable character study during the second act. Again, I'm not going to spoil any of the twists so lets just say that the mother, the son and others are so torn from what happened that it's remarkable watching the actors bring these characters to life. The various troubles that follow is something hard to watch at times but certainly impossible to forget.Brie Larson turns in a terrific performance and only after viewing the film will you see and understand how many different emotions she has to play. She easily becomes this character and there's not a single frame where you feel that you're watching an actress work. No, instead you really do feel as if you're seeing a real character going through these real hardships. Tremblay turns in one of the greatest child performances I've ever seen and especially when you look at how challenging the role and film are. Both Larson and Tremblay have a terrific chemistry that really comes across wonderfully on the screen. William H. Macy, Joan Allen, Matt Gordon and Sean Bridgers are all terrific as well.ROOM deals with a very troubling subject matter and the film really doesn't pull any punches. The subject matter turns more ugly with each new twist but in the end you're seeing one of the best character developments in recent years as well as some of the greatest acting that you're going to see. It's really remarkable what the director managed to pull off but ROOM is certainly a great gem.",

It's a mighty challenging undertaking and benefits to some degree by not being 'based on a true story' even if the inspiration was so obviously horrifically apparent.It tells the tale of a young mother, credited as 'Ma' but actually known as Joy (how ironic) played to Oscar winning standard by Brie Larson and her five year old son, Jack, who was born in captivity some time after Joy was absconded by a man entrapping her with the aid of a sick puppy.Thus begins Joy's nightmare. At some point Jack is conceived at the hands of her rapist jailer, Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers. (It's a casting that may have given him some personal nightmares because he's not what you could describe as a sympathetic character). It's fair to say that although Ma tolerates Nick's visitations, she has to to protect her child and to be fed, no Stockholm Syndrome has developed.The movie begins on or around Jack's fifth birthday. Jack has never left the room in which he was conceived and into which he entered his insular world. He knows no place other than this, has never experienced any weather (or air even), never played with other children, never been admonished for fear of upsetting a very delicate ecology between him, his mother and the 'room' where they live.Aside from the nightly visitations of Old Nick for the daily rape of his mother he knows no other human being.Ma and Jack have a TV, so Jack has a perverse awareness of the 'world' but it's seen through juddering images and is as real to him as martians are to you and I.But somehow Ma and Jack soldier on.We catch them at the end of Ma's tether. After five years of protecting Jack from the fact that they live in a parallel existence she's decided it's time for the facts of life and so begins a plan to escape. You'll have seen the trailers so you'll know that ultimately the escape bid is successful and so begins the painful psychological process of leaving an almost feral yet totally sheltered existence into a world that's overwhelming.Relationships in the family have moved on in the years since Joy's disappearance. Mum and Dad, although both still alive cope in very different ways. The media go mad for the story, Joy finds the whole thing extremely difficult to cope with and we spend a very moving hour or so watching them come to terms with an existence that's completely alien to Jack and totally overwhelming for Joy. This is a life affirming movie. It's directed with great skill and sensitivity by Lenny Abrahamson and in Brie Larson and five year old Jacob Tremblay we can pretty much believe that this is not fiction but very real reality.A remarkable film that deserves all the awards that are about to come its way.Deep respect.",

We don't see how the lead character, Joy, is raped by her abductor who keeps her imprisoned for more than five years with her little son Jack. We don't see how she is liberated by the police, after she manages to let her son escape. We don't see what happens to her abductor and rapist.The director doesn't show all these things, because they distract from the theme of this movie: the way mother and son cope with their freedom. The surprising thing about this film is that this freedom turns out to be rather problematic in a lot of ways. Even so much so, that Jack starts to long for the intimacy and the routine of life inside the shed he called Room.The film shows how life in Room is claustrophobic, but also intimate and familiar. There are no unexpected developments in Room, but there is a lot of love between mother and son. Once they escape Room, everything changes. For Jack, who has never known a world outside Room, this is very threatening. He has to share his mother's attention with other people, he has to get used to all sorts of impulses, he has to learn how things like a telephone work.In this film, there is only one major dramatic event: Jack's escape and the subsequent liberation of his mother Joy. The rest of the film is rather uneventful: at first we see Joy and Jack in their daily routine in Room, and afterward we see them cope with all sorts of problems in the house of Joy's parents. Still, the film is almost never boring. The psychological developments make up for the lack of real action. And although there quite some emotional scenes, the director didn't make an outright tearjerker.",

            "content": "Ever since I've been following the Award season, I was wondering what was exactly about this 'Jacob Tremblay' kid. I had never heard about him, but the more awards nominations he got, the more pictures of \"Room\" I was discovering, the more intriguing that skinny pale-looking child with unusually long hair was, especially that movie snapshot of his stunned look crossing as you could tell he was witnessing something of hypnotic beauty.First, I thought Tremblay was portraying some kind of autistic kid, then the story of a mother and her child trapped in a room made me expect a movie about confinement, and the ability of creating a world out of a horrible situation. And the kid looked strange enough to make me believe that he was victim of a condition forcing him to be isolated. Lenny Abrahamson's \"Room\" was the kind of film that is surrounded by an aura of mystery, but that alone wouldn't have been enough without the whole awards-buzz, so like many others, I saw it to see what was good about it.At first, I was disrupted by the whole voice-over narration, I wasn't really ready for some abstraction \u00e0 la \"Tree of Life\", and I wished the kid wouldn't be too strange, even within the story's strangeness. But doubts immediately vanished, Jack was a normal kid who loved to play, to please his mother Joy, played by Brie Larson, to be told that he's grown up, to write, to draw, except that everything he does, and been doing since he was born, took place in that small shed, whose only door to the world is a skylight. And as the story goes, we get the circumstances of their presence there, especially when there's a sort of figure named Old Nick who's the only known outsider.The film echoes many news items about women or kids who've been abducted for years and years, being raped and having children with their own captor, the kind of stories that make you wonder how can anyone survive from such conditions. It's the mark of great films not to answer questions directly but to make you answering them on your own. Jack, unlike Joy, doesn't know what he missed and the whole world, as far as he's concerned is the room and whatever is in the room is real. A mouse is real, a spoon or a kitchen sink or a wardrobe are called by 'mister' or 'mrs' but whatever appears in that box named TV is made of pictures and can't count as real. And as far as humanity goes, there's him, his mother and Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers.Jack can't be unhappy or his unhappiness is limited to his world. However, his mother spent only 7 years of her life there; she not only knows what she's missing but she knows damn well what Jack is missing. And if Jacob Tremblay deserves the praise for his performance, there's something in Larson's acting that cuts straight to the heart. She is devastated but she must hide it,, the presence of Jack is the only thing that keeps her alive, otherwise, she would have killed herself. Jack is her skylight. But there comes a point where enough is enough, and for his own good, she can't let Jack drown in a fantasy-world that might eventually destroy him. This is a story of a mother's responsibility, and she's got to stop pretending and get her son out of there.She first thinks of faking illness so Nick can take Jack to the hospital but instead of that, Nick goes outside to buy antibiotics. She then teaches Jack how to play dead, so she can wraps him under a carpet and ask Nick to 'bury' him, this is where Jack must free himself. They say even a frail mother can increase tenfold her strength if her child is in danger, the same goes when Nick wants to check the body. Joy learned how to fake emotions, but now, she has to make it 'Oscar-worthy' so that Nick is convinced not only to take the body but not to bury him in the garden and take him on his truck. Joy keeps her head on the carpet not to let anything betray her nervousness, and the plan works. I guess there's a justice if Larson wins the Oscar if only for that scene where she gave her best acting in order to forever stop acting after that, the climax of her room years of pretension.And a lesser film would have made it the real 'climax', and make \"Room\" a sort of mother-and-son version of \"Life is Beautiful\" with a heart-warming slow-motion reunion at the end, people crying and some cheerful happy-ending music but \"Room\" is respectful enough to our intelligence not to tell us that everything will go perfectly right after such an experience. The second act consists on Joy and Jack coping with their trauma, and building new relationship with family members who's either strangers or estranged to their world. \"Room\" isn't about people stuck in a room during seven years, but stuck in the world after such experience, and this time, it's harder for Jack.Indeed, I finally saw what was beyond that picture, Jack had a stunned 'where am I?' born-baby look, with his vision blurred because of the years spent in obscurity, he was reborn, but life will go very fast for him. One day, he'll ask his grandmother (Joan Allen) to cut his hair (a vivid symbol of \"Room\" days, his Samson-like 'strength' as Joy told him) and this action ironically makes him even stronger, and is a positive signal for Joy. Then they visit the room again and Jack realizes how small it was, just as when we visit a childhood place. He didn't grow much physically after the \"Room\" but he could finally enjoy life now that he discovered how wonderfully big it was.",

And so, no matter his complete isolation, the misery of his existence, and the fact that he is a constant, although unconscious, witness of his mother's abuse, at 5 Jack is both mentally and physically healthy, even happy child, he has smooth skin and complex reactions and the only sign of his unusual circumstances is his long hair...I didn't even have to use irony \u2013 the whole thing is flat enough on its own. Actually, I see it as an insult to anyone who have lived through \"the Room trauma\" \u2013 be it real, or more metaphoric. It sets ridiculous standards for the victims while what they truly need is understanding and compassion. But yeah, let's say that mother's love conquers it all and clap our hands.",

It is about Joy planning their escape and then trying to adapt to a new life with her mother, now split from her father. Her dad meanwhile has difficulties accepting Jack.The film is rather bland. Of course the first portion of mother and son living in such distressing conditions is harrowing but Jack looks a little bit too healthy apart from his long hair. Joy only seems lost when she tries to fit in to her new circumstances once she has left the room.The film was rather underwhelming and uneventful. Jacob Tremblay gives a good performance.",

            "content": "'Room' is an immensely powerful film. It has the ability to make its audience care from minute one right until the dying seconds. There isn't a weak scene any where in sight and the result is two hours of magnificent cinema. It's rare that a film can succeed in so many different aspects. The drama throughout is second to none, taking the audience on an emotional roller coaster that is genuinely moving. There is a scene of suspense that Hitchcock himself would be proud of. The intensity in this scene would struggle to be matched by the absolute best action directors Hollywood has to offer today. I haven't been that on the edge of my seat in a long time. The script is also incredibly thought-provoking. The character of 'Jack' played by Jacob Tremblay delivers some truly beautiful voice-over work. If you truly listen to what he's saying, in context, you can appreciate just how much we all take for granted the small things in life. Behind everything else the film has a wonderful message.Director Lenny Abrahamson, who has deservedly been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for his work in 'Room', has done an unbelievable job of balancing all these aspects of the film. He was helped a lot too by his two leads giving near flawless performances. Tremblay gives one of the best performances by a child-actor I can remember in a long time. Sadly the category of Best Actor is simply too strong for a child to be nominated in it this year, but make no mistake, anyone who sees this will be blown away by his performance. He's definitely one to be watched out for in the future. Brie Larson has received a nomination in the Best Actress category and deservedly so. The girl can act. She's been around a long time now but has really found her niche in the last couple of years seemingly. Here, she perfectly puts you in the shoes of the character and makes you feel every emotion and every shred of desperation as realistically as if you were actually in that situation. Based on what I've seen here, I'd call her a shoo-in to win the Oscar.There's not a lot else to say about this work of perfection, other than make sure you see it. The title could be considered a little bland and I hope it doesn't put anyone off giving it a chance because the product itself is anything but. Perfect direction, a beautifully written script and superb performances, all equal one of the best films of the year. I don't think it has quite enough momentum behind it to win the Best Picture award in what is a very strong category this year, but the fact it's been recognised with a nomination, and thus more people will get to see it, is a bonus if nothing else. A flawless film.",

We see the movie from young Jack's perspective, which I think was the right choice, he made the tone more light hearted and heartwarming, taking away from the reality of their situation in a way that feels peaceful, albeit somewhat surreal, as we experience a very unique view on the world. I did think we could have seen more of Joy's father, who is portrayed terrifically by William H. Macy, for only three scenes, they clearly had a complicated relationship and I left wanting to find out more, it is probably established fully in the book. The performances are outstanding, Brie Larson is entirely engrossed in her character in a way that would be frightening for most actors, but she did it without half measures, and the chemistry between her and Jacob Tremblay is absolutely brilliant, it is very tough love, which makes it real. Heartwarming, thrilling and dramatic, Room will leave you experiencing many different emotions, and you will be happy that it did, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama. A loving mother convinces her son that the room they are trapped in is the whole world, until he is old enough to help her plan an escape. Best Performance: Brie Larson",

            "content": "It's hard to get revenge on a bad movie. I am partially consoled considering I snuck into this theater rather than paying for a ticket. Still, this subversion robbed me of the cathartic argument over my refund with some hapless manager. Room stole two hours of my life, and the only way I am going to get value from that experience is to get the last word. Room has an extremely fertile premise. An unnamed woman (Brie Larson) has been kidnapped and imprisoned in a shed for seven years, five of which she has spent raising her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). I am unaware how the book navigated this premise, but author and screenwriter Emma Donoghue had a bottomless potential of directions and selected none. The writing is too shallow to be a thought experiment on trauma or a character study. The narrative is too muddled by loose ends to be a simple \"feel good\" movie. Cult classic The Room had a similar degree of cohesion\u0085 yeah okay no it didn't. Poor contractually obligated jokes aside, Room is simply aimless. This child grows up in a 10x10 room surrounded by sexual abuse his entire life and his lone complications are a paleness, shyness, and poor grammar. I have met children with comparable behavior from normal households. Children might be plastic, but no one is going to manage a full swift recovery from being born into this environment. The mother character is better explored, but barely. The strength of this woman while kidnapped is unbelievable, but interesting questions are raised after the escape. Her relationship with her parents, her friends, and dealing with new realties are all introduced and either dropped or solved off screen. This is a device derived from the book where everything is seen through Jack's perspective. But post-escape Jack is just cute and boring, not worth following. His narration of events is insufferable. The conclusion of Room is sickening. The film has the audacity to propose that mother and son will be able to leave this experience behind in the closing moments. This claim is beyond ignorant and well into insulting.For the sake of critical fairness I will mention all the two and a half things I enjoyed. The escape sequence is genuinely thrilling. Putting a child in peril is often a cheap way to manipulate the audience. It worked here, so credit is due. Second, the cinematography in the room itself was surprising. I think most films would have tried for a more claustrophobic. Instead, the dimensions are simply defined and unjudged. The abrupt camera pans while Jack is running from wall to wall brilliantly reflects the mindset of these trapped characters. This place is simultaneously small and their entire world; traversing the room is trivial, but also the greatest possible distance. The one victory achieved by the closing scene is the brief moment perfect perspective when the room is seen from the outside. Finally, the acting was serviceable. It is hard to completely differentiate the awful roles from performances, but the film did dodge some melodrama. The Oscars successfully suckered me into watching Room. I would like to just chuck this movie atop a pile of other examples where the illustrious academy failed, but I am apparently in the minority. There are some aspects of quality filmmaking here, but there is no prize for best drama for housewives. Room took a premise ripe with potential and failed to nurture it with a drop of ingenuity or realism. I was disappointed, and I refuse to believe I am the only one.",

Their life, however, is anything but. They are confined to a windowless, 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has named Room. She has created a whole universe for Jack, and will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in their situation, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet, the world outside.......Depending on who's point of view you see the film from, Room has two different connotations. From the point of View of Ma, it begins as a prison drama, her and Jack being held captive against their will, and Ma being subject to abusive on an almost nightly basis. And then there's the road to freedom, enlightenment, and finally, subjection and coming to terms with the years that she lost, the most important years of her life, and in turn, beginning to resent Jack for being the creation of her imprisonment.From the View of Jack, it begins as normality to him, he and Ma are the only people in the world, apart from the man who visits every night while he is in his 'room', the wardrobe. His life here is the norm, being born with a built in Helsinki Syndrome helps the falseness of his world, and the love from his mother is unconditional, likens other Mothers love.So when he finally leaves his world, he is subject to a whole new world, an unsettling domain where he is made to wear a mask and sunglasses as he will be vulnerable to a host of new germs. And no just that, new emotions are abound, such as Ma acting differently, not the always there person he is used to, but someone who is distant and weary.Plus the fact that there are a host of new people he meets, who react differently, not forgetting the fact that they haven't seen Ma in an age, relief turns to anger, turns to guilt, turns to neglect.It's a fascinating movie, heart breaking in one sense, and forfilling at the same time, because not only can Jack start his new life, Ma has to grieve her lost life, so an element of jealousy can be seen in some scenes.Larson is wonderful as Ma, showing so many emotions in such a short time, it won't be surprising is she wins every award this season.Tremblay is a major force in this film, putting in one of the best child performance I've seen in while. Here's to a wonderful career ahead.But the film belongs to Macy. There is one scene at the dinner table that is so devastating, so sad, Grandpa denying his own Grandsons existence, and uttering a syllable,Mis both should destroying and the core of the film.Jack isn't to blame for anything, he was just created amongst the chaos, he is the blessing, and to see a world full of hate form the view of a five year old, especially when your free, you would long for that one final visit to the room.An exceptional movie.",

You probably imagine some sort of \"Life is Beautiful\" unfolding in a room. But NO! Be warned. This movie is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional, the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this 2 hour long ordeal. Like someone dragging a fingernail on a chalkboard.

The fact is Joy was abducted seven years previously, when she was seventeen and has been locked in a shed by a captor she has dubbed 'Old Nick' who is of course Jack's father. One day Joy decides it is time to tell Jack the truth about the world and plot their escape. She comes up with a plan and manages to get Jack out and not long afterwards she is free too\u0085 this isn't the end of their story though; it is merely the first day of the rest of their lives. Jack must come to terms with the vastness of the world and all the new things he sees and Joy must deal with changes that happened while she was in Room; most notably the fact that her parents split soon after her abduction and her father can't bring himself to even look at Jack.This was a really gripping film that turned out to be quite different to what I'd expected. I had assumed the whole film would be similar to the first half with perhaps a few more escape attempts followed by a happy ending where they get free and we see 'Old Nick' brought to justice. In fact they are free around the half way point and while we are told that Nick has been arrested we don't see him again. Instead the second half of the film is all about coming to terms with what happened; or in the case of Joy's father being unable to do so. The room they are held in gives a feel of claustrophobia to such an extent that the world outside suddenly feels huge to the viewer as well as the characters. Brie Larson gave a fantastic performance as Joy; it isn't surprising that she got an Oscar for it. Likewise young Jacob Tremblay was great as Jack; he really made the viewer believe that his character hadn't seen anything of the outside world before. The escape scenes were particularly tense as for some time we had no idea what was happening to Joy; we just knew that 'Old Nick' knew she had helped Jack escape and she was shill his captive. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody looking for something a little different with an emotional intensity.",

A sequel, remake, reboot, whatever\u0085that unintentionally hilarious, albeit awful Tommy Wiseau film from 13 years ago still haunts me.And now, this 2015 film haunts me. Only, in a much different way.Other than my own dumb fears about the similar title, I knew almost zero about it going in, and I would like to try and keep my review to the bare minimum for anyone else who hasn't seen it. In fact, if you have NOT seen it, and you absolutely MUST, stop now, bookmark this and return. I won't spoil anything significant, but even knowing more than me going in, or about 1%, is too much.Okay, you're back? Good. Here goes, to the best of my ability, my effort to non-spoil this.Getting the synopsis out of the way might help explain my thoughts and feeling following. Movie opens with a mother and her child in a small room. Within minutes, or less, you realize that is their world. As expected, more and more is revealed on how they came to live in such a small room. And for how long. Too long. It also becomes apparent that the boy knows of nothing else IN HIS ENTIRE EXISTENCE but \"Room.\" Or the mysterious man that enters nightly, brings \"presents\" on Sundays and is not allowed to see.Annnd, I'll stop there. There's so much more I want to say. Feelings, emotions, fear, anger, hate, longing and ideas on how to solve the problem. That last one\u0085that's just me. I'm always trying to put myself in the character's shoes and attempt to fix whatever problem, or plainly, \"what would I do\u0085better?\" After some ideas, luckily, I realized: I am NOT in her shoes. I never experienced what she went through. I doubt 0.00000001% of the world's souls ever has. So, I'm glad I could shut down the \"obvious solutions\" to this mother and son's imprisonment. So, there you go. The movie's about a kidnapped mother and her son in a tiny room. How would you cope? How would you care for your child when all he knows is those four walls? How would you escape\u0085if you ever could? How would a five-year-old experience the real world\u0085if he never has before?This movie is harrowing, magnificent, brilliant, tough, original and has some of the best acting I've seen in years. Of course, Brie \"Mother\" Larson was fantastic. Never once did I not believe her, she was as real as it gets. But, damn, that boy, (at the time of filming) 8-year-old Jacob Tremblay was incredible. I did love his mother's performance, but multiply that by two for Tremblay. You can't help but be captivated for what he has to go through, or learn about \"the real world\" outside of Room.The other performances were solid \u2013 ALWAYS love me some Joan Allen \u2013 as was the cinematography, score, direction\u0085everything. I can barely think of one thing I didn't like here. Okay, well, maybe one thing\u0085Even though I still grant this movie my highest honor: 10 out of 10 stars and it does nab my top pick of the eight Oscar nominated Best Pictures of 2015 so far (still have yet to see Bridge of Spies and Brooklyn,) my only complaint is that I wanted to know more. More of the aftermath, and the details of what's outside Room.Guess I need to go buy the book this is based on. My one gripe, which really isn't a complaint, isn't enough to lessen how incredible my experience was with this movie and how perfectly it was shot and performed. You must see Room.Um, to clarify, don't see \"The\" Room. Just \"Room.\"",

Room is based off a book by the same name written by Emma Donoghue. The novel won all sorts of awards and shortlisted for many others. I have not had the privilege to read it but I've heard good things. Donoghue also adapted the screenplay. The significance of this movie cannot be denied as I clearly remember hearing the horrifying tale of the three women in Cleveland and the other awful experiences of young woman at the hands of derange men. This movie takes place in Ohio too. Overall this movie is very sad and moving, a real downer. Jack played by Jacob Tremblay steals the show. I'm surprised he didn't get nominated for a Golden Globe. His young performance was only outdone by the young man of Beasts of No Nation, Abraham Attah. This doesn't take away from Tremblay's performance. He dominates the film and his voice-over brings us into the strange world of room. The back and forth between him and Larson's Joy, or Ma, was real and grew steadily nerve-wrecking as they plan their escape.See the rest of this review and more at swilliky.com",

Brie Larson is good as Ma and does an excellent job at portraying her anguish and grief. As the viewer you can only imagine what must be going through her characters' head, but it's Larson that really sells the distortion and her performance demands emotion. Jacob Tremblay is the most impressive by far, being only nine at the time of filming, who plays the son, Jack. It's really interesting to see Jack's perception of the room, or just Room, as it's the only place he's ever known. You'd expect him to be more open with the outside world, but his drastically sheltered life makes it a slow process as he's used to his creature comforts. Tremblay does a really good job at selling his emotional scenes too and I enjoyed his pieces of narration throughout the film. The soundtrack was okay, it worked really well for the emotional scenes, but some of it felt a little too grandiose for the scene's it was played over. William H. Macy's an amazing actor and whilst I feel he was the slightest bit underused, his character and role in the story still made a strong, emotional impact. The mother-son relationship that runs through this film's core is what makes it so endearing, despite their predicament, Ma still does her best to give Jack as normal a childhood as she can and she does her utmost to shield him from the real horror of their situation. Glad I finally checked this out as it's been on my radar for years, was definitely worth it and I'm looking forward to starting the book.",

Not only to make you feel like you're in the movie but also to force you to feel what both of them are going through and to also to sit the mood I guess.3=I simply don't get it if the captive mother (Joy) has a knife why wouldn't she just simply use it to force their way out. And why would the captor give his captive victim a knife in the first place, spectrally when clearly she hasn't yet lost all hope? Huh?! No not just a knife but why not just grab an thing to use as a weapon. Even before when she got pregnant, sure she tried once before but why wouldn't she just try again? Again huh? 4= There is a great Mother/Son sit up unfortunately they missed that up, yes at first in the beginning they did have a great relationship but for most of the time they mainly just yell and scream at each other. In addition I just don't get the kid's (Jake's) seemingly erratic mood swings. OK I get it he's frighten in beginning because all he knows is the Room, and now all of sudden his mother is telling him about life outside the Room, but even after when he and his mother were rescued he still remained bratty and having all of these erratic mood swings. I simply just don't get that.5= The night scenes are simply just way too dark to see anything now, I'm not sure if that was the attent or what, but in either case for that simply just cheapens the movie. And this is coming from someone that just sits in his dark room from time to time with little to no light being lighting the room from an outside source. And even that I could still see shapes of objects, but with this movie I don't know what was going even with sound.6= There is a poor sit up of the Kidnapper (old Nick), somehow feel his character just wasn't fleshed out enough.7= I feel the second attempt at escape wasn't will planned out enough, and what I mean by that is that they were so busy planning out the main plain they forgot t plain out the Plain 'B'.8= I just don't have any emonal or any kind of connection towards or against anyone in the film, which is too bad because I love Mother/Child Relationships. And speaking of I'm simply not sure if anyone in this movie is truly likable.9= At times during the movies I feel that it's simply too long. I often find myself thinking during the movie 'This movie is simply too long it should only be a 90min movie. And not a 2hr movie.' 10= However I do feel that there is a lot of plot holes in the movie: What happen to Old Nick. Did the dog ate him? Is Jake home schooled or does go to public school? Etc... but I guess those are just simply 'minor' plot holes.11= The good points: is that I do like almost everything that happens in the Room before the escape. Also I do like the music that went along with the escape. In addition I do also like the descent into depression of Joy (Mother) after when she was rescued. Finally, finally only at the end where the Mother comes back from what we can assume 'getting help' just after trying to kill herself some time after being rescued. They finally, finally show this excellent Mother/Son relationship in some kind of mini montage. All leading up to this neat and interesting ending (which I will not ruin for you).CP: I'm not sure the ending itself is enough to redeem it , but however I am wandering should I have waited to buy?",

            "content": "22 November 2015. What is remarkable about this movie is that the audience members didn't fall asleep for the first half of the movie and that's a great thing. Unlike The Diary of Ann Franke (1959), the underlying and ominous tone of Room doesn't have the constant and imminent death threat from Nazi occupation that helps to sustain the visceral tension that Ann Frank was subjected to. Instead the director was confronted with the challenge of somehow making the mundane and likely boring life in a small room something of modicum of interest. In a way, the audience experiences the same efforts of the mother to keep her child preoccupied as much as possible with the few resources possible. Overall this movie has a deliciously balanced and sustained plot development often times left out of the confined and happily released plot outlines of most mystery thrillers.The performances are superb and so consistent with the storyline, there isn't any pretense that any of this was stage or acted. The relationships are well developed within the timeframe of the movie and are delightfully varied to reveal the breadth of human responses to such a tragedy. The presentation mostly from the child's perspective made the directorship's job tremendously more difficult but at the same time more captivating and absorbing for the audience. Instead of the usual death lurking around every corner horror genre or the sensationalism of publicity drama, the movie narrowly and richly captures the amazing and arduous behavior of the mother's attempts at some form of normalcy and the doubts surrounding her own competence in having done so.Like The Miracle Worker (1962), the depiction of a world beyond our own universe, our senses, Room offers up a new way of examining our own environment. Unlike Helen Keller, though the child in Room wasn't limited by his senses, but by his limited surroundings. Nevertheless, the audience is exposed to a refreshing and innovative way to re-examine our own limited senses.",

The fact that the mother doesn't try to guess the combination of the lock in the time when the man is gone is just so dump. Even if he regulary changed the combination, she could've atleast looked at his hand movements, so you would have the idea which numvber he presses. She also could've made something sharper in her time which could cut the skin and she could've tried to cut his throat. Obviously logic wasn't the point of the movie. It was the emotional message... The family escapes after 1/3 of the movie and the rest of it are the boy's learning of the new world, which he doesn't do at all. He somehow lives an oridinary life as if nothing had happened. I mean nothing surprises him, he interacts with stuff as any other kid. His mother is also completely fine, they live as if nothing happened, they were trapped for many years you know. Oh and her parents also couldn't be more unrealistic, they don't even get surprised they found their lost daughter. This movie is pure garbage, it tries to go for emotional message instead of plot, but they had no idea how to make human emotions look real. Even The Room (2003) was better on plot and more emotional, that's saying something.",

            "content": "Room is a simple story that will hit you hard. Brie Larson plays a young woman (Ma) who was abducted and has been held captive in 'Room' for 7 years, where she has subsequently given birth to her son Jack. Jack has never been out of Room and knows nothing else. We see how they cope in day to day life in Room, as the captor brings them basic rations every day. Throughout the film it is left to our imagination as to where exactly they are and what is the reason why. Jack believes that the outside world is non existent and anything he sees on TV is not real. Jack is key to their escape so Ma has to explain the situation very carefully to him in order for him to grasp that the outside world is indeed real. The pacing of the film is very good, we pretty much have two halves: the first half starts straight away with the pair in Room, we see them go through many different emotions in their fight for survival. Then they plan the escape (which if you have seen any trailer for the film you will know that they eventually escape anyway so it's not a spoiler). The second half of the film is about both of them adjusting to the outside world. Ma going back to family life and facing struggles as her father can't even look at Jack. Thankfully her mum and mum's boyfriend are much more supportive and really help Jack along the way. The acting is terrific throughout the film which gave it a lot of realism. I do wish that the film had perhaps been a bit more detailed, we could've had another 20-30 minutes which could've explained briefly how the captor took Ma, what exactly happened to him at the end and how he was caught, a few bits of news/interviews detailing the fact that she was missing, search parties for her, was anyone ever suspicious of him etc. And also a bit more of Ma and Jack as he was younger just to get a sense of even more struggle they went through and then perhaps a little segment at the end of him growing up in the world. All in all though it is certainly my favourite film of the Oscar nominees for best picture this year. 9/10 and highly recommended to all.",

But as Jack turns five and his curiosity starts to grow, Ma decides to attempt yet another escape.The first half of this film is chilling. To live in such a closeted space, with only the barest of necessities. Never feeling the wind on your face, barely even seeing the sun. With only one other person for company. Their kidnapper should not be counted. And what makes it even more chilling is the fact that it's told from Jack's point of view, who of course treats it as completely natural. He quite literally doesn't know anything else.Powerful premise, given even more strength by the performances of Larson and Tremblay. Larson quite deservedly collected an Academy Award for this role, but I have to praise Tremblay as well. He sells his character beautifully, even though Jack's upbringing is about as far from normal as is possible. But in Tremblay's hands Jack's humanity shines through.If I had to name a flaw, I really shouldn't, but if you were to force my hand, I'd say that the second half of the film lost something. It was still chilling, but more as a mundane drama. It ceased to be otherworldly and barely conceivable, becoming a story of mother and son trying to live. Which is still good cinema, but not quite as intriguing.Nevertheless, one of the best dramas I've seen in recent years and well worth its praise.",

The director has tried a silent approach to take out the emotion and concentrate on the subject matter but has gone too far and left it a bland and dim affair. I was expecting a lot more from the confined direction but not once did I get feeling of claustrophobia. Every character was also very one dimensional and stereotypical.Too many issues all going at once but none of them were dealt with properly. It's not a bad movie but I think the bland direction and lack of narrative let it down...I would imagine the book would be far,far superior. Still worth a trip to the cinema because I love movies on the big screen...where they should be...and it will not show well on T,V or DVD.One of those movies that try to make you think but come across as somewhat pretentious and believes it's own hype..will not win a single nomination...let alone an award.",

            "content": "Irish filmmaker Lenny Abrahamson has been making terrific films since 2004. \"Adam & Paul\", \"Garage\", \"What Richard Did\" are all excellent small films, marked by top rate acting and rich characters. With the oddly funny and surreal \"Frank\", Abrahamson finally started to get some attention here in the states. \"Room\" may be his strongest film yet -- a vertigo inducing mix of thriller like tension and complex and sometimes disturbing character studies. Again, he gets great performances; from the young and extremely talented Brie Larson, to great old pros like Joan Allen and William H. Macy, to a remarkable performance from a child, Jacob Tremblay, in a seriously difficult and demanding part. I've seen a lot of films, but - even with no blood or gore, and little violence - this was so harrowing it was downright hard to watch at times. But in a way that never felt exploitive, but always in service of bigger themes and ideas. This is a film where knowing too much about the plot can work against the experience, but it's not giving away too much to say at the start we find a mother and child locked in a small room, having evidently been there for the boy's whole 5 years of life. They are scared, thin, holding on the best they can. We slowly come to understand the situation, at the same time getting a fascinating, and often chilling peek into what the world might seem like to a kid who has only lived in one small space. The film is beautifully shot: the ultra-tight closeups, and wide lenses feeding the dizzying and nerve wracking sense of being trapped, and giving the \"Room\" (a character in itself) a plastic sense of shifting size and shape. The score occasionally seemed a bit much to me - there's plenty of emotion here without needing the music to convince us - but those moments were few, and certainly not enough to seriously hurt the film. It won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's dark, sad, complicated, scary and uncomfortable at times - although, as in life, lighter moments and hope find a way to break through. It's not light entertainment. But it's not like anything I've seen. It made me think, and has haunted me in the days since I've seen it. That's a lot for any film to accomplish.",

I am happy to say that this movie surpassed all my expectations and then some. The plot of Room is one that we've seen before. While it's not horribly original, it's presented much differently than you'd expect. It's more mature than others, and much more personal. The idea of someone living their life away from society and suddenly being exposed to it again is typically used in a more comedic or 'big picture' way. Room deals with the transition in a much more personal way, and it makes way more sense. The characters spend most of their time indoors, dealing with the new problems of living outside of a single 10 by 10 foot room, and there still feels like there's a reason for it. It really is quite a beautiful story, despite how unhappy that it can be. The characters are brilliant, and the obvious driving force of the movie. Considering for the first hour or so we've only been exposed to three people you really get to know them well. But what are great characters without great actors to portray them? Luckily, Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack are both fantastic. For a child actor Tremblay is phenomenal, and really sells his character. Larson is fantastic too, playing a single mother who's not exactly in the best shape. Everyone else is great too, but the two main protagonists stand out the most. The first thing I noticed about this movie was the realism. From the opening to the end, everything felt real. Emotionally, it was real (I've already stated that), but it was also visually real. The characters looked real. At the beginning of the movie Ma has a bit of acne, and that really stood out to me. Finally, a movie where people don't have make-up coating their face so that they appeal more to the audience. Brie Larson looked her part, she had acne, bags under her eyes, bad hair. She didn't look like she was trying to impress anybody, which is because she wasn't. This is something that I don't think I've ever seen in a movie, where people look bad and it's never part of the story or addressed or anything, and it really adds the level of immersiveness in the film. This movie is very emotional. And I don't mean that there's just some climatic sad part at the end, it's spread out. Throughout the movie I felt myself on the brink of tears, and that was with resistance. It brought me closer to crying than any other movie that I've ever seen. Overall Room is absolutely amazing. It's one of the few movies I've seen where not a thing about it has bothered me. I found no flaw in this movie, making it easily one of the best movies of 2015, if not the best movie of 2015. It's realistic and unique, something that so many movies seem to lack. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, whether your interested or not.",

            "content": "How anyone could watch \"ROOM\" and not be touched in some way is beyond my comprehension. It is by far one of the most amazing films that I saw to be released this past year and one that takes your emotions on a roller-coaster ride that continues even after the credits roll. I sat watching the movie absorbed in the tale it had to tell, angry at times, concerned at others and walking away with a love of life that few films can inspire these days.Most people will know the basic set up of \"ROOM\" prior to watching it. Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue it tells the story of Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Trembly) who are together in the single setting of a room. Deeper than that is the realization that Ma was kidnapped and held hostage here giving birth to Jack during the years of her captivity. Now the two of them remain prisoners of the rarely seen Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), the man who kidnapped Ma years ago and who abuses her sexually when the mood strikes.For the better part of 40 minutes the movie focuses on how Ma and Jack live together. The movie begins with his 5th birthday and Ma deciding that she needs to find a way to get out or at least get Jack out so he can live a normal life. That a movie can hold your interest in a single setting, a room, without letting go is a testament to how good this movie is.**Spoiler Alert** So if that's all you want to know stop reading now. What happens after those first 40 minutes are so are the most amazing parts. Their escape plan works and Jack finds himself in the world outside. For 5 years the only world he has known was room, an 11x11 room with a skylight in the ceiling. Now he finds the entire outside world before him and is dumbstruck with all that he must absorb before he can escape Old Nick. But escape he does and eventually is reunited with Ma.And here the story goes on a whole different track. The movie now focuses on how not just Jack but how Ma must deal with adapting to the real world as well. While everyone realizes that Jack must learn how to cope with this outside world few comprehend how Ma, 17 when she was abducted, must also relearn what the world is like. She must come to grips with how no one found her. She must deal with how the world looks at Jack, the child of an abductor. She must learn to live with being unable to escape so long ago and it all takes its toll.We witness the world through Jack's eyes most of the time, learning about this new world. He learns that there are many people in this world, including his grandparents. Grandma (Joan Allen) and grandpa (William H. Macy) are now divorced and grandma lives with Leo (Tom McCamus). Shy and withdrawn he must learn to develop trust with them, learn what the world is like and deal with his mother trying to cope as well.The movie grips you by the throat early on and rarely let's go as it progresses from start to finish. The emotional roller-coaster ride I spoke of has you in fear of what will happen to Ma and Jack. It will have you sad watching the terrors that they go through and considering what it must be like to have been held a captive for years. It will encourage anger as you consider what this monster Old Nick has done to the lives of all he touched, his victim and her friends and family. And it will leave you filled with a sense of joy at discovering through the eyes of young Jack exactly what this world has to offer.Larson won the Academy Award this year for best actress and deservedly so. Her performance here is amazing to watch. She moves from strong protector to little girl once again and her character feels she isn't the mother she should be when Jack lets her know that she is. What stuns me is that Trembly, even though he is so young, wasn't nominated at least for supporting actor. His performance is something one would never expect from a child.I'll say again that I can find no way that anyone who watches this film will not be touched in some way. Watching it at home will make it much easier on viewers as those who might cry won't have to worry about who sees them at different times in the film. If the movie doesn't touch you then you have no soul. I now have to see \"SPOTLIGHT\", the winner for best picture Oscar, just to see if it was better than this movie. Somehow I doubt that it will be but I will be content in knowing that this film was one of the most deserving of the nominations for that title.",

The story is told from the perspective of the 5yo boy, who does not understand that there is a real world outside.To me, it is a story of perspective. The boy, who knows nothing else, sees his tiny grimy space as a whole world in itself. The cinematography accentuates this feeling by never showing \"room\" in it's entirety in one shot ever, despite being a 10x10 space. We see the wardrobe, where Jack hides when \"Old Nick\" comes in to visit Ma, the bathtub / kitchen space, bathroom, and bed as unique places in different scenes, as Jack does. It does not feel claustrophobic to Jack, but we also see it through the eyes of Ma as the viewer.***SPOILERS***Ma is intelligent, patient, and resourceful. She has tried to escape in the past, unsuccessfully. But after Jack is born, her priorities change. She has to keep him safe. She makes sure he gets vitamins and brushes his teeth, despite receiving very little from her captor, and keeps Jack away from Nick. She teaches him to read and exercises with him. And yet, we feel her pain and hopelessness. She expertly negotiates with and earns the trust of Nick, for Jack's sake. Jack is watching her carefully, and eventually she reveals the truth only when he is old enough to understand, and when circumstances force her hand. She does brave things without thinking and coaches Jack to help with their escape.When Jack is riding in that truck, my heart was pounding in my chest. I was so emotionally invested that it felt real to me. I was so afraid that Nick would capture him before he got help, echoing famous cases like Jeffrey Dahmer, when he convinced strangers that his victim was out of their head. Even after the female police officer's intuition led her to take the boy seriously (and she was my favorite btw), I was still afraid and did not know what would happen. It was pure joy to see them reunite. And what was so great about it is that there is never a cut to the captor or anyone else. This story is about Ma and Jack and their experience. One might argue it as a feminist work that puts in focus the unique and empathetic view so often neglected or sidelined in society. The typical perspective is briefly represented by her father's reaction, a perfect example of toxic masculinity preventing the acknowledgement of his own grandchild.It is such a penetrating view that it barely needs to be verbalized at all to be understood. It is internalized in Ma when she continues to punish and blame herself and her mother after they are safe. A raped woman is a ruined woman, and a child of rape (or from any other less than perfect circumstance for that matter) is doomed to the way they came into the world, specifically their biological parents. The reaction of everyone (except Jack) to Ma's enlightened and brave answers in her media interview is heart wrenching to watch. It reminded me of something I heard Elizabeth Smart say in interviews when asked why she didn't try to run away. She said that unless it happens to you, you do not know what you will do. And no one should ever be judged for how they react as victims, but especially women as rape victims because of the complicated stigma and endemic sexism. This is the kind of judgement a man would never be subjected to, and the reason victims rarely report at all, especially male victims, who lose all claim to manhood.Jack is the shining star in the story (though Brie Larsen's performance, particularly in the first half deserved an Oscar). Thanks to his incredible mother, and his young age, he adjusts well to life outside the room. As children often do, he helps his mother more than he realizes by simplifying the world through his eyes. It's a wonderful testament to family and how important they are for overcoming adversity in life, through unconditional love, even when it's uncomfortable. It reminds us that we can find joy and wonder in the most peculiar places if only we can adjust our perspective.",

The story is an emotional ride with phenomenal acting from all involved. For this alone it's worth watching.\nThe film really illustrated well the physical and mental issues a mum and kid would have in this situation and it's that detail that really makes the film better.My major beef I have with this film stems in the 2nd hour. Mainly because nothing of interest really happens. 1st half you're gripped as you watch her lose her mind yet and try to escape. 2nd half, sod all actually happens and it skips out certain storylines that could have made it more interesting. All other characters played a really small role there was no point in them. I get that it's focusing on the mum and son. But the film needed that something to keep the audience somewhat entertained. Because you know how it's going to end, so you feel like you're just waiting for it.Overall, it's a lovely watch that gripped me emotionally. But slightly let down by the 2nd half of the film. 7/10 for me.",

After two years of torture, he gave birth to the little boy Jack. This brought a bright color to her life, where they lived together for five years in a place called Room. Lovely Jack, thinking that this is his world, his mother thought that the danger was approaching at any time, and then told him there was a bigger world outside the skylight in the room. Joy concealed the bad guys by letting Jack pretend to die, and finally let Jack escape to life, and he was finally rescued.This is a very sensational movie, but the plain picture has a lot of tears. It is difficult to imagine how to spend every night and day in a small space, not to mention the prolonged seven years. At the same time, the helplessness of reality is also reflected from the perspective of Jack. When the space is large, the distance between people is also widening, how much helpless. The plot of this movie is not absurd. People may suspect that the heroine has many ways to escape. This is just the view of outsiders. There are realistic cases in our lives. When you are in this situation, you may not be like her Living hard, guarding everything about Jack. Jack is also a brave and loving child, it is he and his mother hug those boring days.The outside world is big and exciting, but it is a bigger challenge for the mother and daughter who escaped. The outside made Jack feel terrified and uncomfortable, and thought about the Room time with both his mother. My mother was also hysterical and depressed during communication with her parents and the media. She tried to commit suicide. Fortunately, Jack was found in time and sent to medical treatment. Eventually, Jack and his mother walked out of the enclosure together. When they visited the former hut again, they discovered how small the original Room was, Jack and the things in the room.\nWhen we say goodbye, we also formally bid farewell to the unbearable past and move towards a new future.In reality, we sometimes have the courage to walk out of our imprisonment and look back at what was once so narrow.",

            "content": "Greetings from Lithuania.Here is what a professional film critic from New York Post has to say about \"Room\" (2015): \"Dopey as the film is on a plot level, it's equally vapid in its psychology\". Here is what i have to say to this \"professional film critic\" - \"Dude, please, change you profession, ASAP, thank you\".\"Room\" (2015) is THE best drama that came from 2015. It features great performance by Brie Larson for which she deservedly must win Oscar, great supporting work from veteran familiar faces, and probably THE best acting from a child i have ever seen. This movie could have felt apart very quickly if it weren't greatly played by actor portraying Jack, in my opinion the key character in this story. Fortunately Jacob Tremblay gives unforgettable, jaw-dropping performance that glues this movie together. Superbly crafted by director Lenny Abrahamson and amazingly written by Emma Donoghue (based on her own novel), \"Room\" tells the hard, gritty, and sometimes very difficult to imagine story, that unfortunately has happened in a real world just months ago (without children as i read). The first hour of this movie is simply a masterpiece. I won't spoil anything, but the second hour goes in a different direction, but never looses it's reality or great movie craftsmanship. I was waiting for this movie months after i heard about it, and finally seeing it i'm so glad it delivered everything i have hoped for - not that i wanted to see such a story - i wanted it to see happening on the screen, in a movie world. \"Room\" is as good as movie drama gets it.Overall, i can't praise this movie more - this is the best movie that i saw in 2015. There are more movies from Best Picture contenders that i haven't seen it yet, but those will be more visceral experiences. \"Room\" is different kind of drama. It unfold just in front of, keeps you glued to the screen for all it's running time 1 h 50 min. Sometimes it will be difficult to watch, but don't turn away - this is the best movie of 2015.",

            "content": "The title is \"Room\" not \"The Room.\" The more general term makes the film about the space in our lives and in our selves and our need to escape whatever walls or restrictions that others \u2014 or we ourselves \u2014 have imposed on us. So our experience really is reflected in this freakish story. The film is about the vast room we have at our disposal not the small room to which we might accept restriction. Unlike most of us, this boy's first five years are spent in a small enclosed shed with no other outside experience but a usually blank skylight sky and the confusion of realities on the wavering TV. No cable there, no proper connection. His Ma has nurtured his delusion that there is no real world out there, concealing their imprisonment until he is old enough to handle it \u2014 i.e., to escape. When they do get out she's troubled by his slowness to make a \"connection\" to anything, but he does, first (of course) to Lego, which enables him to start building his own world, then to a neighbour pal. Unlike most of us, Ma, nee the lost Joy, had her high school joy and promise smashed by seven years of sexual enslavement. But as she was the anchor on her school relay team she's the anchor in her Jack's life. And he becomes her reason to survive. Their (non-umbilical) cord isn't broken until well into their liberation. Only then does she stop breast-feeding him. The film ends with Jack and Ma going back to Room to say goodbye. Of course the past is not the same: the evidence has been removed but mainly, it's not Room any more with the door removed. Its essence was restriction not space. The two leave restriction behind to embrace the expanse of freedom. But psychological restriction remains. Ma's suicide attempt and the TV interviewer's insensitive probing show her still scarred. Jack seems stable when he pulls out of his Ma's embrace to go play with his new/first friend Aaron. This story is a bleak parody of Eden as a parable of our origin. Their captor \"Old Nick\" evokes Satan. Joy's two \"families\" curiously contrast. Her relationship with her captor is a bleak parody of marriage. Jobless, Old Nick is a loser who asserts his false authority by enslaving and abusing Joy. Imprisoning Joy gives him a power and potency he lacks in real life. Enough families, alas, live like that without the literal abduction. Joy's one firm rule is to insist Old Nick will never touch or even see little Jack. She enforces that principle to the point of hysteria. She will save Jack from her contamination by Old Nick, later even denying his paternity. Once reunited, Joy's father can't bring himself even to look at Jack. For him, the boy embodies his daughter's and therefore his shame. The boy's father's imposed restriction parallels the grandfather's self-imposed containment.In contrast, Joy's mother Nancy's new man embraces him in a sensitive, respectful manner. Jack opens up to him: \"I had a dog once but he wasn't real.\" Luckily, Leo brings him a real dog, Shamus, a cozier creature than the big black lab who's Jack's first contact in the outside world. As Nancy admits, Joy's was not the only life destroyed by her abduction. Obviously the parents' marriage was another casualty. The father moved away and remains remote. But Nancy immediately accepts Jack. Her first words to him are thanks for saving \"our little girl.\" Jack saves her again by sending her his \"strong\" in the hair he lets Nancy cut off and bring her. In a touching irony, Joy's horrific enslavement has not diminished her adolescent tensions with her mother. Bonding is like that, as restricting and yet as liberating as \u0085 the room through which we live.",

It sounds horrific, but in the end it is actually inspiring because it is less about detention and more about relationships - not just between mother and child but between mother and her parents and between child and his grandparents.By the time I caught up with the movie, it had been nominated for four Academy Awards and won one, Best Actress for Brie Larson who, most of the time, appears with no make-up and gaunt. But all the performances are impressive, not least that of young Jacob Tremblay as Jack. The novel is narrated in his words and the film uses his voice-over from time to time which give added poignancy to this remarkable and moving story. Jack is just five and forms a special relationship with a grandparent and I am grandparent to a little one who is just five, so I found the film especially resonant.Irish director Lenny Abrahamson has done brilliantly in conveying the physical confines of the eponymous room and the psychological restraints under which we all operate. I didn't like his previous work \"Frank\", which I found too weird, but this is a triumph.",

Some of the finer plot details do not quite add up (in seven years of captivity, she should have been able to work out a four digit security code) and the first half of the movie is a tad repetitive. Things gets more interesting in the second half though with the escape plan in action and superb point-of-view shots as we literally and metaphorically see the world for the first time through the young boy's eyes. Tremblay is excellent as the youngster in question; not all his temper tantrums ring true, but he is great in the quieter moments in which he simply sits back and observes. In fact, the film is more about Tremblay than Larson even though she was the one who garnered all the awards attention. With all the focus on Tremblay though, several plot points feel undernourished; an impending trial, having to eventually tell Trembley who his father is, and acceptance of Trembley into the family are all issues that are mentioned once or twice and then later forgotten. Some have complained that the film runs too long but the ending comes as abrupt if anything with so many avenues left open. The uncertainty is arguably fitting though, and with two very solid lead performances, this is a hard film to look away from, but its resonance will vary depending upon how one feels about all the issues and ideas here that are unexplored to make room for its depiction of a boy seeing the world for the first time.",

            "content": "I'm a sucker for emotional dramas, and even more so if they deal with difficult and/or sensitive subject matter. ROOM is both of those things and does so in a tasteful fashion. I also haven't been so emotionally invested in a film since probably PRISONERS. The story revolves around and Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Ma (whose real name is Joy) was abducted as a teenager and lives in a garden shed, affectionately (or not so, depending on how you interpret it) referred to as 'Room,' with her now-five-year-old son, Jack. When the opportunity arises, Jack escapes and the real meat of the story begins. First off, I was very impressed with performances in the film. Brie Larson does excellent work, but I was even more surprised by Jacob Tremblay. Even though he's quite young, he was able to convey a dramatic range that, although suiting the role in particular, sometimes isn't achieved by older actors. Playing someone who's spent his entire life in captivity, he portrayed the wide-eyed curiosity required as well as the confusion in someone whose perspective on the world is fundamentally changed. There were a number of intense and/or emotional scenes, and he nailed every single one. I also liked how, even though the story deals with women who have been abducted, there was a bit more going on under the surface. Separating the narrative from the obviously horrible situation in which a woman is raped repeatedly, you can see the film also dealing with the psychological effect when a woman has motherhood thrust upon them, the culture shock when someone who has lived in isolation comes into contact with the \"real world,\" etc. There was a lot going on than a simple escape from captivity, in other words. The only issue I could possibly come up with is that the second half of the film doesn't quite live up to the suspenseful first half. Once mother and son are freed, the narrative drive is somewhat lost, or at least goes into a holding pattern for a while. The difference in pacing is noticeable, although I wasn't terribly bothered by it. And, the film wraps up in a satisfying way anyway. All things considered, ROOM is an extremely compelling story that will have some people reaching for a tissue. It has great performances, cinematography, score, etc., and is certainly one of the best films of 2015.",

            "content": "Here's the catch-22 with sexual violence: we need to talk about it, but we don't want to. Can you blame us? It's horribly omnipresent in society, but disturbingly easy to largely overlook out of convenience, between those shameful deniers who live in a sunshine-and-rainbow-unicorns world where only consensual sex happens, and those who are all too aware of the tragic rates of sexual assault, but wouldn't mind an understandable break from contemplating its awfulness. Factoring in all those folks, and the poor, article-challenged audiences wandering into the wrong screening carrying spoons and bellowing \"YOU'RE TEARING ME APAAAAAAART, LISA!!!\", it wouldn't be a surprise to consider Room a hard-sell as a carefree Friday night at the movies. Thankfully, Irish-Canadian author-turned-screenwriter Emma Donoghue has neatly nipped the paradox in the bud by extending the 'only poetry can properly explicate the hidden depths of trauma' maxim to the next level. Room is innately a powerful, necessary, even beautifully moving story of suffering, survival, resilience, and rebuilding. But filtered through the eyes of a child? A masterpiece. Situating five-year old Jack as narrator not only raises the stakes to almost unbearable dimensions - not only must they survive and escape, but Jack must not know - but gives us a far less graphic or painful 'indirect narrator' through which to focalize and make sense of the nuances of his and his Ma, Joy's imprisonment. Director Lenny Abrahamson allows Jack's whimsical boisterousness to shape the film, and the cameras and music mirror his exuberant attention span, bouncing around every corner of the enclosed set with the lilting dance of a surrealist fairy tale. Abrahamson imbues his film with such life that it's easy to empathize with Jack believing Room to be the entirety of existence beyond the fantasies of heaven and TV (and all without any of the tacky, exploitative FX interludes of Peter Jackson's take on The Lovely Bones). There is darkness here as well, even if Jack may not understand the full ramifications of the ominous creaking ensuing from the weekly visits from their grimy caretaker, but his accepting this as part of the fabric of life, in turn, makes it easier for us to bear as well, without lessening the traumatic context in the slightest. In fact, Abrahamson handles the first half of Room with such deft, immaculate precision that we're too busy in survival mode to fully let it all sink in. Cherishing each fleeting scrap of Jack and Ma's happiness, and bemoaning the petty squabbles which infest their relationship, there's almost a palpable feeling of \"if we keep it together and hold on, they will too\". It's only upon Jack's escape - and I dare you to find a more unbearably tense sequence in recent memory - and immersion into the overstimulating sensory flurry of an outside world he previously disavowed the existence of, that we start to feel release. It's only when we are given threads of hope to cling to - that Jack could bounce back, and actually be okay - that we, like Ma, are permitted to finally break, to let go, to grieve, and to rejoice. Donoghue's piercing, conversational screenplay teases out the ripple effects of Jack and Joy's release with gently unflinching care: the inevitable madhouse of paparazzi attention; Jack has no conception of how to play with toys, and requires sunscreen at all times due to his skin's lack of outdoor exposure; Joy's father, who cannot look at his grandson out of what he represents (wonderful William H. Macy at his most heartbreakingly earnest); her mother and new partner desperately striving for normalcy (the pristinely warm and sturdy Joan Allen and Tom McCamus). And just when we start clawing for a continual crescendo of hope, we're subjected to a talk show host interviewing Joy with a winsome, rage-inducing, abominable lack of tact Harry Potter fans will immediately associate with the similarly despicable Dolores Umbridge. Who knew Donoghue could conjure up a character more hateable than Joy's rapist. But, deft plotting and immaculate directing aside, Room as a triumphant two-hander. Brie Larson, having just closed an awards circuit with a hat-trick of accolades, still manages to exceed expectations with an incomparably brave performance, allowing her to play strong, vibrant, caring and clever, but brittle, frayed, and, essentially, very young - often all with a single look, or defeated slouch. Still, Room is Jack's story, and eight-year old Jacob Tremblay carries the film with an overwhelming talent unseen in almost any of his older contemporaries. There's never a moment of Jack that doesn't feel agonizingly real, and Tremblay's use of eye contact, or avoidance thereof, allows so much of a richer entry point into Jack's soul than even his endearingly shrill voice and fidgety physicality - he plays Jack as fundamentally unshowy and real, and is all the more captivating amidst the absurd circumstances he's surrounded by. It's arguably the most impressive performance of the year, and will unquestionably stand the test of time as one of the most powerful child actor performances ever captured on film. Unassuming and harrowingly stripped-down, hugely emotional, yet never false or saccharine, Room was a quieter entry into the 2015 awards circuit, yet by far the year's most haunting and essential work. It's utterly devastating, and yet, in unexpected ways, also certain to make your world a little brighter. When we, alongside Jack and Joy, say \"bye\" to Room, it's with a similar mixture of a heavy heart, tears, and unsettling regret that we let go of a world so horrific yet beautiful. Room reminds us to appreciate and cherish what's dear - and where better to start than with such an unforgettably human piece of cinema. -10/10",

            "content": "This indie drama directed by Lenny Abrahamson is a movie with not enough words to describe how breathtaking it is from beginning to end. Based on the captivating novel by Emma Donoghue, this indie flick rounds up a gripping testament of one of the most powerful bonds between a little boy and his mother ever told on screen. And with an awe-inspiring direction by Lenny Abrahamson and lively storytelling that holds the effects of making you cheer with utter joy at one moment, then leaving you reaching for the tissues the next; and by the end when the credits start rolling, it's difficult to leave the film without garnering a feeling of haunt, or imagining how it would feel to step in the shoes of the characters as they face an near-imaginable predicament. This film follows of the story of twenty-something year old Joy (played by Brie Larson) and her five-year old son Jack (played by Jacob Tremblay) who have spent many years incarcerated in a small shed by Joy's abusive lover who she calls Old Nick (played by Sean Bridgers) who's only means of support is bringing them food and water; while keeping them locked up in the shed using a number combination only he knows. Spending his five young years cooped up in the small shed crammed with a twin-sized bed and a sink, Jack has absolutely no knowledge of the outside world; he makes friends with inanimate objects including a wardrobe and a sink, he believes people on television are just characters made of abstract colors. This is until one day when him and Joy finally make their escape, they go out where Jack experiences the outside world for the very first time.The film introduces an idea that may lay some familiarity on some film goers, an idea of innocent souls held captive in a small enclosed area and alienated with society for many years which you may have heard in some news articles dating back to the Baby Boom era. Lenny Abrahamson however, executes this concept in a way that not only breathtaking, but simply magical. Abrahamson takes the harrowing story of a mother and her little boy enclosed in tiny, old world free from society, successfully captures the deep emotional atmosphere surrounding the lead characters and conducts the story in a way that feels incredibly realistic as if you are actually another character trapped in the small room. Just about every scene taking place inside the small room is beautifully shot with decent lighting to make sure you are able to capture the intense feeling of the characters and their interaction with the small place outside the world the little boy believes is imaginary made up by his mother. When the little boy finally reaches his chance of examining the outside world for the first time, it fuels the emotional core of the story, even more so than the relationship between him and his mother which serves as a key figure of the film. And the emotional gravity continues as the two are forced to adjust to their new life outside, with plenty of moments to allow our characters to shine, and never feeling the need to manipulate us with sappy storytelling. Brie Larson gives a performance that is simply phenomenal and bound to pull at the heart strings. Jacob Tremblay who's only eight years old playing a five-year old child is also tremendous in his role, especially for a cute kid his age. Sean Bridgers, though not given too much do, makes a good source for some intense, heart-pounding moments during the first half. The rest of the cast including William H. Macy and Joan Allen are simply mesmerizing, though fall short below the gold of the two main leads.Room is riveting, triumphant journey through one of the most stories ever told on film in years. With unforgettable performances and lively storytelling, this film is one piece of cinematic artwork that is definitely too breathtaking to ignore. Yes, it can be tough watch at times and there are moments are destined to scouting for tissues or crying on the shoulder of your friend next to you. But ultimately, the film is a rewarding experience.",

Room is solid all around and will not leave you feeling bored because of its interesting choice to shift tone halfway through. Check it out.",

Also hooks and you want to continue watching.The actors are great. If I'm not mistaken they are all unknown but that does not stop them from being great. Even the child and it is not easy to do.The picture is not very good outdoors, but to make a credible film is enough.Even if you do not have nice blueprints or composites. The director, if he knows how to take the film forward. When the thread is finished, it knows how to change and move on and that is very difficult.Spoiler:For me the problem with the script is that I think that the idea of \u200b\u200bthe room ends quickly and then it has to continue somewhere. You are watching it and you do not know what happens until you discover it, but when you discover it, you do not know where it is going to go, but it is still on one side and still very well. At the second turning point, the same thing happens exactly as well.Another great thing about the movie, which plays the script is that of acceptance. Will the grandparents accept their grandchild born of rape? It is a pleasure to meet these jewels that the world of cinema offers us.",

            "content": "Watching \"Room\" is like taking in a film on the Lifetime channel with an A-list cast and a big budget. Like the novel that was the basis for the film, there is a two-part melodramatic structure to the narrative.Melodrama #1 depicts the harrowing captivity of a woman held hostage by her captor for a seven-year period in a dingy, claustrophobic shed in the offender's back yard. Two years into captivity, the woman delivered a baby boy, who is now five years old. The first half of the film plays out like a Harold Pinter drama with the mundane dialogue of the mother and son, plus menacing visits from the captor.The second melodramatic action follows the daring escape of the child, who is successful in alerting the authorities, who free the mother from the shed. The second half of the film is the more engaging because it introduces the family members and seeks to portray the recovery of the traumatized mother and child. Unfortunately, there are too many plot holes in this intense drama, the most glaring of which is the insensitivity of the grandfather character, as played by W. H. Macy.The screenplay was adapted by Emma Donoghue from her novel, and her strong suit is in storytelling, not character motivation. At one of the crucial junctures of the film, when the mother needed support from the family, the grandfather refused to even look at the boy.In the novel, it is made clear that the father is tormented by the idea that the grandson would have the same face as the perpetrator who abducted and raped his daughter. But in the film, the little boy's face is a dead ringer for the mother--not the father. The motivation was not spelled out in the screenplay, and the film's director was completely oblivious of the unmotivated action of the grandfather. In the DVD's commentary track, the director spoke of deleting a scene where the grandfather peeks into the bedroom of the little boy, but still cannot bring himself to look at the child. By restoring that scene, the motivation for Macy's character would still be confusing to the audience.At the premiere of the film at the Landmark Theatre on West Pico in Los Angeles, there was an artistic installation of the 11' X 11' room that was recreated on the site. Such a display indicates the shortcomings of this film in the superficial treatment of a serious topic. This film should have offered a strong social commentary about predators like the one who abducted the young woman. Shouldn't the television reporter be investigating the perpetrator, instead of grilling the young woman, as we see in the film? The overall effect of the film sadly trivializes a serious subject and turns a topic that should evoke moral outrage into a routine tearjerker.",

On finally escaping, both mother and son need to connect to a world which has moved on for Joy, and which Jack has never known.This is a psychological drama on three acts: there is an expository section which shows us the limits of Joy's and Jack's world (and, as it is the only world Jack has ever known, it is perfectly normal to him), then there is the drama and excitement of the escape and, finally, there is a lengthy section in which we see what happens afterwards. This final section was the part I loved because it simply plays with your emotions as you follow the progress of Joy and Jack, and Joy's family, as they meet assorted issues which must be dealt with.Brie Larson as Joy (\"Ma\") is wonderful, and young Jacob Tremblay as Jack is simply astonishing. Jack is a complex character and far from easy to play, but you never for a second think you are watching a child acting: Tremblay IS Jack.This is an excellent film.",

Second case: Amanda Berry, who gave birth to a child of her kidnapper Ariel Castro. But, although it touches on the problems of Stockholm syndrome and Pavlov's reflexological theories, Room's script does not \"decide\" on a definitive diagnosis for its main characters. Audiences today, in part, are those whose outlook on life has become so complacent that they have lost any sense of wonder. The monologues are short, banal and... childish! (What do you expect from a 5 year old anyway?) The 2 hours of the movie - which could have been condensed into 80 minutes and I would have felt less manipulated - feels like 3. Aside from a small underlying horror plot line, NOTHING happens. It's a film about nothing, without a great deal of insight into the causes of human suffering, without any insight into the captor's psyche, without details about the separation of grandparents, without a real weighty role given to a potential character like the psychopath. The protagonist does not provoke empathy, but that's minor. In the good versus evil duel, I always side with the actual victim.",

The first part of the story dealing with Ma (Brie Larson) and son Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) isolation is claustrophobic, depressing and downright creepy at times. Their situation would seem nearly impossible to comprehend, though by now we've had real life examples of similar abductions in which the monstrous perpetrator fathers a child. Consider the cases of Jaycee Dugard and Amanda Berry, both hidden away, virtually in plain sight, as is the case depicted in this film.I found some of the story's concepts interesting, such as young Jack's distorted concept of space and time after exposure to a 'normal' life. The business with the hair and offering the 'strong' to his mother was a unique parallel to the mythology of Samson, and I thought that was cleverly done. I'm on the fence as to why Jack would want to go back to visit 'Room' once he sampled a safe and loving environment, and found it even more baffling that the local police department agreed to accompany him and Ma there.I'm gratified I stayed with the picture because straining through the early part of the story was very disturbing. This isn't the type of movie one ought to consider for entertainment, as the physical and mental abuse suffered by Ma was as harrowing an ordeal as one might find in a war or hostage film. And even though the story ends on a positive note, it's not with a feeling of joy that one eventually comes away with.",

            "content": "The crime of kidnapping and extended captivity is well known through media exposure that sensationalises the psychological horrors of confinement in claustrophobic spaces. The dependency of some victims on an abusive captor or prison is just one of the many strange twists found in captivity stories. But this one is different because it is narrated through the eyes of five- year old Jack who was born in a fortified shed with only a small overhead skylight visually connected to what is outside his world called Room. His mother was abducted at seventeen and has been a captive for seven years, raising Jack as best she can in a co-dependent relationship that shines beautifully in their small prison. When tormentor Nick loses his job she knows he will not keep them alive, and that's when the slow-paced narrative opens predictably towards a fast world full of frighteningly wonderful sights and sounds and feelings expressed through the naivety of a newborn five-year old.This film would not work without the emotionally intelligent acting of Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Being almost ten and convincingly presenting as half his age is nothing short of remarkable. He describes his new world through wide eyes and lyrical words that capture the exploding space into which he is thrust, and he alone holds this film together. As Ma, Brie Larson's acting fixates on maternal dynamics at the cost of a convincing portrayal of captivity trauma. The scene where Jack and Ma re-visit Room after Nick is caught has all the nonchalance of strolling through a museum, as the story winds down from the highs of a taut psychological thriller to a modest melodrama. It is after all a film that strives for insight, not entertainment, while remaining true to the book upon which it is based. It does this thoughtfully in the first half, but slowly loses focus as it drifts aimlessly towards the end.",

The story is told from the eyes of the little boy. Here the perpetrator is a stranger who kidnapped and keeps a 16 year old girl captive in a 11X11 feet cramped room (which has a tub, wash-basin, toilet, kitchen bed, cupboard, a TV and only one skylight) for 7 years.The movie starts when Joy is 24 year old women with her 5 year old son Jack in this tiny space where they create their own world. It is a gritty story of survival of Joy and her mother's instinct to protect her son Jack and planning an escape so that they are freed from this hostile and captive room for Jack to see the wonders of the world. By the mid-point of the story Joy succeeds in her plans and is rescued by police. The second half focuses on re-integration of Joy and Jack within the society and their family but skips the perpetrator's arrest and prosecution.The main three characters Joy - (Brie Larson) Jack - (Jacob Tremblay) and Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) play their parts beautifully. Brie won the Oscars Academy award as Best Actress for this role and another Jacob had 45 award nominations from which he won 19 awards as best supporting young actor.The movie did excellent business after the Oscar award for Brie Larson. On a budget of 13 million, it did a business of 36 million world-wide.The Director Lenny Abrahamson has done a marvelous job in remaining true to the novel, thanks to the help of the author Emma who also wrote the screenplay of the movie. The movie is rated all time 136 best movies of the world rated by IMdb and has 239 nominations from which it has won 130 awards. Phenomenon.Good thing about the movie is that even after undertaking such an abusive subject, Lenny and Emma have created a clean, touching movie that moves us to tears and smiles and final triumph of human spirit. A bit slow but to transport to the lives of Joy and Jack - one needs to hold the flag of empathy. A good Drama thriller.I would go with 7.25 out of 10 P.S.\nJust for those who are interested in Fritzl case, the father is life-imprisonment till death in Austrian prison and the daughter was a given a new identity and lives with her children a normal life.",

Emma Donoghue had the high profile, real life situations of Jaycee Dugard, Elisabeth Fritzl and Amanda Berry (Ariel Castro) to draw from for her terrific novel upon which this film is based. While not easy for anyone (especially parents) to watch, it's a well made movie with outstanding performances \u0085 including a career-changer from Brie Larson.Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank, a critical favorite from last year) takes us inside the world \u2013 or more accurately \u2013 the walls where Ma (Brie Larson) and her just turning 5 year old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live. Seven years ago, Larson's character was abducted while walking home from school, and since then she has given birth to Jack, and the two have been held captive in a small shed with only a skylight connecting to the outer spaces of life. The captor \u0085 known as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) \u0085 periodically brings them supplies, while also regularly visiting to satisfy his more base needs with Ma.For the first half of the film, we as viewers are held prisoners right along with Ma and Jack. We see what a patient and wonderful mother she is as she strives to provide some semblance of hope for her son, though in a nearly hopeless situation. When Jack turns 5, Ma begins to explain the outside world to him, as she knows they must try to escape in order for her son to have any semblance of a normal life. During this time, we are in awe of this 10 x 10 environment and how it is every bit the nightmare we have imagined while reading the articles and seeing the reports on real life ordeals.The second half of the film is equally fascinating, as we watch young Jack and his sense of wonder and caution at discovering the real world. We also see the psychological trauma that Ma experiences after staying strong for so long. Assimilating into society brings different challenges for both Ma and Jack, plus those of her mother (Joan Allen), her father (William H Macy) and her mom's new beau (Tom McCamus). The film doesn't shy away from their reactions, though some are easier to stomach than others.Providing any more details would soften the impact of the film, and this is one that is meant to be felt \u2013 even if it's a true kick in the gut. The film is well cast and well acted, and young Jacob Tremblay captures our hearts quickly and joins the short list of child actors who go far beyond \"cute\" and into profound. Brie Larson exploded onto the acting scene in Short Term 12, one of my favorite movies of 2013; but it's here where she steps into the elite level of actresses. She brings a tenacity and emotional strength that leaves us never doubting whether she has \"her strong\".",

It brought out a lot of emotions and really changed my perception of Brie Larson.Room follows Joy and her son, Jack, who've been held captive in an enclosed area which they've referred to as Room. One day, they get their freedom and her son gets to finally experience the outside world.What I really loved was the first hour. Director Lenny Abrahamson really managed to capture the claustrophic aspect of the 10 x 10 room as well as the lifestyle they had to adapt to for the years they were in there and made me genuinely care a lot for Larson and Tremblay. Putting us through the perspective of Jack was a clever choice by writer Emma Donoghue as we got to see his interpretation of the world compared to ours, making the film wholly interesting.For me, personally, the second half wasn't as engaging. It was still fascinating nonetheless as we got to witness Jack discovering and exploring this new world he wasn't familiar with as well as the psychological issues Brie Larson's character goes through when coming back. However, the film wasn't able to carry the same level of interest that I had in the first half.Aside from the tight script and direction, the two lead performances are what carry the film. I'm not really a fan of Brie Larson but I have to give credit where credit is due. She was terrific. Her emotions and facial expressions were executed perfectly. No wonder she won the Oscar. The one who really suprised me was Jacob Tremblay. It's insane how good he is throughout this film especially for his age at the time.

Like any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but typical-- they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has euphemistically named Room. Ma has created a whole universe for Jack within Room, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet: the real world.The star of the film is Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson does a credible turn as Ma and the 'outsiders' \u2013 Ma's parents Joan Allen, William H. Macy and her kidnapper Sean Bridges \u2013 carry their weight. The film is unnecessarily long and that need for editing diminishes the extraordinary impact of Jack as he discovers the real world. If young Canadian actor Jacob Tremblay secures the right agent he could become a very important actor in the future.

It wins Brie Larson a coveted Oscar for BEST LEADING ACTRESS, but the real backbone of this bracing indie drama is its 9-year-old child genius Jacob Tremblay.Joy (Larson), is captured by a man she calls Old Nick (Bridgers) 7 years ago, as his sex slave, she is locked inside a room with only a skylight above, and she gives birth to a son named Jack (Tremblay). Now Jack is five years old, he has never been outside the room, and Joy hatches a daring escape plan which puts Jack at the mercy of his luck, but it seems to be their only chance to get out of the living hell.The first hour (before Joy's plan) is entirely shot inside the room, a small shed, Abrahamson has done a phenomenal job to circumvent the claustrophobic setting and elicited an exceptional two- hander between Larson and Tremblay, especially the latter, who is born under such a unique situation, which makes his view of life worlds apart from our common sense and himself a perfect focus point for viewers to scrutinise under the lens of the dramatic sea change soon he is going to experience. Joy's protective strategy works well for a toddler in this extremely unhealthy growing environment (he has to submerge into imagination for companionship, believes everything shown on TV is not real, and the room is their whole world), but when she needs him to assist her in the plan to escape, she must shatter the entire fabrication and tell him what is the real world, here, the clash reaches its boiling point, again, Tremblay is such a godsend to watch, accurately expresses Jack's confusion, denial, fear and maturity from writer Emma Donoghue's taut but rational script.The next hour is less engaging, when Joy and Jack reunite in the outside world, Jack meets his grandmother Nancy (Allen, a fresh welcome to high-quality cinema since she is so overdue for recognition) and grandfather Robert (Macy, a small cameo, but his reunion with Allen as a couple hits the nostalgic sweet spot) for the first time, although they have separated since the missing of Joy, the cognitive knowledge of the real world is a lengthy and time-consuming progress for Jack, but thankfully he has no sequelae of the captivity and it turns out fine for him. It is Joy, who is struggling with depression, anger and guilt, collapses in the real world, Jack becomes her sole strength to overcome her psychological hurdles and there is a brand new life awaits them.ROOM has an all-approaching, soul-touching story at its kernel, burnished with a brilliant cast (the film is unswervingly taking the stance from Jack's viewpoint, which does make Larson's Oscar- winning showcase less reverberating than in SHORT TERM 12, 2013, although Larson's tenacity and mastery of emotions are peerless), and a humble diegetic approach through a child's eye, it adamantly gives rise to a heartfelt sensation without sensationalising its characterisation, a singular accomplish under the belt of Abrahamson and the sterling teamwork.",

Most impressive about this film is how much thought the writer Emma Donaghue put into her screenplay, not made easier and probably harder by the fact she also wrote the source novel (a surprise and must-read to me!). With help from Director Lenny Abrahamson the film is finely crafted not to waste a word or a moment to embellish the story and suspense. It would be very easy to veer into pathos, melodrama and voyeurism to stir up emotions but such temptations are well avoided. The thrilling scenes in the middle of the film are standing alone worth the watching. The dialog and screenplay skills become most apparent in the second half of ROOM when experiencing Jack's emotional, physical and verbal responses to a world he is unfamiliar with. most apparent in his almost humorous but curiously on-point descriptions of everyday behavior and encounters. I'd have assigned a perfect \"10\" but for the fact that Macy's Dad's reaction Ma's \"descent\" might've been anticipated a bit more. I quibble. Great movie!",

When I heard its name, my first reaction was \"is it a horror movie?\". And she explained that it wasn't and told me briefly the story. I'll try to tell as little as I can, because I believe one of the reasons this film had such a huge impact on me was precisely my lack of previous knowledge.Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a five-year old boy, lives with his mother Joy (Brie Larson) in a tiny room in precarious conditions. The boy has very long hair, is still breastfed, and sleeps inside the closet. Soon you realize they are not there by option: Joy was kidnapped 7 years before and Jack was born there, inside that room, which he believes to be the only thing that exists in the world. He has absolutely no idea that there is an \"outside\" behind the door.I had all the possible emotions while watching Room. I was sad, happy, angry, and nervous (almost having a heart attack during an specific scene). Even my cousin was on the edge of her seat and she already knew what was going to happen.Everything in this film is great, starting with the cast. Brie Larson is so perfect with her portrayal of a young woman who has been through such a trauma that I strongly believe she has real chances to be awarded for this role. Her character is so complex and she's able to transmit to us the sadness due to the situation and the happiness for having her son with her. And, of course, the boy! Jacob Tremblay is perfect and you can't help but feel both sorry and sympathetic towards him. He is so genuinely na\u00efve and oblivious of the bad (and good) things in the world that is impossible not to like him.Full review: http://wp.me/p5Rk4c-fB",

            "content": "How many times in your life have you been forced to finish a bad movie, book, or story, all the while just wishing it would end? Rarely is that longing as desperate in our reality as it is for the characters in Room. When Jack screams at his Ma, \"I want a different story!\", you know there's more to it than just a hunger for a different bedtime yarn. Her response, \"No! This is the story you get!\", punctuates their situation, and ultimately our own desires, with such force it nearly knocked me out. Room, a powerhouse of horrifying drama and real-life suspense, breaks out from its confining premise with enough gentle moments of love to make it one of the year's best. If you can't tell, I'm being careful with the details of the plot. However, know that it's a setup that's about as bleak as one can imagine. Director Abrahamson (maker of the criminally underrated Frank) creates an atmosphere of intensely palpable desperation in his small sets. In lesser hands, Room could've been either an oppressively gloomy downer or dishonestly optimistic hack-job. Instead, it's both strikingly candid and beautifully grace-filled This compassion for its subjects is thanks in no small part to the much-deserved-Oscar-nominated Larson, and young actor Tremblay. His character, in particular, presents such a powerful look at childish na\u00efvet\u00e9, he gives us one of the most amazing examples childhood trauma and perseverance I've ever seen. That theme (determination through suffering) creates an experience that harbors as much exhilaration as it does tears. Piercing and gut-wrenching, Room is a film you may want to escape, but will be glad you endured.",

            "content": "I didn't see Room (2015) when it first hit the theaters because I knew it would be something of a downer (or worse) and I tend not to opt for those. But that, of course, is pretty short-sighted. My wife thought I should watch it even if just to see Brie Larson in her Oscar-winning role before I went to see her as a big-budget superhero in Captain Marvel (2019), so we watched Room on Netflix this week. And of course she was right -- this is a carefully thought out and crafted film that sticks in the mind afterward. Although it's fictional, sadly it's not all that fictional. We read in the news all the time about kidnapping and abduction of young women for sex-trade purposes or worse.I'm not going to worry too much about \"spoilers\" in my review, coming 4 years after the fact -- the IMdB synopsis itself gives away the bare bones of the whole plot -- so I'll just go ahead with my reactions. Larson plays Joy Newsome (\"Ma\"), abducted on the street at age 17 by an unnamed predator (Sean Bridgers) who keeps her locked in his backyard shed as a sex slave (no other way to put it). 7 years later she now has a son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who has no knowledge of the world outside their Room except for what appears on TV. The first half of the movie shows them in their tiny, gruelling world day by day. Joy takes advantage of a temporary power outage to concoct an escape, which beyond all hope actually works. The second half of the movie is their adjustment after re-entry to the world outside (or in Jack's case, first-time entry).But no plot summary gets across the emotional impact and at-times surprising turns of the story. Though Jack is utterly bewildered at first by the reality of the larger world, as young children are very good at doing he adjusts, learns, adapts and accepts over the course of the next few weeks: meeting his grandparents, finally dressing and eating well, just being outside, making a neighborhood friend, delighting in the family dog. It's Joy who has much deeper trouble. After the Great Escape, dealing with the police and the doctors, and making the transition back to her own family home, things are not all rosy. She's unpredictably short-tempered; impatient; aimless; unhappy. She doesn't know what's wrong, experiences a physical breakdown. Shouldn't she be happy and fine? The obvious answer staring us in the face, of course, is that she's exhausted: flat-out, bone-deep exhausted, after 7 unrelenting years of captivity and five years looking out for her son every minute of every day -- protecting, feeding, training, teaching. Healing happens, but it takes far longer. This is a deeply sympathetic portrayal of a very ordinary person pushed far beyond ordinary limits, and Larson delivers every bit of it.Which brings me to the stylistic part of the movie. Everyone here is an ordinary person and acts that way. When abducted, Joy was an average high-school girl with no more personal resources or courage than average, pushed into an impossible situation. She has no particular training in dealing with motherhood, or sexual predators, or isolation and deprivation. Jack is what he is -- a kid with a kid's typical mix of behavior that is variously affectionate, obedient, self-centered, kind, shy, peevish, frightened. Their captor (\"Old Nick\") is menacing but also banal -- a social loser who can't hold a job and has minimal competence. Joy's escape bears no resemblance to the kind of McGyver scheme that a normal action thriller hero would come up with; her plan is not really a very good one, is also extremely risky, but it is just bold enough to work. The police officers and doctors who find them and care for them are unspectacular in turn, but they are seen to do their jobs sympathetically and well. Finally, Joy's parents Nancy and Robert (played by major actors Joan Allen and William H. Macy, in strong supporting performances) are ordinary suburban dwellers who had been forced to presume their long-lost daughter was dead. In the intervening years they have separated, and Nancy has a new partner Leo (played very effectively indeed by Tom McCamus). Both Nancy and Leo turn out to be the strengths of their newly rebuilt family: Nancy takes over Jack when Joy cannot, and Leo succeeds in making friends with him while Robert finds that he cannot.The media feeding frenzy that usually accompanies sensational news stories like this \"Woman Held Captive for Seven Years Escapes! News at 8.\") is shown too, but not all that much time is spent on it. What little we get, though, does not cast reporters in a very good light. We see one very telling scene where Joy consents to do a TV interview, and the interviewer (Wendy Crewson) sideswipes her with appallingly self-righteous, judgmental questions about what she did with her son.Lastly, a shout-out to young Jacob Tremblay. He was age 9 when making the film, playing a 5-year-old, and breathtakingly convincing at it. It never occurred to me while watching that he was that much older in reality. He's just as major a figure as Larson at carrying the movie and in certain sections has to effectively carry it alone. We know how Brie Larson's career has taken off (literally, in Captain Marvel!) but it's nice to see that Tremblay is beginning to make his mark as well in other features.",

He is Jack and this room is his world along with his mother Joy. She raises him within that room heightening his imagination with various activities until bedtime in a closet. Nights are chilling because that is when Old Nick returns. He keeps them locked in this room and abuses Joy who protects Jack. When all seems lost Joy schemes a plan for Jack's freedom and the result is a spectacular yet intimidating image of adapting to a bigger universe. Director Lenny Abrahamson does an intriguing and detailed job at showcasing this outside freedom from both perspectives and how both Jack and Joy adapt differently. Brie Larson has become one of the most dependable talents with a resume of diverse roles. This is Larson at her best as she struggles to raise her son within confinement and then prepare him for an escape into an unseen world. Sean Bridgers plays Old Nick whose footage is brief but important as his sadistic choices become clear. Joan Allen plays Joy's mother who eventually introduces Jack to his very first hair cut. Tom McCamus plays her second husband, Leo who accepts Jack when his grandfather cannot muster up the ability to look at him. This is a powerful and emotionally charged film about motherhood at its most extreme. It demonstrates what a mother will go through to allow her son a promising future and an escape from the enclosed space that was room. Score: 10 / 10",

            "content": "Ma: \"You're gonna love it\".Jack: \"What?\".Ma: \"The world\".Room tells the story of a relationship between a mother and son, as she raises him while confined to a 10x10 room and what happens when they finally get out.Since the 2016 Oscars are on Sunday and I've been lacking quite a bit on seeing as many Oscar contenders from last year. Room was one of those movies, as I've heard nothing but great things about it and how truly unique it is (from what I heard). It was a real shame that I had to wait for a while to get a chance to watch this movie, because it's been a very slow month over here in jolly good England. But after finally seeing the movie after that long wait, I can say that the movie was pretty underwhelming, and that's really disappointing saying that.Brie Larson has been sweeping the award season this year, by taking home: The BAFTA, Golden Globe, Critics Choice award and the SAG award, and it's very deserving. Brie Larson delivered a tremendous performance and she was without a doubt the best part of this movie. I'm so happy that Larson is finally getting noticed since everyone pretty much forgot about \"Short Term 12\" and her performance in that film that got very unnoticed. Larson shows off her acting skills in this movie and I know for a fact that she will receive an Oscar on Sunday night. She was truly brilliant in this movie and one of her best performance so far.Lenny Abrahamson (director of the movie) brought us the 2014 film \"Frank\", which I really liked and I couldn't wait to see want he will bring to this movie, and what he brought was somewhat of a mix bag for me. I'm happy for him to get an Oscar nomination, but I didn't find anything that special or groundbreaking when it came to it's directing. Most of it is just copy and past from the book that this movie is based on, so Abrahamson can look on what he's doing. I didn't read the book (and never will) but I've heard a lot of people who did read the book say that the book is better than the movie, and even the author herself said the same thing. The directing isn't anything Oscar worthy, but it's decent directing at best for Abrahamson.The first act of this movie was very strong and it did kept my interest. That's the biggest positive I had for this movie is it's first act.Jacob Tremblay is an unknown star to me and for everyone else, so this is basically he's break out role. I did look up on what Tremblay has been in before and I found out he was in \"The Smurfs 2\" which wasn't that good. But all that aside, I thought he's performance was alright, nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible. He's better than most kids I've seen in recent movies, but I also have seen better ones as well.Now for the problems: The second act wasn't as strong as the first act. The movie did lose me a couple of times as I became disinterest as it went along.The movie did feel like a sugar-coated version of the book and as I said before I haven't even read the book, but for what I heard from other people, the book is more graphic and dark than the movie. I get this question asked a lot when I say the movie sugar-coated from the book, \"Would you rather have graphic scenes of rape from the book\", well if that's what the book is suppose to be, then yeah, and it's not because I want to see someone get raped, but if you what me to give a crap about the characters and their struggle to see how their suffered, then the film makers shouldn't have sugar-coated it. I feel like if this movie was handled by a different director, it would have been a much better movie. The movie is basically telling you that there's violence and rape that happened, but there's nothing really graphic about it. The movie tells you to care about things that it never bothers developing and if you are going to make a movie on a subject like that, and pretend that this horrible thing that happened, again, you shouldn't sugar-coat it. Take \"12 Years a Slave\" as an example: That movie was graphic, brutal, honest and that's what made it an amazing movie, because it took a real life story like slavery that's suppose to make you feel for the character's and makes you look at what their been through and say to yourself \"Wow, that was truly awful\". Now look at Room, we have a single character and the movie is telling you to feel bad for her and what shes been through, but it didn't show any of it, and it's not like it has to be graphic for the sake of it, but it didn't even try to develop it.Overall Room was very overwhelming and kind of bland. I know a lot of people are going to get mad at me for not loving this movie as they do, but that's just my opinion.",

            "review_title": "A tremendous mix of drama and science-fiction that will eventually resonate with nearly viewer at some point in time",
            "content": "I remember seeing a trailer for \"Room\" months back in 2015 and being almost entirely mystified; it looked like a strange, almost ethereal mix of drama and science-fiction that even the trailer couldn't adequately communicate. Not until seeing it, I realized that this is a film that isn't easy to summarize in a brief two minute trailer, and I'll undoubtedly struggle to illustrate the film's genius with its review. This is the kind of film one needs to experience and feel; a film where words often feel either exaggerating or shortchanging in attempting to illustrate the film's emotional power and exceptional narrative.Simply put, \"Room\" is the emotional movie-going experience of the season. A deeply moving film that combines the aforementioned genres of drama and science-fiction, \"Room\" is the kind of film that hits you with its most powerful shot after you walk out of the theater or turn off the TV. It lingers in your mind and the characters, their motivations, their conversations, their struggles, and their thoughts don't escape you, unlike most dramas, where character names are probably not even remembered by most following the end credits.The film opens with a young mother named Joy (Brie Larson) and her small child named Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who live their life in an enclosed garden shed of about one-hundred square feet and their only available sunlight is a skylight. They eat, sleep, bathe, and cook in there, and for Jack, it's the only life he has come to know. At first, their routine actions and close relationship lead one to believe that they've chosen this life in order to free themselves from the constraints of society. However, we see the horror of their reality soon enough.Seven years ago, Joy was tricked and kidnapped by a man known as \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers), who raped her and had her give birth to Jack. Since then, she has lived inside this closed space; it isn't until their escape-plan is successful that Joy goes back to her mother and father and Jack finally experiences the outside world. Previously, Jack believed, largely in part of his mother, who tried to make their life seem a lot less hellish, that outside of the four walls of \"room,\" as they referred to it, was outer space. The people on TV were just flat, and nothing else besides them and Old Nick existed.Upon finally escaping and trying to return to a life that seems brand new to them, Joy struggles to get Jack to assimilate to the world. His entire life was predicated upon just him and his \"Ma,\" as he was largely kept hidden in the closet whenever Old Nick would come pay them a visit. Now, he must be socialized into the world at age five, and learn that there is not only a larger life, but a larger world outside of \"room.\" His mother, on the other hand, must grapple with her demons that have haunted her since she was captured.If you look at \"Room\" from the perspective of Joy, you find a drama about being re-socialized into the world after living your entire life in captivity. It's a familiar story, but one that is truly sad and potent, and Brie Larson brings such life and emotion to the role for a woman so young (her precocious acting reminds me quite a bit of Jennifer Lawrence). However, if you look at the film through Jack's perspective, you see a film that plays with the realm of science-fiction. While nothing about \"Room\" deals with supernatural or \"the unknown\" in a grandiose sense, we do have a character who has never experienced life first-hand and sees everything around him not only as foreign but, for lack of a better term, alien.This results in a film that's very lucid and ethereal, largely in part because of Lenny Abrahamson's (who directed 2014's \"Frank,\" a strong film dealing with mental illness) unique direction and cinematographer Danny Cohen's dreamlike grasp on reality. These beautiful and immersive aesthetic choices make the world and everything we take for granted and overlook on a daily basis look as if it's an unearthly object, with extreme close-ups and high-contrast depictions employed by Abrahamson.\"Room\" is a film largely bent on repetition; everything from Joy and Jack's daily actions in \"room,\" Jack's attempts to socialize with other adults, Joy's attempt to come to terms with returning to her old life, and more are all showcased as recurring events in the film. This slowburn narrative tactic allows character motivations and interest to rise and boil accordingly, creating a film that turns impacting and even emotional when bigger, more elaborate events occur (the truck scene may be one of the best sequences I've seen in film last year). With all that and more considered, \"Room\" is a wonderful treat of a film; one that will hit everyone differently in a sense that it's not a matter of if it will resonate with you but how it will eventually manage to do so.",

While those minutes are crucial to the rest of the story, seeing how a grown woman and her five-year-old son survive while locked inside a 10ft. by 10ft. outdoor shed is a tough task for any viewer. Director Lenny Abrahamson and screenwriter Emma Donoghue, adapting her own novel, free the captives (and the audience) before too long--and yet, mother and son's new life in the suburbs is nearly as uninteresting as life in that shed (I'm not sure this is intentional). Thankfully, Brie Larson's Oscar-winning performance as the exhausted, anxious (and guilt-ridden) single mom facing a strange new world is riveting on occasion, while the (not implausible) center of the story--an awakening, if you will--is emotional, if never quite fascinating. As an acting exercise for this cast, the material must have looked like a godsend. Abrahamson is careful with his actors; he allows them to think and breathe and hurt and heal. But all this drama could take its toll on an impatient audience, so personal judgment will have to dictate whether or not the movie is a success. **1/2 from ****",

This film is way better than I thought it was going to be. I thought this was going to be one of those boring films that got nominated for and grabbed numerous awards. I was wrong. I was very impressed at the way this film was played out and was delivered. Imagine being a five year old boy who has only known an enclosed room his entire life and then escapes and live through the aftermath of it. This sets the stage for a brilliant film. At times I did want Ma (Brie Larson) to whip Jack (Jacob Tremblay) during and after the imprisonment and I did find myself getting angry with Ma (Brie Larson) after their escape.

But of course the members concerned have long banished the word justice from their collective vocabularies as I predicted right here on IMDb back in November, 2013, when I said in my review of Short Term 12 that neither Larson nor the excellent movie would even be nominated. What can I tell you. Those are the breaks. In a perfect world everyone involved in Room from the Head Honcho right down to the guy who carried beer would be recognized for their contribution to one of the finest movies of the year. Okay, the people responsible for nominating actresses got it right for once but, as if to compensate they failed to even nominate Larson's remarkable co- star Jacob Tremblay. Like Short Term 12 this is hardly Multiplex fodder aimed at the popcorn set but that doesn't mean it shouldn't play in the Multiplexes and expose the cgi sequel freaks to real filmmaking.",

            "content": "The kidnapping, incarceration and rape of children is incredibly difficult to represent authentically on screen. 'Michael' shows how damning the effect can be when genre demands are prioritized over authentic portrayals. The first half of Room offers up a subtly plausible account of how a young woman copes with appeasing her captor in order to avert his gaze from her son. The performances of Brie Larson and an outstanding Jacob Tremblay are crucial here. Jack craves affection but also explores revolt, and the parent-child bond is utterly convincing. Sean Bridgers as the captor Old Nick takes a banality of evil approach: this could be your cousin, your neighbour, your boss. When Jack escapes and Old Nick makes the decision to abandon him in the street, the way he throws the boy down completely conveys the psychopathic nature of the man. The second half of the film, about Ma's difficulty in re-adjusting to society, works less well. Her father is wheeled in then wheeled off in order to make a point about the difficulty of accepting his grandchild. The A-list casting here did not help - a more anonymous face in this role would have given it more of an everyday dark fear appeal. The ending is low-key, but is in its own small way triumphant, a full stop placed right where it was needed. These two characters will go on. They will heal. Thoughtful, mature film-making that stays with you after the curtain closes.",

            "content": "\"Room\" (2015 release; 117 min.) brings the story of a young lady named Joy, and her son Jack. As the movie opens, Jack wakes up and can't wait to tell Ma that it's his 5th birthday. He goes around the room, exclaiming with joy \"good morning rag, good morning TV, good morning sink!\". It becomes clear very quickly that, despite Jack's innocence and joy, they are actually held captive and Jack has never known anything other than \"Room\", as they call this place. Joy is trying to figure out a way to deceive the man who is holding them captive, so as to escape. TO tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is directed by Lenny Abrahamson, who just last year brought us the delightfully quirky \"Frank\", and Emma Donoghue, who wrote the book on which this is based, wrote the script. I have not read the book, so I do not know how closely the movie sticks to the book (I'm guessing quite closely, though). Second, as the movie's trailer makes plain, Joy and Jack do end up getting out of \"Room\", and as a result this movie really consists of two separate parts: before and after, and each takes about half of the movie's running time. The \"before\" part is nothing short of extraordinary, as we observe Joy and Jack living in their cramped quarters (which look quite big to Jack). Third, everyone's been talking about the Best Actress Oscar chances for Brie Larson in her role of Joy/Ma, so imagine my surprise when it turns out that yes, she is quite good, but the young boy playing Jack simply steals the movie, period. Jacob Tremblay brings one of the more astonishing and accomplished performances of such a young actor or actress in recent memory. Joan Allen (as Joy's mom) is quite powerful too, but also keep an eye out for William H. Macy's short (less than 19 min.) but impactful role as Joy's dad.\"Room\" opened this past weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I finally had an opportunity to see it. The week night screening where I saw this at was attended surprisingly well for a week night, which is great news. I imagine that \"Room\" will pick up quite a few nominations in the upcoming awards season, and deservedly so. \"Room\" is an outstanding movie on so many levels, and I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. \"Room\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

The movie starts out promisingly and does a couple of things right, makes no mistakes but does nothing special or extraordinary with the situation. I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt and was hoping the psychological aspects of the film would step up in the second half but it didn't do so, the second half completely changes the situation for worse, there are new problems to deal with and the movie goes about them in it's usual half committed way which was prevalent in first half. The acting is definitely the strong suit of the film, Brie Larson is amazing and I would be OK with her winning the Oscar, though I didn't think much of the film I thought she was great. The kid played by Jacob Tremblay showed amazing depth and variety for a young child. The weakness of the film is direction, it does not capitalizes on it's setting, it has no great scenes and does not visually grab you at anytime (I am not reading a book I am watching a movie), also sometimes Brie Larson's character is quite inconsistent and unrealistic sometimes, she shows very few signs of PTSD, it sometimes feels she was trapped in Room for weeks not seven years, not her fault though, another misstep by the director, along with not capitalizing that Jack maybe better off without Joy (it touches so less on the REAL issues it's infuriating).",

This too is unfair. Are you actually seeing what's in front of your eyes? Are you sure? The film demands that you give it at least another ten minutes, and you do. And as soon as you do, it gets worse. After that it gets worse, and then worse, and worse, and worse. And it's only just begun. The setting hasn't even left the room. Then it does. Finally. Surprise! A goodly portion of the film, in fact, at least 30 percent, takes place outside the room. I have no idea why. To show that the outside world is just as claustrophobic? That would've been a good point, but the story doesn't allow it! The writer is adrift. The shift of scenery doesn't help. It makes Room even worse - and it gets worse yet, and even worse than that, despite the brief, welcome, charitable appearance of two superbly talented actors (William H. Macy and Joan Allen) who can actually act, whether they have a character to play or not. Acting, in fact, is not an issue in the movie. To be fair, the child star of the film, Jacob Tremblay (made deliberately genderless as only a 5-year-old could be) gives as execrable a performance as any adult ever has, and deserves a lot of credit for it. If the director intended it that way, he probably either has no children, or doesn't know or like any. It's not totally Tremblay's fault: he obviously found it impossible to believe in the story, as did the writer, director, actors and producers who concocted this infinitely boring, one-dimensional, unfelt drama. Here and there throughout the story, that sickly, treacly piano that has invaded the soundtrack of hundreds of anemic films like a skin rash makes an appearance. To top it off, Room is made with the highest of production values. They are the only values visible, and may lift the movie to the heights of Trumpian emptiness. Americans love nothing better in their movies: production values are the new family values. The overall impression is of a movie, clunkily directed by Lenny Abrahamson, written by someone (Emma Donoghue) whose entire experience of life must have been acquired in a room, probably a classroom, possibly a cloakroom, a writer unashamed to display her bad handwriting, and constitutionally unable or unwilling to share with the public how little she knows or cares about the world she inhabits. A lot has been written about the hell the cinematographers went through to make parts of this movie, jamming their equipment into a tiny cramped space for countless hours. It doesn't show, and what does is not interesting. If they'd shown us the hell, and not the Room they made of it, I'd have had a lot less to say but would've left with more than a craving for a quick burger on my mind.",

After the exit the difficulty to consolidate human relationships demonstrates the delicate period of exploration of another world that doesn't necessarily coincide with the first one.

One major theme of this film is about survival and finding your place in the world, something which many, many people can relate to.

Academy Award Winner Brie Larson is exquisite as Ma/Joy, a complex, complicated, nurturing mother but also brutally traumatized kidnap victim and sexual assault survivor. At first I wondered what people were talking about when they said Ma was 'such a good mom' to Jack, as she has her bitchy moments almost from the start of the film, but then i stepped back and realized I'd be that way too. To expect the character to come away unscathed is just unrealistic, but for the years she's in Room, she does a great job sheltering her son from the realities of life until its unbearable. To the people that say Jacob was robbed of an Oscar nomination at least, i would agree, but i would also remind them that doesn't mean Brie's win was not deserved. Her character was MUCH more complex. It's easy to play a kid unaware of a situation, its much harder to play a character that has to deal with the trauma of an event once they're free, and they've got other people watching their kid, so they can just fall apart. I know a lot of people worry about this film and what you see, but as its from the son's perspective, you don't have to worry about anything gratuitous. A Gem of a film I wish everyone would see!",

Instead we get to see all the rest of their daily existence: mundane details of passing the endless repetitive hours. What that gives us is a portrayal of survivors, not victims. Rather than concentrate on her helplessness, the film depicts the mother as a thoughtful, brave individual who is making the best she can out of an awful situation.The colour scheme and the composition of images throughout the film are beautiful and unexpectedly peaceful. The overall atmosphere is calm in a way that gives the thrilling moments a much stronger impact than they would have otherwise.After seeing this film half a dozen times I finally read the book, and I think anyone who has loved the book might be quite happy with the film adaptation.

The acting is superb from Brie and Jacob and you can't help rooting for them, when they were plotting and executing there escape but it was sad to see how the whole ordeal took its toll on Ma. The way that Jack's character was written, was perfect and for such a young boy, he really did bring realism to his character but I would have liked to have seen more scenes of them in the room, which was the most enjoyable part of the movie. It was amazing to see them make the most out of everything in that little space, including the mouse and the little birthday cake, so it wasn't surprising that it took so long for Jack to adapt to normal life. That wasn't the same case for Ma, who was locked up for 7 years and forced to have sex for food but I have to commend her for bringing up Jack under such abnormal and cruel circumstances. When she eventually came to terms with what she had been through, it was good to see her back with her little boy but I'm sure that it's something that will stick with her, for the rest of her life. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie and I'm glad that it got all of the recognition that it deserved. Original & Enjoyable!Round-Up: For such a small movie which is based in a little room around 2 characters, it's good that it made such a profit at the box office, and with Brie Larson winning an Oscar and a Golden Globe award for the \u00a0Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, it certainly went down well with audiences around the world. Personally, I think that Jacob Tremblay, equally put in a brilliant performance and it's a shame that he didn't get any awards for his amazing contribution. It was also up for an Oscar in the best picture of the year category, along with an director award and screenplay award, so it was a smash hit, in terms of the recognition that it received. The movie was directed by Irish born, Lenny Abrahamson, 49, who also brought you Adam & Paul, Garage, What Richard Did and the extremely strange movie, Frank starring Michael Fasbender. He certainly got the most out of the actors, who all put in emotional and believable performances but he did take his foot off of the gas towards the end.Budget: $13million Worldwide Gross: $35.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramatic movies starring Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridges, Wendy Crewson, Joan Allen, William H. Macy and Matt Gordon. 7/10",

It's also a film that if you're planning on going to see, you shouldn't watch any of the trailers or even read the IMDb synopsis. Just go out and see one of the best films of the year. Brie Larson, who impresses more and more each film she appears in, plays Joy, mother of Jack. Larson hides the depths of her character for a good portion of the film, which makes the emotional moments all the more powerful later on. The story of a mother and son trying to escape this 'room' and their whole emotional journey is what drives Room to greatness. The film itself has a unique structure in that it seems the film could have ended about 45 minutes before it did, but yet it keeps going. It's not that that time is wasted, but I think the flow and rhythm of the movie isn't always there. Which is why the emotional moments midway through are what stick out to me most.Jacob Tremblay absolutely kills it as Jack. At 5 years old and an extremely demanding role, it's hard not to think he deserves some awards attention as well. He pulls off every emotion that is called of him and his chemistry with Brie Larson couldn't be better. The supporting cast is really good as well, but that can get into spoiler territory so I'll stick with the two leads. I also should mention Lenny Abrahamson's directing. I loved the way he chose to unveil why exactly Jack and his mother are stuck in this room and the revelations that follow. Room as a whole isn't always as smooth as it wants to be, but the performances are among the years best, and I think the story will take you on an unexpected emotional roller coaster.+Larson+Tremblay's performance is an anomaly+Emotional journey+Meticulous directing-Second half doesn't live up to the first8.7/10",

            "content": "\"For love all love of other sights controls, And makes one little room an everywhere.\" John DonneThink of a relationship more powerful than a mother and child, and you'll be wrong. Room, directed without glamour but with tenderness\u2014many close-ups\u2014by Lenny Abrahamson and written lovingly from her book by Emma Donoghue, is the essence of such a relationship: a young woman, Joy (Brie Larson), imprisoned by a wacko for 7 years and bearing a child, Jack(Jacob Tremblay) who stays with her for 5 before they escape.The first half of the film ever so gently shows the creative power of a mother, who does not let her cloistered son want for ideas and perspective about the world they see on TV and through her eyes. Although Larson's performance is low key and she does nothing spectacular, the reason Jack is so well developed without meeting the world is because of her composed love.The second half delivers us from the almost idyllic \"room\" to the outside world, where Jack faces a reality almost blindingly real, filled with germs and a grandfather, Robert (William H. Macy), who can't talk to him because of Jack's paternity. Yet there is grandma (Joan Allen), who loves Jack and to whom Jack can say one of his first endearments beyond his mother. The power of this film is its unwillingness to accelerate his acclimation; rather like ripening fruit, that growth takes its own time.Tremblay is a discovery of an exceptional actor\u2014we should see him again soon and for his lifetime. Larson is already an accomplished actress who brings subtle intelligence to difficult roles (see her in Short Term 12). Besides the other very fine actors is the outstanding Joan Allen as Grandma Nancy-just think about the layers of reaction she must have with a daughter returning from a kidnapping and a grandson who needs the gentlest nurturing.The cast does what is needed to bring off one of the best films of the year and Oscar nominations aplenty.",

            "review_title": "Room is an emotional film, dramatic and tense, and a stand out thanks to Larson, Tremblay, Abrahamson and Donoghue",
            "content": "Room opens on Jack's world on his 5th birthday. To him, the universe is as expansive as the four walls he knows. Jack's mother known simply as Ma (Brie Larson) is driven by one mission in her life, to shield him and protect him from the true and harsh realities of their life in spite of the harrowing circumstances.I first heard about the book Room through a friend. She told me the concept and I was immediately intrigued and quickly added it to my Need to Read pile. But it had the reverse effect when I heard there was going to be a film adaptation. I was concerned how the distinct style and voice would transfer over. The wisest decision filmmakers and A24 made was to have the book's author Emma Donoghue also write the screenplay for her bestselling novel. Her faithfulness to the original source is unmatched and her expertise in expanding upon the literature for film should be a basis for all future movie adaptations of novels.For those unaware of the subject matter, Room is about a young woman being held by her kidnapper. She has been there for some time, long enough to have a five year old son named Jack. She creates a wondrous life for him in the confines of that 10\u00d710 room in an effort to protect him from the horrors of their situation so may grow to be a happy child. What we the audience see is this life and the effect Jack's curiosity has on Ma, spurring a desire to escape to the outside.The beauty of Room lies in its unique perspective and distinct mechanism through which it chooses to tell the story of its two characters, through the eyes and mind of a five year old child. In that regard, it is awe inducing. In doing that, a film about several different simultaneous traumas is bearable when in reality it should be like living in a raw nerve. And still, the harrowing emotions these characters go through is palpable, going through the screen straight through your soul. There is a constant tension and quiet terror to Room, an anxiety that leaves you restless, wriggling in your seat as you desire to help the characters. I was left nauseous, an amazing feat given how restrained the film is and how perilous it may have been in someone else's hands other than Lenny Abrahamson. He showcases the two sides of this story, inside and outside Room, with balanced finesse and an artist's eye and accomplishes a film that is both tender and terrifying without being far-fetched or jarring.You really can't talk about Room without talking about its two stars: Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Both of whom give outstanding performances with the former perhaps having the luck of earning the role of her career. With as many complex layers to the film as it has, it rarely resorts to telling and virtually relies entirely on the actors' performances and the audiences' abilities to observe minute details. The character of Ma is strong, vulnerable, traumatized, scared, desperate, hopeful, and angry, along with scores of other gentler emotions and Larson does it with a quiet grace and inherent awareness of her craft. Her commitment to the character is so honest that there is no Brie Larson.You may not be ready for the intense subject matter of Room, and that is okay, but we implore you to give it a chance. Room is one of those films that will touch your soul and feel for your fellow man.Please check out the site for Archon Cinema Reviews for full reviews of all the awards season contenders!",

            "content": "It's hard for me to fully express the staggering impression that Room left on me using only the written word, but I'll have a go at it anyway. First I'll say that it's hands down my favourite film of the year thus far, and I left the theatre with many emotions swelling in me, affected in a way the only a small group of films have been able do for me. It's a patient, mature study in psychology and a sweeping symphony of complicated emotions revolving around a terrible, tragic situation that seems like a well of hurt and pain until in climbs it's way out into a tenderly heartfelt, incredibly life affirming resolution that never dips into half assed melodrama and feels earned and appropriate. The film casts such a powerful spell that it briefly changed the concept of time for me; Upon arriving near the end, I felt as if years had actually passed for me in theatre since I embarked on the film's journey. The camera, script and actors kept me so intimately close to the characters for the duration of the piece and made me love and care for them so much that it brought me right into their timeline with an intimacy that rarely happens for me in cinema. Now on to the actors. What brave, compelling work from every single performer on screen, right down to the bit parts. Every role castes with a sharp eye for detail and reverent contemplation of who is right for what, creating a roster of heavy hitters and up and comers to be reckoned with. Brie Larson gives a beyond award worthy turn as Joy, a girl who was kidnapped at a young age and held captive by a horrible man (Sean Bridgers, displaying smouldering volatility in terrifying proportions) who impregnates her. She raises the child in the dour, tiny garden shed he keeps her in. Faced with the unthinkable task of creating a nurturing environment for her little one, she tells him that the shed is 'Room', their kingdom, and that the people he sees on their little TV are fake, imparting that they and their captor are the only real ones and there is no outside world. This reminds just how mouldable our minds are when we are small, and the film beautifully explores the psychological ramifications of how we raise our young, how nature vs. nurture comes into play in startling ways during the darkest of times, and the decisions we are forced to make on our own to ensure that our children are safe, even when things have gone beyond wrong, as they have for the poor girl. Old Nick, as she nicknames their captor, rapes her every few days, and treats the two of them like animals. Her son Jack reaches an age where escape becomes vital in his mothers eyes, and she takes her chance, orchestrating a harebrained ditch effort to break free, which is my favourite sequence of the film. It's also one of the most tension filled, seat gripping scenes I've ever seen, as the character buildup has set our personal stakes epically high, which combined with the excellent set up makes for a clammy nightmare of an escape. The director makes the fascinating choice not to use any music at all until they reach freedom, which I noted. As soon as they are out, I let out a cathartic, audible sigh of relief, as the dank hell they undeservedly spent almost a decade in gives way to a vibrant, strange new world for little Jack. The camera takes his perspective and pores over every aspect of the outside realm with the patience and curiosity it takes to place us in his psyche, a child viewing the world in its entirety and true form for the very first time, essentially a second birth, a theme which the film handles marvellously. I must speak about Jacob Tremblay, a Vancouver native who plays Jack and gives the most soul wrenching performance I've ever seen from a child actor. The levels of sheer intuition and innocent truth he infuses in his work at such a young age are just unbelievable, and he should be in the riding for Oscar gold as well. Larson and him have uncanny chemistry, the love shown in the early scenes a blooming Rose of hope that fends off the looming darkness they dwell in, which is tested by the inevitable complications they face upon entering the real world once again. Larson burst onto the scene with 21 Jump Street and Don Jon, fun but inconsequential fluff. Here she shows us that she means business, and wants to tell stories that are important, and show audiences what it means to be human through her work. I look forward to where this extraordinary girl takes us in her next cinematic journey. Joan Allen makes subtly heartbreaking work as Joy's mother, William H. Macy is briefly present as her Dad, Tom McCamus makes compassionate work of her stepdad and like I said, everyone else is superb, right down to the day players. I was crippled by emotion and raw with nerve jangling suspense after this one, exiting the theatre soaring on the high I eternally strive for in my cinematic adventures. The fact that only one theatre in Vancouver is playing this one is an affront to the universe. Get down to Tinseltown and see this one before it's gone. You'll thank me.",

During this they play uplifting music and it is absolutely tonally daft. Once they escape Room they are better off. Then, \"Ma\" feels bad about how horribly she treated her son and thus tries to kill herself, to make it all better.Also, the boy in this movie looks and sounds exactly like a girl and has long hair. So I'm expecting maybe \"Ma\" lied that it was a boy, so her kid wouldn't be a rape target. Nope. Toward the end you realize it's a boy, and you go, \"Whoa, why was I distracted by that for absolutely no reason?\"Then, they revisit Room. And Ma feels better. Because going to where you were repeated raped for seven years makes you happy. Absurd, ridiculous, fantastical film that is unintentionally insulting.",

            "content": "Right from the first scene, Lenny Abrahamson shows us so much with a simple piece of information. Ma loses a tooth, making us realise she's not seen a dentist in years; Jack falls in love with a mouse because it's real, remaining us that he's likely never seen a living, breathing creature. We ache for Jack's lost innocence but also the same for his spiritually broken mother. When the two of them scream at each other, we feel the tragedy for both of them. Eventually, of course, Jack and Ma make it out of Room and Abrahamson does a terrific job at conveying Jack's terror at a world he doesn't understand. Shots from Jacob's POV are filtered, shaky and intrusive with extreme front-lighting, making us flinch back from the screen. The choice of music creates a sense of wonder but also a sense of sadness, and the inspired choice of casting the doctor to look exactly like their captor makes Jack's fear palpable. The whole film is cleverly from Tremblacy's point of view, replicating that spectator experience Jonathan Demme created in Rachel Getting Married. It is like you are there with Jack the whole time. The escape scene has the emotional resonance that Frank Darabont brought to The Shawshank Redemption, and even some of the small spats between Tremblay and Larson are reminiscent of Rian Johnson's Looper.The film breathes on the achingly beautiful performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Larson's spirit is completely broken and we learn that early on from a rape scene where Old Nick is chatting nonchalantly as if she's a normal relationship. We see naked emotion play clearly across Larson's face as she is traumatised by a terrible interview question, scared by the knowledge that there may be no way for them to rescue her even if Jack did escape, embittered by her realisation that her friends all lived normal lives, and enraged by her father's refusal to acknowledge her son. Her performance is truly spectacular, but of no less import is Jacob Tremblay. He carries the film on his tiny shoulders and does such an incredible job in portraying Jack's emotions. A scene in which he cries about his imaginary dog will make you long to console him and then a later scene where he meets an actual dog will bring an enormous smile to your face. William H. Macy feels underused but is solidly excellent in his small role as Joy's father, whilst Joan Allen is a firm hand on the final third of the film and sets up a great Oscar-scene between herself and Larson.Emma Donoghue's screenplay is well-balanced between Jack's discovery and the events actually taking place. The character of Old Nick, whilst well-acted, is a great testament to Donoghue's writing more than anything else. There is a demented sense of morality in his words that show you he feels no remorse. That is what makes him a great villain. Donoghue's superbly written scenes make the movie what it is, everything else is a vital but supporting piece. This film would have stank with a lesser screenplay.Room is a film of small scope but grand effect. In many ways it is the Boyhood of this year. There's so much naked emotion floating around in this beautiful film that it's impossible not to be touched.",

            "content": "Watching \"Room\" is an intense experience for it's the story of a woman (ma) who fights for the survival of her child, the one source of happiness and strength in a very limited world, a place that could have killed her long ago. At first, we see the interaction between mother and Jack. Through the eyes of a very gifted director, we are able to almost feel their hearts beating, how their souls are almost like one. He depends on her completely because it's all he has known. She has insulated him from pain and created a world inside their prison. He's happy, and that sustains her. It's what makes her endure the visits of her kidnapper. She has become one with the child, but one day she realizes he will grow up, and this place will not be sufficient for either, especially for him. Jack is a bright and inquisitive young boy. He has learned to read, and he is beginning to wonder. She knows it won't take long for his soul to break because he's like her, a part of her: a sensitive soul that needs to grow and develop. There's much love here, but there's plenty of sadness and horror, too.One day, she fashions a plan to secure his freedom, and at first, it's not good enough, but with a modification, it succeeds, and this is barely the first half of the film because unlike other stories and film makers who take the easy road and simplify the dilemma or the problems of the main characters, this film has taken us to the edge of the precipice, and if you thought the life in the room was hell, things are about to really intensify.Transitioning into normalcy is not as simple as it's in the fairy tales, and just like Larson and Tremblay have already proved themselves as accomplished actors, their performances become even more exquisite in the second half of the story. We got to know them as they spoke about the world. We knew how simple their existence was, how controlled, and how dangerous it was, too. We became part of their world, and now as the doors of freedom are open, we begin a long road to adjustment. It is not easy. It might have more pain than we realized.Most people are happy to see Ma (Joy), but Jack represents many things to others. For those with a big heart, he's a bright and scared little boy who will most likely be o.k. after a while. It's the immediate family who have the toughest time since the transition is sudden and very emotional. Joy's mother tries the hardest, and it's a good thing she's around. Others experience a myriad of feelings which will affect both Jack and his mother. Her prison has changed her, and her expectations don't quite match her perceptions. It's at this moment that I was so impressed by Tremball's performance, which is better than most of this year's praised performances, adult or otherwise. He communicates his emotions through body gestures, glances, strong lonely yearning with his eyes, as he goes through the new trauma the big world has for him.It's a long and painful road, but it has a good resolution, one that feels real and universal, one that doesn't rely in long speeches, beautiful photography or any sort of overblown productions. This is as heartfelt as they come, giving us another reason to believe that we haven't forgotten to be human.",

Having seen that this was one of the highest rated films of 2015, I felt obliged to give it a watch. I was totally overwhelmed by how much of a psychological impact it had on me. Sometimes, psychological impacts are bad. Room is not one of them.Room focuses on two characters: Ma/Joy (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Very, very rarely are the two main characters of a film as good as Larson and Tremblay. One of the few movies where the main girl and the main guy are this good is Silence of the Lambs. Room is at that level.After receiving her Golden Globe, Brie Larson is nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress--a role which she WILL win for. Larson is one of those familiar faces seen in the backdrop of movies such as Trainwreck, but Room finally exposes her acting ability and lets her shine as she deserves.The one that really steals the show is young Jacob Tremblay. He is a cute little Canadian kid who gives the performance of a lifetime. I was actually rooting for the kid to win or at least be nominated for an Oscar. Being nominated for an Oscar is a victory in itself. Say Tremblay did win, imagine how angry other people would be if a prepubescent beat them. When its good, its good. Tatum O'Neal was 10 when she won. Justin Henry was Tremblay's age when he was nominated for Kramer vs Kramer.Room is a very depressing movie full of redemption that will make you cry sadness one minute then tears of joy the next. When Brie Larson's character was in her late teens, she helps a man find his dog. Unbeknownst to her, she falls prey to a kidnapper and is placed in a 10x10 foot shed and kept there for almost 10 years. She has tried multiple times to escape, but is never successful. She is raped and eventually gives birth to a baby boy called Jack. Jack has never been outside of the confinement and thinks that is all there is in the world. Joy loves her son and shields him from the horrors of the reality. Jack is a happy- go-lucky imaginative young man.A few days after Jack turns 5, Joy tells him the realities and practices an escape plan. When Jack ventures out, he is completely overwhelmed. When they both get out, the adjustments to life outside seem almost impossible. Jack has never seen outside the Room and Joy's reconciliation with her family after years in captivity seems almost impossible.Room is based on a book based on a true story of a Austrian father who kept his daughter locked in a basement dungeon for over 20 years. But the movie touches base with so much more. The very idea of kidnapping is depressing. But it also shows the importance of family. Joy and Jack love each other more than anything, and we feel it. Joan Allen and William H Macy play her parents, and we feel when they reunite. But perhaps the most important thing Room shows is how precious life is and how much there is in the world. Jack was a happy boy, living in a tiny space. His journey outside is the biggest treat of his life. And of course, the acting by all is superb.Room really hits home. It is one of the very best, emotionally-charged movies I have ever beard witness to. One of the 100 best movies of my life.4/4",

At many points in this movie, I thought scenes were gonna play out another way, and I was so glad they didn't. I also appreciated the little narration of Jack, because he always said me and you, never me and Ma, kind of addressing the viewer themselves. Also, props to Emma Donoghue for not only writing the book, but also the screenplay.",

This includes reconciling with Joy's now-divorced parents (Joan Allen, William H. Macy) and dealing with the media's victim shaming.The most frightening yet life-affirming films in years, this character-driven adaption of the novel will resonate with views, not only for its brave performances, but also for Jack's alien-like viewpoint of the world we take for granted.Ironically, the shut-ins discovered that everyone in the outside world was being held captive in a virtual prison.

            "content": "I watched ROOM because I'm a fan of Irish director Lenny Abrahamson, that's the only reason. The premise didn't really appeal to me, although I'm aware that it's based on various true stories about long-term captivity; if I'm honest I'd rather watch a documentary about one of the cases rather than this attempted fictionalised version. And, truth be told, I didn't like ROOM very much at all. The premise is okay, but there are two problems with this. The first is the running time: at two hours, ROOM is a film which is dragged out. I couldn't help but think it would have worked better as a thirty minute short. I thought the first half was bad, but once the characters actually get out, it really stalls. I know they'll struggle to adapt to society, I can work that out for myself, but I didn't need to see all those dragged-out moments and relationships with other characters.The second problem is that I hated the characters in this film, and not just the villains you're supposed to hate. Brie Larson gives a non-performance as the lead and the only thing they got right was in making her skin look manky. She's unsympathetic to me, a mother who seems to take a perverse delight in putting her child into danger over and over again, and I found her behaviour quite disgusting. With a proper actress giving a proper performance I might have liked this more. Even worse is the kid: a typically bratty American child whose overbearing and obnoxious attitude makes him no different from all the others we see in the movies. Why do American kids seem so selfish, self-obsessed, and prone to tantrums? Due to this child, the only thing ROOM did for me was to give me a headache. A pity, as Abrahamson's earlier movies ADAM AND PAUL and WHAT RICHARD DID were both very interesting, while this and FRANK have by comparison been chores to sit through.",

            "content": "We all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096 Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.The both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son.\"If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.\"The movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line 'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.It was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room.\"When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know everything.\"It was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.When a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half. Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.There were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.9/10",

            "content": "After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery.The difference between this film and a B-grade thriller or revenge film is in the level of performance achieved by the two leads, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. They are the beginning middle and end of everything good about this film. (And luckily, they are strong enough to cancel out William H. Macy, who is horribly miscast in this movie.) There is no doubt that Brie Larson will win the Oscar for Best Actress, and no doubt that she deserves it. After her picking up a Golden Globe and a SAG Award, it would be very strange to applaud anyone else. She is strong, weak, sad, elated, protective and terrified. This is just about the fullest range of emotions that a person can have, especially in under two hours on screen.Many have noted that Jacob Tremblay is equally good. Some say he is even better than Larson (and that is quite possible). Yet he did not get a nomination. This is definitely unfortunate. Whether he is on par with Leonardo DiCaprio's strength this year is hard to say, but it seems that Tremblay easily was more intense, more memorable than Matt Damon. With all due respect to Matt Damon.Not having read the book, I can make no commented on the adapted screenplay. I think the script we end up with is excellent, but if the award is for the adaptation, that might be more difficult to call.This leaves Best Director and Best Picture. I find it very unlikely that Lenny Abrahamson will win. He definitely deserves to be in this category, and he has risen relatively quickly. 2014's \"Frank\" was a quirky little film that deserved more attention, and \"Room\" is going to launch him into the A-list. His next film is rumored to be a Civil War story, and although that has been done to death (what hasn't?), many eyes will now be on it.And Best Picture? That would be quite the upset. Some people have really gotten behind the film. Richard Roeper, for example, thinks \"Room\" is one of the best films of the decade. He would love to see \"Room\" go home with the little golden man. But it would be an uphill fight. Most likely it will end up taking third or fourth place (and we are not privy to the votes).",

            "content": "A cleverly envisioned concept realised on the film canvas in a controlled but highly effective manner, Room is an ingeniously crafted, expertly narrated & superbly performed thriller that packs in a much darker story than expected, works as a beautiful ode to the bond between a mother & her child, and benefits immensely from Brie Larson's compelling performance.Room tells the story of a young mother & her 5-year old boy who live in a dilapidated room where she has fabricated a safe & happy universe for her kid in order to shield him from the gruesome reality of their current situation. But after sensing that he is now much capable of understanding things, she concocts a risky plan to escape from the confinement and return to a world her son is totally unaware of.Directed by Lenny Abrahamson and written by the author of the book this movie is adapted from, Room begins on a calm note that takes us through how this mother & son spend their daily life in the small room they live in while steadily bringing a sense of curiosity about their surroundings, which turns absolutely traumatic once their predicament is revealed. The plot is divided into two parts and both cover their isolation in different confinements.The first half is fabulously constructed, with production design team doing a commendable job in congesting the enclosed room with all the necessities that finds its use in the finished print. Cinematography encapsulates the whole picture with an overcast ambiance that aptly reflects the harrowing experience our leading lady has been through. Editing could've been improved for sequences in the second half become repetitive at times. And the background score makes its presence felt only when required.Coming to the performances, Brie Larson & Jacob Tremblay spearhead this aspect with an impressive input and share a spot-on chemistry with each other. Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers & William H. Macy do well in their supporting roles but it's Larson & Tremblay who carry this film all the way for the former delivers what's arguably her finest performance to date while the latter manages to be less irritating & more adorable as the story progresses. Plus, their bonding as mother & child is believable, heartfelt & mesmerising.However, the most striking thing about Room is the way it deals with the themes of isolation freedom & love. For the majority of its first half, we see only two people who are completely dependent on each other, haven't had the exposure of the outside world in years, and share an amazing bond despite the nearly hopeless situation they are in. The next half focuses on their difficulty in readjusting to the real world, as the mother finds herself equally isolated in the outer environment while her son is trying to grasp the unfamiliar world around him.On an overall scale, Room is a beautiful, riveting & heartbreaking story that keeps its main focus on the relationship between a mother & her child, and even in the darkest of situation it doesn't discard the elements of love & hope. The first act brilliantly paves way for what's next in store, the middle act capitalises on the solid groundwork and is simply perfect for it brims with just the right amount of tension & uncertainty, while its remaining runtime feels a bit stretched & becomes repetitive before finally concluding on a hopeful note. Rewarding in more ways than one, Room is one survival tale that's worthy of your time. Don't miss it.",

            "content": "Although less commercially driven, \"Room\" is to 2015 as \"Gone Girl\" was to 2014: An acclaimed film based on an acclaimed book adapted for the screen by the author that takes the viewer into deep, psychologically troubling places. Obviously, \"Gone Girl\" is a mystery thriller with a creepy darkness to it, while \"Room\" is more of a trauma study, but both stories also center on fictional characters at the center of a huge media story.Jack (Jacob Tremblay) lives in 'Room' with his Ma (Brie Larson). 'Room' is all Jack has ever known, but after his fifth birthday, his mom decides to try explaining to him the truth \u2014 there is a world outside of 'Room' and they need to get out. Writer Emma Donoghue gives us this story through Jack's eyes as much as possible, and director Lenny Abrahamson (\"Frank\") does an excellent job flowing back and forth between Jack's idealistic view of 'Room' and the dark, terrifying real-world circumstances of it, and he continues this balance of perspectives in the film's very different post-'Room' second half.That's where Larson comes in in a very complicated role, because there's a tangible separation between the viewer and Ma, the adult who has endured this trauma. In most cases, she would be the easier character to relate to, but this is Jack's story. Larson has to communicate an absolute roller coaster of emotions without the film focusing a ton of attention on her. She succeeds in being easy to relate to despite our lack of knowledge and insight into her character, outside of the fact that she's undergone an unfathomable trauma.Tremblay doesn't give one of those child performances for the ages, but his job as Jack is to evoke the child within all of us because he's a child narrator/main character in a story for adults. He acts with incredible authenticity, creating a connection with the audience so effortlessly.Creating a connection that puts you in the shoes of the characters is far and away what \"Room\" does best. From the performances to the two-act story structure, Abrahamson works hard to envelop you, to provide a sense of claustrophobia, and then rip it all away, leaving you with a mixture of mental and emotional poignancy. Suddenly you start looking at characters and situations with a refreshed emotional perspective.This effect compensates a bit for the lack of an especially compelling narrative in the second act (although one sequence in the film is absolutely heart-stopping). Eventually, plot sort of gives way to study and observation as we are left to sift through the emotional aftermath and watch these characters cope.\"Room\" is in the very least a showcase of several emerging talents in front of and behind the camera, all of whom have big careers ahead of them. There's a lot of great talent making great choices in this film, and though lots of other independent films are equally worthy of acclaim, it's nice to see something like \"Room\" get some major recognition.~Steven CThanks for reading!

            "content": "\"When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know everything!\"It doesn't feel right to call Lenny Abrahamson's latest film a small one because it is such a rewarding and emotional experience. Yes, it is a low key and small scaled film, but it has such a profound impact on the audience that it is far from being small. The first half of the film takes place in a very confined space, which makes the second half of the movie even more rewarding as the world around these two protagonists expands. Very few times in film has a director captured such an interesting and authentic mother and son dynamic as we find here with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's performances. Larson is guaranteed to win the Oscar for her lead role here and she fully deserves it as this mother who has endured the worst of times, but found a means of surviving through her son. She truly lives a nightmare, but Abrahamson doesn't focus on that as much as he does at making us experience their world through the young son's eyes. He is innocent and has never seen the world outside of the small room in which he unknowingly has been held captive since his birth. His mother has done everything she can to give him a happy and normal life despite the situation. Tremblay delivers an equally impressive performance, and his young age shouldn't have been a factor when it came to voting for the best performances of the year. He was outstanding and held his own in each scene he shared with Larson. The two performances are the main reason why Room has achieved such greatness. Room is based on Emma Donoghue's best selling novel about a 5 year old boy who experiences the world in the confined space of a small room. The only person he has direct contact with is his mother. His only contact with the outside world is through a small TV, but his mother has told him that the images are of other universes far from theirs. Jack also knows there is one other person that exists in their world, as some nights a visitor comes into the room from a locked door, but his mom orders him to keep away from him and stay in his wardrobe. Jack's mother has done her best to give him love and nurture, but as his curiosity begins to grow there is only so far she can go with her story. What will happen when young Jack realizes that there is actually more to the world than the small room in which they have been confined in? What follows is a deeply emotional and profound thriller that shook me to my core. Lenny Abrahamson is known for delivering original and unconventional stories. Previously to Room he had directed Michael Fassbender in Frank, a film in which the main protagonist wore a giant paper-mache mask throughout the story. Room however goes a step further delivering a thriller in a very unconventional way as we get to experience the harrowing events through the innocence of a five year old boy and the depths his mother goes through to give him a normal life. From the very opening scene we know there is nothing normal about their lifestyle, but at the same time the film avoids the typical atmosphere we are used to seeing in crime related films. I don't want to say too much about Room because the less you know about it the better, but the second half delivers even more thrills and engages the audience with even more to ponder about. Finding freedom is only have of the battle, and most of the time these films fail to focus on it, but Room manages to deliver on both ends. This is an effective and powerful film and I'm finding it incredibly hard to put into words how much it affected me.",

When I first saw it, I thought it was good, but after another watch, it doesn't hold up as much. Let me make this clear, I don't think its bad, it just isn't as effective on a second (and most likely third) viewing, and Im a person who believes a great movie can hold up on multiple viewings. Anyways lets get started.Ill start off with the positives. The performances were pretty great. Brie Larson, I can't say anything new about her since everyone has already said how great she was, and I can't disagree with that. Jacob Tremblay was surprisingly good. I say surprisingly since most child actors are known for being terrible, but he was great. Even the actors who weren't in it for very long, like William H Macy, were great. So all around great acting. The script did have its moments, it wasn't amazing, but not bad. I think its good for a first time a writing a screenplay. It had some heavy handed moments, but some subtler moments. My biggest problem is that some of the characters were somewhat clich\u00e9, but thats really it. Now for the negatives. My biggest problem is that the first third of the movie, the part that takes place in Room, drags on, a lot. It didn't bother me as much on my first watch, but on a second watch it feels like it goes on forever. I know some people found this part very emotional, but I just couldn't get into it. I started to see some of the problems on the second watch, which aren't really major problems, but really bugged me. For instance, the cinematography is kinda bad (which bugs me since i'm a cinematography buff). There were sometimes when the characters got a bit hard to feel for after the first third, I just didn't get invested anymore. Luckily after the first third is over, it does pick up a lot more and gets a lot more interesting, but the other part was just unbearable.So in conclusion, Room isn't bad, its just one of those movies that declines on repeated watch.Final Score: 6/10",

A man kidnapped a 17 years old girl by asking for help about his sick dog!!! And she bought that. Writers, please, be more convincing.The kid's character was somehow annoying. And he was talking like a thinker! But the actor played well.When a Hollywood movie wants to demonstrate a drama, all the other things are at their best. For example, they got kidnapped, but the kid has good hair and skin and Ma's family are wealthy and in good shapes, so that there will be no more drama. As another example, watch The Fault in Our Stars.There's a skylight. She has a knife. Old Nick sometimes sleeps in her bed. Why didn't she kill him and try to escape from that skylight or to destruct the walls with something at worst? There were lots of stuff including a wardrobe that she could use to climb. Even if there was no knife, she could use other stuffs. She says that she tried this before, but with not a good plan. Why not try again? There were not much to do except thinking. Even he could have a phone on himself. See, ideas are coming...Eventually she ends up with a plan and without any training she decides to operate the mission at the same night!!!So, Old Nick is a fool!!!The man the kid ran into for help didn't even make Old Nick stop. He just let him go. At least write down the truck's plate number, please.When they go to the hospital after finding the Ma, the Grandmother's reaction was funny. No sign of happiness, shock or anything related. Even the whole family's reaction at first night was weird. Their just eating their lunch.It was slow and long with not necessary characters or events.After Ma is found, movie goes into a boring predictable phase.The idea was good, but the whole product didn't convince me that a young girl and her child would react to the events like this.",

            "content": ". . . that is far easier to take allegorically than in any literal sense of story-telling. As a linear tale, ROOM is deeply flawed, building to its primary climax just 58 minutes into the 118-minute feature film, and then tacking on a pretty boring final hour (that mostly emptied my American theater by the end of the showing). However, when astute viewers realize that the main characters and locales in ROOM are standing in for other things, the flick as a whole is much easier to take. Perhaps if it was more directly titled (CANADIAN CONFESSIONS, for instance) more people in the world film market might \"get\" it. This movie is suggesting that most if not all Canadians feel trapped in a cold, squalid room or shed--sort of a back bay to the Real World tantalizingly close (but a world away) just South of their border. The ironically named Mom here, \"Joy,\" tries to convince son Jack that every wall has two sides, but Jack's not really buying it. Jack's kidnapper\\rapist father, of course, is meant to represent Uncle Sam, that is, America. And Jack himself, certainly, stands in for the Canadian film industry, infamous for being comprised of a million counterfeit Americas--amazingly including ROOM itself (C'Mon, guys, don't tell us ROOM is in \"America,\" and then show a politically-incorrect \"Apache Burger\" joint just down the block in Etobicoke, Toronto, Ontario, Canada!). When Joy, with Jack's help, escapes ROOM (for the wider world of America, allegorically speaking), she has so much regret over what she's missed during the prime of her life the past seven years she attempts suicide. Only Jack (that is, the fraudulent Canadian film industry, the country's main export now that the XL Pipeline won't be spewing nation-killing tar sands oil to the rest of the planet) is able to cheer up Joy (at least, while in some sort of confined ROOM, such as a theater or shed).",

            "content": "Saw this on BluRay at home. First-rate picture and sound.This movie can't really be commented on without the SPOILERS so anyone reading this before seeing \"Room\" might want to defer.The movie is roughly divided into two halves, the first half with the mom and son in the small 11X11 room with only a skylight, no windows, where they have been together for almost 5 years. The captor brings them food and supplies, he has sex with her regularly, with the boy in a closet. The boy still nurses, no doubt as a natural form of birth-control. We witness the boy's 5th birthday.The second half examines the trauma of someone seeing the outside world for the first time after studying about it from books, drawings and TV images. Encountering people, encountering wide open spaces. Plus the trauma of a young woman returning to her real world and family after perhaps the most trying ordeal a young girl can go through, kidnapped as a teenager, kept in a storage shed, having a baby, raising that baby to a little boy.Brie Larson is Joy, known by the little boy only as Ma. She won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Jacob Tremblay, who was probably 7 during filming, is Jack just turning 5. The book and then movie were clearly inspired by the several news stories over the recent past where something similar happened in real life. It is fiction but still a very interesting examination of how that situation might play out.",

This is storytelling at its best. The acting was gripping and emotional. I honestly can not believe this movie was so engaging. The writer and director literally thought of everything. I think the reason why this film works as well as it does is purely because of the attention to detail. You feel everything the boy does when he sees and understands things for the first time. Another thing that the movie excels in is pacing. For the past 5 or more years it seems like most movies have had pacing problems. This one works well and never rushes or bores you to death. You can write a book about why this movie is so good. It is thought provoking, entertaining and a breath of fresh air in a world full of CGI bullsh!t without plot.

            "content": "There is an old saying, \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\" I feel in terms of movies, it would translate to something like, \"Don't judge a movie by its trailer.\" After watching Lenny Abrahamson's Room, I believe even more in the validity of this statement.If there is a way to experience a film like Room, then it is only one, and that is to jump into it with a childlike curiosity. Not a single word needs to be read beforehand, nor a frame of the trailer watched. With this statement, I feel its absolutely worthless for you to read this review and for me to type this.There is nothing special in the story, yet everything is so special. Even though it wasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of the countless similar cases of women enslaved by warped men and their tales of survival. Room is about another similar story of a young mom, Joy, better known as \"Ma\" who got kidnapped when she was 17 and has been held captive for almost 7 years now in a locked shed by her captor, who uses her as a \"sex slave\". Jack, is a five year old boy born to \"Ma\" who turns into her ray of light, her hope, and her survival in the end.I'm not going to talk about the plot here, as it's quite obvious from the trailer. If it isn't, better yet, go watch the movie directly and skip the trailer all together. The trailer was something holding me back from watching this movie for the longest time, and when I did finally saw it, I realized why the director chose to reveal almost the entirety of the plot in the trailer. Because this movie is not about its story, but about the way it is presented. Its about the emotions and the feelings of the characters and the way they drag you into their world, their pain becomes your pain, their small moments of joy become your moments of happiness.Room is a harrowing thriller, but not in the traditional sense of the word. It deals with a dark subject matter and the first half of the film can be quite disturbing. Yet director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion thanks to its two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks and surprise at every turn.It is not an easy film to watch. It has the rare ability to actually make you grip the sides of your chair at particular moments. I believe any high tension scenes involving kids are sometimes deliberately put to manipulate the emotions of the audience. But Lenny actually managed to pull this off very well in this movie. The tension in the scene when Jack tries and finally manages to escape from \"Old Nick\" is so high that it get almost impossible to bear. It is perhaps a cruel coincidence that the music that places over this scene is by the great instrumental band This Will Destroy You.The film opens and ends in a 10 by 10 room (which I believe is the main character in the film, more on this later), that has no windows, a locked door, and no light other than that provided by an overhead skylight. The tone with which the movie opens, actually makes you feel like it's a Christmas movie at first! Jack running around saying good morning, to the objects which is all his world consists of; the lamp, the sinks, the plant, the refrigerator. Every inanimate object is like a dear friend to Jack. For him, they are all real. Together, they survive incomprehensibly difficult lives.\nWith as much joy as the film opens to, it drops its tone immediately as we slowly learn the bleak and grim reality of the room. It is but just a prison of torture for his Ma.By incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from realizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that anyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe that his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept it.Director Lenny Abrahamson has created one of the greatest fairy tales ever put on the screen. To try and make whatever sense she can of their harrowing situation and provide for Jack a 'normal' childhood, Ma creates a world of imagination. The TV Old Nick has stationed in a corner is their only window into another world. The skylight on the roof has become more like a painting.The second half of the film focuses more on Jack and Ma's awkward adjustment to life outside of their room which was their entire world for the past six years. There is a strong supporting cast including performances such as Joan Allen's role as Jack's loving Grandma and the ever convincing all-star William H Macy as a resistant Grandpa who is having difficulty accepting that his daughter is raising her rapist's son.There are some scenes that are so heart-warming that it will be difficult not to find yourself becoming emotionally involved. In one particular very touching and loving scene, Jack asks his Grandma to cut his long hair so that the strength that he thinks that his shoulder length hair possesses can be transferred over to his sick Ma so she can return home from the hospital. Jack who understandably is initially withdrawn from anyone other than his Ma simply tells his Grandma after she washes and cuts his hair that he loves her. This loving scene between Jack and his Grandma will stay with me forever.The best actors are the ones able to transport you into their characters' own universes, no matter how isolated from society they happen to be. Larson, Tremblay, and Joan Allen all have a tremendous range of emotional ability and are able to sell you on their story not just for two hours, but for an entire lifetime. With Room, Abrahamson goes the extra mile with his direction, and director of photography Danny Cohen keeps all eyes on Jack. The film asks us to examine how we view the world and how this viewpoint is shaped by our nurtured upbringing. The result is a breath-taking experience brought to life, one you won't soon forget.The cinematography in the room itself was surprising. I think most films would have tried for a more claustrophobic look. Instead, the dimensions in this are simply defined and unjudged. The abrupt camera pans while Jack is running from wall to wall brilliantly reflects the mindset of these trapped characters. This place is simultaneously small and their entire world; traversing the room is trivial, but also the greatest possible distance. Victory and closure is achieved by the closing scene is the brief moment perfect perspective when the room is seen from the outside.Director Lenny Abrahamson is no stranger to the strange, and with Room he's made a masterpiece of filmmaking. The entire idea of 'room,' the abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. What I loved about the book was its focus on Jack and how he adjusts to seeing this new world for the first time, and the movie never loses sight of that.The director & the writing team made sure there was not one dull moment. The addition of \"insignificant\" characters and plot twists are later realized to be so significant and influential in keeping the film alive throughout its duration. It was the little things that made this story one of the best I've seen in a long time. I experienced an entire palette of emotions all at once and was left in a deep level of curiosity and reflection. Very few films have the power to continue to influence its audience after the credits. Room is endless in the most beautiful way.Room is wise. It is a movie of extremes. In it's own magical way, the film makes staggering observations about life. What is real, what is not? What is our place in this endless universe? For Jack, Room is his entire world. Everything he knows and loves is right there. He looks up and sees the sky out of the skylight. Sometimes a dead leaf tumbles down. He questions it. Just like we do when we stare at the night sky glittering with shining stars. What lies beyond our microscopic corner of the universe? Will we ever be able to comprehend it? Can we ever be as brave as Jack?It is a bleak film, yet so full of hope. We live meaningless lives on a little blue dot. But that's not how we look at it. To us, we are the center of the universe. We are Jack. The world is our room.In one of the best child performances I can think of, young Jacob Tremblay essentially carries the movie on his tiny shoulders, especially in the second half. He gives it his strong. Together, they are heart-breaking, unforgettable, resilient and joyous.Room is timeless. It will live forever, and in its immortality, it will continue to inspire generations after we are all gone. It is one of the best films of the new millennium and after its two transcendent hours, you emerge a changed person, one who has a new appreciation for the tiny miracles of life that are usually ignored. Room is an ephemeral moment in time and I will always remember it with fondness.",

Room deserves totally to win an Oscar, even more than one. Room is a movie that I will remember for a long time, while the other one I already completely forgot about it. The story is very poignant, a rollercoaster of emotions, from hatred to hopeful to sad. I almost never cry with movies but here I have to admit I had a couple hard times containing my tears. Brie Larson deserves her Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, there's no doubt about that, but the young Jacob Tremblay was to me the big star of this movie. Even at such young age he deserved an Oscar for his performance. What a powerful piece of acting that was. For once I was blown away by an Oscar winning movie.

            "content": "Room has a fairly simple premise. Most people if they've seen the trailer know how the story goes. Woman and her son are locked in a room for several years. Eventually they escape but now have to negotiate a different version of reality. But which is realer to Jack who has only known the inside of the same 4 walls for his entire life? Will either of them be able to cope?This is a surprisingly sweet film given the darkness of what happens in it. Perhaps this is because at times our point of view is that of the 5 year old boy. His mother has concocted a fantasy world in order to protect him from their harsh reality. And so we don't feel shocked when we hear her routine rape (albeit unresistant) because it is made to be part of the normal routine of 'room', for Jack's sake.The planning and implementation of Jack's escape is the most harrowing and tense part of the film. I was shouting at the TV for him to get the hell up and run.When they escape things don't get any easier. Real life is new and frightening and the readjustment a shock to the system for both. The film then shifts from the relative simplicity of room to the much more complicated real world. The acting in the film from the two leads is great but particularly from the youngster. I know Larson wins the Oscar (and she is good) but Tremblay's performance is more affecting. I really couldn't tell if he was acting or actually just being himself. I'd recommend this to anyone with an open mind who doesn't mind something a bit different. No explosions in this one, just family drama, human relationships and human nature, all told without pretence or sugar coating.",

The story glamorizes the process of being held hostage, using a young women and her child. I am afraid why a story teller would choose such a topic, and why would he be so consumed as to make a message of this to the general population. Although it may seem cute at first seeing how a boy senses the room, and world around him; I am left with the taste that it only desensitizes others. This is not a story we should expose ourselves to like this, as a human race we might be tempted to play it down if it happens to others in real life, or make it seem to others it is not so bad to commit such an act to others.There is a responsibility here when you interact with the public. I realize art is based on trying to work through what happens to you or what you have experienced, the art part being you are trying to get others to feel and communicate with you and what you are experiencing. But if that be the case here, then a more appropriate form of art in the direction of it should have been a movie portraying the horror of being held captive, and better yet maybe even realize this is too hard a topic not just for the writer to articulate but also too hard for the general public to consume. I give this film a rating of zero, and suggest this film maker and crew take a different occupation to make money. I don't want to be a part of any of it anymore.

Sean Bridgers, Tom McCamus and Amanda Brugel also make noteworthy contributions.On the basis of this, and of that excellent, eccentric movie FRANK, it's easy to see that Lenny Abrahamson is a superb director of actors, with an interest in and an understanding of the complexity of people's relationships.",

This movie is a haunting look at the emotional & survival aspects of child abduction seen through the eyes of a young boy. That boy's name is Jack; his mother Joy was abducted as a teen and held captive for numerous years. The despicable excuse for a human being who abducted Joy impregnated her and the result was Jack. The first half of the movie is captured in the shed \"room\" where Joy & Jack are held captive and it shows them both go through their normal daily routine, and their mother to child interactions. It is very disturbing to watch, but so resounding in how their resiliency holds them through. Jack is blinded to much of the world due to his captivity, and only envisions to be reality on what he sees on television; this is brilliantly presented by screenwriter Emma Donoghue who adapted the script from her novel. The second half of \"Room\" is stored in the aspects of adjusting to the real world after Joy & Jack are able to free their captor. Director Lenny Abrahamson helms the picture with a commanding orchestration of the inner emotional layers that Joy & Jack go through their experience in captivity and adjusting; my only minor critique of \"Room\" was in the film's unrealistic ending which obviously I won't reveal because there is no room for spoilers in my reviews. Brie Larson was astounding as Joy, and this is the real Joy who will be the next Oscar winner for Best Actress. Jacob Tremblay as Jack was a revelation, and this young actor is heading straight to the real world of stardom; he is a genuine pure talent. There was also strong supporting work from Joan Allen as Joy's mother, William H. Macy as Joy's father, and Tom McCamus as the boyfriend of Joy's mom. OK, I will free you now from this review, sorry I held you captive with all those roomy puns. Just make sure you make room for \"Room\". ***** Excellent",

            "content": "I have seen some great dramas and this one rates good on my scale. I imagine the book is much better than the film because the story picks up in this one at the end of 7 years of being stuck living in one room. While references are made in slight bits about how the ordeal for Ma and Jack started, there is very little done to explain how this could have happened for so long. Granted, that is not important to the dramatic part of this film, but it does make the film a leap that might explain why -Old Nick when he does lose Jack just takes off. I really thought he might do something more desperate like go back and harm Ma before the police free her from the room. When I looked at this, the hook is the relationship between Ma and her son Jack. Brie Larson as Ma & Jacob Tremblay (Jack) are outstanding in their roles. Their relationship is key to this drama working. Ma's entire world is being kidnapped when she was 17, raped by old Nick (Sean Bridgers), having a son and then wrapping her entire life on bringing up her son in one room with Old Nick being the jailer and provider for them both. It is an out of whack world which Jack can only see through a skylight for 7 years. Ma totally protects Jack from Old Nick like a mother in the wild protects their young. She teaches him to read, and they do get exposure to the outside world via a television set. Finally, Ma uses her son to finally escape from the room. Then this film goes into the raw emotions and reactions of shock as she and Jack get exposed to the outside world.Many times, Jack is narrating the story as it goes along. Jacob Tremblay's performance is outstanding in all aspects here. Brie Larson is very good but it is the child's view which really carries this film to make the viewer care. It is the emotion which made me interested in the film. It is not a perfect film, but it does pull the viewer in.",

            "content": "I didn't watch the trailer, so I never knew what exactly was going on. So when I started watching the movie, I was genuinely surprised and shocked with the circumstances that these characters had to go through, along with how deep and emotional this movie was. The film was able to do so much skill from the director and being able to bring a heavy hitting emotional film.I really liked how the film allowed us to be in the perspective of the child and to see the world from his point of view. You can tell from where they were that something is off about the room the mom and Jack were living in; especially with how cramped and dirty it looked. However, as we see it in his perspective, we understand that since this was the only thing that he knows, we see the beauty and the enjoyment that he has in that small place. Even when they escape the room, you see everything in a new light as we are in Jack's shoes and a simple room in a hospital will look heavenly. You see everything as if you are seeing it for the first time and this is what the director was able to do very well. The cinematography and the overall structure of the scene works perfectly well, allowing us to be in his shoes and to be amazed with the boy.This is not an easy film to sit through due to the bleakness and how daunting what the mother and son had gone through, along with her parents can be. This film provides so much depth and emotion to all of the characters and I cannot help but give praise for what this film was able to accomplish. As the mom and her son was able to get out of their room, I really loved that we get to see how something like this can ruin people emotionally and that things do not end happily so soon. We usually see the family become happy and the characters who had gone through trauma will miraculously get over it. But this film doesn't do that as it dives deeper into the turmoil of what had happened. The main character is going through some emotional distraint, the boy is struggling to understand the new reality he has entered and we see that the parents of the main character also have to struggle to deal with their new reality. Despite all of this, not everything is a disaster as there were moments of enjoyment and happiness that had me tearing up. Which is another reason why I loved this movie. The film perfectly combines the darkness with the heartfelt moments well, adding more emotional element to the overall story.Every character here goes through so much and this is all due to the performances. Brie Larson was absolutely amazing as Jack's mom. She has to carry part of the film and the emotion that she was able to deliver was just great. I really liked that we get to see that even after it is over, things won't go back as they were before and you see the inner turmoil that she goes through. She did deserve every praise and awards she has received for this film based on what she brought to this movie. Also, even at a young age, Jacob Tremblay gave such a fantastic performance. Just like with Larson, he provided a lot of depth and emotion to the character as he also has to carry the film and based on his performance alone. I was able to buy that he knew nothing outside of the room he stayed in and that he is totally oblivious to the world around him. You also have great performances from Joan Allen, William H. Macy and Tom McCamus, whom I really liked, especially with what he does in the film.Even watching it a second time, the emotion and the tension that I felt, the connection I felt with these characters and crying non stop in some of the more emotional scenes really made me appreciate this film and consider this as one of my favorite films of all time.",

            "content": "Adapted by Emma Donoghue from her own novel, this Fritzl-esque tale of brutal long-term abuse may come across as the easier, Hollywoodised alternative to Markus Schleinzer's Michael, but that description misses the point. Room goes beyond the horror of physical incarceration and explores arguably the more challenging issue of the psychological incarceration that follows. It's easy for cinema to show suffering; harder to portray recovery, especially the stuttering kind.Joy (Brie Larson) and her 5-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) are imprisoned in a tiny room by an abuser known only as \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers). Jack hides in the closet when Old Nick visits Joy every night. During the day, Joy teaches Jack about the world outside Room (note the lack of definite article). There's wonderful humour and pathos in her struggles to explain reality and fantasy via images on a fuzzy old CRT TV. But for all her efforts, Joy comes to the conclusion that she must help Jack escape and see the world for himself.I'll plant a minor spoiler alert here.We have a movie of two halves. The first half takes place entirely in Room. The second follows the escape of Joy and Jack, and their efforts to recover in the brightness and busyness of the wider world. There's no trial for Old Nick. This is not a movie about the all-healing power of justice. It's about a mother and son adjusting to long-term trauma, and how it affects their relationships with the (grand)parents who've been living in their own dreadful dark for the past seven years.It may be surprising to hear that this comes from Lenny Abrahamson, who last brought us the relatively slight and irreverent Frank. While that movie was distinguished by its irony, the earnestness in Room is almost suffocating. It's not always subtle, proudly wearing its intention to devastate, making it not so much a weepie as a complete and utter bawlie, expertly tailored to tug the heartstrings. In some scenes this can be a curse but overall it's a blessing. It's no small feat to reduce an entire auditorium to a blubbering mess.As Joy's mother, shattered by her relief, Joan Allen almost steals the show with an amazingly detailed performance. In the middle is Larson, playing Joy as powerful and principled, carrying her hidden brokenness out into the real world. But the movie belongs to Tremblay. Abrahamson has drawn an astonishing performance from the youngster. For a start, the kid really acts like a kid \u2013 it's not one of those creepily precocious manchild performances that American cinema sometimes conjures. Through Jack there's a sense of genuine wonder at the world, whether it's within the confines of a sound-proofed shed, or outside where the sky goes on forever. The youngest Best Actor in Oscar history up to this point was almost 30. Just saying.I can't say I was on board with every filmmaking decision. Stephen Rennicks' soaring, Johann Johannson-style music is frequently grating, seeming to exist to make us the audience feel all fuzzy rather than having any real relationship with the narrative. And there are certain scenes which don't quite ring true. For example, the primetime TV interview \u2013 an exercise in awkwardness \u2013 is unconvincingly thoughtless. I mean, as if we need any more help sympathising with Joy. Perhaps US TV journalism really is that insensitive, but it felt like low-hanging fruit to me.There are no answers to the evil of Old Nick, nor for the suffering of those he's abused. But uncertainty and doubt are not the same as hopelessness. I felt manipulated \u2013 but that's what good movies do. In its soul-scouring search for truth, inevitably the film dips into sentimentality. But let's applaud Room for bringing to a broad audience an extremely difficult subject and making it as accessible as it can possibly be.",

            "content": "Room was written in 2010 by Emma Donoghue and through close collaboration with director Lenny Abrahamson, who had written a letter and convinced her of his understanding of the novel and its characters, it was finally brought to the big screen in 2015. An immediate difference that the medium brings is the removal of the five year old first-person perspective of Jack who views 'Room' through his young, inexperienced lens. A novel's perspective can hide and obscure certain details depending on how and from where it is told - when Richard Adams' Watership Down was adapted into animation, it lost the nightmarish quality of encountering phenomena such as trains and cars through the rabbit's eyes, and in this film we also know from the start their predicament. But what is lost in perspective is supplemented through cinematic features, primarily in the cinematography by Danny Cohen. The first half of the film, comprised solely of scenes of life within the shed known as Room, are shot with long lenses, which thrust the camera up close and personal, compressing the space between foreground and background and visualising the claustrophobia of their existence. The shallow-focus brought about by the lens is particularly essential as the camera centres clearly on Jack and Joy, seeking to maintain the illusion of infinity that he has been raised to believe. An early crucial scene aligns the camera alongside Jack as he goes through his morning routine by greeting each inhabitant of Room, the frame bouncing from closeup to closeup of fingers brushing lamp, plant, TV and toilet. Cohen returns to the same routine in the final scene but now framed as a wide shot, and the imaginary space of Room is shrunken to a mere ten by ten shed. The film retains an air of mystery because like Jack, we are made aware of the situation piece by piece. The first sighting of Uncle Nick is in the pitch darkness of night, and we can merely hear his muffled voice as we are perched next to Jack in his tiny bed. The next night he gains a little bravery, and peeks through the shutters of the wardrobe to see the vague outlines of a man in bed with his ma. In the next night he steps out, and then only finally does Abrahamson allow us a glimpse of the person who has imprisoned them inside the shed. Room shows to us the intricate and desperate lengths to which a mother will attempt to shield her child from the dangers of truth, and how Joy wields the inherent wonders and imagination of Jack to assist this process (she's even made up a story to convince him to help her scream for help through the vents each day). Through their dialogue we catch pieces of the mythos and story that she has painstakingly created to give some semblance of a life, an education, a healthy mind and body and a family for Jack, and how his leaving of the wardrobe and the loss of Nick's job demand the necessity of 'unlying' and finally confessing the truth of their life. Viewers will inevitably discover, through the trailers or through mathematical deduction, that they do make it out of Room and back into the real world, but the escape scene remains one of the best scenes of the year. Stephen Rennicks' score, which has been up until that moment comprised of whimsical tracks designed to illustrate the wondrous imagination of Jack, suddenly cues in a thudding, rhythmic beating of the bass drum, which slowly becomes one with Jack's and the audience's heartbeat and gradually rises in tempo. The open expanse of sky becomes an infinite tapestry, stretching the boundaries of the frame and beyond the comprehension of Jack's little brain. The way in which he stumbles and is almost reclaimed by the grasp of Jack, the way in which we scream at the screen as he forgets the name of his ma, and the agonising wait in which the police piece together his whispers and rush over to the shed make this sequence taut with tension. By the time of their reunion I was emotionally and physically drained. But there is also the challenge of maintaining momentum after this hair-raising escape, and the lull in its aftermath. Abrahamson wisely resists the obvious and exploitative temptation of focusing on Nick and his outcome, concerned not with punishment but rather the healing process of the victims. We see Joy, now without the immediate day-to-day struggle of survival on the inside, collapse and withdraw into the trauma of the years inside the shed, but also the regret of Jack's early years. Larson is a marvel. A question from a reporter insinuates something that she has been trying for years to deny (that she could not give Jack the life he truly deserved), and in the weariness and desperation etched in her face, she makes us believe that the stories and mythos of Room were important coping mechanisms for her as they were for Jack. In Short Term 12, Larson's past of abuse was a convenient mirroring for the youth she cared for (and resulted in cutesy scenarios like following behind at a certain length instead of actual engagement), but here she makes the guilt come from within a place deeply buried for the sake of herself and her son. Tremblay's musings occasionally become a little cloy for the subject matter (\"Meltedy Spoon\" or the \"strong\" in his Samson-length hair), but Larson reigns him and his short temper in with such patience and empathy we often forget that she is merely a teenager herself. Joy's motherhood may not be 'good enough' from outside standards, but she's ma, and they will heal and grow together.",

How relieved I was to find out it was actually about a mother and sons journey of escaping from the single, enclosed room where they were held captive in and then watching the 5 year-old 'Jack' adapt to the huge world we live in.The main structure of the film splits down into 2 parts; When they're inside 'Room' and when they've escaped. I completely felt for Brie Larsons 'Ma' having to raise a child who's only experiences in life have occurred inside 'Room'. Larsons performance was something that added so much emotional depth to her character as she manages to show the psychological damage 'Old Nick' (her kidnapper) has put her through. The 9 year old Jacob Tremblay added a believable performance from such a young actor who at times you really feel sorrow for. Then, when the riveting escape sequence is over, the film seems moved to its second half; The outside world. For me this felt like a complete shift in the films pass and tone, which I believe was a great decision as it was almost simulating how our protagonists felt when they were welcomed back into society. However, I really feel that, whilst the trailer didn't take anything away from the film for me, it would of been better not to of shown the fact that they became free of 'Room' Great performances from everyone, an deeply emotional tone, and an overall great film to watch.One of the best 2015 had to offer.",

Well, this movie completely shattered my entire belief system, to the point where I find myself without a guiding light for the future.Many better worded reviews on this site have already captured the grievances that I had with this film, but I must write mine out so that I can feel better and move on with my life...It felt like it was 3 hours long. In an unbelievable feat of cinematography, they managed to stretch time so that a 2 hour movie felt like 3. The could have condensed the film into an hour and 20 minutes and I would felt less cheated. Outside of a short plot line, *nothing* happened. And every single thread that could have been interesting to develop was cut short leaving us unsatisfied and wondering. It's a movie about nothing. There was no great insight into the human cause or suffering, no great insight into the psyche of the captor, no details on the parental breakup, no real role given to the very interesting characters of the girl's real father or her mom's new husband. The girl was a b*tch (I mean, that's forgivable given the circumstances), but outside of sympathy for her, it was not entertaining to connect with her on any level. And every single time anything got interesting in the movie the scene ended.The real life is a lot scarier and way more touching than this movie, and unless one lives in a room, turning on the news every day brings a lot more real emotion and watching a poorly constructed movie with a very minimal depth is not that touching. What can we learn from a 5 year old and his view on the world? That could be interesting to see, sure, but even here, the monologues were short and infantile (because what would you expect from a 5 year old?) Jack was no great thinker at a young age. Yes, the world is full of wonder on the outside, whether you're 5 or 85.Perhaps it was a movie for those whose view on life has gotten so complacent that they lost any sense of that wonderment and listening to an annoying 5 year old describe his first experiences in the real world outside of his room brought them to tears because of nostalgia or remembering their own childhood innocence. Clearly, I am one of the few against the world who Loved this movie, so I'll be the first to admit defeat.Now, however, I'm left to scratch my head and re-evaluate my relationship with movie reviews.",

Utilising a sparring yet effective voice over from the young boy that tells us all we need to know about how he sees the life he lives and constructing impressive visuals even in the films tight surrounds, this is Abrahamson's real calling card after two commendable early efforts and the cast also join Abrahamson in an reaching another level of success.She may have just recently won a surprise Golden Globe for her committed and believe able turn as a loving mother but Brie Larson has been carving out a noteworthy collection of films over the last few years so the true breakout of Room is young Tremblay.Tremblay delivers a deep and beyond his young years turn as Jack and it's thanks to this child actors success that Room becomes the film that's been resonating with audiences the world over. While Larson will be billed as the star here it is Tremblay that carries the film through its sometimes murky middle half and whenever he and Larson share the screen, Room is an often faultless exercise in dramatic filmmaking. It's a stunning turn and one that will likely seeing the young performer be an in demand presence in the years to come.While it arguably loses some head of steam after a breathtaking opening half in its exploration of the opportunities that lay outside the prison walls, Room is a unique and emotionally strong tale of the bond mothers and sons share and in a strange yet touching manner, a tale of what it means to be alive in this great big beautiful world we call home.4 remote control cars out of 5",

            "content": "Room couldn't be further from Lenny Abrahamson's last film Frank, a bizarre music-orientated comedy. Gone are the idiosyncrasies that made Frank wild and, for many including myself, compelling, instead we have a moving drama that earns its sentiment. The different approach is felt immediately as Abrahamson traps us with his two principle characters, Ma and Jack, in tight and sometimes oddly framed closeups. It's a somewhat clumsy execution to show the claustrophobia and intimacy Abrahamson wants to achieve as he uses Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's faces as blank canvases, but the effect is thoroughly felt, and the film's following 30 minutes remain its best. The photography decides to take a step back, but it continues to catch that raw emotion. The concept of a mother having raised her son in confinement then finally breaking free has many avenues to explore. Having not read Emma Donoghue's book, of whom also wrote the screenplay, I mostly expected a small scale -getting out of the eponymous room then reuniting and resolving itself there. Instead, the film goes further than I expected, getting Ma \u2013 also known as Joy, which is becoming a familiar character's name this year \u2013 and Jack back to her teenage home with her own mother. Then, in a way, it doesn't go far enough. But it's interesting to watch it play in its happy medium. It does rely on some key contrivances to get there, such as the kidnapper's wonky perception and ultimately not fighting hard enough when he could have, but that doesn't take away from the gripping escape sequence as the orchestra swells and squeezes tears from you whether you like it or not. Room becomes a rehabilitation story as well as a discovery story, as Joy struggles to re-adapt to home life and Jack is seeing the world he only suspected but never imagined. The detail and convincing touches in Tremblay's performance are what make it special, such as the fact that Jack has never had to deal with stairs. The film is told mostly through his perspective, but it's not held as a consistent theme though that helps it be less on the nose. The first time Jack sees outside is not the first time we see outside. But it's still cathartic as we watch him finally see real trees and real telephone poles. While many can assume that actors as young as Tremblay, who was 8 when he shot Room, are coached through their roles then we can also assume he had expert teachers. He may not carry the gravity of the film throughout, but he nails the moments that count. Brie Larson had not only shown potential but delivered the goods with 2013's Short Term 12. It's a similar environment here with devoted maternal instincts but this time it's pushed to the brink of her skills as an actress. She's drenched in this exasperation that speaks to years of exhaustion. In the tone of her primal performance, she paints a full rich portrait of Joy's whole life from her carefree teen years to her brutal capture by Old Nick when she was 17, to every little story and lesson she's told Jack. Joy's constantly revising the way she raises Jack and while there's bumps in the road, it's a complete picture of motherhood. She balances resilience and vulnerability, hope and dejection with a fine tooth comb. Most times she commands the screen and offers one of the year's best performances. It's a film about the harsh realities of growing up, operating for both of the main characters, and it's a very sensitive and emotionally potent portrayal. Joan Allen, as Joy's mother, is heartfelt and shows unconditional love in a wonderfully nuanced way, whereas William H. Macy, Joy's father, is regretfully underused but doing the 'in over his head' thing Macy does best. From one domestic space to another, it's easy to wish it would spread its wings instead of remaining so confined. It's clear that recovery is difficult but there was a lot more ground Room could have covered. It loses a lot of steam after the escape, but at the very least it never loses my investment in the characters. It's not working on a defined timeline, or with hardly a goal in mind, so it leaves itself a little elusive. I was either ready to jump 10 years to see how they're doing or I accepted that it would simply end at a good enough point. Story problems aside, it's focusing on emotion, and while it may step into melodrama, it's always potent. It's hard to pinpoint Abrahamson's voice as a filmmaker exactly, and he might be a little overzealous with how he adapts his style so far, but he's certainly got the right edge.8/10",

No spoiler, it's in the description the movie) the story becomes unbalanced and drags on as a lifetime drama. Nothing about the investigation. Just many scenes of getting back into the real life and mundane grievances. The narration by a boy who is far too old to be a 5 year old is about as irritating as it can get, but I can cut some slack with American child labor regulations. The story is rather flat, in dialogue, in relationships, in story line. Horrible what happened to victims like kampusch but that fact just isn't enough to make this particular one Oscar material. It certainly doesn't compensate for poor directing and flat writing. Not impressed.",

            "content": "I am giving 'Room' 10 stars, this film is truly amazing and a touching presentation of Emma Donoghue's book 'Room'. They have really stuck to the book which is what I love about this adaptation, there are just so many words to describe this film it is just so hard to put them all together in one review because Room is spectacular and heart wrenching. This film really gives you a point of view from the other side of the story, it is not all about the thriller aspects of how 'Ma' (Brie Larson) has been held captive for years by a horrible man she refers to as 'Old Nick' who in retrospect is a kidnapper and an atrocious man. It looks at the characters sides of the story especially her son Jack who she has whilst captive in Room. He looks at life from a completely different view to his Ma and everybody else in the world that does not exist in Jack's mind. To Jack it is just him and his Ma, he sees no negativity in their situation which is truly beautiful. Not only do I love how they have shown a different perspective of life in Room they have shown the reality of life outside of Room and how the characters cope and react differently, it is unforgettable and truly moving. I just could not fault this remarkable masterpiece.I absolutely adore how this is so carefully written, it is a sensitive subject that is rarely spoken about and I have never looked at these types of stories from the victim's point of view. It is heart breaking to sit and watch this film but at the same time it gives you an insight of the unfortunate people in the world who have to live like this and sometimes their stories do not turn out as well as Ma and Jack's stories, which is a really painful subject and will always have an effect on the world. I would definitely recommend this film to anybody; no matter what genre you are interested in you just have to see this film. It is so brilliant that I would not even know what genre to class it as, there are so many special moments in the film that just cannot be created again they are incredibly unique and the actors play these characters perfectly you just could not have picked actors more perfect then the ones that brought these characters to life.I was left laughing, crying and just smiling throughout all the different memorable scenes in Room. There was not a single moment that I was disinterested; I was left moved and unable to take my eyes of the screen, I really did not want this film to end. But they have made a fantastic adaptation of Room that just cannot be faulted and will be a forever classic that will never grow old. The uniqueness of this film is outstanding and just will not be able to be duplicated.",

Jack not being able to walk upstairs since he had never done it before in Room is one example.This movie made me feel grateful about my life because you get to see Jack and his mother happy after all.

            "content": "Emma Donoghue's Room (2010) is sublime alchemy, switching from heart wrenching horror to endearing tenderness with an air of innocence permeating throughout. It is a book that is so profoundly good that immediately when I was done I realized that even though the world is still the same everything feels different; I have changed. Narratives like this don't come very often for me. I love the book so much that I started and maintained a book thread in an internet forum (http://www.xtremeplace.com/yabbse/index.php? topic=99456.0). In prose, the harrowing subject matter is pushed to the background by using a very clever narrative device - the entire story is told from the perspective of a five- year-old child. We become privy to his thoughts, his emotions and his voice of innocence. I had my doubts whether this narrative stance could be replicated on film without losing its emotional impact. From the get-go I realized my fears are totally unfounded. Lenny Abrahamson has directed Emma Donoghue's adapted screenplay magnificently and it is buoyed by two stellar performances by Brie Larson and newcomer, Jacob Tremblay. How the film manages to avoid all the usual trappings of exploitation and emotionally manipulativeness is a case of absolute marvel. Room deftly dances around these big holes of hysterics and histrionics, but yet still manages to make the horrendous situations feel authentic and heart-hitting. From top to bottom the cast shines, especially with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Larson has turned in a career defining performance and I think she is the one to beat at the Oscars. Such humanity and honesty, and through her character arc we are graced with what a mother would do for a child. She essentially creates a cocoon to nurture her child and to protect him from the cruel reality. Newcomer Jacob Tremblay is also phenomenal and he carried the film's weight on his little shoulders. He would of course say it is his long hair that gave him \"strong\". This is not a dutiful and obedient boy that does everything his Ma says. They do quarrel and have shout-fests but their diamond-hard bond is the beating heart of the story. I do feel the movie is largely spoiler free but I don't think I should say more on what happens after their escape from Room. The second half is essentially their journey back into the world and I am thankful that the movie doesn't whitewash everything into a stroll towards a golden sunset. Just like reading the book, I came out of the cinema feeling everything has changed, and I am grateful for the story of an unconquerable love between a mother and her child in harrowing circumstances. This is the first great film I have seen this year and I feel it is a profound cinematic and emotional experience to have lived in Room for two hours.

Towards the middle of the film, I find every cell in me wants the woman's plan to succeed. I held my breath, I welled up and I sincerely hope there would be some humanity left in the world. Another very emotional scene is the brief TV interview. The interviewer seems so caring and empathic, but asks very biased questions which leads to another emotional zenith. This film depicts the horror of captivity, which I am sure doesn't even match the true abuse and desperation that the victims face.I hope the victims can recover and lead fulfilling lives.",

            "content": "Based on the book by Emma Donoghue, from what I heard about this film I thought it may have a similar vibe to Oldboy (without the violence), I knew a little about the concept, and it became part of Awards Season, it turned out to be even better than anything I could have expected, from Oscar nominated director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank). Basically twenty-four- year-old Joy \"Ma\" Newsome (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Brie Larson) and her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in a squalid shed they call \"Room\", sharing a bed, toilet, bathtub, television and a rudimentary kitchen, the only window is a skylight. A man called Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), Jack's father, abducted Joy seven years ago and has held her and Jack captive ever since, he routinely rapes her while Jack sleeps in the wardrobe, Joy is overcome sometimes with depression and suffers malnutrition, but tries to stay optimistic for her son. Having been in Room since he was born, Jack has been allowed by Joy to believe that everything he sees on television, from the rest of the world, is make believe, and that only Room and its contents are \"real\". This changes however when Old Nick tells Joy he has lost his job and threatens he may not be able to afford future supplies, so Joy decides to finally tell Jack the truth, there really is an outside world, everything on television is real, he reacts dramatically with disbelief and a lack of understanding. To stand a chance of getting out of Room, Joy trains Jack to fake a fever, hoping Old Nick will have no choice but to take him to hospital, but instead he says he return and bring antibiotics. Joy has Jack play dead so that she can wrap him in a carpet, in the hope that Old Nick will remove him from Room, he falls for this trick and places a wrapped up Jack in the back of his pickup truck, driving through a residential area, Jack is stunned by exposure to the outside world, but jumps from the truck and attracts the attention of a passer-by. Old Nick tries to take Jack back, but gets away before he can be questioned or caught, the police question a startled Jack about what has happened to him, he slowly explains about where he and his mother are being held, they soon identify the location of the shed and Joy is also rescued, they are both taken to a hospital. In the hospital Joy is reunited with her parents, father Robert (William H. Macy) and mother Nancy (Joan Allen), who she learns have divorced, Nancy is now married to new husband Leo (Tom McCamus), Jack is still overwhelmed by all the new things and people approaching him. Joy and Jack return to her childhood home where Nancy and Leo live, Robert cannot accept Jack and leaves, Jack initially struggles to adapt to life in the larger world outside of Room, speaking only to his mother about his feelings, even expressing a desire to return to Room. Joy struggles with anger and depression about the seven years taken from her and her son, she argues with her mother, and during a television interview about what happened reacts angrily, she finally has a breakdown and attempts suicide, but survives and is taken to hospital. With his mother recovering, Jack slowly shows signs of adapting and settling into his new life, bonding with his grandmother, Leo and his dog, playing with toys he has been given, and he meets and plays with a boy his age, he also finally allows his grandmother to cut his long hair, his \"strong\", so he can send it to his mother in hospital. Joy returns home and thanks Jack for saving his life again, he asks her if he can see Room again one last time, she agrees to his request and they visit room, escorted by a police officer, Jack feels that with the door open and light coming in that is has shrunk, Joy assures him it is the same place, Jack and Joy says his final goodbyes to Room, and they leave to continue life in the bigger world. Also starring Cas Anvar as Dr. Mittal, Matt Gordon as Doug, Amanda Brugel as Officer Parker and Joe Pingue as Officer Grabowski. Larson gives a compelling and career-minting performance as the emotionally drained mother who has had life stolen by a terrible situation and longs to escape, but this film almost completely belongs to newcomer Tremblay, who (with his long hair could be mistaken for a girl for a long while) is exceptional as the youngster whose whole life revolves around the small space he lives in until being gobsmacked by the realities of life in the bigger world, the mother-son bond is highly believable. The novel was inspired by the case of Josef Fritzl, the Austrian man who incarcerated his daughter in a basement for 24 years and systematically raped and impregnated her, but obviously the crime element is lessened. The incarceration and claustrophobia works fantastically for the dark first half, then when the break into the outside occurs it really delves into the complexities of the real world, this is absolutely from the point of view of the innocent child, nightmarish and emotional, but ultimately a thrilling, uplifting and well executed story, a must see drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay for Emma Donoghue, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

            "content": "Today's movie shares a big trait with True Grit that was debated when the awards season came out; with who the main character was. True Grit's marketing pushed that Jeff Bridges was the main actor of the movie even though the story really shows that Haliee Steinfeld was the focus. Once the awards season came, she was given plenty of supporting actress accolades even though most people felt that she was more in the reigns of best actress. Room will probably have this same issue with one of it's actors.I think the reason the studios tend to put great child performers into separate categories away from the big A-listers that are nominated for other movies because their afraid that they either won't have a chance at winning or if they do win, no one would take the award seriously. Children need to be taken seriously.Today's movie Room may be a mother/son bonding story, but it's really about the psychology that goes through their minds when after years of being together, are going on a journey that separates them physically and emotionally. It's about two people growing up despite being different generations as Room portrays. Joy Newsome (played by Brie Larson) is a young woman that has been living in a shed converted into a small home for the past seven years by her kidnapper she calls \"Old Nick\" (played by Sean Bridgers). In the time since, she gave birth to a child (fathered by Old Nick) that she named Jack. In the years growing up there, Joy tried as hard as she could to be a good mother and protect Jack from the situation and raise him like any other child. Now turning five, Jack (played by Jacob Tremblay) only sees the Room they live in as the world and that anything outside is \"outer space\".Joy finds out that \"Old Nick\" has lost his job and is low on money, which will mean fewer resources for food and heat. It is now that she tells Jack about the outside world (the only thing they had for information or entertainment was television that was mostly tuned onto Dora the Explorer for Jack) and that they need to get out. She knows that the only way out is if \"Old Nick\" realizes that Jack has to get out due to illness. The first half of the movie is planning on the escape and the second half is about what happens after wood.I can barley say anything about Room as most of the movie contains major spoilers. All I can say is that even though this is a thriller, I count this as a coming of age story. A really good one as well considering that we have both a young woman and a little boy who know little about the world around them. Brie Larson does phenomenal as Joy who has the hard task of both remaining forever frightened of \"Old Nick\" and being a proper mother.Speaking of which, Jacob Tremblay may be the frontrunner for most supporting actor awards as his performance is better then a lot of child actors. How they got a kid this young to pull off the necessary emotions that few adult can properly show off? I don't know, but this is defiantly his movie. Is perception on the world and the adults around him remind us why we were frightened by the rest of the world as children. When our parents aren't around, we might as well be on an alien planet, stepping around strange sounds and sights. This child made me realize how one can see the world differently at a different age.I'll give this ten imaginary dogs out of ten. Room is an emotional, but rewarding coming of age story that may be hard to sit through the first half. But once the second half starts, you'll realize how strong bonds are between parents and children. You'll realize that in order to move one, part of your old self has to go away. Room is one of the 2015's best.",

First, is the importance of a good script with a strong story that many should be able to relate to & when this essential element has its basis in fact, it's already well ahead. Emma Donoghue's script supplies all this. Follow with a director who has a personal passion to bring this particular story to life & Irish born (of Eastern Jewish parentage) Lenny Abrahamson was the right choice. If Performers have a large role in convincing us to care and feel for the subjects they play - this film certainly has those! Next comes someone to create images that will draw us into each situation and with Award nominee Cinematographer Danny Cohen ('The Kings Speech') this is almost perfectly achieved. I say almost, as the 11 x 11ft set he was given to capture a large degree of his shots in would have been extremely limiting - this no doubt created obstacles i'm sure everyone would have preferred to do without (referring to a couple of clumsy but minor, hand help shots). A sympathetic producer who wants the best result caps a good production off. Stephen Rennick's sensitive Music Score and carefully detailed Editing lifts this work even higher. Multi-talented Brie Larson certainly earned her well deserved Oscar as 'Ma', with young Jacob Tremblay surprisingly impressive as son Jack. All cast members work hard to make this harrowing film unfold in a naturalistic manner. When generally mindless 'action' movies win massive amounts of Awards and spend obscene amounts of money achieving this \u2013 it's refreshing when a life affirming gem like 'Room' comes along to add balance to the industry. With the task of pleasing everybody being just about impossible - some won't be able to relate to 'Room's' highly claustrophobic, personal situations so, the hard and fast action aficionados won't understand the accolades. Others will be astounded and may even come back for a second visit. If being technical, I'm perhaps a little perplexed as how the 'garden shed' with its skylight kept the screams out of neighbor's ear range and the captors in for so long but, perhaps this demented captor had rebuilt the internals with heavily padded materials - I understand the original situation this story is based on took place in a European cellar (not sure why this was altered). Maybe the captor was also overly naive in not checking the body in the carpet (?). Other than these plot details , 'Room' is not to be missed by appreciators of discerning films.",

            "content": "\"Room\" is certainly one of the most compelling and interesting drama movies of this year the plot and story is just so different and complex. The film is a harrowing tale of a young boy named Jack(beautiful work from Jacob Tremblay)who along with his Ma(Brie Larson)is trapped and confined for many years in an enclosed room with a 10-by-10-foot space to live in. Thru it all Ma coaches and cares for Jack along the way by reading him stories and singing him songs and putting him to bed with warm love and food. It just goes to show what it's like and how a person must make it when their life is a shelter away from the norm and society. Then all of a sudden the second half of the film takes a spin a twist as when the two escape an outside world is discovered by the little boy and mom. As the grandparents of Jack are found the loving yet tough accepting Nancy(Joan Allen)and Robert(William H. Macy). Most revealing and different is how little Jack sees an open world of sight and sound as it's an adjustment it's clearly not what he was use to with Ma. Overall this film proves that each and everyone leads their own little sheltered life in their own way and world. And true when one ventures out a new world of sight and sound and mind is discovered as each world and room for that matter is of different sight and it gives off a different feel for everyone. \"Room\" is one drama that sets free the character and viewer to discovery of new sight and to a new look of life.",

            "content": "If you're itching to see a masterpiece in film, then go out and watch Room. It's the perfect example of filmmaking that doesn't dumb itself down for its audience. And at the same time, it isn't highbrow or overly complicated. Room starts out in a padded room with a young boy, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), and his mother, Joy (Brie Larson), lying in a bed together. We're not sure why they're there at first. But eventually we figure things out. Joy was abducted 7 years prior and Jack is her son by her captor. Joy is a normal mother. She loves her son. She get's annoyed by him from time to time, just as a normal mother would. Everything is not hunky-dory, but the two of them are content there with each other. Or at least Jack is. You can sense, in Joy's eyes, that she is hiding pain. Jack doesn't know of anything that's happened. He knows of no world beyond those walls.It's not until about 25 minutes in where we realize what's going on. But we don't mind because the journey there is just as riveting. The plot is revealed very slowly, as the filmmakers let us figure things out on our own, and do well not to spell things out for us. They don't assume the audience is stupid--at least those who are willing to commit to the storytelling. Nothing is ever stated, but we have a grasp on background and character dynamics due to brilliant exposition. Room is slow, I admit, but consistent. Director, Lenny Abrahamson knows what he's doing at all times. Besides getting fantastic performances from his leads, I'm thrilled with every choice he makes. From what he includes to what he omits, he understands what's necessary for us to get as organic of an experience possible. This movie could very well be depressing, but it intentionally never stays in one place long enough to do so.Larson is something to behold in this film. She's pretty much gives as flawless of a performance that anyone possibly can. It's perhaps the best female performance I've ever seen. And Tremblay, for a child, is extremely believable the whole way through. The film is ultimately about moving on. And that process can be long and drawn out and never- ending. There are times while watching this film when we ask ourselves how it will end. Not because we want it to, but because we're not even sure how any ending would be enough. But then we find out we're not looking for an ending at all, but a beginning.Twizard Rating: 100",

            "content": "How did this film slip through my watch list? I just saw it yesterday.Imagine yourself as a five year old child never having seen the outside world. What would it be like growing up in a single room of about 10 X 10 feet with your mother as your only companion?That room is where about half this movie takes place. Jack was born there after his mother became pregnant from her abusive kidnapper. You would think that the confined space would induce claustrophobia. It does, but that's only one of the visceral emotions you'll experience watching this remarkable film.Seven years into her captivity, their story comes to painful life as we discover how she lovingly nurtures Jack, the precocious boy with the heart of a poet. The jeopardy is palatable. Excruciating. And it carries us through to the inevitable escape with enough nail-biting to match the scariest thriller.Although most of \"Room\" takes place in a tiny space, Jack's perception and description of it turns it into a magical universe that is rich, colourful and exciting. You are propelled by the child's imagination through an intense experience that will leave you breathless.The screenplay is astonishing. It's what dreams are made of for a writer like myself. The childish words coming from Jack, whether interacting with Ma or in voice-over narration, are, as I said, poetry. The only way to experience it is by listening to it. A young Jacob Tremblay brings Jack to vivid life with his portrayal. Brie Larson (winning an Oscar for Best Performance) exposes a character who is tortured and totally focused on protecting her baby.There's not enough room in this review to capture everything this movie is. You simply have to see it for yourself. As always, I was skeptical, just waiting for the moment when I'd switch to something else. That did not happen. The two hours I spent watching it went by in a flash.",

            "content": "Imagine if your entire world was a single room. Adorning this room is a heater, a small table, a bed, a closet and a toilet sans a seat. Also in the room is a carpet, a sink, a tub and a small toaster oven. The only thing connecting you to the outside world is a skylight, an old TV and a crestfallen mother with memories of the world behind your four walls. Everything you know is in that room. How would you develop? How would you understand; and what would happen if you left your world in search of a better one?This is the story brought to luminous life in the film Room adapted from Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name. Told largely from the perspective of five-year-old Jack (Tremblay), the young boy comes to grip with the realities of the outside world after narrowly escaping imprisonment and saving his mother (Larson) from seven years of isolation and sexual torture. Their tormentor is a man described simply as Old Nick (Bridgers) a man always sporting heavy working boots, thinly framed glasses and a look of indignation. Every night, Old Nick trundles into the keycoded room and defiles his prisoner while Jack tries to sleep in the closet. After turning five however, his mother tells him of the outside world and plans an escape.Allegory of the Cave by Jan Saenredam The first act concerns the realities of \"room\" and all it's little joys that Jack seems to savor. While always having a demeanor of consternation, his mother gives him the best version of gentleness she can afford, reading to him nightly and constructing arts and crafts out of broken egg shells. Once we leave room, the story floods the audience with a vortex of raw emotion initiated by Jack's first real look at blue sky and tree branches. We feel as Jack does; fright, confusion, elation, concern, in short a complete sense of awe.The movie only gets more captivating as it goes on and I dare not spoil anymore sufficed to say that the acting on the part of Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay is nothing short of revelatory. Fully immersed in challenging roles, the two create a relationship so visceral and rewarding that it can bring any unsuspecting adult to tears. Every moment of joy and sadness is thoughtfully executed; which if put in lesser hands would come off as manipulative. Larson recently won a Golden Globe for her portrayal and will likely get at least an Oscar nomination come January 14. My sincere hope is that Tremblay likewise gets a nod complimenting the story arc of a mother strengthening her son and visa versa.While not based on a true story per se, the novel Room was inspired by a true case of abuse and imprisonment dubbed the Fritzl Case. The mere fact that such things can happen in this reality stands as an impeachment of humanity and all the disgusting things we do to each other. Yet despite the tragedies that unfold before us and the toils we might have faced, this small piece of fiction makes a case for hope and perseverance in the face of hardship.",

Once they had escaped, with barely half the running time elapsed, all the tension went out of the film. I was sitting there thinking - okay, so what is going to happen to fill the next fifty minutes? The answer? Pretty much nothing, sadly.Don't get me wrong, the final scene was very moving, but I still got the feeling that the movie peaked during the escape and then just sort of ambled around for the remainder. which is a great shame, because I was really enjoying it up until that point, not least the stunning turn from the young actor playing the kid.I think I understand what the film was trying to achieve in being structured the way that it was, it just didn't work for me personally. I'm actually quite a fan of non-linear plots, and maybe that's something that would have enabled the director to keep building the tension to the very end whilst still showing us the aftermath of the ordeal.",

It can take you to \"A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far, Far Away\", or it can take you to visit the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" or, sometimes - if you are very lucky - it will take you to ROOM.Directed by Lenny Abrahamson, ROOM tells the story of \"Ma\" (Brie Larson) who, as the movie begins, has been held hostage for 7 years in a windowless 10x10 enclosure. She has dubbed this enclosure \"ROOM\" for the benefit of her 5 year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who is held imprisoned with her. The first half of the movie takes place entirely in this enclosure where Ma has helped create a world for Jack. It is very much Ma taking care of Jack. The second half of the movie takes place \"afterward\" (I will not spoil anything here).Ms. Larson, in her Oscar nominated role, is fantastic as Ma, imbuing her character with the right combination of strength and weakness of one imprisoned for so long, but you can see the love she has for her son and that she will do anything to protect him. While the first half of the movie is worthy of her Oscar nomination (and Oscar frontrunner status), it is the realistic affects to Ma (who we find out is named, ironically, Joy) during \"afterwards\" that really cement the role. We don't see a \"superwoman\" here, we see a real person dealing with a traumatic event and it's aftermath. She is ably assisted by strong turns by Joan Allen and William H. Macy as her parents, as well as Tom McCamus as \"Leo\".The surprise for me is how strong a performance 9 year old Jacob Tremblay gave as 5 year old Jack. While Larson, rightfully so, is receiving critical acclaim, I am surprised that Tremblay isn't receiving more. Larson is the rock of the first half of the movie, but it is Tremblay who holds the 2nd half of the movie together. Jack's warm and loving soul radiates throughout the back half and keeps things together when it looks like things are falling apart.Director Abrahamson gives a strong hand to the proceedings, having us focus on just what we need to focus on without it becoming too depressing, maudlin or sappy. He knows when to pull in and when to pull out and has you rooting for these characters from the start.This movie is not for everyone and I am sure that more than 1 person will have a tough time making it all the way through it (I had a strong desire to go home and hug my family afterward, much to my son's chagrin). I was warmed by the strong love of mother and son and how it takes a subject that could have been a downer and has made it heartwarming and life affirming.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",

            "content": "Within the first 10 minutes of this film, I was curious as to where the writer was going to take the story. Do the mother and son break out? Do they just accept their fate and live there for eternity? Does one of them die? Well, the writers did a great job of surprising me as it seems as if they have never heard of the three act structure.The production value, I digress, was very well done. Good direction, excellent performances, cinematography, etc. For a small budget, it was well done. That's about all I have to say I liked about this film.Back to the story... I'm not going to spoil it here, but as I was saying before the film doesn't follow a three act structure at all. Some films can get away with this, namely some cheesy 80's comedies, but these are comedies, not dramas.In room, there's no call to action, journey to overcome a goal, obstacles in the way of that goal, point of no return, etc. There are subplots that have their own beats, but not a main story.There is sort of a climax at one part. It happens literally half way through the movie, and then the rest of the movie is the resolution, for a whole hour in which you'll be checking the time hoping to god the movie will be over soon. If you have ever thought at the end of a movie, once a character has overcome their weaknesses and achieved their goals, what happens after the film fades to black? The character ought to go on with life, where he or she will face more challenges to come. This film almost seems like it has a fourth act that merely explores this idea. It delves way too far into the aftermath of the events that happen only an hour into the film.There is also a slush of subplots that don't know where they want to weave themselves into the story as they aimlessly fly throughout the film. Here's the beef to my arguments (SPOILERS):First, as I've mentioned before, the story is horribly structured. It starts with about 40 minutes of repetitive introduction, followed by a 20 minute long second act in which they break out, and an hour long resolution in which Jack and his mother deal with the real world.Some may say that it does follow the three act structure and that I'm just missing the real story, which is Jack growing into a world outside of Room. Well here's the problem; if The introduction had included the escape, and then the second act focused on Jack struggling to fit into the regular world until he overcomes his fears, then I'd say it's appropriate to say the story is focused on a boy being exposed to a world he's never seen before. This isn't the case however, as Jack isn't exposed to the real world until the second half of the movie, and this story line is barely glossed over in my opinion.In this movie it seems you have three plots: -Ma's growth and struggle as a kidnapped mother -Jack's coming of age into the world outside of room -The escape from Room.The film tries to put all of these plots into one piece, not focusing on one in particular, which failed to engage me in the story at all. There are also plenty of loose ends and unexplored characters that I could go into, but I'd rather not.Overall, this film reminds me of Prisoners and Sicario. It's a story that has potential, but seems like a first draft of a script. There are too many subplots and not a core story that it focuses on, nor is there a proper three act structure to draw the audience in. The performances and production value is great, but other than that, I thought it was a waste of my time.",

This is a poignant, harrowing film that offers a detailed account of the human condition. The essentials of human existence - like emotionality - are wholly dissected in this film. Room certainly succeeds in (believably) doing so and thereby avoids falling into a domain of superficiality where other films depicting difficult subject matter have. Seen through the eyes of an innocent child, we are reminded of the saying ignorance is bliss.Larson was absolutely phenomenal in the lead role, as supported by her deserved Academy Award for Best Actress. She convincingly immersed herself into the psyche of a woman with palpable psychological damage and did so in such an unpretentious and altruistic manner. The tenderness and motherly solicitude she displayed felt extremely genuine and almost made you forget it was a film you were experiencing. In what was a profoundly intricate character portrayal, she really delivered on this one.This was a film that heavily depended on its acting. There was no flashy CGI, no dazzling special effects - just a true-to-life story, credibly depicted. The central performances were superlative and the chemistry Larson and Tremblay showed together was remarkable. Both incredibly humanistic and exercising a compelling charm that is truly touching and hard to not feel for as you watch them evolve.

            "content": "(Rating: \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: Two wonderful performances make the film even more impressive.GRADE: A-Depending on your point of view, the world can be big and overwhelming or small and intimate. For the characters in Lenny Abrahamson's riveting film, Room, their personal experience is the sum total of a 11' x 11' area. Ma and Jack have been held captive for many years. Although Ma knows the real-life details of their lives, Jack has been spared that harsh reality. Their day-to-day survival activities include storytelling time, games, and gazing out at the piece of sky through the shed's skylight. This claustrophobic house is Jack's world.For most of Room, we are caught in the tiny confines of their room and the film makes this space an important character in itself. The director effectively uses Jack's voice-over narration and numerous close-ups of the everyday objects surrounding them to show their desperation in an isolated corner of the world. As they cling to some shred of hope and sanity, the psychological battle between captor and prisoners rages on. Jack lives in a world of naivet\u00e9 and innocence. Ma tries to protect her son while still having the inner strength to carry on and shield him the awful truth.But it is the love story between mother and child that resonates and makes this film so special. The screenplay by Emma Donoghue, based on her own novel, is concise and literate. She wisely allows the visuals to tell the narrative and focuses instead on the real-life dialog between the two main characters to establish their bond and hardships.Foremost are the magnificent performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay. Their chemistry together is remarkable. Ms. Larson delivers a strong and impassioned performance. Her role runs the range of emotions and the actress uses the quieter moments to convey the angst and anger that manifests within this courageous woman. Mr. Tremblay also is in full control as he fully registers the heart-breaking moments so naturally. He inhabits his part with such confidence and authority, delineating his character's moodiness and sense of wonder with such skill. Most adult actors should envy the intrinsic talent of this 6-year old. (That this young actor was somehow excluded for an Academy Award is enough evidence to question the voting process of the Academy.) Strong work is given by Joan Allen, William H. Macy, and Sean Bridgers in supporting roles as well.The film does have some issues with time passages that remain murky and more clarity is still needed with some of the minor characters who seem more like plot devices than real characters. But those details are minor complaints. Room is excellent, a film that emotionally captivates its audience with its gripping story, sensitive direction, and top-notch performances.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",

One of the officers patiently questions the child and finally frees Joy from the shed. The reunion scene between Joy and Jack is one of my favorites. The sheer relief on Joy's face as she realizes that they are finally free is priceless.\nThe story then continues with Joy trying to reintegrate in society and with Jack adjusting to an immense new world. This is a highly unusual situation, considering that most kids get to know the world as they grow up. It is hard for Jack to comprehend his environment, fact which makes him wish to return to the shed.\nThe film realistically portrays Joy's exhaustion and sadness about Jack's reactions but also never gives the impression that all hope is lost.\nRoom is definitely one of the most beautiful movies I have seen recently.",

We get multiple instances of dramatic moments being so dramatic we get the piercing sounds instead of trusting the actors and the dialogue.The musical score is also totally lazy and uninspired. It has that same sad little piano melody that blends together in this kind of film as if the audience were Pavlov dogs.I say this and yet as I said earlier I have to recommend it. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are excellent in the film. They both bring more sincerity to the material than the director or screenwriter do. These performances are brave. Tremblay in particular is asked to go further than many child actors do. I wish though that the movie was more honest and straight forward. I think Brie Larson and Tremblay would be even better. They are talented enough. Their performances aren't in need of dishonest and manipulative punctuation in search of a hollow catharsis. 'Room' should be seen for it's excellent acting and as a reminder of the challenges storytelling presents. The kind of dark subject matter explored in 'Room' should linger more with a viewer. You shouldn't walk out with the rays of optimism from a monologue that makes it all better. An audience deserves more, the victims of violence deserve more.",

If you do watch the trailer that's fine, but if you wish to avoid knowing what the \"second half\" of this film is like then you should avoid it.That being said, in order to avoid commenting on the second half I am referring to, I'll try to talk about issues explored in the film rather than plot content.The basic premise is that a woman and her son live in a shed, which they refer to as simply \"Room,\" years after the woman's abduction by an older man. Their names are Joy and Jack, and they are very codependent.What I did not expect from this film is that it deals with the theme of perception of reality, and how much the environment has an impact on this perception. Jack has only lived in Room his whole life and knows nothing outside of this life. To maintain his innocence, Joy has had to tell stories to build a certain perspective on reality for her son. One of the best scenes of the film is when Joy decides it is better for Jack to know the truth about the world and reality, and Jack's reaction is heartbreaking and played brilliantly by Jacob Tremblay.I want to say more, but I feel like I would give too much away if I did. In a nutshell, this film deals with issues I never would have imagined to be tackled in a film with this premise. I recommend you see this film unless you find the premise disturbing, though the film is never violent or graphic.3.5/4.0",

Of course, it is difficult to act if one did not actually live it through and it is quite understandable.The only performance that is worth of nominations, from my point of view, is the one of a little boy.

            "content": "Of all the films coming out last year, I would definitely have to say that Room was one of my most anticipated releases and one of the films I was most looking forward to. Having now seen the film, I must say that it did not disappoint. I was mentioning in my review for Brooklyn about how we are getting a lot of really good female driven films that have great female performances and great perspectives from a woman's point of view and I would certainly add Room to that list as well. Room, is not based upon a true story, but the events in the film were most likely taken out of the newspaper headlines because we have had a lot of these cases surface and come to light within the past couple of years. The film does an excellent job of conveying what being trapped in a small space would have been like and while the film is quite disturbing at times and leaves you with an unsettled feeling it is also emotionally very powerful and also has moments of great beauty and humanity thrown into the film giving it a wonderful balance of both tragedy, loss and despair as well as hope and love and knowing that with time that everything will turn out okay. The two lead performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are amazing and two of the best performances of this past year, or really any year lately. Larson has proved what a talented actress she is with films like Short Term 12 and now Room will definitely be the film she will receive a much deserved Oscar for. I was really in disbelief though that Jacob Tremblay did not receive an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Jack. Here is a young kid who delivered one of the best child performances I think I have ever seen in a film and he proved himself totally capable of handling and delivering a performance in what is an emotionally really intense film and one that I think even people more than half, or triple his age would find difficulty in doing, but he makes his performance so natural and believable and we believe every second what he is thinking and going through and with his total fascination with the world and the things around him. This was a great oversight for the Academy by not nominating him because it was certainly one of the top performances of last year and worthy of an award. I am so glad that Brie Larson was nominated though and her performance is so great that I know she will be walking away with Oscar gold. Here is a character who goes through the unthinkable and yet while she still struggles during and after her circumstances, we see what a brave and independent woman this is and how for all the years in captivity she put her young son, Jack and his needs in front of her own and always looking after his best was just amazing and completely heart warming to watch. As others have said this film truly captures the deep and personal relationship between a mother and son and the endless love that goes with it. Larson's character is loving and caring for Jack, but we also see how she is strong and even later in the film while dealing with depression and trauma for what she went through we are completely with her every step of the way and again this is such a beautifully natural and realistic performance and one that must have been extremely emotionally draining and challenging to play each and every day, but Larson pulls it off flawlessly and is totally deserving of what is sure to be her first of many Oscars. The film would unfortunately maybe be too difficult for some to watch because of the heavy emotional content and the subject matter of the film, but I would challenge any serious film goers to give the film a chance anyways because it is such a wonderful cinematic experience and one that will surely move you and challenge you in many ways. Often throughout the film as I mentioned earlier, there is also scenes of love, family and maybe even in a sense coming to terms with yourself and the events of your life and these such moments did bring tears to my eyes and deeply moved me. This is a film where we certainly see that there are a lot of bad people in the world who do terrible things to one another, but the film does not let us lose hope because we are also confronted and experience the love between this mother and son and a relationship that does get challenged, but never broken and the strength that family and the right people in your life can have. This is not a film about despair, or the evils of mankind and yet while it does deal with that, this is overall a film about hope and overcoming your past and struggles and finding your peace in life even after a terrible trauma which is further helped by your loved ones. The film is certainly realistic and gritty at times, but all the more natural and real because of it and this is one of the most emotional and best cinematic experiences I have had of last year because we identify with these characters every step of the way and we feel hope and compassion for them and in many ways see that the outside world and things in it are truly beautiful and a wonder to behold and that personal growth and healing can happen to us all no matter what our circumstances.",

            "content": "\"Room\" starts in the middle of a horrifying tale of abduction with little back story and little history. And that works wonder. It places us right in the middle of the claustrophobia of the two main characters, Joy and her son Jack. The first third of the film made me almost as uncomfortable as I was during the whole masterpiece film, \"The Act of Killing.\" There are so many times when this film could have gone awry, sappy and melodramatic. In fact, the sappiest thing about the film was the music, being far too uplifting and loud for the themes in the movie. The framing of each shot in the first-third of the movie augments the feeling of being trapped. The shots are as beautiful as they are terrifying. The acting of the two main characters is spot on, especially the five-year-old boy Jake, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson plays the complicated role of Joy, the mother, who goes through untold agony. We aren't told what happens in detail; we see it on her face, in her body.There were so many times this film could have gone for cheap sentimentality; they could have gone for the easy reconciliation and happy ending, and it didn't. Put one in the win column for small, well writing, well directed and well acted cinema that doesn't involve stunts or explosions. Rating: Pay Full Price\"Room\" is excellent. While it didn't play for cheap emotion and the issues it addresses are horrifying, it could have used more detail regarding the aftermath of events for the mother. The son's issues were dealt with well if not completely. The framing of the shots? Fantastic! The music? Terrible. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscars nominations. Peace, Tex Shelters",

It is the discovery of the world through his eyes that raise the movie above harsh drama.The writer gets the credit for the good and perhaps the blame for some things that were so heavy handed red flags nearly popped off the screen. Perhaps it was better developed in the book but the William H. Macy character and issue felt rushed and distracting. The Dr. handing out sleeping pills when sleeping wasn't an issue was a jolting red flag. The news reporter interview was so far in bad taste to be realistic. Both mom and attorney sat by to set up another unlikely scene. The male characters were all written as insensitive clods. That includes the male cop. Even the male dog while kind sure wasn't much to look at.Ignore the flaws and admire the performances. The movie may be hard for some to take as it deals with abuse issues and aftermath.

            "content": "Which of the following situations would you find the most traumatic? (1) You are kidnapped, removed from everyone and everything you know and love, never knowing if you will ever be free again. (2) You are born into a captivity in which you know hardly anything about what most people take for granted as \"the world\" and then are suddenly thrust into that world with almost no understanding of what you're seeing, what to do or how to behave. Stop. Think about it. Either situation would be a horribly upsetting and disorienting to experience. We see both situations play out in the fictional drama \"Room\" (R, 1:58). Although the film is not based on any specific real-life story, it does have a strong basis in reality \u2013 in the cases that we occasionally see on the news or in a true-crime TV drama. A young woman is taken captive by a monstrous person who holds her for years against her will. In some cases, innocent children are born into such situations, knowing nothing but confinement, with only a mother's love to depend on.Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) was seventeen when a man who claimed that he needed help with a sick dog abducted Joy and imprisoned her in the garden shed in his back yard. The man (Sean Bridgers), whose name Joy didn't know (simply referring to him as \"Old Nick\") kept Joy as a sex slave, bringing her just enough food and other essentials to survive. He brought her supplies once a week, but visited her for sex every night. Eventually, Old Nick's ongoing rape of Joy produced a baby boy. Joy named him Jack. Jack only knows Joy as \"Ma\". He has never even seen Old Nick. At a set time every night, Joy sends Jack to sleep on the floor of the wardrobe in the corner of the room. Old Nick punches a code into the door's electronic lock. He enters. He does \"his business\" and leaves. Jack is now free to climb into bed with Ma.The days belong to Joy and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). He's now five years old. He has never had a haircut, never seen a doctor and never left Room. The wardrobe where he sleeps when Old Nick comes calling, Ma's bed, a toilet, bathtub, sink, toaster oven, small table and old television is all Jack has ever known. As far as he knows, the world he sees on TV is all made up and the small skylight in the roof of the shed is outer space. To Jack, there simply is nothing else but Room, the mysterious voice of Old Nick, and Ma. For her part, Joy does all she can for Jack. She \"cooks\" the meager rations that Old Nick brings and she breastfeeds Jack. She's his teacher, his playmate, his protector and, basically the only person who exists.As hard as Joy works to make a life for her and Jack in Room, their situation is starting to change, calling their long-term survival into question. Joy has tried to escape before, but it becomes clear to her that she has to try again. Maybe Jack is now old enough to help \u2013 if she can get him to understand her plan. It isn't a spoiler to reveal that Joy's escape plan works, because that is what the second half of this movie is about. Joy is reunited with her mother (Joan Allen) and father (William H. Macy), who are now divorced. Joy and Jack move in with her mother and her mother's boyfriend (Tom McCamus) who do their best to help Joy and Jack adjust to their newfound freedom, with all that means for each of them.These adjustments aren't be easy. Jack has to learn\u0085 everything that you and I take for granted about our world. Joy has to try to get past the emotional trauma of seven years of captivity and having raised a son in that environment. Then, of course, there are certain legal questions that a family lawyer is now there to handle\u0085 and the media circus that naturally accompanies such stories in real life. This film doesn't dwell on the legal or public aspects of this case, but those elements are there in the background, even while this dramatically changed family focuses on finding a way to forge fresh bonds and move forward in the most difficult of situations.\"Room\" is as remarkable as the story it portrays. Basing the film on the 2010 novel by Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay) frees the plot to explore a wide variety of issues without being confined to the details of one specific real-life case. Telling the story through Jack's eyes (complete with a judicious use of well-written narration by the boy) helps us to understand the wide ranging implications of such an experience for Jack, his mother and his newfound family. Director Lenny Abrahamson takes full advantage of these story-telling opportunities with his use of camera angles and the markedly different tone in the movie's very different halves. Topping it all off are exceptionally affecting performances by all the main characters \u2013 especially Larson and Tremblay. Although the pacing of the film sometimes lags unnecessarily, there is no criticizing this film's emotional impact and the importance of the lessons that it teaches its audience. I have no room to give this film anything less than an \"A\".",

But we see none of this. The film opens with the two main characters, Jack (the five-year-old boy brilliantly played by Jacob Tremblay) and his mother (played by the talented Brie Larson) going about their everyday life in the room \u2013 sleeping, eating, exercising, playing, reading\u0085 etc. with occasional visits from the mysterious Old Nick. Upon Jack's fifth birthday, the mother decides that it is about time to get them both out of the room.I won't go into the details of the extremely bold scheme and the mother-son heart-wrenching argument scenes, but they finally do it and they make it out of their prison \u2013 a crucial moment that, you might think, will bring about the two characters' happily ever after. However, Room is not a happily ever after story; it is a story about what happens after the happy ending \u2013 a story about transitions. The film is divided exactly into two halves: inside and outside the room, two places that are equally confining for Jack and his mother. In the first part of the film when we are trapped inside with the two, we could feel the sense of confinement in mother's eyes but Jack's giggles and jumping around make us feel that the small room is as big as a playground. When we leave the room \u2013 an overwhelming moment for both of them \u2013 the room's concrete walls are replaced by psychological confinement materialized through personal disappointments and people's judgments.The two main characters are tied by blood but differ drastically in the way they perceive the universe. For the mother, the room is the strange unfamiliar grounds; whereas for Jack, the room is the only universe he has ever known and the outside world is the unfamiliar, intimidating terrain. Despite the change of perspective, the bond mother and Jack share helps them become stronger, reach out to each other and overcome the difficulty of transition. Regardless of the melodramatic undertones, the story shows that it doesn't matter on which side of the wall you're standing because the only walls there are are the ones we build around ourselves and around other people, and that love is the only power that can overcome those walls.The natural chemistry between Larson and Tremblay is phenomenal.

            "content": "Room is a dive into the head of a child's perspective, who witnesses the world for the first time. Emma Donoghue comes with a tale that is so beautifully wrapped under the outlook of Jack who believes space is confined. It is in a way reflective of how we have been living in today's world, and how possibilities gawk at us from a distance, and we are never prepared to challenge ourselves into stepping out.Ma: You're gonna love it.Jack: What?Ma: The world.The plot of Room unfurls like a beautiful flower. You are thrown into the mundane sphere of daily chores, and then suddenly you are told what's happening and what seems to be the disconnect. It is hurled at you at once, amidst the regularity and it is hard to handle just like Jack's head refuses to accept it. But then again that is the truth. Jack, the smart kid he is, accepts it and tries to help his Ma out, whilst challenging himself to a bizarre world that he has never encountered before.What are quite thoughtful are Jack's diegetic thoughts which go in the background often telling you how he feels about the world. They put your insight in the garbage. Seeing the beauty of the world through a learning phase is indeed really soothing. That's where the screenplay goes really brilliant. His words are so powerful and yet so innocent that he will compel you to go broody.Jacob Tremblay is exceptional as Jack who turns five and knows everything. Brie Larson plays an outstanding Ma, and fiddles with the right emotions. So is Joan Allen as Nancy, Jack's grandma who epitomes sanity and tries to put sense and normalcy in the inane.SPOILERS: Film's most touching moment is when Jack reunites with his mother and the music bashes your nerves to dust. It makes you happy and sad at the same time. But that's only the half of it. The rest of the movie progresses with how he tries to gel up with the asynchronous. Lenny attempts to manifest how Jack sees his surrounding through his sheepish eyes once he is out in the open. You can almost feel yourself feeling sorry for Jack and Ma. It would make you want to hug him right up and teach him the ways of the world.Room concludes at an arresting juncture where Jack wishes to see the room he used to live in. He finds it smaller now that he has seen more of the world, and bids every object he used to adore so much in that room farewell, as his ultimate closure. It is really so pensive that you can't shake it off. It was like he was in a womb till he aged five.If you are a drama freak, you can't simply miss this one. Brilliantly thought of and well written. Thank you Emma!",

Her son Jack & her have been held captive in a tiny room for a couple of years. For little Jack, that room is his whole world. He has lived there, all his life. Ma tells Jack that, \"Room\" as they call it, is all there is in the world. Anything outside the room, is space & aliens. She tells him this fantasy tale, to hide the truth about Old Nick. Somehow, Jack & Ma get the opportunity to escape & miraculously, they do. Now, Jack has to face the real world in its entirety. Ma has to cope with the world after a long gap & help Jack get accustomed to his new life. Room is a flawless & mind blowing film! It is a one of a kind experience. Director Lenny Abrahamson has masterfully adapted Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name. One of the highlights of this movie is that, everything is shown & explained to the viewer, from Jack's perspective. From the camera angles, to the adorable narration, we see the events of the film unfold through Jack's eyes. Apart from being an emotional & feel-good drama, Room also has a few thrilling moments. These will have you on the edge of your seat. At its core though, this movie is about the infinite love that a mother & her child share. The performances are the main highlight of the film. Brie Larson has given the best performance of her career, as Ma. Larson has proved her versatility by acting in a variety of movies, ranging from adult comedies like 21 Jump Street(2012), to indie dramas like Room. Brie Larson truly deserves all the appreciation & accolades coming her way. Jacob Tremblay is the standout performer, as Jack. At a tender age, Tremblay effortlessly showcases a variety of emotions as Jack. Jacob Tremblay has a bright future in Hollywood. Sean Bridgers is great as Old Nick. Joan Allen is brilliant as Nancy. William H. Macy is awesome as Robert. Tom McCamus is excellent as Leo. The supporting cast did a superb job, as well. Room is a must watch. It is not just the best movie of the year but also, one of the best movies of all time. An instant classic!",

            "content": "One of the best movies depicting a strong parent-child relationship, after the recent 'Babadook'. Those who watched that can find plenty of irony when they get to compare the plot of this one with Jennifer Kent's masterwork.Though I had seen trailers to this one going in, along with having an idea of all of the plot turns, the narration still managed to hold me, and most of the well behaved audience, in a vise-like grip, all the way through. Irony is used more than once within this plot itself, to tie everything up quite badly, and though I'm a fan of keeping things ambiguous, this approach does have its merits, especially as used by the director here.The performances (Brie Larson deserves the Oscar - her performance in 'Short term 12' was overlooked, as does Jacob Tremblay, ably supported by Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H Macy, in a rare performance, in all of 2 scenes, but hey....) are all top notch, and the minimalist approach in each of the movie's technical departments holds up against tough scrutiny, including the use of its score (fantastic, unique...), works to perfection, and greatly helps in putting us in the middle of the protagonists' lives, front-and- center.The best movie I've seen all year this year, in spite of some annoying, and unnecessary censorship. It was strange to note the use of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, though many mainstream and Indie filmmakers, considering the scope of the subject matter, may have gone in for the narrower 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Not complaining. I very much prefer this aspect-ratio, and it works fabulously, especially when one plot device has an important aspect of depicting an evolving perspective of the outside world, that's beautifully realized, while also being subtle.Also appreciate the numerous opportunities not taken by the makers to make this a sloppy melodrama, our a powerful drama that plays to the galleries, while preying on base emotions.Not to be missed. I might go enjoy it once more.",

            "content": "Now, I don't think it was bad, thought it was ehh , I just wish the filmmaker had done more. Never while in Room did I get the sense of claustrophobia to emphasize just how tiny the area that the characters were in was (which really makes the fact that they actually filmed in that tiny area pretty pointless), or hopelessness, and imprisonment, to highlight the unbelievable amount of time that they've been there; Instead, we are just told this information. In addition, due to not really getting what situation these characters were in, made it really underwhelming when they made their rather fortunate escape; there was no feeling of awe at this, seemingly, new and strange environment (like in Oldboy, The Hurt Locker,and The Descent), and it's clear with the slow-mo, and shots of Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) face that was what they were attempting.Aside from what I'd wish they'd done, there were also some questionable and unfitting music choices throughout, and two scenes: during and immediately following the escape. The two scenes came off as awkward, unrealistic, and contrived; and the acting and characters in these scenes were both bad and annoying.Besides the already mentioned, the acting in this film was good, with Brie Larson being the standout. And though I thought Jacob Tremblay was good, for a kid, I didn't think his performance was amazing or award worthy, like I had heard previous to watching Room. Just because his performance was better than most child performances doesn't mean it's great.I appreciated the way they decided to take the story, and I liked the way Brie's character's struggles were handled, and to be honest, that's it.With all this pessimism, it may be hard to believe that I didn't hate this film, but I didn't; I just thought it was meh. Nothing special, and I won't be seeing it again, though it is watchable.",

            "content": "Room is a pretty good movie. It is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue who also penned the film script. It is the story of a woman who was locked up and sexually abused for 7 years inside a 10 ft. by 10 ft. shed.It is also the story of her 5-year-old son who was born and raised inside the 'room' with no knowledge of the outside world. He assumes that the small television set they watch every day is just 'make believe'.The story is sometimes difficult to watch as we see mother and son play out their daily lives in this room, where the male perpetrator appears at night to have his way with mom while little Jack sleeps in the closet. They are both totally under the control of this evil, sexual pervert and there seems no hope for them.I confess that I was worried that the entire movie would take place in the 'room', as after about 45 minutes I was starting to become tired of watching such unspeakable misery. Fortunately, my concerns were unfounded. Jack manages to escape by pretending he is dead. The cops find Jack and glean enough information from him to work out where the shed is located. The rest, as they say, is history.The final part of the film is devoted to the trials and traumas of Jack and his mom adapting to the real world at the family home of his grandparents.The film handles this sensitively and realistically, although I would certainly take issue with the shocking and invasive questioning by a TV reporter, even though Mom was being paid for the interview. Even in today's sensationalist America, where just about anything goes, an interview like this would never be allowed to happen to such a distressed and traumatised woman \u2013 money or no money.I don't know why, but I could tell that the film was adapted from a book. Some of the events \u2013 such as Jack rolling himself up in a carpet probably works well in a book but less well on screen. It didn't ring true. Maybe I'm nit-picking, as generally speaking, the film works well and holds your attention throughout.Jacob Tremblay, as Jack, acts out of his skin and Brie Larson, as the mother, is also excellent and does everything that could be expected of her in the acting department. But for this reviewer, she wasn't the best actress amongst those nominated this year for an Oscar, even though she won. But there again\u0085I'm probably biased.",

            "review_title": "Make Space for Room!",
            "content": "A fantastic feat in directorial achievement from Lenny Abrahamson, Room gives the audience a front row seat to the power of love and unrelenting devotion. Revealing the commanding force of love between a mother and her son when they are the only two people in their world, Room is an incredible tribute to the essence of human existence. The first half of the movie is filmed in the garden shed prison shared by the captives, proving Lenny Abrahamson to be a phenomenal director more than capable of creating a powerful film with little space. If you see no other Best Picture Nominee from this year's Academy Awards, please see Room; for it is truly the most captivating piece of art up for this year's top prize.The audience is immediately thrust into the gripping story of Ma, who used to be known as Joy (Brie Larson), and her son Jack (Jacob Trembley) prisoners in a reinforced garden shed attempting to \"celebrate\" Jack's fifth Birthday. We soon learn that Joy was kidnapped 7 years before by a man, only known as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) who is holding them hostage. Repeatedly raped, Joy gave birth to a son since her kidnapping. Jack and Ma, as he calls Joy, are never allowed to leave the shed, called Room, and Jack has not seen the outside world in his entire life. With as active an imagination as any 5 year old boy, Ma tells Jack stories to keep him entertained and distracted from the grim reality in which they live; a reality where pants are treats only delivered one day a week. Reaching the end of her psychological rope, Ma devises a plan to save herself and Jack, allow her to return to life in the outside world, and give Jack a proper childhood among family and friends, trees, wind, and even bugs. Escaping Room proves to be more daunting than happy, as Joy has lived in constructed isolation for so long that her adjustment to the outside is difficult. Jack, having almost no immune system, must make an extremely careful entry into the world; a world that he has only been introduced to in his 5 years of life to an old television with a blurry picture. Seeing everything the world has to offer proves overwhelming for Jack and he seeks out Ma more than ever. Rediscovering and creating human identity, rejoining family and friends and a normal life, and creating a life for Jack illustrate the journey that one woman will traverse to give everything possible to her little boy.Brie Larson is one of the year's standouts this year in the role of the embattled, psychologically exhausted Ma. She eloquently displays the desperate yearning for life outside the garden shed, yet shows her complacency of not seeing a way out in extraordinary fashion. The child actor, Jacob Tremblay was also a force as the boy whose entire life has been lived in four walls. He excels when he shows the wonder of a 5 year old out in the world that he has never had the opportunity to experience. The two work together so well, and develop a compassionate chemistry on screen, creating a truly powerful experience for the audience. Watching the two only have each other, desperate for things among everyday life that seem so inconsequential was an incredible experience.Identity and love are the cornerstones explored in Room. Joy lost her identity once she was kidnapped; she is then tasked with creating a new one for herself and her son in order to simply be able to live through their shared experience as captives. Jack, on the other hand, is robbed of developing his own identity apart from his mother. Once out of room, he is exposed to parts of the world he thought didn't truly exist, and being in contact with all of life's wonders in such a short amount of time was magical, yet overwhelming for the young boy. The depths of love explored in this movie are unparalleled by any other film in 2015. Constantly having her body violated, Joy became pregnant by her captor, eventually delivering the baby inside the garden shed. This all happens off-screen, but is a difficult concept for the viewer. Able to look past the harrowing truth behind Jack's conception, Joy loves him and would stop at nothing to protect him. Likewise, Ma is the only person Jack has ever known, his autonomy is solely based within her, and he is so devoted to his mother that he keeps a tooth of hers that fell out in his mouth so he always has a piece of her. Compelling is the story of how deep love lives within human beings, despite the circumstances we encounter.Without question, Room is the standout as far as art pieces recognized by the Academy for their top prize this year. (I am still upset that they missed out on recognizing Carol) I sincerely hope that Room pulls out a dark horse victory for the highest honor this year. If nothing else, I hope that Todd Haynes wins a statuette for Best Director, as the range he gained from the two actors inside four walls is unmatched in skill and product. A gripping tale of love and identity among on-going psychological hell, Room is uncontested in delivering its message. One can only cross their fingers that The Academy gets this one right.",

As it did occur to me that it is quite strange that a man had kidnapped a minor and proceeded to keep her alive in his shed, eventually impregnating her and continue to pay for all expenses of her and this child. All in all, despise the odd premises it is an intriguing story on coping with the outside world. For \"Ma\", someone who has experienced it but has been detached from it for several years and \"Jack\",one who has never been a part of it. I do believe that Jacob Tremblay's portrayal of the boy Jack was quite well done, I was sold at his bewilderment of seeing the outside world and the impacts that has been inflicting on him after being exposed to the false belief that the room is everything. It's got this whole idea of new things versus the old familiar things and the idea of the fear of new experiences. It also deals with the problem of post traumatic stress on Brie Larson's \"Ma\" and her trying to cope with the world despite her experiences of potential rape and having been kidnapped for such a long time. It is clear that there is a disconnect which brings viewers to the next theme of a sense of belonging and fitting in.

Brie larsons's character is trying to care for her son with little resources and in a horrible situation. She raises him as best she can in the situation provided. It isn't often that a rich Hollywood actor or actress can really encapsulate what it's like to be that desperate or that caring, but Brie Larson absolutely kills it. She is so human In her portrayal. I was honestly surprised she isn't a parent now because she really encapsulates what it's like. She definitely deserved that Oscar. The kid who plays jack was very good as well, as he convincingly portrayed someone with no knowledge of the outside world. This movie is subtle and there's are no real action shots or adrenaline rushes besides the escape scene in the middle, but it's such a rewarding experience. You really care about these characters so much. And in the end when they say \" goodbye room\" it makes you so happy, because you went on the journey with them, and your so glad they've moved on.

Room is about a child and his mother who were locked in a Room, they manage to get out but finds it tough to conform with the real World outside the Room. Let's move to the plus points, the major factor and the most convenient thing about this film is the Child Jack. His innocence, his perception about the world inside the room and the outside world makes a clean and coherent sense. Imagine yourself as a 5 years old kid who hasn't got out of a Room since birth, how would you react when you see the Real world? How would you adjust your imagination about the thing called 'The World'? How would you survive? This all makes it very intelligent scenerio and almost nobody can find any contradictions in this part at least. The second best thing about the film is partition of the narrative in two parts, one inside the Room and other one about outside the room. Jacob Trembley and Brie Larson gave beautiful and natural performances. Almost 90% screentime is focused on them so they got every variety to try. Director Lenny Abrahamson has definitely made a very good film and his direction is one of the major reason behind it. I liked the way he used background score and camera while showing the child's perspective. Especially when he sees the outside for the first time, the camera shoots from inside the rolled mattress and trees pass by. Now coming to the minuses, there are many inconvenient things about the story in the first half. In the second half, it tries to explore depression for no valid reason. I mean the girl has just got out, she must be happy and curious about Future but instead she's drown in the memories of the horrible past. The depressing thoery doesn't work entirely hence film loses the main motive. Overall, A Very Film but IMDb Top 250 seems unmeritable.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

She was found there in 2009 and like, it is just so upsetting to think we have these evil b*stards lurking around and wanting to ruin people's lives in so many ways. The pedophile in this movie Old Nick, definitely reminds me of Philip Garrido and Ma as Jaycee Dugard except she birthed a son and not two daughters.

As a five-year-old who has spent their whole existence captive, his actions, emotional outbursts and general demeanour feel misguided and nonsensical. It is not that the role is portrayed badly - I just think the character wasn't written brilliantly.The standout scene (where Jack lies in the back of a truck looking at the sky) is excellent, beautifully shot with some quality music to boot. From that point on, however, I felt a lack of investment in the story's developments, confused by some of the reactions of the parents and the media surrounding the story.I wanted to enjoy Room, but had it made clear it me early on that that wasn't really part of the deal (and I am fine with that).

To be honest the screenplay seems like unreal,7 years in room, childbirth in room,no escape before,no information about old Nick and there many things we can ask questions about, But! the cast,director and whole crew made it REAL LIFE TOUCHING DRAMA! and it was getting real and real time by time. i also thought that life after escaping would make me angry but nah! it surprised me again! the integrate to new world for 7 yrs old boy who didn't know anything about it - and the integrate for Ma to 'old world' was exactly how it supposed to be with few illness and whole stuff!So the Movie Was Surely best Drama in this and past Year!",

            "content": "A fantastic mix of genre, this film is a psychological thriller, a horror film, a drama, a character study and all of this it is doing at the same time seamlessly in what is one of the darkest films of the year.This story is incredible and opens up naturally to an endless list of themes that get explored and there is so much that can be done with this core material that it would be practically impossible to include it all, that's why Room succeeds. It understands what it is and doesn't try to reach too far out of its zone in what would certainly result overbearing. By putting the focus solely on the mother/son relationship it doesn't feel like the film is missing anything.I have been telling everyone since I saw her in 21 Jump Street in 2012 that Brie Larson would be going a long way, this is proof of that and whilst I still reckon Rooney Mara or Kate Winslet to be the best actresses of the year, she sticks to a close third. There were times, especially in the first half, where everything, every emotional beat fell on her performance and she managed to rip your heart away. The way in which she portrays a mother's worst fear is harrowing. Yet, her fictional son, steals the show away from her. Look it is easy to get too excited about a child performance just because it is good, but this is not what's happening here. Jacob Tremblay has possibly upstaged my favorite young performance ever (Tye Sheridan in \"Mud\") and I didn't think that possible. He really made a character come to life, there were no filters, it was a true performance that made him disappear from the screen.I think that has also to be credited with Abrahamson fantastic work. This is one of those few films where you really feel the director's presence and it doesn't get in the way of the film. He really had a strong vision for this and you see how powerfully it makes the transition to the screen. You feel the confidence and the inspiration.I had a fantastic experience with the film, whilst it doesn't manage to achieve what other sad films like, the example I always use, \"Requiem for A Dream\", in other words to be depressing but at the same time give you that rush of adrenaline and experience you kind of want to relive, it is still a deep and insightful drama.",

She is constantly trying to escape her prison while her son, 5 year old Jack (Tremblay) is always wondering about the outside world.Directed by Lenny Abrahamson known for the quirky yet witty comedy Frank (2013). Room is a truly inspirational story and is always heartwarming from start to finish.Brie Larson (Trainwreck) has always been threatening to outbreak and in this film she does exactly that, however nine year old Jacob Tremblay's performance is beyond awe-inspiring, normally a child actor is only ever as good as their director but that is not the case in this feelgood and at points heartbreaking picture.This film literally open's a new door in the art of film making and will have you gripped from start to finish, this film will make you smile or make you cry, it will grab you by the heart and it will never let go. This is a film that is painful to watch I completely 100% recommend it, in my opinion this one of the best films of the year and it is a must see, even though it is very painful to watch at some points I think this is a total masterpiece 10/10. Just perfect.*Best performance by an actress in a leading role Room, 2015",

And after that , the movie have a bored long sequence of sentimentalism and a mom's decisions about his son and her . Pretty good anyway but the second part is really meaningless and make me want to sleep really . The only interesting part in the second part is the moment where they go back again in the room and see another perception of the kid . I enjoyed also the narration from the kid and his perspective all along the movie and give another perspective even if he is only a child. Nice movie anyway but the second part can be erased really .

            "content": "Sometimes a person's world can be as small as a stifling room. Specifically, when a 17-year-old girl is kidnapped by a man who uses her as his sex slave, having abducted her sever years earlier producing her child. Surprisingly the movie is now 125th ranked IMDb movie of all times,but bewildered movie's director, Lenny Abrahamson, should have realised some troubles in this 118 minutes. Firstly, we all thought the boy was a girl. Is it so difficult to cut his hair a little bit? So, we are expecting Ma to have lied about his gender so that he would not be a rape target. But not \u2013 towards the end you realize it is a boy. Why were we so distracted by that for absolutely no reason? Then the director had created 50 intriguing first minutes provoking questions like: 'are they going to die enclosed?' or 'will they somehow try to escape?' whereas in the second half he fabricated a clumsy and infinitely one-dimensional and boring drama. There is just no real connection between the first and the second act. The seven years Ma previously spent in the room might as well have been a written premise at the start of the movie. But with no deeper layers to the film and with no character really fleshed out, the picture feels aimless. Maybe the first part of the movie was that brilliant that the second half does not live up to it. Unfortunately, the Irish filmmaker did not find harmony like he previously did in Frank (2014) and What Richard Did (2012). If the movie had finished just before they have escaped from the garden shed that would have been great. He should have probably said to himself: \"As the movie is so-called 'Room', I must focus more on what happens inside the room and go with the flow with all the rest of it\". Nice effort 'my friend' but this does not work like this, mainly because this is a potential Oscar winning movie and what you have done is just not even enough to be nominated for the Oscar awards. With such a bloodcurdling topic, a seven year prisoner who has been abducted and her little child discovering for the first time the existence of a brand new world outside a room where he was born, the story struggles to hold our interest as the outside world intervenes. The issue as cinema-goers is that we have simply expected to find the cherry on the pie \u2013 to see something unexpected and pleasurable, and what Abrahamson does to all cinemaddicts is living them starving because nothing interesting happens at all. Put simply, we know how this part of the story goes \u2013 they both are stressed, later they come down and eventually adapt to the house rules. That is really sad and the worst thing is that with a sort of plot like this, the movie has got a score of 8.3 out of 10 on IMDb! How come this movie is better than The Truman show (1998), A beautiful mind (2001) or Gran Torino (2008)? You should open your eyes and ears people and do not rate movies so generously next time. This is definitely one of those movies that the IMDb rating makes you imagine some sort of Life is Beautiful unfolding in a room. In here all is about an annoying kid and his annoyed mom stuck in a room. They both manage to escape the room and guess what? They continue to be annoying and annoyed. The characters are so completely one dimensional that the movie fails to both entertain or be insightful. You end up feeling stuck with the characters in this two hour long ordeal.

If you're aware of the Fritzl case back in 2008, or any similar besides, there's a fair few hardships to view when watching Lenny Abrahamson's rare gem. Brie Larson, known as Ma, has been trapped in 'room' for several years. Her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who's just turned 5, has never been outside. His world is inside the four walls that surround them. This is sweet, sentimental material, but so, so agonising, showing the strengths of a relationship between mother and son, and their ability to overcome the odds. Larson is impeccable, a beautiful performance that'll have you smiling then crying moments later. The young Jacob Tremblay is a sensation, playing a part that would seem impossible for someone to even comprehend at such an age. Room is more than anything a love story, with added thrills and drama. Highly recommended viewing.",

            "content": "First things first, I do my absolute best not to ever write a \"spoiler\" review. I'm going to honor that pledge with this review, but I have to say that this is a hard movie to do justice to without spoiling it. But I think I can, so read on.I decided to go see a random movie this afternoon after seeing the 2016 Oscar nominees were released. This movie is nominated for Best Picture, and it was the one of the three nominees playing at the local indie-flick theater in town that was about to start when I arrived at the theater, so I chose to see it. The most important thing you can know about \"Room\" is that it's worth seeing at least once. It's a pretty simple, low budget movie, so no special effects or anything like that, so if you'd prefer to wait for the digital release you can. Regardless of when you view it, though, my suggestion is to try to go into this movie without knowing virtually anything about it. Seeing it cold, without having read any reviews or heard a thing about it, will greatly augment the experience.I say that because that's how I went about seeing this movie, and not knowing what it was about really made it quite powerful for me. So while it's fine to wait to see it at home, don't let anyone tell you about it between now and when it hits digital release.Now, here's the one, tiny spoiler--nothing huge here, but just one slight tidbit that I have to reveal in order to write much of a review at all: This movie has a significant plot twist to it. That's all I'm saying, but the point here is that in going into this movie cold and not knowing a thing about it, I thought I was watching a certain story play out on the screen, and then the plot twist hit........and WOW. Man, oh man. I did NOT see that coming.That said, I'll finish here by saying a few words about the quality of the film. The acting is great. The cinematography is great. And for a low budget movie, it does what it sets out to do very effectively.The only thing that I might be slightly critical of is that as the plot develops this movie gets a bit odd--not in the content of what the story is about (although that is odd in and of itself), but rather that after that plot twist happens it seems like everybody in the film becomes a very irrational actor. For me, this made the film suffer a bit, as I kept looking at the decisions that people made as the plot moved on and I thought, \"That's not very believable.\" And yet, the more I think about it, the fact is that the irrational decisions and far fetched mindset that so many of the characters have in this movie may actually make it more believable, since people tend to be irrational creatures.That having been said, I'd give the early portion of this film a 10, and the rest of it a 7. It gets worse as it moves on, but at no point does it ever become a bad movie. The other downside is that it's not a film that would be very re-watchable--it's probably not one that you're going to want own on Blu Ray so you can see it over and over again. But it's definitely worth seeing once. All in all I'd call it an 8. So, 8/10 stars for me.",

            "content": "Toilet. Wardrobe. Bed. Bath. Chair One. Chair Two. I have deliberately left out pronouns because that is the way 5 year old Jack refers to the items in his tiny world, all he has ever known, a single room he occupies with his young mother who was snatched on her way home from school as a teenager 7 years ago and has been imprisoned in 'Room' ever since. 'Ma' has managed to bring Jack up in this bizarre environment in as healthy a way as she can, she has obviously taught him to read and write with the limited resources in 'Room', she makes a game of exercise, with Jack giggling and running from one end of 'Room' to the other. Her captor put a small TV in 'Room' at some point, and Jack sees all the things on it as a great fantasy. There is nothing outside of 'Room' to Jack. Jack and Ma make a birthday cake for Jack's 5th birthday, but he wonders why there are no candles on it. Every evening 'Old Nick', which is the name Ma and Jack have given her captor, visits 'Room' and rapes her. We see this through Jack's eyes from the slats of the wardrobe he sleeps in. This film is not afraid to ask a lot of its audience. Jack has temper tantrums and Ma has 'gone days' when she doesn't manage to get out of bed. On 'gone days' Jack entertains himself, just like on the outside world. There are short bursts of narration from Jack telling us what he understands of his existence. For reasons I would rather allow you to discover for yourself, Ma decides that it is time for quite risky attempts for her and Jack to escape from 'Room', so she starts to plant ideas in Jack's head about the outside world, she points out a leaf that falls on the skylight and Jack says 'but it's not green like on TV'. Ma hatches a plan for them to escape but crucial to her idea is Jack pretending to be ill. She coaches him on what he must do to convince Old Nick that he must go to a hospital. This first attempt at freedom fails, so she comes up with another plan. She coaches Jack again, and in a sequence of agonising suspense, Jack does get away. I'm giving nothing away telling you all this, because this is the point at which the film really spreads its wings (this much has been suggested in the trailers). The early scenes, although beautifully played, are merely set up for what follows. Ma's relationship with her own parents and a devoted family friend, Jack's discovery of everything outside of 'Room' and his growing fondness for his grandmother (the sublime and criminally underrated Joan Allen). Ma's father (William H Macy) cannot bring himself to look at Jack and we are not told why, which feels right. We don't need to be bashed over the head with what he is thinking. The questions raised are emotionally complex, staggering. What of the power of unconditional love a child has for it's mother? Ma questions her ability as a parent and Jack's response is simply 'But you're Ma'. How do we come to accept the point at which a child no longer completely depends on us as parents? Why do we find it so difficult to reconcile feelings of being trapped and tormented in our minds when we are physically free? It is so refreshing to see a film that doesn't make announcements about what it wants to say or signpost it's big moments. They just happen. I am loathe to point out any particular scene in a film which unfolds so fluidly but there are two, you will know them when they come, where I dare you, DARE YOU, not to be an emotional wreck. I am normally pretty good at keeping myself together when I go to the cinema, but when the credits rolled here I had to rush to a toilet to compose myself before I left the building. The great film critic Roger Ebert once said 'It's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it'. This film's director, Lenny Abrahamson, understands this completely. I could describe every single scene and divulge every plot detail and I truly believe doing so would not make seeing it any less meaningful. The film is that good. The balance of subtlety and poignancy is perfect. The music is incidental and subtle, the camera angles, particularly in the early cramped scenes, are largely from Jack's point of view, to great effect. This film even goes to the trouble of managing the viewer's suspension of disbelief by paying heed to the fact that Jack would not have been exposed to normal bacteria having been holed up in a small room for so long.Ma is played by Brie Larson in a performance of such astonishing power and naturalism that I am reminded of Charlize Theron in 'Monster' and Meryl Streep in 'Sophie's Choice'. The Academy has nominated four other actresses for the Oscar out of nothing more than politeness this year.Jack is played by a child actor called Jacob Tremblay. A child actor depends greatly on their director and co-actors. I can only assume that during the filming of 'Room', he was nurtured and guided with great love and care, and I am amazed that he has not become the second youngest person to be nominated for an Oscar.Joan Allen and William H Macy, who played parents together before in 'Pleasantville', are both excellent here.Out of IMDBs top 250 films, I have seen 135 and rated four of them 10 stars. If 'Room' ever makes it into IMDBs top 250, it will be my fifth 10 star film.",

Nothing odd about that, you might think - well, except for the fact that thus far in his short life, \"Jack\" has never actually left the room in which he lives. He eats there, plays there, sleeps there - he knows nowhere else. As he ages though, he begins to get itchy feet and his mother finds it more and more difficult to contain his enthusiasm for finding out what is going on outside. What also emerges from their scenario is that \"Ma\" herself is not exactly free to move about. She was taken by \"Nick\" (Sean Bridgers) many years earlier and it soon becomes clear that he is likely the father of the boy she is so desperate to protect. Are they better off indoors or seeking freedom? Well, she decides that the latter offers them a better chance of happiness (and quite possibly sanity, too) - but the execution of that plan is not without risk! Lenny Abrahamson directs this with quite a bit of subtlety. He allows the audience to become immersed in the relationship between the two principals; he lets them do the talking and as the narrative unravels we realise that the story is anything but what we may have expected at the start. There is a palpable chemistry between the confident Tremblay and his more experienced co-star, and she complements that well. This is a nuanced and engaging tale offering us plenty of parallels of modern life - good and bad; with a dialogue that is both poignant and frequently heartfelt too. Certainly, it was nothing at all like I was expecting and it's stimulating and enjoyable in equal measure. Well worth a watch.",

This one did it for me again.\nI loved this movie in many angles such as acting was moving both from Brie and Jacob, development of the story was just right. While watching this, I can't help not to question myself what if I was Joy.. how would I have handled it ? Fight and kill my kidnapper ? Commit suicide when I didn't see any hope escaping that room ? The thing is ... you cannot say Joy was so stupid to let herself be captive for seven years. You just don't know what it's like. He got kidnapped when she was a teenager and kept in that shed for 7 years. I am sure there are a lot of possibilities she had thought of to escape that place. She attempted to escape once with no success and got her wrist broken for it. In one scene, she was questioned by the reporter if she had not thought of requesting his captor to have Jack be adopted to give him a better normal life. And she answered .. \"Why? He had me.\". And I realized, why didn't she ? But for Joy, requesting that from a man, his captor, obviously someone she does not trust at all, would be a risk. There is no safer place for Jack other than with her. I have read some reviews that think how she behaved was totally unrealistic. Being a captive that long and in that conditioning would have affected her mentally / her reasoning. Again, with her situation, it would be hard to judge. And when they finally got out, you would think .. at last, freedom! In the scenes following the escape as they start their new lives, it felt that they are still trapped somehow.. trapped from the memory and horror of their experience, and the judgement of people around them. I loved that take. I think what's powerful about this movie is the fact that it is realistic enough this can happen to you and it lets the audience imagine themselves what if they are in Joy's situation.I give it a 10 and would definitely recommend others to watch it.",

A life taken away from the world is gruesome. A life coming to the world inside a maybe 10 square metres of a room is so far away what the ordinary thoughts can grasp. I were so emotionally involved in the way the mother had routines, structures and organization to build both her and her sons life. Amazing! The whole concept of a human settle down in its own mind and accepting a room for life is breathtaking. Accepting the fate and raising a child for 5 years inside a shed. If I only think about that, I feel so alive and proud of the freedom in the world... the freedom in making own decisions. So...all right....enough with the philosophy and the realistic point of view for this one.Oscar nominations has brought attention to the picture. And that is fair. This movie has great acting, great production, great aspects of the whole storytellling and a really good director.Maybe there could be even more realism considering the boy is out in the world for the first time in his entire life.... and, on the other hand... the mother had raised and educated her child in such a good way that the courage took overhand in situations and helped them escape.The way back into the world can be long. The way back into the world can be devastating. Sometimes is the sad thing the only thing to hold on to...the habit of having something.I am so impressed by the way the story and the movie rolls out. Splendid and important movie.8,3 out of 10",

            "content": "We all know how the Academy continually gives out awards and award nominations to the wrong movies, while snubbing movies that are superior in every other way. HOWEVER, the Academy really dropped the ball here.I am a huge movie buff and will pretty much watch anything even if the premise doesn't have mass appeal. This one clearly has less mass appeal, but the critical acclaim drew me in and wasted 1 hour and 20 minutes of my life (I couldn't watch the last 40 minutes and after reading the plot summary on Wikipedia, I was relieved/upset to find out I didn't miss anything.)The character development flat out sucks. I'm all for movies with a slightly ambiguous nature, but you gotta satisfy the viewers somehow by letting them know what's going on and having the movie make sense. Brie Larson is decent in the main role, but her character isn't really explored and there isn't enough depth to her character. Jack (don't know the actor's name) is a basic 5-year old and I've heard a better child-centric voice narration from a Disney movie. The only reason I gave it a 5 and not something lower is because there are a few aspects of the film I liked. *SPOILER ALERT* The scene where they finally escape from the room is engaging, but after that the film drags on as the people who made this film don't have any knack for quality storytelling. *END SPOILER ALERT*Don't waste your time on this movie as it doesn't do justice to a very disturbing subject matter and only leaves you asking one question: Why did I waste 2 hours of my life? Congrats Academy for messing up again. It just really sickens me that great films like Love & Mercy, Straight Outta Compton, Sicario, and The End of the Tour get not nearly the acclaim they deserve by the Academy (Sicario and Straight Outta Compton deserve more nominations) or fail to be recognized by the Academy at all (Love & Mercy, The End of the Tour). The Academy sucks and this film re-confirmed it for me.",

The story is hard to watch.They finally gain their freedom and Jack is able to experience the outside world for the first time. Interesting details brought up you wouldn't think about; like the kid can't do stairs, never seen the sun or real daylight, never been alone, or exposed to germs. Jacob Tremblay is amazing throughout Brie Larson shines in the second half, finally breaking down when she is safe and can relax enough to let herself go at her mother's house.\nWilliam H Macy (with top billing) is in this for about a second as the dad who can't look at her.",

            "content": "Room was an impressive from the start, it unveiled more and more mystery and intrigue as it went on. In the confines of a small room and space a great story of struggle, sacrifice and sadness is conveyed. The film is effective in getting the viewer to formulate numerous thoughts as to why a young mother and her son exist in this small room. We gradually wonder until a shocking and unspeakable truth is revealed to us. After this revelation a number of things makes sense. Like little Jack is slowly coming to terms with reality it gradually sets in for the audience. Lenny Abrahamson cleverly keeps his audience within the confines of that room until he reveals its cruel reality. Its a shocking truth to most who perhaps conjured up all kinds of science fiction related reasons, the reality is bleak. The first half of Room was suspenseful, intriguing and became increasingly poignant as it went on. The strength of the film was in the build up and longing of the mother and her son to escape into the world. The second part of Room while pleasing at the start took a dive as the mother went through emotional turmoil and took the audience through this sad journey. The film wasn't long enough to explore the long ranging effects and aftermath such entrapment would have on the mother and son. Hence it was an unnecessary emotional downward spiral. If the film had built up the need for escape, the difficulty of it and painted a fairy tale picture of the outside it might have been even better. Escape happened far too soon, perhaps this could have been prolonged and intensified so when they finally escaped it would have been a lot more rewarding and satisfying. The outside and final scenes could have been drastically shortened to show a happy and free mother and son. Overall a decent film, Brie Larson gives a stellar performance and one can see why she earned the Academy Award for best actress. 7.5/10",

This movie was truly amazing, it was intense, emotional, had a beautiful, unpredictable and gripping story, fantastically written characters backed up by even more incredible performances, and was directed and shot amazingly. The plot of the film was amazing in terms of the events of the film, but where it really shines is when it explores this very interesting and unique relationship between Jack and his Mum, and you get to understand these very fleshed out characters and learn a lot about them. I was completely mesmerised from start to finish and not once was i bored, as the story of these characters is so emotional, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and dramatic that you care for them as if they are real people. Going into this film without seeing the trailer made this film infinitely more enjoyable and surprising. There were sequences that made me feel ways that no other film ever has. I have experienced intense edge of seat moments in films before but there were part(s) of this film where i could feel my heart beating like crazy and no other film had ever done that before. That is really a testament also to the amazing directing by Lenny Abrahamson, i have not seen his other films but the way he captures all of the emotion and all of the drama in such a unique and effective way makes me interested to see what he works on next. The way the film was shot was so confronting that you feel like you are going through everything with these characters, and that you are trapped in this room with them. The performances from both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay were absolutely phenomenal. They delivered every line and gave off every emotion so perfectly that it sucks you into the film and it makes everything incredibly grounded, realistic, and personal. Brie Larson was astounding, you could tell her character was very damaged, and you didn't need much of an explanation of what she has been through, simply from the way she talks and acts in certain scenarios you can gather a lot of information about her past, and that shows how amazing she was in this film. But even more surprising was the astounding performance by Jacob Tremblay, this kid is going places, usually you have child actors who show signs of being great but never really make it, but this kid has just put in what is probably my favourite performance from a child actor ever. He commands the screen in every scene and was one of the biggest highlights of the film. But even more astounding was that neither one overshadows the other and both of their amazing performances are front and center the whole time. So overall this is an incredible film, from the directing to the performances, to the plot, everything tied together really well and made for a very gripping, dramatic and intense story. Late in the film it does get a few pacing issues here and there but nothing so substantial as to dampen my overall enjoyment. This is a must see film, and although it will most likely not win Best Picture, i think it is the dark horse in the competition. 9.3/10",

The same old plot rehashed, good vs evil, victim vs oppressor, with the good oh so perfect and the evil eventually getting their cummuppence at the end of the film?\nIf that's what you want, don't watch this film. If you want all action scenes, if you want in depth character analysis, a view into the psyche of a kidnapper, a morality lecture, a commentry of the state of society, the trauma of rape, or just like seeing the bad guy eventually getting killed after the mandatory end of film fight when he rises from the apparent dead before eventually being finished off, but not before some trite final exchange between the hero and villan, then don't watch this film. You'll be disappointed. If that's what you want, there are 1000s of other films you can watch.\nThis film tells the story entirely from the point of view of a 5 year old child. Elements of the story that don't involve the child aren't shown. Issues with the characters that don't affect the child aren't shown, and those that do affect him are only shown in that context. No attempt to explain or analyse why the adults are behaving in the way they do. Lots of unanswered questions that an adult would ask, such as about possible methods of escape, which are not dealt with. Because the film is not from the POV of an adult. That's what most of the critics of this film simply didn't get.\nIt also doesn't follow the usual flow of a film. It doesn't build to a climax at the end, the climax is in the middle.\nWhether you like or hate this film, at least you won't have seen it before, or most likely anything like it.

Now 7 years later, she has the 5 year old boy Jack, played by Jacob Trembley, who lives with her inside the shed. She does everything in her power to make him feel safe. The Irishman Lenny Abrahamson directed this hard and claustrophobic film. The first impression of Room is that the film is rather comfortable. Ma and Jack enjoy each others company and do things that a mother and son usually does. They bake, eat food, celebrate birthdays and watch TV together. After a while as we get more into the story, their relationship changes and becomes more and more tumultuous. Jack by the age of 5, is forced to face and take action against things that no human being ever should have to.Room is really divided in two parts, the first one in captivity and the second one in freedom. The interesting thing that Abrahamson does with this film, is that he in an incredible way asks very daring questions to us. With a life in total captivity, is it possible to feel freedom afterwards? When the safe base a 5 year old has felt his entire life just disappears, what happens then? How does the public react when something like this gets out in the open? Some parts really reminded me of the film Gone Girl where we see in the same way, how the media exploits the suffering the family is going through, only for their own self gain. These moral and psychological questions is the foundation of Room.The best thing about Room is these questions Abrahamson stirs up by not prevaricate, embellish or avoid delicate subjects. He shows it just like it is, no matter how brutal. The second thing that really enhances this film is the amazing acting by both Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley. Their chemistry is truly amazing and Larson even won an Oscar for her performance. If their relationship hadn't felt real, the film wouldn't at all work in the way it did.

Room made me feel a way about a movie I haven't felt since I watched The Elephant Man years ago.It would be easy to turn Room into a ham-fisted Lifetime movie, but the acting, pacing, and restraint of Room could go a long way to show Quentin Tarantino that you don't need a lot of yelling, dialogue, and forced situations to make a movie. Brie Larson (Ma) is certainly Oscar- worthy for a delicate and tortured performance that never gets derailed by any maudlin notes, and Jacob Tremblay (Jack) does some of the best child acting I've seen, even handling off-screen narration with impressive realism.We get two distinct hours. For the first hour we are trapped in Room, finding small pleasures in small things, alternating with the terror of an evil man. The second hour does something amazing: it gives you a heartfelt examination of Jack and Ma entering the world, emotionally, physically, and somewhat spiritually.

They weren't even plausible, which didn't occur to me at the time because I was drifting off. A very young boy, who has spent his whole life in a shed and is suddenly thrown into suburban USA, behaves no more traumatised than a shy child meeting somebody for the first time. And as for the escape plan...Don't be fooled, this are no deep insights, no personality developments, and no twists. There is no drama, no laughs, no tension and very little emotion. The tone of the film is just so lifeless. Film is supposed to be an art form. Art requires love and passion from the people creating it. There are a couple of genuinely moving moments, so I raised the score to a 3, but they stand out simply because the rest of the film is so dull.

In this shed there is a door which is locked by a combination keypad lock, you have been provided with sheets, some clothes, water, food, I think there is a glass or two, matches, an oven/heater/microwave, and there is a skylight in the top of the shed. The guy comes in to have sex with you and he eats the food you cook for him and he sleeps in bed with you(not sex, actual sleep). After a while you bear a child Now I'm pretty sure quite a bit of you reading this would have come up with quite a bit of plans within five minutes or at least a number of complicated plans within a span of a week, or at the very least hatched a convincing plan when your son was born and of a decent age to run. The woman in the movie however comes up with two really bad plans, one of which surprisingly works. Well actually her first plan consisted of hitting him that one time with a really heavy thing, him damaging her wrist..somehow and she not trying anything after that from what I can recall. I am still surprised that the end plan actually worked considering how asinine it was, didn't seem very logical and didn't line up with how a captor of this woman would behave.Ignoring all that though, I thought it was a movie about the psychology of victim and kidnapper/captor/rapist, or the mom and her son within the confines of this shed and how they cope with being held against their will and the child somehow not knowing this. Nope. I said okay then fine, maybe it's about the plan and coming up and following through with a plan that sets them both free and- nope. Then when the escape takes place I thought it was then going to be about the kid escaping from the guy and finding help. Nope, he finds it within a minute of jumping out the truck. Okay then I thought, well the guy who 'saved' the kid didn't bother to take a photo of the truck or even bother to note the license plate so I thought it would be a manhunt for the guy and a race to get to the mom before the kidnapper-No, no, nope, they find her within like five minutes. She's okay. Then maybe how about she and her son living with the constant threat and presence of the one who kidnapped her still on the lamb, free to swoop in and- no, they arrest him in some aside news report. Well fine then, no action, a quality drama about how this woman adjusts to losing all that time in her life, dealing with how the world is now, getting a job, settling back in, adjusting to men having being raped for seven years(or just adjusting in general after being raped and confined for seven years and having a baby for your rapist), picking up her life and how her son adjusts to all this and being-No. Nothing of the sort really, or kind of. They sort of go for some of those things, then stop short and drop them. She gets depression but it's nothing that significant or rather not shown to be that impactful, just seemed like the sort of depression that I've seen in a number of teenagers. I figured we'd have much more in the form of the son, but no, he's shy and has bad grammar, but it's not really that out of the ordinary for a kid with say aspergers. Late in the movie a random kid(I was actually thinking none existed in this movie world since no one really came over to interact with the kid or mom when they got back but is somewhat understandable) and he got along fine with the other kid kicking a ball. Maybe about the family dynamics, her parents aren't together anymore, maybe then about the family why and how they split apart, how they must adjust to finding their daughter and their son and-no, not really.It just sorts of superficially goes for things and then stops short, it felt like watching a well made Lifetime movie of white middle America drama. I guess it was partially my fault for seeing the numerous ripe dramatic and tense places the film could have gone and then never going there.You don't have to give me action, suspense, terror etc, but you could have given me some solid drama to sink my teeth into, and unfortunately this movie didn't have any of that for me. My wife liked it though, so I guess it's more for the women Lifetime audience mom crowd.",

WE need to remember how lucky we are\u0085 just think of that the next time you're complaining about what ever you're complaining about (same goes for me, I need to stop complaining about the weather situation..). This is not based on a true story thankfully. It's heartbreaking but so good. And the Cast is one of the best I've seen in a while. Brie and Jacob are just amazing, two really great actors, who were meant for this film. Also kind of glad that they didn't focus on showing us all these horrible experiences the mom (brie) has to go through, I mean you know that they're happening, but what we get to see is this strong mom fighting for her and her sons life and It's more from Jacobs point of view which makes it more pleasant to watch. If that makes sense\u0085 I can't elevate this film, cast and crew enough. JUST GO watch it already! Words to help describe this film: isolation, escape, heartbreaking, breathtaking, lego, family.I absolutely loved it, a lot because of Brie and Jacob (and who am I kidding- also the compelling story of course)I give it 10 out of 10",

            "content": "This adaptation of Room's magnificent screenwriting, award-deserving performances, visual tones and frequent emotions only increase the heaviness and intensity of the original novel. Although it doesn't actually display the horrific violence and rapes implied, it's still equally as upsetting and unpleasant as most movies that do depict rough content are, if not more. It's beautiful and moving, but it's also painful.Themes in the film centre on the kidnapping and rape of a 17-year-old girl, but that's only implied by the plot, not shown. Room's first half actually displays Ma and her young son being held captive for several years, before they attempt an escape plan which gratefully results in triumph. That's usually where most stories end, though. Room's second half is even more dramatic and emotionally intense than the claustrophobic and also thrilling first half. It goes on to depict these characters adjusting back to the world, with the 5-year-old not knowing anyplace more than 'room'.Brie Larson stages many different emotions through the imprisonment, arguments, parenting and coping. But she's not the only star. Jacob Tremblay is more than outstanding in his exceedingly lifelike child role. Lenny Abrahamson's execution also takes a deeply heavy look into being the victim of the horrendous crime. In our perspectives, we'd want to hear all about the story on the news, but this film takes the chance to consider the depressing emotions and trauma.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",

            "content": "Room (2015)I knew almost nothing about this film going in and I recommend that having watched it. The film is a bit artsy and will bore some audiences and captivate others. Each of the characters are beautifully written and dynamically flawed in one way or another. The film has suspenseful elements and heart strumming ones too. Brie Larson's character deservedly won the Oscar that year, even if Brooklyn was a better film over all. She wore no make up for a majority of the film and relied on her acting to sell the audience her character.Jack played by Jacob Tremblay was impressive. I can't say if he was just a genuinely talented performer or if what happened to Jack had also happened to Jacob. His performance was that convincing.How a major scene happens in the film is because of Amanda Brugels character who I can't remember her characters name. That being said I loved how the movie transitioned from act one to act two because of this Police-woman's actions. You'll know which scene I'm talking about because it's the most suspenseful moment in the film. William H. Macy is in the film and is thrown away immediately to add to the underlying theme that some men can be horrible people, just like Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers who played Johnny Burns from Deadwood, one of my favorite (canceled before their time) TV shows. Joan Allen play's the main character's mother who takes on the motherly role for a certain reason and does a wonderful job making the audience hold their chest in many emotional moments.Enough with the superb acting. The film has flaws. Mainly direction and storytelling. A film shouldn't take you out of the scene because of boredom or nothing to really take in. Many scenes felt longer than they needed to be. Timing is a problem in the film as it felt like The film felt like it was almost over at the 50 minute mark, then had an hour epilogue.Verdict: Watch if you enjoy drama. I can't recommend this to anyone who enjoys watching the Transformer movies, because this is the polar opposite.",

It was a movie about courage, about never letting go and keeping it together. I will forever remember the dialogue when she says to the kid \"I am not a good mom\" and he replies, \"well, you're mom\". This was the one phrase that defined the movie. Nothing more needed there.

            "content": "Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and is the story of a woman named Joy (Brie Larson), who was kidnapped and imprisoned in a woodshed for 7 years. While living there, she had a son named Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who sees their \"house\" in a different perspective than that of his mother. Jack has never seen the outside world, and believes that there is nothing beyond their room; just outer space. This film follows the two as they plan a daring escape, and have to face something much bigger than their room; the world.To start, the Academy was smart to nominate Room for best picture. This movie is a masterpiece. It's one of the best films of the year, and it's very close to being the best. Room, while being a different story, is amazing. The plot and dialogue is absolutely perfect. There's no a thing wrong with the plot (no holes), and nothing wrong with the dialogue, either. The directing was also amazing. The way the directing makes a tiny room seem as big as the universe is fantastic.The acting was definitely the best part about the entire movie, and that's saying something. Jacob Tremblay is only 9 years old, and delivered one of the best child actor performances in cinema history. I honestly think this kid will land many more roles, and continue to give us even performances, just like this one, or maybe even better, though that doesn't seem possible. Brie Larson also does great in her role. She plays a conflicted woman, going through something she doesn't understand astoundingly. Every line that she gives is truly astonishing.Now, although the movie's great, there are a couple negatives. They are nitpicky, yes, but they're negatives. The first one is that of William H. Macy's performance as Joy's father. Not only is the performance pretty bad, the character isn't the greatest either. Macy's character is not ready at all to handle the return of his daughter, let alone that she has a son. Luckily, this character is only in the film for 10 minutes or so.The only other negative is that the film moves a bit slow, mostly in the second act. The first act can drag a little, but the second act moves pretty slowly. The second act takes place after Jack and \"Ma\" escape, and their getting home and used to life in the world. This seems to take much longer than it really is, and that slows the movie down a little. However, it's not enough to make the movie bad, or even not amazing. Not nearly enough.Overall, Room is one of the best films of the year, and it definitely deserves an A, or a 9 out of 10.",

As the story progresses, the viewer learns of the bizarre and heinous circumstances of their situation. The movie is based on the novel by Emma Donoghue who also wrote the screenplay. While it takes place in the U.S. , the film is a Canadian-Irish co-production.When I read the superb novel a few years ago, I hoped it would be made into a film with similar impact but I wondered, is it possible? The answer is an absolute yes thanks to the sensitive directing by Lenny Abrahamson, his brilliant cast, and Donoghue's perfect adaptation.The film follows the book's premise of seeing the story only through the eyes of the young boy. In the book, the interior life and thoughts are illuminating. Luckily, Abrahamson, Larsson, and Tremblay convey similar impact in the film version meeting the challenge of keeping the viewers' attention within the dingy and limited space of the room.The movie's climax happens in the middle, creating an almost entirely new story. It provides amazing insights such as the awkwardness and disillusion that can happen after a presumably positive change. Here again, Abrahamson's attention to detail and subtlety say so much with so little while continuing to get great work from Larson and Tremblay and also from the always dependable Joan Allen.The last scene seems bizarre at first but is understandable considering the trauma of the main characters. It's a perfect result of the other great scenes that precede it and it leaves one's heart wide open.Tremblay gives one of the best child performances since that of Victoire Thivisol in \"Ponette\" (1996). He and others boost \"Room\" to be one of the best movies of 2015.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Directing by Lenny Abrahamson",

Room has one of, if not, the best child acting performances of all time.No doubt Director Lenny Abrahamson worked his ass off to make this possible along with the rest of the cast and crew which also do a tremendous job to make this film come to life.One thing that I think makes this film so great is it's screenplay. It is written by someone who knows the source material more than anyone, the books author Emma Donoghue. I loved how events in Jack's life where told by his extremely imaginative and optimistic point of view even if deep down what he is describing is extremely dark and traumatic. The whole film opts for a hopeful, feel good tone which I appreciated as it easily could have been much darker.Since I saw her in the indie flick Short Term 12 I remember saying that one day Brie Larson would win an Oscar. I may be right as she beautifully portrays a loving mother who is strong when she needs to be for her son. It's a fantastic performance with a believable on screen bond between the two leads. Although Brie Larson being Oscar worthy, Jacob Tremblay's mesmerising lead role in the film outshone her by far, but this may be due to personal expectations.Go see Room, it is an extremely well made film from it's wonderfully unique screenplay (and dialogue), it's astonishing child and adult acting and of course it's directing that has successfully brought everything together as we cut the cord and say \"Hello Jack!\"",

            "content": "I can appreciate all the critical love for Room, even if I can't agree with it.What I can subscribe to, is that the film is anchored by two wonderful central performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay.And though I haven't read Emily Donoghue's adapted novel, I applaud director Lenny Abrahamson's reported decision to upgrade Ma's role for the screen version. For me, it's the complex character of Ma/Joy that holds major interest, rather than 5 year old Jack, through whose perspective we view much of the action. We are told very early on in the second of two clearly defined halves of Room, that young Jacob is resilient and very likely to shake off the effects of 5 years of confinement with his mother. We (at least me anyway) don't need huge amounts of onscreen time devoted to watching Jack atune to his new environment. It's here the film really falls down, with a now plodding pace, as Ma disappears from the screen for very large tracts of time.Of far more importance and interest was exploring the more edgy personality of Ma and the vast challenges, which are really only paid lip service, on her repatriation from capture. A bit of a spat with her mum and a testy TV interview and all of a sudden Joy disappears for way too much of the second half, when things were just starting to get interesting.Without turning Room into a police procedural, I think the movie could have spent a little more time following up the arrest (and likely conviction) of Old Nick. His character generates much of the suspense and he goes virtually unreferenced in the film's second half. In fact the only indirect link is when Ma and Jack return to the room with the police at the end of the film. It looks so ramshackle and flimsy, that even I found myself wondering how Joy had not really managed to create any other escape attempts. It just didn't have the appearance of a virtual escape-proof cell.Room is an unconventional and very professionally produced vehicle about a none too uncommon issue which has affected many women and children over the years. But for me any thriller/suspense elements disappeared when characters such as Ma and Old Nick were off screen, so as to allow an unfettered, somewhat repetitive look at Jack, adjusting to his brave, new world.",

The story of the young woman (Brie Larson) is rather downplayed. There was so much more to tell about her - how did she endure the nightly (or near nightly rapes), how did she give birth by herself in this Room, how did she manage on so many levels? I also felt for her parents, it would be hard to accept this child, the child born from rape and forced impregnation. She was a 17 year old, a little girl, the last time her parents saw her, now she is a woman with a child born from these circumstances.The perspective of the child is fascinating. Never having seen \"the world.\" Knowing only his Ma. So innocent.This movie is disturbing and haunting. I left the theater thinking about it off and on for the next several days. Thinking through all the complexity of what she (Ma / Brie Larson) went through and her parents and all sorts of things.Somehow, for such a horrific subject, the film manages to bring out the positive in how hard a woman can fight for survival, how strong she can be to take care of her child. It is an amazing film. It's heavy and heartbreaking but it's also beautiful.It deserves all the awards!",

            "content": "Brie Larson's performance in this film is beyond question one of the best performances I've seen by a woman in a long time. This film starts with a mother and a son living in close confines. You think at the start they are just poor, but you begin to realise they are locked in a shed and the mother has been held captive for seven years. She tries to make the room a safe place for her son to grow up. But then one day decides she has to use her son to escape. This leads to an emotional roller-coaster of a film that doesn't let go the whole way through. This is not an easy to film to watch, so many emotions going on below the surface. I had seen Brie Larson in movies when she was a kid, but I had no idea she could be this good. What her character has to go through his horrific in itself. But she shows courage and a strong will to survive. There is so much emotional depth to her character. She shows love for her son, uses her survival instincts and a real strength has a human being to want to live in the real world again. The performance is astonishing and the performance by Jacob Tremblay as the young son is equally powerful. If you love great movies and performances, and can take this subject matter you must see this movie. Brie Larson better prepare a speech at the Oscar's because this the most sure front runner I've seen in a long time.",

            "content": "Room is half an extraordinary film and half a decent one. Both halves, in my opinion, don't properly come together to create one incredible product. The tonal and narrative shift that this film takes is jarring. Perhaps that was the intent.We begin within the confines of a makeshift room inside of a shed. Ma and Jack are the captives of a disgusting cretin named \"Old Nick\". He kidnapped Ma years ago, and he subjects her to sexual slavery. I might note that the film shows us what \"Old Nick\" looks like, and I think that was a mistake. Why you might ask? It's because of the powerful dynamic that director Lenny Abrahamson establishes right from the very first moment we meet Ma and Jack. We see the special place they've created for themselves in spite of their circumstance. Everything about it seems ordinary, and that's because Ma makes sure that it seems that way to Jack. Jack only knows Room. It's his only base of reality. Abrahamson purposely centers the film through both points of view. In this sense, this first half of the film is extraordinary So why did we need to humanize their captor? Only a sub-human creature would do this to two innocent people. We know these people exist in real life. We choose not to recognize them in news reporting, for the mere risk of legitimizing who they are and the crimes they committed. Cinematically speaking, it would have been more powerful to have made \"Old Nick\" an off-screen character. It would have been more real, and more chilling.Ma and Jake ultimately escape captivity through a crafty ruse of an emergency that includes hot water and a rug. We enter the next half of the film. Life outside of Room. Ma and Jack readjusting to the real world, and Jack's inability to cope with what the real world is. All he knows and loves is Room, and it leaves him completely detached to what is normal. Jacob Tremblay gives an incredible performance. However, the new characters that we meet in this half do not add anything new or substantial to this story. Or at least that is what it seems like, because of the drastic tonal shift this film takes. Needless to say, I wasn't as hooked into this world as I was inside of Room. I wish I was.But warts and all, this is a well made, and extremely well acted film. Brie Larson's role of her lifetime was this one. To realize she's accomplished this and Captain Marvel before turning 30 is mind-blowing. She has not years, but decades of greatness ahead of her. The same can be said for young Jacob Tremblay. Room is, if nothing else, an effective emotional ride, which was all it ever needed to be.",

            "content": "Giving meaning to tragedy and trauma is dangerous ground. Whether you're a preacher, a writer, a journalist, a film-maker or just somebody trying to walk alongside someone experiencing trauma, the traps are the same. Say too much and you risk the trite, the trivial, the weightless; say too little and you risk a silence which is filled by worst imaginings. Try to find meaning and you flirt with missing the point, not doing justice to the pain; try to let events speak for themselves and you come close to nihilism. There's so much that can go wrong it's best to do nothing if you don't have to, if events don't force themselves on you. Trauma is distant to most of us But as I found out when my when friend was murdered by terrorists, that approach is ultimately of no use; sometimes the worst case happens, the unthinkable becomes your daily concern, the unimaginable your lived experience. This is the territory we are in with Room, the film adaptation of Emma Donoghue's massively successful novel (an adaption written by the novelist). I had little knowledge of the book personally, but the film-makers want us to be in no doubt as to where this film goes - the bare facts make this a hard sell. It's the story of a young woman (faultlessly played by Brie Larson) confined in one room for seven years where she's repeatedly raped by her captor; she inhabits the room with her five-year old son to whom she gave birth in the room as a result of the rapes. Jack's world is the world in four walls; it's all he's ever known, all he's ever seen save for what he sees through the single window in the form of a skylight and the television. This is a child's eye view film; it is through him we perceive the abuse which we never see; it's through him we learn of his mother past life on the outside; it's with him that we eventually journey to the outside world in the film's final third. Jack's mum has helped him create a fantastical world within the four walls of his existence; around his fifth birthday she tries to explain the outside world to him. He's disbelieving, but gradually grasps towards something resembling truth. When he attempts to affect their escape he's just about aware enough to cope with the revelation that there are other people and animals and places. We know there are real-world equivalents to this fictional story, but still this film is trying to imagine the unimaginable. By all rights it should be inadequate or trite or tasteless or just plain unbelievable. In trying to make a film that isn't a thriller or a drama or comedy but instead a hymn to love and relationships, the film-makers should be falling flat on their faces. Instead they've given us a genuinely unforgettable, overwhelming and transcendent film that helps us rediscover ourselves, our loved ones and the world around us. It finds beauty in the desperately ordinary thanks to some remarkable cinematography that makes the small room both a place of captivity and a universe to discover; the relationships are perfectly drawn and life-affirming thanks to Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's (the son, Jack) achingly beautiful performances. The depths of their relationship are unfathomable yet also utterly recognisable to anyone who has ever loved. The startlingly brilliant music haunts, prods, pushes and finally engulfs. We never see the rape or abuse take place, but we're left in no doubt as to its reality, its inescapability. Yet we're never without hope or beauty, and ultimately the film lets us and the characters find life in new, beautiful and subtle ways. There's much to say about Room, but at the end of the day there's little I can properly articulate. I can think of maybe one other film (Pan's Labyrinth - in many ways very different, in others very similar) that has come close to making me feel as moved, alive, tearful and full of wonder as this one. It's a rare work of art that leaves you speechless yet desperate to talk, but Room is one of them.",

The acting is fantastic, Brie Larson was excellent and I thought she would be good when I heard she was cast as she impressed in short term 12. No disappointments there. The boy, Jack, was just brilliant, I see so many films where the child actors overact and are over cutesy. He did neither, he was perfect.

            "content": "Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson (Frank, Garage) and stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen & William H. Macy. Based on the best-selling novel; Room explores how 5-year-old Jack copes with the huge world surrounding him after escaping the 10-by-10 foot enclosure that kept he and his mother captive his entire life. With tour de force performances by both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, this psychological drama triumphs in a story of survival, hope and the unbinding love between mother and son. With award season in full swing, Room has captured audiences around the world, with its small and subtle storytelling and gargantuan directorial vision. The attention this film has gained is so vast and wonderful to see, focusing on the performances of our two on-screen protagonists. I'm truly glad to see Larson taking the Oscar for best actress and Tremblay for the AFCA breakthrough artist. Both are equally magnificent as their chemistry flows beautifully throughout the 128 minute running-length of the film.After seeing Abrahamson's directional efforts in 'Frank' and hearing that he was sitting back in the directors chair for Room, I knew I had to see it. His work is highly regarded as some of the best Irish cinema around. I can safely say, I agree. Truly enduring work, and the pacing never holds up even for a few moments.Stephen Rennicks pairs up with Abrahamson yet again with their fifth collaboration and it sounds incredible. The soft guitar melodies play slowly and gently under the performances and perfectly portray the mood and themes of this film, then as the drama and tension increases, a structured string movement thickens the emotional core. I'd love to see the two connecting again sometime in the future. I have very little to say that would be derivative of the overall feature and because of this, I have to say I'm very happy with the experience I have had with this film. I think Abrahamson is an ingenious director and really strives to be different.My verdict; Room is a film that everyone should watch and take note of. A simple idea can go a long way. This is substantial proof of that. Room, 9/10.",

            "content": "After finishing the book a mere couple days ago, I went to watch the movie adaptation of Room.On the whole, I was very pleased with what they did with the story even if, as usual, I prefer the book version. Some things just brought more depth and realism to the characters.I felt this especially with Jack's transition to the real world. Whereas in the book the boy felt terrified and in shock for most of the time, in the movie it was almost as if he was just surprised and curious, even if a bit shy. On the other hand, Ma didn't come across as the huge role model as in the book, even selfish at times, which I found very true to such a character's development.Pretty much all the characters were different in one way or the other, which was OK for most except for Old Nick, as I felt he came across as much too humane.At the end of the day, there are so many little details in the book that make the experience so special and something else entirely. Also, there's the fact that it is entirely told by Jack. You see everything through his eyes and even when he is describing something completely ordinary you have to stop and figure out what it is because he describes it in such a different way. That can't really happen in a movie, not to that degree, because you base what you are watching on your own notions. He still narrates it from time to time so you can appreciate it, just not on the same level.Considering all the difficulties involved in bringing this story to the big screen, I feel it was a job very well done and definitely recommend it, whether you have read the book or not. This is not a theme for the faint-hearted and I felt it was handled with respect by the author and now by the director. I am so happy that the author's input was taken in so much account when making this movie. You can tell.The performances were breath-taking. I can't believe a little boy can act like that, even if he was probably 8 or 9 years old at the time. I have to admit I shed a few tears on more than one occasion. This is a heart-warming and heartbreaking story all at once, just like the book's.In a time when it seems so difficult to go to the movies and find something special to watch, this one is definitely a pearl in the middle of the ocean.",

Towards the middle of the film, I find every cell in me wants the woman's plan to succeed. I held my breath, I welled up and I sincerely hope there would be some humanity left in the world. Another very emotional scene is the brief TV interview. The interviewer seems so caring and empathic, but asks very biased questions which leads to another emotional zenith.

I get the concept of darkness in the shed, but why the darkness anywhere else. One can show confinement and oppression yet allow the audience to see what is going on. Of course that's theory on my part. Maybe the producers and directors were so low budget they were embarrassed by sets and costumes and \"painted it black\" to hide them.

Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are excellent, and major props to Abrahamson for getting such a quality, realistic performance out of Tremblay. Room does a great job of taking its time and letting the setting really seep into your mind, and then create a jarring contrast with the real world. It is broadly positive and uplifting, and I respect the choices they made, by and large. The biggest exception was that I thought Jack's rapid, rather smooth transition socially to being around other people and losing the familiarity of the items in Room was unrealistic. I also thought they could've further shown what was bothering Ma and her mental state after returning. Those points aside, it was great and I loved the acting, script, and intentional cinematography in the angles and lighting choices.",

            "content": "After God's love for us all, a mother's love for her child is the most powerful force in our universe. Never is this inestimable strength more explosively in evidence than in the relentlessly gripping domestic drama \"Room\".Brie Larson unequivocally earns her Best Actress Oscar as Ma, a young woman who at 17 is kidnapped by a sick fu-- and held as a sex slave in a suburban backyard garden shed for the better part of a decade. During this time she bears a son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay in a stunning and utterly natural performance). For five years this boy believes the \"real world\" consists only of this 11 x 11 foot prison he and his mom inhabit. Until the day that Ma stuns him with the declaration that there is a vast and diverse existence beyond the four walls of \"room\". And she hatches a plan that may just lead to at long last freedom from the sinister oppression of the evil incarnate \"Old Nick\".At this point in the story Director Lenny Abrahamson takes us on the rocky journey experienced by survivors of unspeakable trauma, both from the perspectives of those who lived through the ordeal and those whose lives were devastated in the \"not knowing\". It is here where Larson and Tremblay, along with the great Joan Allen as Ma's mother, Nancy, and Tom McCamus as her partner in particular, shine with poignant ferocity amidst a consumptive crucible of relief, remorse and regret. And never is there a false note struck among the emotional carnage.As \"Room\" concludes we find Ma and Jack together gaining at least some measure of closure to the horror that has befallen them. And while it is certainly not a happy ending by any standard, it is nonetheless one of, while admittedly tenuous, hope for the future. And considering what may have been in this oh so sad chronicle, this represents infinitely more than we as an audience could have hoped for at the outset of this deeply moving examination of the triumph of the human spirit.",

            "content": "An irritable woman, a little \"girl\" with very long hair, a messy room, just some food that can only be eaten. Opening a movie without reading the introduction, to be honest, I have a lot of prejudices. At that time I wondered why she didn't take her children out, why did she have to rely on that man to have food, is it not good for self-reliance? Look, without knowing it, I arbitrarily assert.\nFortunately, curiosity suppressed my irritability, wondering when she would take the child out, when she could live on her own, and continue to watch the movie with my prejudices. When I really saw the iron gate and the little skylight, I woke up. It's not that she didn't want to go out, but that she fell into real hell. The life in captivity forced her to only dream with her children. For seven years, I could not imagine how she persevered. She used her efforts to create a normal childhood for her children, using necklaces made of eggshells and patterns made of cardboard to let children read and watch TV. Finally determined to let the child understand the truth, because the child could not accept them for a while, they had a strong dispute and had a cold war for a while. Pretending to be sick, pretending to die, and constantly training, the child finally had the opportunity to be taken out of the wooden shed as a \"corpse\".\nMother kept telling the child to crawl out of the rolled blanket and jump out of the car after the car stopped. When he met the first person, he asked for help. Before the age of 5, he had never seen a third person, thinking that those on TV were fake, and everything in nature was fake, because his pet dog was also fake. When his mother tells him the truth of this world, he needs to identify the true and false of people and animated people. They were finally reborn and saved. A 17-year-old girl was imprisoned for seven years. Is such a person worthy of being called a person? In a straightforward manner, the evil in this world goes far beyond this. And the movie did not end after they were saved. Life is not the perfect ending, so it can end. In seven years, everything outside requires her to accept and adapt again. Everything around will not stop because of her disappearance, time will not stop because of her disappearance. Holding a photo album to see friends at that time, their lives are still the same, this is the biggest blow to her. I can't understand that when they were interviewed, the host repeatedly forced her to recall the past, and still questioning why she didn't release her child for freedom earlier. I have a hard time understanding how it is a fault to depend on each other to survive. In that situation, all her methods are not wrong. This is not measured by right or wrong, no one can truly empathize. The fact that the authorities are obsessed with bystanders is not just a warning to those in it. Isn't there a warning to be onlookers? It is wrong that your sobriety does not mean that the person who is truly experienced. What we lack is not only empathy, but also a sobriety of being self-righteous.\nFortunately, they finally said goodbye to the room and really came out. Maybe this shadow is difficult to erase in this life, maybe in many midnight dreams, waking up in a trance. Fortunately, they were finally saved. I thought it was just my mother who said that he was a boy in order to protect the child. As a result, he was a real boy, a brave man.\nThe disparity in strength has made women, children and the elderly naturally belong to the disadvantaged groups. How to protect themselves has actually been talked about a lot, but there is little education for the truly powerful. I hope that each mother can do her best to cultivate a real man, not a murderer with a decent appearance.",

            "content": "I didn't really have any big expectations when going into 'Room' - I initially thought it looked like one of those Oscar bait titles that tries way too hard to be emotionally powerful and becomes an overdone melodrama. However, after seeing a few scenes and realising that it's directed by Lenny Abrahamson (previously having directed the quirky masterpiece known as 'Frank') it intrigued me, and started to look like a lot more than just typical Oscar bait... and thankfully, it was. This is one of those beautiful films that manages to capture the strength of love and the importance of family, as well as reminding us that the less we have, the more we appreciate.'Room' tells the story of a devoted mother's relationship with her five-year-old son, Jack, who has been living in an enclosed 'room' ever since he was born. This is essentially the boy's whole world for the first five years of his life, which immediately establishes the mother as a strong and loving character with the determination to bring up her son properly, providing him with happiness and creativity despite their harsh living conditions. Abrahamson often incorporates tight framing and close-up shots here in order to signify how restricted these characters are in a physical sense, yet how open they are emotionally - making for some genuinely heartfelt interactions. This is where the film succeeds, seeing a realistic relationship between a loving mother and her young son is truly heart-warming, especially if you take their limited surroundings into consideration. Even when the tone switches and tension is built up, realism is still maintained, the characters feel just as engaging, and the overall atmosphere is handled pretty well throughout.Unfortunately, despite how well these interactions work, the focus always leans towards the character of Jack and his perspective of the world, with segments featuring narration from the little boy himself as he adjusts and learns about the real world for the first time. This basically provides us with the typical portrayal of children in films like this - innocent, naive and somewhat cute... and although there isn't anything wrong with the execution of this, it's nowhere near as captivating as the actual relationship between the mother and the son. After a while, the film starts to slightly lose focus in general, by including some drama which felt somewhat forced and unnecessary. However, these are just minor flaws in the grand scheme of things.In terms of cinematography, the film seems to switch between Dogme 95 style filming (handheld/steadicam) and standard static shots, which feels quite inconsistent in terms of style, but works pretty well regarding the atmosphere being conveyed. When it comes to acting, everyone pulled off a magnificent job; Brie Larson winning an Oscar for this role was well-deserved, and although I'm not really a fan of child actors (they can either be great or just really cringe-worthy), I thought Jacob Tremblay was pretty fantastic in his role. All in all, this is a heart-warming story with some phenomenal performances and beautiful sequences that will undoubtedly tug at your heartstrings, which is why I'm giving this film a very strong 8,4/10.",

The film does not describe the pain she suffered, but it is conceivable that if it were not for the birth of her child, she would have gone into a nervous breakdown. In some ways, coming out of captivity, she had a harder time adjusting to normal life than her own children. Because a child who has never seen the larger world only has to face the fear of the unknown, and who has been robbed of her normal life needs to find the meaning of life again.So we see Joey back at home, chronically depressed and reluctant to see anyone; He scolded his mother for teaching him \"be kind to others\" when he was young, which led to his being easily tricked.The media questions killed the last straw in her heart.\nThe last question the media asked joey before he killed himself -- why not ask his captors to send the baby to a hospital or nursery as soon as he was born, in exchange for his relative freedom by \"sacrificing himself to help others\"?\nJoey's answer is -- because Jack needs me.\nWhat a feeble excuse, and then she fell into a long silence -- it was not only old Nick who kept the child in the room, but also herself who, as a \"selfish\" mother, deprived the child of the freedom he deserved.\nIn the constant torture with his soul, Joy broke down and finally chose to commit suicide.",

            "content": "The success of Room is definitely driven by the stellar performances by both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. After a winning performance in the 2013 favorite, Short Term 12, Brie further impresses through her portrayal of such a psyco-emotional demanding role as \"Ma\" Newsome. She shines as the bruised survivalist, putting forth a physically & emotionally believable character that is both a victim of crime & sexual abuse, & a struggling single mother. With Brie's commitment to the role (and success), the Oscar victory was well deserved. As for Jacob, he was jaw droppingly convincing without being cloying, a rare feat for young actors challenged with sincere roles. His characterization of Jack Newsome was spot on, nailing scenes that relishes his curiosity, disbelief & incomprehension.Apart from the astonishing acting, the screenplay & directing elevated the film further. The camerawork\nby Lenny Abrahamson was superb, with the use of first person perspective and widescreen closeups that places the audience right smack in the middle of the claustrophobic Room. The adaptation of Emma Donoghue was just as superb, leading with the iron-clad resolve of our leads to craft a film that haunts initially, but pushes for gradual awakening & internal freedom as just rewards.Truly an impressive film, Room succesfully showcases an unbreakable bond between a mother and a child, that endures even the most insufferable circumstances. What a story, and what an unforgettable Cast and Team behind it.",

            "content": "Because of me being an idiot, I finished reading the book Room literally an hour before I saw the movie. The good side of this was the novel was still in my head, but the bad side was also that the novel was still very much in my head. Usually when this happens, you become critical as you constantly go \"Where's this bit? Where's that bit?\". The novel is pretty intact with this adaptation, and is also a pretty much perfect adaptation.A lot of Jack's internal monologues are narrowed down, obviously as this is a visual medium and not a novel where you can get away with this, and this shows how Emma Donaghue takes over lovingly crafted novel and makes it work with a film format. And when she has produced the script with the same tone and sensibility, albeit with some scenes appearing slightly shortened (notably the interview scene, which in the book brought me to tears and felt a little hastened here), she gives that script to very talented people to bring to life. Irish director Lenny Abrahamson shoots the movie with very tight shots - around 80% of the shots are ECUs or CUs, which is mixed with a cooler pallet to make the world seem cold, and as the movie ends, we see a final wide shot of our two main characters walking from the camera to give a great resolve. It's a very tight, clever piece of storytelling with camera-work. The cast are also stellar. Joan Allen features prominently as Jack's grandmother, and is great as a woman who's trying her best to warm to and love Jack whilst also making her own daughter's return to the world more accessible and is great, Tom McCamus plays 'steppa' Leo who is the first person to really coax Jack out of his shell, and uses his warming and caring voice, and subtle, gentle expressions to gain his affection. Sean Bridgers plays Old Nick, the captor and creator of Room; Sean Bridgers deserves a lot of credit for being genuinely repulsive, despite only being seen a small number of scenes, and for creating a quiet unassuming quality about him - that no-one would ever expect him - while also being horrifically calm with everything he's done. Now onto the main players: Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson has come a long way since Envy Adams in Scott Pilgrim, and she creates a TOTALLY realistic portrayal of a traumatised woman who is also a genuinely loving person/parent. In her already mentioned interview scene, where she's asked horrifically insensitive questions to provoke, your heart breaks for her. As Jack, Jacob is our eyes of the movie as we follow him wherever he goes, and he's so adorable yet wise in his way; he says things like his \"strong\" is in his hair, like Samson, and you find it utterly adorable and endearing at the same time. He is really good, and it's good he is because if he wasn't then whole movie fails.I can't think of any flaws with the movie at all actually, and if there are they are pretty minor. There are obviously differences with the novel, which is always frustrating BUT as a movie, this is perfect. Brie Larson is particularly wonderful, as is the script and the minimalistic movie score. Hopefully Oscar for Brie, and all around good things for this movie.",

His world was the distance from a hut to a skylight. How could he survive when he came out of the trap and saw the real birds, the blue sky, all kinds of people, exposed to the bacteria of the air and the complexity of human nature?However, I never expected that, although Jack began to have trouble fitting in, as a child, he soon learned everything, learned to contact and care for the grandparents he just met, learned to be strong and independent, and made friends of the same age. Instead, the mother collapsed in the face of everything lost and recovered and the pressure of public opinion. Why?There is a plot that I think is very well designed. Joy is showing Jack a picture of her with her friends when she was a student, and she says, \"do you know what happened to them?\" Jack says no, Joy says exactly, nothing happened, and then she has a fight with her mother and even blames her for what happened to her. She is dumbstruck by the host's questions on the talk show, and finally fails to commit suicide by taking drugs. This is a very clear expression of her psychological process. Joy was only a girl when she was cheated and imprisoned. From the swing set behind her grandparents' house that she had been telling Jack about, it can be seen that she grew up in a harmonious family environment and was a good girl who was healthy and had no bad habits and was willing to help others. Maybe she had never experienced a real love heartbreak. When a person is suppressed in a few meters square room, she thought only how to escape, and when the real escape, she began to lose the seven years of heartache, is much transformed, parents are not together, that of his friends about also have their own family business, and she is just one of the world's most insignificant a single particle, didn't she, on the earth is still in turn, others are still in the forward, live a life, only oneself, and this world all contact solidification in seven years ago, out of place. There is only one achievement, and the seven years has brought up Jack lived alone with yourself, so when the host asked you have never thought in the Jack was born Old Nick put him in the fire department or hospital to let him have a real childhood, this is the last straw breaks the camel's, she's the only meaning there seven years were rejected, she the meaning of survival and life values must be collapsed. However, he was saved by his son Jack, who cut short his long hair and integrated into the society. However, he still kept the pure heart of being dependent on his mother.I believe that in the end, the mother and son returned to the room, where many people were in tears. At first, I thought the plot design was a little abrupt. Why should I go back to the place where I was imprisoned? After watching it, I wanted to ask the screenwriter to take my knee. I felt that the last scene cleared away the haze and heartache that the whole movie had brought to the audience. Suddenly, I realized that the film was not about how to escape, but how to make peace with the heavy past and finally move forward with hope. Some people may think the latter part is too much chicken soup, but I think in the treatment of the mother and son relationship, this degree of soft chicken soup I am still very willing to drink it, after all, did not cry to tell my mother to love me again, but is gentle and romantic, directly to the heart.If there really is a mother and son in some corner of the world or in some parallel universe, I would like to send my blessing to you, whether in a small room or in a big world, I hope you two can stay together, you and me agianst the world.",

The genre is psychological drama but really it is Not like anything you have ever seen. You know that you have something special when everyone is telling you that your movie is good and unique. The only movie i would relate it to as analogy- may be The Road. This picture is all about a struggle that mother and her child have VS cruel and constantly changing world. It is not actually about the abduction, it is more about growing up and adjusting to new world. For both mother and child. Despite the extreme circumstances of this story, it leaves you asking yourself are you really ever ready for pressure of raising a child? Dramaturgy here is maybe the best I have ever seen. Astonishing work on psychology and writing it into a simple but impressive form. Also incredible actors performance. You will shed a fair amount of tears but it will leave you with a good feeling.",

The story, according the Donoghue, is not based on any one story, but one can't help feel the story is familiar and current. Within the film there are a variety of additional stories that make one think, such as News Reporter (Wendy Creson) Q&A's, the kidnapper's (Sean Bridgers) thought process, parental (Joan Allen and William H. Macy) accountability, and a whole lot more. The combination of relatable story lines makes this project important and relevant.

I questioned if the filmmakers even got permission from Emma Donoghue to turn her book into a movie, because why else would they change literally everything? Yeah the theme was the same, but important little details were changed that really didn't need to be. If you stayed true to the book, it could've been better.It felt like reading one page out of the book, and then flipping forward 75 pages. I'm biased because yes, I read the book, so obviously I'm connecting the two, but even if I hadn't, I know a rushed movie when I see one. It felt like a student project or like a short film off YouTube. I don't mean to put it down. The story is incredible, I could never imagine going through all that... but the movie adaptation just... didn't do it for me.The book had me on edge. The book was full of intensity and emotion. I didn't feel that from the movie. The only thing that really got me is when we see just how small the shed is at the end of the movie, from an external POV. Imagine living in there for 7 years--! My issue is just that, so much was left out, and so much was changed. What about Paul, Joy's brother? What about Jack's cousin? Paul and his family were present for almost the entire last third of the book, but they weren't existent in the movie. What about the dog bite? What about Joy and Jack getting an apartment? What about the entire week-long stay at the hospital, all the patients they met? To filmmakers, those may seem like trivial and useless scenes, but to me and I'm sure many others, they were important. I know you only have so much you can shove into a movie... but the obviousness of the rushed state just ruins it. I'm very sorry to say I'll likely never watch it again. I honestly can't even recommend it as I thought I would. I don't doubt this'll get hundreds of thumbs down.I highly recommend you read the book.",

Either way this childs rollercoaster of emotions are incredible acting for a child so young and on such a deep topic you wouldnt think a child that age could grasp.

Brie Larson is my front runner for the Oscar, and little Jacob Tremblay put together a great performance for being so young. I didn't expect to see a phenomenally acted movie, but instead a compelling story line. The first half of Room had both! Brie Larson is a new star! Its hard to imagine that anyone else could have done as well as she could. Tremblay was a great supporting role that complimented Larson as well. His emotion and commitment to the role really added to the terrible nature of that locked room.I was really expecting a great story, which there was. The entire movie was a great story, but the first half did a much better job of telling that story. After they escaped the room, the story went from compelling and torturous, to just being depressing and rather slow. The first half has something devastating happening that is also unique. No one can imagine what these two were going through, and how just Larson and Tremblay handled the isolation was amazing to watch. Honestly, if the movie would have ended after the escape, it would have been better. Room is a very good movie with a great story and great acting. If the second half would have a little better, this would have been a movie for the ages. Still, Room is definitely worth the watch; 7/10",

The Cinemagic that made this 2-hour movie seemed 6 hours long was amazing. I can't even phantom how they did that. All these 9 and 10 reviews is people feel obligated to give it to review the cost of the Academy Awards. They are lying to you. They are so many things left unexplored which is a shame. . . No wait, isn't or this movie would have been a month long. I get this is supposed to be some heartfelt and emotional movie to move you to tears for some cathartic moment but the sappy music that plays at every vaguely emotional scene ruins.

            "content": "Held captive for years in an enclosed space, Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) and her 5-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) finally gain their freedom from a man known only as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), allowing the boy to experience the outside world for the first time alongside Joy's mother and father (Joan Allen, William H. Macy) and her mother's friend Doug (Matt Gordon).So this is a big one. I was interested in this ever since I saw a trailer a few months ago. I thought it looked good enough but I never thought it was going to be this good. So the film, based on the novel of the same name, is about a mother and son, Joy and Jack, forced to live in what amounts to a single room. This room consists of a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. Joy has been living in it for over seven years and the room, or \"Room\" as Jack calls it is all he has ever known since he is yet to experience the outside world. Room is what is normal to him and how he sees the world has been influenced by it. The world to him is only what is inside of the room and nothing more. Once he and Joy finally escape the room, they (mostly Jack) must readjust to their new lives outside the room. Jack must reshape his view of the world and also must relearn what is real and what isn't. The story may not seem as much but it really is a story of fear, hopelessness and hope and most importantly a film about redemption and family bond. The film definitely pulls you through the range of emotions: sadness, happiness, anger, nervousness, etc (I will admit to almost crying at a few moments). I will not give anything away here in order to not spoil these moments. The story which was told mostly from Jack's perspective, follows Jack's evolution and his changing view of the world. He uses his five-year-old imagination to make the best of out where he is and what he knows. There were plenty of moments in the film where Jack goes on some \"imagination tangents\" where he would come up with his own stories and they were infectious. You can tell that these were happening from the child-like music and the change in the camera. Besides all of that, the film is about the relationship between Joy and Jack and later with them and Joy's (nameless) mother. What sold me with all of this was the amazing acting from Larson and Tremblay (and to a lesser extent Allen). I thought they had great chemistry with one another and it showed (mostly in the beginning when it was just them in a room). The cinematography here was amazing here as it helped bring to life Jack's imagination which mostly served to advance the plot. What also helps by telling the story from the kid's perspective, it lightens up the rather dark subject matter in the film (and it is very dark). I was not a big fan of the ending but I can't give it the benefit of the doubt by not having read the film's source material. Overall, this is a great film driven by a great story and great acting and should not be missed as it surely likely to earn some awards.Score: 9/10 keithlovesmovies.com",

            "content": "In our culture and era we live in, we hear about rape and kidnappings way too often. I bet anyone I would ask would know of someone whos been sexually harassed or has been themselves. This is a sad and harsh reality we live in but nobody knows what happens behind the scenes and \"Room\" really encaptures what happens in real life. This film is very raw and hard to watch at times. But that's honestly why I liked it so much. The director of \"Room\", Lenny Abrahanson did a great job at capturing realism in his film and didn't sugar coat it.This film starts in 'room' where Ma (Brie Larson) and her five year old son Jack, (Jacob Trebley). Jack calmly talks about how Ma would cry and watch tv like a zombie all day before Jack \"zoomed down from heaven through skylight, into room\" (1:44). When Jack turns five, they bake a cake and talk about what a big boy he is now that he's five. Ma has decides to tell him the truth about why they are stuck in 'room' and that there's a whole world outside of room that jack has never seen before. Now that he's old, she trusts that he's ready for the truth. After telling him this, he is in disbelief and does not believe what she's saying for one second. Jack has been comfortable in 'room' since the beginning and has trouble understanding why ma would want to leave. Jack enjoys his routine and his \"friends\" there ( he was friends with a mouse who came in occasionally, the rug, the table, the bath etc). Ma decides they were getting out and to do that she thought she would pretend jack had died from being so sick so he could be taken outside of room and could run to someone, anyone for help and to tell the police the situation. Even after the escape however, things didn't go as smoothly as one may think for being released from a seven year prison sentence.This film really caught my eye considering the context. This is a dark film that shows a very raw description of what it could be like to be captured and held by a sick old man. Going into the film, I thought I knew how it would go. Show their life in 'room', have a few failed escape attempts, finally get out, then reunite with family. I was happily surprised with how much different the film actually was from what I expected. Lenny Abrahanson did a well job on making the film realistic as well as making it unexpected. The camera angles used in the making of the film truly enhanced the darkness of the film. The lighting also went along with camera angles, since they only had one window, which was a skylight they had to use that as basically their only light source besides some lamps and the lighting helped portray the eeriness of the film. Especially once they finally get out into the world again, it is immensely bright. Jack, (Jacob Trebley) is a very convincing five year old boy in this film. He is a main character and his acting really helped convince the audience of his fear and sadness. Ma, (Brie Larson) also is very key in making this a convincing film. Ma has to portray someone who has been locked up by a sick man for seven years and has to show the pain through her actions and words and I believe she does an excellent job with that in this film. However, one thing I didn't enjoy in this film was that it lacked voicing of what Ma and Jack were feeling after they got out. There was some emotion showed but Ma didn't speak to it as much as I thought she would have. Jack's only true emotion after the escape, was that he missed 'room' and wanted to go back. He quickly got over that and became a much happier boy but he also didn't comprehend what he and his mother went through. Ma did show some feelings after escaping, through her actions. She tries to end her life since she knows now that Jack can be cared for. But it took her some realizing that she needed to be on this earth and take care of her son.This heart breaking story thankfully turns into a very powerful and strong message. I would recommend this to anyone who likes dark thrillers or if you enjoy films based off real life events then I would definitely suggest this for you. I give \"Room\" an overall rating of 5/5.",

I loved that we as the audience were able to experience the world through the eyes of the boy: the tight room, the sad eyes of his mother, the exploration of the world around him after they escaped. Strong, but would not rewatch it.",

            "content": "Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H. Macy. The film is about a woman named Joy \"Ma\" Newsome who was abducted and held captive in a room for seven years, and her son, Jack who is five years old and has been living inside that particular room his entire life. The film follows their attempt at escaping from that place and as we see through Jack's eyes, his experience of the outside world for the first time in his life. This is definitely at the top of my best movies of the year, simply because it is incredibly done and perfectly portrayed. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give some of the best performances I've ever seen in my life in any movie what so ever. The kid, Jacob, is phenomenal and surprisingly he carries it all throughout. You'd think that an amazing actress like Brie, and her character would be the center of the movie but that's actually not the case. As she says so in the movie, her kid saves her many times, and that goes to show just how different and amazingly done this movie really is. The director (Lenny Abrahamson) also did a very good job here, as he kept us interested and entertained through the first part of the movie when they're in the room. That is really hard to do, considering that there are not much things to do or a lot of different ways to go about it but this director did it. The music composed by Stephen Rennicks is very touching and gives those very much needed and present emotional moments meaning and heart. I think that one of the main reasons as to why this movie worked so wonderfully well was the screenplay written by the author of the original book that this movie is based upon, Emma Donoghue. More movies should take notice of this and be loyal to the main source because that's the best way to succeed at making an adaptation. I pretty much loved everything about this movie, it was touching, filled with incredible performances, very good cinematography, great directing that conclude to the perfectness that this movie is.",

What makes room so powerful is because the majority of the book and the movie is in the \"room\" and how Jacob Tremblay's imagination is in \"room\" is so so amazing! My sister cried when she saw it in theater's and I didn't because I don't cry easily at movies but if I did I would be bawling my eyes out. This movie isn't for everyone, but for those who can handle seeing abuse, etc go see this movie! :)",

            "content": "There's a common saying that goldfish grow to the size of their bowls. This, in turn, is used to describe the limits or extent of a person's world view, often implying one of two things \u2013 either that you can have a very narrow and limited view of your environment if you allow it to be that way, or alternatively, that by pulling off someone's blinkers, you can set their mind free into all kinds of untold possibilities. Room explores, brilliantly, both of these extremes in a way which is touching, tender, emotional, yet also has tension, precision and power. The first section is claustrophobic in the extreme in some respects, the goldfish clearly trying to be kept restricted and contained. Four bleak walls and one distant skylight form the landscape, with tattered crayoned pictures and grubby misshapen items offering little relief. Yet the creativity and determination of Joy towards her young son Jack lights up much of this segment. At least initially. Things very quickly take a more sinister turn as we're introduced to old Nick, their captor, who is initially a shadowy and ill-formed figure, viewed from the wardrobe.As plans are fomented to deal with the situation at hand, the action and acting, accompanied by the music, interplay in quite magnificent ways to ratchet up the dramatic tension. Even then, little moments of tender humanity and humour are allowed to show their faces, making this feel like your peering into their tiny bowl. And when finally the break for freedom happens, you're left almost unable to breathe with fear and hope, as the brave new world swings tantalisingly into view.The second section, unsurprisingly, takes more than a few blinking moments to come into view. Suddenly the bowl is huge and scary and although we're allowed to breathe again, it's in a short shallow slightly shaky way. We meet more people who we're given to understand in an understated way have also been finding things difficult to cope with. This is in many ways at the crux of what we see unfolding, although there's also a beautifully played subplot about growing up and letting go.There was one what I felt was a slightly clunky moment during a TV interview, but with hindsight, I can see this was a plot device used to take you deeper into the mindset of Joy, helping to explain subsequent events. The juxtaposition happening before you is unsettling at the same time as it's uplifting and yet the director manages to tie things up and bring closure to the production in a beautiful way. Although certainly elements are harrowing, it is never mawkish or gloom-ridden and it strikes a particular balance between dark and light throughout. The score, edits and photography are superb, really adding to the piece overall, with the music in particular hitting the sweet spot. I've spent most of the past 24 hours with things from this movie bubbling around in my mind, in particular, picking over details of what we've seen as well as wondering about what happened next (I know I know, it's fiction but that's how engaging and embracing I found this). One of Jack's little soliloquies towards the end in particular had a resonance that went far wider than the contained events we were presented with \u2013 he's outside the bowl looking in now methinks. 5",

You would naturally think how could been in whole movie work so well without been boring? Well, this movie made it work. The direction and acting in this movie as just so powerful that it could not be boring for a second.Ma and 5 year old Jack have been placed in a room for years and years by a man by the name of \"Old Nick.\" Old Nick never lets them leave. Jack has never left this room before. Ma somehow manages to make a small little room the whole world to Jack. She manages to convince jack how fun it is been in one little room, and she convinces us too! Then one day Jack escapes to make a terrifying and thrilling journey to self discovery.Brie Larson was amazing as the Mother who has been abused and is raising a kid to be strong and show him the real world. She deserved the Oscar. I remember seeing Brie Larson is \"21 Jump Street\" and thinking she will never make it in a movie like this. I was proved wrong once again! My hates off to Jacob Tremblay who played 5 year old Jack. He's one of the best Child Actors I have seen. He made every scene seem so believable. Director Lenny Abrahamson brought this movie to life with his amazing skills.Great movie. I would have loved to hear about \"Old Nick\" and seen more of Ma's parents on screen, but that's only mild. Not even close to destroy this whole film's powerful message. I give this 4/5 stars. -Autistic Jay",

The tragedy factor is only used as the background of the story.

            "content": "I absolutely loved this film and the way this tragic but at the same time sweet and hopeful story was told, which is mainly through the eyes and observations of this 5 year old boy Jack, whose view of the world completely changes when he is forced to come to grips with the fact that the world is a much bigger place than what he's known through living in the room. Jack and his mom share a relationship like no other, and it is rare that you see such a strong bond between two people portrayed in such an authentic and delicate way, by two incredible actors Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. These two provide the backbone of the story, their strength, their perseverance and the love they share is what makes the film-goers become so attached to these characters. The details that were put in this story make it so much more than just a story about 2 victims of a psychotic kidnapper that faced immense psychological trauma. For example, the way that Joy uses Alice in wonderland's story to explain to Jack what happened to her and why they were in room, or her facial expression as she looks up at the ceiling and wonders what will be the future of her child if she doesn't do anything to get him out of there. Joy's blank expression as she ponders the journalist's words of whether it would have been better to have asked Old Nick to get him out, shows a tormented soul that is struck with the realisation that she has potentially been a bad mother to the one thing she loves the most and has devoted her life to. The miracle of the story is that little Jack, as afraid and bewildered as he first is by this new world he is forced to enter, becomes the hero of the story and gives his mom his hair, in a way lending her his 'strong' to help her get through her depression. I've been a bad mother to you, Joy tells him and he replies with: You're Ma, ultimately the most important words that a mother could hear. An incredibly touching story involving two superb performances that I know I will be coming back to forever.",

The grittiness and true courage to make a film like this is highly commendable and its originality and uniqueness will forever stand out among the rest.One underrated thing is the performance by Jacob Tremblay who plays Jack, a scared young boy who struggles to grasp the true scale of life and everything in it. He is definitely a person to keep an eye on for the future and I'm sure he will have a successful career in acting should he continue on.

            "content": "It was on my watch-list since long and had a chance to watch it finally last weekend. Room is an interesting story of a 5-year-old boy's interpretation of the real world as it comes face to face with it after circumstances force him to be confined in a small room, totally isolated from the outside world, for the first five years of his life. The movie released in 2015. Story (10/10): Jack and Ma are being confined to a small room by their abductor who kidnapped Ma before Jack was born. Jack hasn't seen the real world - for him, there is no real world that exists outside the room - as explained by Ma who protects him from the abductor at all costs. She also makes sure he has everything he needs even within that small space. However, as he turns 5 and his curiosity about the world increases, Ma realizes it's time to introduce Jack to the world he needs to be a part of. As they implement their escape plan, lead by Jack, he encounters the real world - people, animals, natural phenomena, technology and a lot more. All his notions are challenged at once. The large part of the story is how the relationship between Ma and Jack changes as Jack, now, has a lot of questions for Ma - a little too much to handle for a young mother. However, Jack never gives up on his mother - the only person he trusts blindly in this world - as he slowly adjusts to the real world. While Jack adjusts to the real world, Ma finds herself understanding and adjusting to the new realities, emerged while she was abducted, that adds to her frustration. Acting (9/10): Without a doubt, Jacob Tremblay, playing Jack was the star of the movie and pretty much shouldered it. His acting was top notch as a confused lad who is in dilemma of what to believe and what not. Brie Larson had a tough role to play with a combination of multiple emotions at once sometimes. She was great to watch. Joan Allen made her presence felt in the supporting cast, playing Ma's mother and trying to connect with Jack. Some of her scenes with Jack are really touching as she becomes his second confidant after Ma. William Macy, playing Ma's father, has a very brief role to play compared to Joan Allen. Direction (9/10): Lenny Abrahamson excelled at telling a touching and a compelling story. His use of the camera in the opening scenes to project claustrophobia was impressive. The movie starts off as a little dark and depressing but it kind of opens up as Jack comes out of \"The Room\". While the central focus of the movie was Jack's association with Ma, Lenny also projected Jack's association with the room itself which starts from the opening scene and ends in the last scene. What I loved was the way that closure was brought. In addition, while the movie is very emotional, the melodrama has been almost nil - which made it very realistic. Overall, a very impressive effort. Overall (9/10): A great movie for a compelling story topped up with some amazing acting by the lead cast and great camera work.",

It's not the masterful experience I expected. Pacing is just way long. It's definitely got torture porn vibes even after the escape it turns into emotional torture porn. It's very one note as well. Tonally very weird in that the perspective shifts constantly. The kid's narration makes the film weaker because it's so randomly interjected. I don't really get Larson's flat performance winning an Oscar either. She's not bad at all, just not as convincing as the accolades. Constantly felt taken out of suspension of disbelief. Not emotionally a tear jerker, just hard to watch fiction",

Larson got the Oscar for best actress but Tremblay should have at least got a nomination for best supporting actor, as together they made the perfect pair on screen.

            "content": "Room is the story about 5 year old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and his mother Ma (Brie Larson) who are a typical loving mother and energetic son filled with curiosity and imagination in an anything but typical situation. They are both living, surviving, trapped in a 10 by 10 foot space that Ma has called Room in her best efforts to protect Jack from the absolutely unthinkable nightmare that is the only life he has ever known, a life she isn't sure will ever be anything else. However, miraculously, through Ma's ingenuity and guts and Jack's courage, one day, they escape. With their 10 x 10 Room behind them, they face a new world (literally) of hopes, possibilities, challenges and fears. I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch Room or Spotlight next with the Oscars upon us, but a good friend of mine, Steve Williams, strongly recommended Room. I'll be watching Spotlight next, but thank you to Steve for the recommendation. It was powerful. Larson has had supporting roles in Trainwreck, The Gambler and Don Jon along with multiple TV appearances, but this is her first leading role and she also looks right at home. In fact, her performance has not only earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, but many critics are predicting she will go home with the win and after watching the movie, it would be an award well-deserved. Room opens on Jack's 5th birthday. We find out later that Ma was abducted 7 years earlier and Jack was born and raised in Room. Her abductor makes regular visits (conjugal in nature) with Jack tucked away in Wardrobe. We already know from the preview that they do eventually escape and are given a chance to have a life outside Room, so that's not a spoiler there. I won't give it all away, but the escape will leave you breathless with white knuckles as you cling to whatever you have nearby. I really only had two minor issues with the movie. First, after she is reunited with her parents, Ma is unsettled to discover they had split and her mother (Joan Allen) had met a new man. Her father (William H. Macy) flies home to be there for the reunion, but quickly leaves and can't even look at Jack or address him. And then we don't see him again and are left wondering what happened. The second minor issue I had was that the preview uses part of its limited time to share a scene after their escape between Jack and Ma in which Jack is concerned about their abductor finding them again. Ma reassures him that it will never happen. And it doesn't come up again at all. It's handled just fine in the movie, but the issue is that the preview seemed to indicate it would be a factor in the aftermath. It wasn't. The aftermath of adjusting to the real world was dramatic enough as it was and didn't need to be in the preview.Room is a touching, heart-warming, intense, gripping, original and well-acted and well-told story that I thoroughly enjoyed. I predicted a solid 4 stars: worth the money in the theatre, worth watching again, and has a good chance of making it to my home collection, and that's exactly what I'm sticking with.marksmoviemind.blogspot.com",

Sadly, the film did not achieve the level of drama that the novel had in abundance. My husband (who has not read the book and knew nothing of the story) was in agreement. So many missed opportunities to look into the minds and emotions of these characters. The acting was fine but far too much of what made the book so fascinating was skimmed over and I'm not sure why..... I was particularly disappointed by the characterisation of 'Old Nick' (mid-cast, I feel, and we see little of his confused and confusing state of mind. Jack's relationship with the objects in the house is skimmed over and the conflicts of the grandparents were simply alluded to rather than properly explored. Perhaps this oversimplification of a complex and gripping story was an attempt to convey what was happening through Jack's eyes? If so, it didn't work for me.",

To put a story of a woman who is kidnapped at 17, and has a child, and finds a way to get him out of the Room - on the screen could not have been easy. The ability of Ma to keep Jack curious, to teach him, and protect him - to well presented. The script is so good. You are presented the aftermath of the events and they are presented with such probable truth. To go back to a world that is different that you had at 17 and then a 5 yr. old being able to experience it for the first time - well done.

Slowly it dawned on me that they were held captive by Old Nick and that the child had never seen the outside world, but knew television and some books and stories told by his mother. I was fascinated. Somehow the film succeeded in making me identify with every character in that movie. I tried to imagine what I would have done or thought if I would have been the mother, the child, Old Nick, the grandmother and grandfather, the partner of the grandmother . I loved the movie. I loved the performances. I loved how it make me think and feel and imagine living in a world reduced to a room . I loved the art the two captives were creating and the love they had for each other.

After all, it's more difficult to reconstruct the original world when it collapses than to return to the real environment from ignorance. That's why mom can't stand it and son is braver.

The film\u00b4s concept is necessary for these to work, and they do indeed, in what can potentially be a powerful and beautiful eye-opening experience.\nI\u00b4m generally against voice-overs but the kid\u00b4s narrations are wonderful. One of them specifically is brilliant as a joyful tearjerker.\nThe Bad:\nThe second half isn\u00b4t remotely as confident as the first one. That\u00b4s a pity because the point is very interesting and had the potential to become a seriously outstanding film.\nFocusing on the boy is a great way to manage such a complicated emotion as the adaptation to the real world and the film should probably have gone all the way with that idea. We don\u00b4t really see the world through his eyes as much as it is intended to because we\u00b4re stepping out of him too often. The childish amazement loses most of the presence for quite a while. We\u00b4re left with small bits of information about other characters while the boy\u00b4s transition loses detail.\nThe Ugly:\nThis is the kind of film that inspires reactionary ratings. We\u00b4ll see how it holds up with time. Some people might want to put it down because most people will overlook its flaws in favor of the torrent of emotions it produces at its best moments.",

It didn't need to be ultra-explicit visually, but 'Room' was presented more like a hankies-at-the-ready emo weepfest than a genuinely harrowing study in cruelty and repression. As for the 2nd half of the movie, the attempts at scenes of angsty/shouty family drama and turmoil were from the straight-to-DVD standard school of acting. All in all a bland, boring and forgettable excercise in hollywood 'realism'.",

            "content": "Room was a film that i was very intrigued to see to the extent i actually did go out of my way to see it. I knew barely anything about it, i had seen the trailer a good few times in front of other movies but i never looked into it a great deal. It is one of those rare films that never strikes as something that would be worth going out of the way for, until it is actually released and then you think about it and realise you in fact do want to see it because it peaked my interest a great deal. With that being said, i do not regret my decision. It is a film i highly recommend in fact.First of all, Brie Larson stars as the main character, a young woman who was abducted from a young age and is forced to raise her son who is now five years old in a confined space that they deem 'room'. She gives us an incredible performance, i had only really seen her as Jonah Hill's love interest in 21 Jump Street, but she is so different here that it is hard to recognise her without prior knowledge of who she is. The stand out however is young Jacob Tremblay who plays the young boy Jack. I will say this now, he is really going places and will be a big star in the future if he carries on with performances like this. As a child actor his performance sucked me in as much as the big nominations currently in the Oscars. Whilst being vague, when you actually get to see him experience the outside world for the first time it really brought tears to my eyes because he plays the role in such a way that you really believe he has only known that one plave his whole life. For example he sees 'Old Nick' (the man who is keeping them captive) as a sort of magical being who brings them clothes etc. Because he has never even seen another person in his life. This makes it all the more interesting when he experiences real life people for the first time.At it's core the film is really a powerful story about the bond between a mother and son, but as well as this it is a metaphor for life itself and how we can take it for granted. With such amazing performances from the two leads it became something really special and whilst it is shocking and heartwrenching in places by the end it becomes a real uplifting, inspiring gem. As much as it may be tempting to ignore this film in favour of all the terrible comedies January is notable for, please don't. This is a film that must be seen. When i first saw it i thought maybe it dragged on 5 minutes too long, but in fact looking back i wouldn't take anything out. It shows us that nothing is more powerful than love and for that alone it deserves to be seen.",

            "content": "Emma Donoghue adapts her own successful novel for the big screen in this Oscar-nominated drama that could be based on real events. Room begins in a tiny room, a converted shed in the back garden of an abductor. Brie Larson (this is surely a breakout role for the supporting actor from comedies such as 21 Jump Street and Scott Pilgrim vs The World) plays Joy, the woman who has been trapped there for 7 years, and this is all her five-year old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) has ever known. His conception of the world is limited to \"Skylight\" and \"Wardrobe\", with the place outside the room merely outer space. I don't want to say much more - don't watch the trailer! - as you should really, definitely, see this film. Room, at different times over the course of its runtime, sets different tones. The beginning is harsh, uncomfortable and harrowing. The claustrophobic direction, with Danny Cohen's expert cinematography, honestly makes you feel like there is nothing outside of this Room. The entire lives of our two central characters are on display, with literally nowhere to hide, and the nasty, desolate situation is equal parts hard to watch and finely crafted. From this desperate, harrowing scenario comes suspense, with a tense, breathless atmosphere concocted with almost no action. However, what I perceived as the prevailing tone of the film (chiefly due to my optimistic nature) was the beauty and wonderment of the piece. Somewhat like Inside Out, the only way to describe Room is simply beautiful. The relationship between mother and son is rarely so sublimely depicted. Even through all the pain and suffering that they go through, director Lenny Abrahmason conveys the love wonderfully, helped by skilled, natural performances. Whilst some scenes are sad enough to bring a tear to the eye, I found myself closer to crying in some of the less depressing scenes - embraces, reunions, etc., which is helped by a score that seems jarringly loud due to the still quiet of most of the rest of the film. When the music kicks in, you know it's a special moment. The convincing nature of the piece is supported by two giants of performances in the form of the astonishing Tremblay, who hopefully has a bright future ahead of him, and the rightly-award-tipped Larson. Tremblay helps steer Room from the pitfalls of a precocious, irritating child actor with a natural and believable role, conveying wonderment and joy at the situation that we, and his mother, know as horribly bleak. His tantrums are like watching a real child in motion, and he comes out as the lead actor - a tough feat, but successfully achieved. Meanwhile, as Joy, Larson bears all the sadness and anger that is the inverse of her innocent and wide- eyed son. The supporting performances, especially from Joan Allen as Joy's mother, and William H. Macy as her father, are equally brilliant. I struggled to think of anything wrong with Room. And it's true; very little keeps it from being a perfect 10. And having waited a couple of days, I have still not come to any realisation of negativity. I suppose all I can say is that it is not incredibly memorable - I may not watch this film much in the future, and it's tough to watch. However, Room holds up as one of the very greatest films of 2015. 95/100.",

It's the parents responsibility to nurture their children. Most people are products of their environment. Learning always starts at home. What is the right way and what is the wrong way of things. People only do what they think is the right thing. Others may not see things the same way as others. It all boils down to a persons perspective. In my opinion, don't try and hide your children from the world, because eventually the world will find them. You can protect your children and keep them away from things that you believe are unsafe, there's nothing wrong with that, however, make sure that you explain both sides of the coin thoroughly. As I say, a child's mind is a terrible thing to waste. Children are our future, their fragile, and their full of life. Don't poison or destroy their minds because it may affect them mentally in the future. I truly believe that children are more in touch with humanity than adults are.",

My heart was beating so fast when the boy was in the back of Old Nick's truck. I was literally at the edge of my feet. It also brought tears to my eyes when Grandma tells Ma that she wasn't the only one whose life was destroyed. I felt that. Because as a mom, as horrible as it sounds, you'd much rather know your child has passed rather than know that they're probably still out there being tortured, beaten, raped, sold, etc. and you don't know where. I can only imagine how antagonizing that must be. How do you find closure never knowing what happened to your child? This movie is really good. I like how Jack narrates the story because it shows how a little boy his age makes sense of things, how he gathers up what he knows and build his logic based upon that. He's so innocent, yet so smart. I love how his character develops from being a secluded boy to being out in the big world.",

Some of them are more bombastic like when Rocky made it to the top of the steps or when ET and Elliot fly past the moon on the bike. Room is a more subtle film and its many moments are more personal but no less memorable. No film has ever pulled such an emotional and physical response from me. Like the graveyard scene in Saving Private Ryan or the end of Toy Story 3, the more you see it the harder it hits you but this film extends that feeling for two hours.Much praise has been given to Brie Larson's career defining performance as Ma and she has deserved every award she's won and if there are any she lost she should've gotten them to. She becomes a mother as a teenager, so unprepared, yet she is everything you want in one. Jack is her everything, gives her life meaning that it previously did not have. It's a subtle performance but one of the most powerful, certainly of recent memory. Consider a scene where a reporter asks if she will ever tell Jack about his father. Her response is flawless. The words tell so much but her face... If you watch this scene with the sound of you may not understand what is happening but you will feel everything you are supposed to feel.What stuns me is how little hardware given to Jacob Tremblay. No child actor in the history of cinema has given a performance half as good as his and like all works of artistic brilliance, I struggle to understand why he is so effecting. Maybe its because he is far too young to understand the weight of what is going on. I think its his eyes, his entire face seems too big for his head, very emotive. Whatever it is, he has me wrapped around his little finger. When he is smiling, I'm tearing up with joy, when he is scared I am sobbing in fear (I've seen this three times and I'm practically dehydrated every time) That is not to say that this film is as easily digestible as ET or Rocky. As its plot would dimply, this film is often dark and it is often disturbing. But this is not the horror film that it so easily could have been (though there is a sequence in the middle that is so intense, i want to call it heart pounding but i can't, my heart stopped cold) in fact this is the most uplifting film since Shawshank. For the payoff to have any emotional impact, you have to put the characters through hell. Ultimately this is a film about survival. Jack survived because he is a child and that is what children do, they adapt. Ma survives too, not because of some inner strength but because of Jack. Watch this film and give your mom a hug",

I almost did not watch it.I was afraid to see some sort of exploitation of the ordeals suffered by the three Cleveland girls. Their stories touched me very personally, as for so long when I would stop at the gas station or the 7-11 to buy smokes (so long ago now) I would see their \"missing\" posters. And as time went by, those 8x11 paper posters began to fray at the edges, to become ripped at the tape holding them up, and then to disappear; just like the girls on them. I do not recall noticing when the posters disappeared... and that makes me feel guilty. Especially after they were freed, and I remembered that I had forgotten them.So I put off \"Room\" for last. I didn't want to feel guilty all over again. (No escaping Catholic upbringing.)I am pleased to report that after 10 minutes I felt no guilt watching \"Room\". I am even more pleased to report that I felt many other emotions: fear, revulsion, despair, hope, patience (is that an emotion?), sympathy, and empathy. That last is surprising, since nothing in my life could prepare me to empathize with a 5 year old boy who only knows the inside of a back yard shed, then suddenly must deal with the world. The real world. Most of all, I felt astonishment. At this late date it is hard for me to imagine discovering the world. But it was so easy to share Jack's astonishment. I felt like a five year old who knew nothing but the inside of a small room then suddenly must deal with the world. I felt what Jack was feeling. And for me, that makes it the best movie of the year.A tender, thoughtful movie. The one that touched me, instead of just entertaining me.My choice for Best Movie. I know it will not win. But what do the voters know?",

This film is almost indescribable it's so good. This is the kind of film we get when everyone involved is at the top of their game. You can't just credit director Lenny Abrahamson, or screenwriter Emma Donoghue, or stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, or composer Stephen Rennicks solely. This was a team effort. Brie Larson gives the bets acting performance of this decade as Joy/Ma, a mother lost at sea, metaphorically speaking. Jacob Tremblay gives a performance way beyond his years. The Academy made a serious mistake not nominating him for an award. Joan Allen, in what little screen time she has, gives one of, if not the most unappreciated performance of the year. Lenny Abrahmson has been quietly going about his business in Ireland. He certainly shocked most people with this film. His talent is undeniable and the Academy Award nomination was just the reward he warranted. Emma Donoghue's novel and script are both outstanding, and I believe that The Big Short was lucky to win the Adapted Screenplay award. Stephen Rennicks is a complete unknown in the world of film composing. I feel this may change. His work on this film is a revelation. The moment in this film where all the people named above are at their best is when Ma runs to the police car in which Jack is waiting. The slow-motion running is astounding. The music is extremely moving. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are as good as they were for the rest of the film. I don't know why I waited so long to see this film.

The strength of the mother and the child was an impressive thing to see. Instead of giving up, she did her best to turn a small shack into the world for her boy. It would be incredibly difficult to raise a child in that situation, and especially one who is happy and loving. The acting was amazing by Brie and Jacob. Jacob especially did such a great job for someone so young. This must have been a difficult job for him but he handled it perfectly. Brie had to show such a large range of emotion, and earned her awards for sure. You believe every bit of it. I can't say much about the actual story without giving things away. I suggest if you haven't seen this, go watch it now. Don't watch a trailer, don't read any more reviews. That's how I went into it, and I think that is the best way to see it.

            "review_title": "Room",
            "content": "What is a room? It's an enclosed space. Those two notions, when broken down, alomst seem incompatible, for to be enclosed is to limit or constrain the space within something, whereas space is the expansive area in which things, people, and places exist. But unbounded space is not only infinite, but also almost meaningless, since spaces are defined by their boundaries. This is the heart of what Room is about: the fundamental hum,an exoperience of and connection to space, spaces, and the reality of people and things within those spaces to our conception of the world around us and our experience even of our own selves. Room explores these ideas overtly and narration that explicitly speaks from the perspective of one of the main protagonists, a young boy with extremely limited and innacurate experience of the world even for his young age, on confused notions of \"inside\" and \"outside\". His whole reality, all he's ever known is a single Room and to him it is the world. It is also a prison. His mother is a young woman who was kidnapped as a highschooler and repeatedly raped (and thus impregnated) by her captor (also the boy's father). He believes the outside world doesn't really exist and the images of the outside he sees on the TV they were provided in thier \"home\" are fake. There are no real trees or dogs or cars, because he only sees them in images on a screen and was told by his mother (ostensibly for the sake of sparing him knowledge of that which he may never see) that these things were not real and that all that was real was their world: \"Room\". Much like we call our world \"Earth\". There's a whole lot of the \"Allegory of the Cave\" in this tale. When the characters eventually break free (after a tense escape plan) they must strugle to adapt their reality. They have opposite, but equally difficult adjustments to make to reconcile their new reality with thier old one. The child has a bigger gap to bridge: the entire conception of reality he has has been a mixture of confusion, simplification, limitation, and lie (albeit white lies). When his mother starts explaining the truth, it is litterally world shattering to him and he reacts with hostility and denial (as we all do when our Truths are challenged). When he actually sees the outside world, it is strange, surreal, and overwhelming to him. He cannot process the stimulation, the pace, and complexities. But he is young and still \"plastic\". His situation, while extreme, is not so different for a concentrated does of the kind of confused revelations that all childhood consists of, and which allow for growth and expansion. His world, though expanded radically, becomes quickly accepted. Relatively speaking, anyway.His mother, on the other hand, initially deals much better. She has the euphoria of escaping and being safe. She is not overwhelmed and has an ingrained muscle-memory of how to interact with people, things, and to live in the world. Only after some time does the horrifying and inescapable truth set in: that, although she's escaped and now is back living in a world she'd spent the last 7 years dreaming and praying she mght one day return to, a whole chapter of her early life was stolen, the trajectory of her life inalterably transformed from what it could have been, and in some sense her life can never be normal. She can't go back to being a teenager. The people she left behind, though they no doubt suffered, went on living. They aren't the same. Her parents are both older, divorced, and changed. She may have reclaimed life, but not her old life... that is gone forever. The acceptance of the new is more easily accomplished than letting go of the past and of lost dreams.These dual existential crises continue to be portrayed throughout the film as problems of space, of size and scope. The mother can't relate to the people she held so close before because they no longer share a common point of reference. No one can know what she's been through or how she's feeling. She feels alone. The boy sees so much that he just can't square, he feels the opposite of alone, instead retreating inward and wishing to retreat back to \"Room\" where everything was so much simpler: just him and his mom and the transient, though traumatic, prescence of their captor (\"Old Nick\" as they called him). Later in the film, though both a gesture of solidarity and of some intrinsic commonality between these two poles and by some dialogue, the film expands that isolation of self through shared human love... stating that we as human find strenth in each other-in our relationships and mutual support-an expansion of self that creates community and family in much the way the world of the enclosed space of a room can expand to break free of those boundaries to include many rooms and many spaces within a multiplicity of spaces.There's so much mataphor and subtext here that a single viewing and the time and thought I've given it thus far can't possibly fully flesh out all the dimensions of this film. It's applicatible to so many things-social, psychological, anthropological. But it's also a film deeply intimate in our humanity and in the portrayal of the characters, their experiences, the overall transitions and transformations for those characters, and well executed attention to small details like that the boy has to now learn to walk down stairs or wear shoes for the first times. It struggles with the contradiction of how a prison can nevertheless become a place we may still in some way regard as \"home\" and even miss once gone, all while still being glad to be free from it. Much the way we can miss an ex from an otherwise bad relationship or miss a small crumby apartment during difficult times after moving to a better, bigger dwelling, or miss simplistic notions of childhood once we've learned and grown and become wiser. Those smaller, simpler, albeit more confining and even hostile worlds, may not exactly represent a kind of Stockholm sindrome so much as they represent the innature human tendency to perceive reality and attach a sense of our own personage, of both ownership and identity, to our surroundings and our sense of self. A room is not just an enclosed space, but typically refers to a purposefully but arbitrarily made one, crafted and maintained both for refuge from the hostile outside world and also to give structure and organization to an otherwise unstructured and chaotic reality of nature.Room is not just an enclosed space, but space itself. To have room is to have space and to have more room is to have more space. As rooms and spaces expand or contract, so to do their bounded realities. When the mother and boy return to \"Room\" at the end of the film, it looks impressively small on the screen (wonderful cinematography) whereas earily it had seemed quite large with lots of scenes shot at different angles and dialogue of our child protagonist detailing the expanse of his territory (\"good morning, sink!, good morning, chair!, good morning bed!\"). There's a lot of subtle camera work like this and small plot or sequence elements that add richness to a film that otherwise could have just been another A&E special about a kidnapping victim. But this one does not begin a crime and end with an escape. This one begins with introducing and fleshing out a world, small though it may be, then explaining its origin and by explaining that world it thus tears apart and breaks that world down like Captain Ahab finding the White Whale. The great secret of this reality being revealed, the challenge is to escape from this reality and back to that Golden Age of Before, before the cataclysm, only to find that the old world cannot be rebuilt. The film ends, not with the destuction of the world we finally found to be fraudulent, but with the confrontation of incompatibility between the past, present, past-perceived futures, and presently-perceived futures in the narrative of a human mind and within the turmult of the human heart and spirit and the difficult and painful process of reconciling, processing, absorbing, and reframing those things to create new realities. So it is with all tragedy, loss, grief, and trauma. This film has the courage to stand up and really look at these concepts in smart, honest, realistic ways.Room is not a happy or even pleasant experience, but it is moving, deep, and memorable. It does offer hope and a good deal to chew on for days, weeks, months to come. While the overt overtures to spatial concepts and identity are there, they are well complimented by an easier to follow narrative of human tragedy and emotion along with less overt nods to those topics to continue adding dimension at times where the film might have otherwise has reverted to formulaic linear storytelling. It's not a movie you'll long to see again to relive the experience, but it is a movie that will stick with you long enough that you end up rewatching to continue peeling that onion.",

Her acting felt so real that I could relate so much of a similar person with similar emotions of distress.The shooting done is the Room was very smart, they captured the essence pretty well. Even in later house, the close door cinematography was done with great angles of stairs.Its the little things that I loved, learning to walk down the stairs, world outside being TV, the attention to details. Movie starts with Goodmorning and ends with Bye Bye.\nThe thrill that was involved in the escape sequence was perfect.I love that they didn't waste time on things that I thought they would, 'oh whole 2hr movie is ganna take place in a Room... nope' , 'oh the other half will be about finding the Ma... nope' realistic use of Satallite to find the truck, fabulous writing of 3 Stop Sign. The movie was grounded in reality, hence I love it so much.The characters had great progression, she would definitely have this kind of reaction given the trauma of being 'Thankful' to others. Her trying her best for the child, breastfeeding till 5 years and understanding she isn't a good Ma, but still HIS Ma.Idea of long hair being Strength and the whole outside World being TV, beauty of storytelling.",

            "review_title": "Room - a film about the ineffable bond between Mother and child despite horrific circumstances",
            "content": "Kidnapped at fourteen and locked up in a room for seven years with a five year old child conceived through violence, director Lenny Abrahamson's film inspired by Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name - a composite of true events - is titled ROOM; a delicate and harrowing story of two people caught in a private space, where they live a life of extreme tenderness and tension. The actors are excellent, Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack create a home/neighborhood/community/country inside a small, cluttered \"room\" with occasional shafts of light beaming down from a skylight that displays the stars and moving clouds - the outside \"world\" a dream beyond their reach.A television sputtering on the blink allows that other \"world\" entry, but for young Jack, what he sees flickering on the screen is both real and \"make believe\" ; distinctions have been erased and are unknowable. The relationship between mother and child is stunning - the connection between them is acutely poignant, as if the umbilical cord had never been severed. Days are spent exercising, running back and forth- sharp turns are necessary after a few steps, making us aware of the claustrophobic feel of the space; and Ma's attempt to teach her son to read and maintain a somewhat \"normal\" existence is impressive and heart-rending. Jack's poetic and descriptive use of words to describe his circumscribed environment invokes the originality and charm of expressing and interpreting what we see and feel through language tailored to one's unique cosmos. We also witness the chilling visits of \"Old Nick\" her captor whose step on the stairs on his way to the \"room\" is a sign for little Jack to hide and feign sleep behind a shuttered closet door - the presence of \"evil\" glimpsed through cracks in the battered and weatherworn slats.When Jack turns five his mother decides he is old enough to participate in an escape plan involving resilience and courage which eventually succeeds. Mother and child are hospitalized and the second half of ROOM begins. How to acclimate one's self to being separate individuals, after the powerful link between them is sundered - a tie which was both nourishing and restrictive? Accommodation to \"freedom\" begins, and the aching awareness of the familiar becoming unfamiliar, as well as the unfamiliar becoming familiar, are daunting and formidable.ROOM is an exquisitely fragile story of the pliancy of the human resolve to survive and adapt to suffocating circumstances and adjust to the shock of change after flight and rescue. A child's ability to embrace the magic of his new environs - as one Dr. mentioned in examining Jack, \"he is still plastic\"; and an adult's more complex road to acclimatization which includes grieving the loss of a singular bond where the \"other\" completes you to the exclusion of everyone else.",

I was confined to this little room for more than 40 minutes of the film. Suddenly Ma decides that Jack has to help them get out of this situation. He was able to run away very easily and then the rest of the film was about their life at the grandparents. William Macy is a great actor but I don't know why he was needed in this role. He could have been a good kidnapper. Ma attempting suicide was not believable as no one who had been confined to a room would ever imagine committing suicide after what they both went through and were given a new life.Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay were good as actors so I have some hope for them.

            "content": "Lenny Abrahamson's Room is poignant. Room is evocative. Room is devastatingly beautiful. There is a magic in creating a world in a child's perspective. To capture and display the innocence, the purity, the sheer amount of confusing vastness of the world is no mean feat. Writer Emma Donoghue, who is also the writer of the book that the film is based upon, and director Lenny Abrahamson manage to do just that.The film starts with the pair of mother and son, Joy and Jack, played by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay living their lives while scrapping for resources yet finding solace in each other's company, in a room. That is right. In a single room (which later revealed to be a garden shed with a skylight as the only source of sun). The reason behind this ordeal revealed to be that Joy had been abducted by person referred only as 'Old Nick'. Old Nick kept Joy and Jack, who is his biological son, sans any means of communication with the outside world and had them live a life devoid of any hope to go back to the world.Without revealing much about what happens next in the film, it can be said that what follows is one of the heart-wrenching and heart-warming story about love, innocence and those little joys of the world that we often overlook. There is a slight tonal shift in the second half as the tension of escape and sweetness of the love between mother and son gets replaced with Joy facing the reality of the world. But the change is in coherence with the story and that helped in underlining the difficulty both protagonists, especially Joy, is facing in their new world. Even without reading the book, I must say that the screenplay immensely helped in establishing the dichotomy of the emotions that the protagonists went through. Lenny Abrahamson's direction complemented that aforementioned dichotomy. The first act was shot quite meticulously in the closed room, thus providing a sense of foreboding and an urge for escape.Although bolstered by a good support cast the film largely centers around the mother, played by Brie Larson and the son, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson, whose hitherto best performance perhaps had been in the largely underrated 2013 film Short Term 12, churned out a superlative and breathtaking performance as the mother. The role was a delight for an actor of her capability and she made the character her own. Restrained and gritty while being captive in the room and yet lovingly playing with her son; Vulnerable and fragile, being captive of her own thoughts and insecurities, while trying to get her son attuned to the big world; Brie Larson shines throughout her role.But, the film would not have been so pure, so emotional, so magical without the brilliant performance of Jacob Tremblay, as the 5 year old. It is one of the finest performances from a child I have ever seen. The fear of the task her mother asked, then the taste of freedom, then again the intimidation of the vast world that had hitherto been unknown to him. We feel everything through the wondrous performance of Jacob Tremblay and he genuinely smiled in the film when seeing a 'real' dog for the first time, it becomes difficult to hold tears back.At this point, it would not be fair if Stephen Rennick's score is not mentioned. The music, with the appropriate usage, bolstered the scenes and helped the film in taking the audience for the ride.Room is a film that would provide its audiences a perspective that we often ignore; and for this very reason it is a film that should not be missed.",

The directing was also brilliant. Emotions and drama are well established in the film. My only problem with the video is how the boy escaped from the room, which was performed in a frenzy. In fact, it is impossible for anyone not to see a child who is dead or alive at the insistence of his mother! It was ridiculous, but other than that, the whole movie is great and brilliant. 8/10",

            "content": "The scenario is interesting enough. A mother and her little son are imprisoned for 7 years by a man in small shed halfway down his garden. We think of the horrors experienced by similar victims publicized in the media and we are immediately intrigued to learn more about this phenomenon. But very sadly this film does not fulfill its potential. It concentrates almost entirely on what appears to be a hackneyed feminist agenda - namely the love of a mother for her son - rather than breaking new ground and explaining to us how and why such things occur. In short it leaves far more questions unanswered than it manages to solve.There are too many absurdities to list in this production.With only a single door between her and freedom it beggars belief that the mother was not able to force it open or make her escape at the moment it was opened. There was a skylight to the roof but in 7 years she had not the ingenuity to smash it and escape. There were various metal objects around the room and it would not have been impossible.The man enters the room and sleeps with her regularly. Indeed their relationship seems quite calmly domestic. He does not need to force sex upon her but they simply undress and relate as if normal husband and wife. And both are able to sleep peacefully at night as if everything was normal. She complains at the food and he tells her that he has no work and struggles to keep them both. He buys presents for the boy and seems reasonable normal and decent.It doesn't make any sense. Any man who would imprison a woman and child in a tiny shed for 7 years must be insane. And yet every action of this man is rational. And we are told nothing about the origins of the story. How did her relationship with the man ever materialize? How long after meeting did he imprison her? How did it ever happen? Instead of covering this ground we are subjected to nearly two hours of thoroughly predictable motherly behavior as if we could not imagine it ourselves. Brie Larson executes the task quite competently but this was not an Oscar winning performance. She merely left her Gucci gowns in the closet, left her make up in the drawer and acted herself. Her award was purely a boost to the underlying feminist message of the film.But the boy was something else. Jacob Tremblay dominated the film in every way. His mood swings, his emotions, his play as a boy half his real age and his capture of our imagination in every scene was nothing short of masterful. Not only should he have been given the Oscar but his performance illustrates the need to introduce a new category in the annual ceremony: Best performance by a child actor. He certainly deserved it.",

It had a brilliant outlook on relationships which slowly grew throughout the film. As for the plot, I can't hide the fact that I was a little disappointed that there weren't enough twists in the tail. It is also a little slow to progress for such a long film. As for any horror, it should have the fear factor and for me this just wasn't there. With the slow pace, things remained on a level and dare I say it, were a little dull. The ending and latter part of the film was far better than the first, due to a more interesting storyline though. Music and effects could have enhanced things aswell as a more varied camera angle. Some cut scenes or other characters would have helped keep things more entertaining for the duration of the film.

Moving into the movie with this hype, there is almost no way to not get excited.In my opinion the plot is separated into two parts. The first part is really interesting and causes you to think about lots of things, and this results into some more expectations. Pretty much every scene makes sense, until the part that Ma rolls Jack into the carpet. And then, everything goes the opposite way...When Jack goes into the truck, the second part begins. I thought the movie was starting to get really exciting and dramatic, but it never happened. I thought the movie can't be that simple. I even thought Jack was in a dream and everything was just the preview of what will happen. But he wasn't dreaming. The police immediately found out Ma, and the rest of the second part is pretty much boring.Now, i don't know if i'm unemotional or something, but i didn't get the dramatic side of it. I didn't feel what they experienced. The movie is just not good enough to tell it. Not to mention, there are lots of logical errors such as them not thinking about breaking the window. I know that there is a psychological part of it, and actually that's the point that i'm talking about, the movie just doesn't tell it well enough.If Jacob Tremblay wouldn't carry the movie by himself with his absolutely amazing acting, i would definitely give this movie a lower rating and say that it doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination.

This one is about, according to IMDb:After five-year-old Jack and his mother escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, the boy makes a thrilling discovery.\"A strange one, based on a book that I haven't read. So, I won't be making any comparisons to the book in this review. Plus, an adaptation should be able to stand alone, and not require extra reading to be a complete experience. Moving on.Ultimately Room is a success, it's got some pretty great performances and direction, and the movie is put together really well. Brie Larson does a really great job, and you are pulled into her world and really feel her frustrations. Jacob Tremblay is massively annoying, but I think that falls directly in line with his character. While Jack and Ma are stuck in Room, you feel the tension that the small space creates in very believable ways. Still though, he's really irritating.One of the biggest standouts of this movie is the editing. Especially once Jack escapes from the titular Room. You see the world from his perspective, and the way the scenes are shot and edited together fill you with a very real feeling of being overwhelmed, and experiencing an entire world that you've never seen. It's nice to see filmmakers who know how to SHOW and not tell.This certainly won't be making any of my \"favourite movies ever\" lists, but it really does work to communicate an effective story. It's not my pick for Best Picture either, but I'm not going to pretend that it's unwatchable.This one is up for Best Picture, Best Lead Actress (Brie Larson), Best Directing, and Best Adapted Screenplay. There's a good chance for adapted screenplay or maybe Lead Actress, but those are the strongest impressions for me.The main characters are Ma and Jack, so you do have a solid female character driving the movie. She's pretty dynamic and interesting too, the things that she is willing to do (or more specifically, have Jack do) in order to escape are pretty intense and staggering. That said, like Brookyln, this movie is lacking in the department of characters who are not cisgendered, heterosexual, white people. (With that total sitting at zero, once again).",

The escape sequence, seen both from the astounded Jack's eyes as well as a drone's eye view, grabs the viewer and makes him feel he IS little Jack, if just for a moment.As the escape is executed, it becomes plain that this is a high-grade chick flick. Instinctive motherhood and female mind games that most men would never think of present revelations to those with Y chromosomes, twists that that the brutal Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) never sees coming. Brie Larson's acting, even as her character acts, convinces everyone.There are only three, well, two questions that much of the audience may have: 1) Why was grampa Robert (in a fairly brief appearance by William H Macy) unable to look at Jack? 2) Why did it take forEVer to get Jack's hair cut? (This question is beautifully resolved, by the way.) and 3) This is when you know it is a woman's story: Why, in seven years of captivity, did Ma never think to stand the bed on its end and climb out through the plastic skylight?Those questions aside, ROOM gets ten stars for acting, direction, and cinematography.

Watching this made me realize even more what that poor woman must have endured, as the real story is far more harrowing yet, starting with the unfathomable amount of time, 24 years of imprisonment, the perpetrator being her own father, and bearing 7 children (and losing one) of which 3 lived down there with her.

The connection between Ma and yourself is almost immediate. Even if you don't know what's exactly coming (my case, since I never watched any trailers), the emotion and soul she irradiates is obvious from the start. Through the movie you feel with her, fear for her, and just love her for the love that she has for her son, Jack. Watching her as she does everything she can to make Jack's life \"normal\" is both heart breaking, and heartwarming. Jacks innocence, his naivety from everything on the outside, and his own way of \"coping\" with something he doesn't even realize he's coping with, it tugs at your heart. You feel for this kid, as you feel for the mother, and yet he knows nothing else. We want him to have a normal life, when to him, his life is normal.As amazing and strong as the premise is, the way the film was made is simply put, amazing. The acting is superb, especially from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. You're not watching an actress and actor play mother and son; you are watching a mother and son.

            "review_title": "Powerful premise, but disappointing execution",
            "content": "This film's premise is soul-crushingly powerful. Hearing about the similar real-life cases in Austria like Natascha Kampusch and Josef Fritzl was incredibly devastating, and honestly even quite hard to believe. If events like this didn't indeed happen in reality, the film would arguably be labelled as \"absurdly unbelievable\". But shockingly this does have a very real backing. The writer's decision to keep this fictional was respectable; truly basing this on a real story or person would not be very tactful and may come off as trivializing the trauma of the victims.There is much gained from the premise alone, especially one as relatively unexplored as this one is. However, executionally there were so many problems that the premise shines as all this film really has. As powerful as it may be, it cannot save poor acting, narrative, direction, and even story. In fact, these elements even mitigated the brutal power that stems from the premise.The mom played by Brie Larson is the key actress we see the most in the entire movie, and unfortunately her acting was awful enough that it was tough to actually bear any semblance of sympathy for her character. Her crying was not believable, and that's an important one to get right for this kind of role. Otherwise she mostly came off as just annoying. The kid was mostly annoying and very spoiled too. Perhaps this was somewhat intentional: after being trapped for 7 years, one is not exactly going to be a testament to human behavior, especially not a child. But it did make it tough to garner any true sympathy for the characters. The actors who did a great job in this film were the female police officer and all 3 grandparents (including the creepy stepdad), but they weren't major enough to make much of an impact.Without sympathy as a forefront, it begs the question: What is the narrative of this film? Emma Donoghue seemed to just hang back and portray some snippets out of Jack's life, all without cohesion, relying purely on the premise alone to carry the narrative. The beginning setup and up until breaking out of the room was clear enough, but everything that happens after is very muddy. Why are we seeing the aftermath, the grandparents, the TV interview, the newfound daily life of the child? It's clear that Donoghue wished to show all the complicated facets of this situation, both during and after. But this conflicts with the character's perspective whose eyes we're seeing the film through, namely the child. We should be seeing an interesting perspective on the outside world, and how everything is brand new to him now. We get only a small sliver of that, when he's looking at the sky while in the truck. After that, all that the latter half of the film really boils down to, without proper narrative, is just pointless melodrama and immature conflict shown for zero reason. What is actually compelling or interesting about any of this from the child's eyes?The first half of the story was decent enough except for one very unbelievable part: why would the guy not check if the child was really dead? It would have been very simple for him to do. It is really tough to believe that he successfully didn't fall for any of her tricks for 7 long years and now proved stupid enough to fall for this. It is possible that she played a masterfully long game and simply never tried any tricks up until that, so he wouldn't have any reason to suspect her of trickery. But this was not shown or built up, as we enter the film 7 years in already. Hence, regardless of the hypothetical believability of the situation, what is displayed or presented to us as a cinema viewer comes off as strange and not believable.Overall this was a disappointment. A premise as strong as this one has sadly been ruined by just plain bad filmmaking.",

Brie Larson is at her best ever, since \"Short Term 12\", playing the scorned Ma, having to make ultimate sacrifices for her son Jack, played by the excellent Jacob Tremblay. It is their performances what made \"Room\" hit all the heartfelt notes in an unforgettable way. Every individual and duel moment from them will take your breath away.

I didn't think at first the kid was a boy and thought he was actually a girl that the mother was hiding from the rapist.The film has so much emotions from the time the kid finally jumps out of the car to Joy trying to kill herself.

            "content": "\"Room\" is based on the 2010 novel of the same name, written by Irish-Canadian author Emma Donoghue who was also responsible for the film's screenplay. It tells the story of a 5-year old boy named Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and his Ma (Brie Larson), who are living in the confines of a small enclosure after Ma was kidnapped by a man when she was 17, and has been held captive there for last 7 years. This same man was responsible for Jack's birth, so Jack knows nothing or has seen anything else in his life apart from this room he's currently holed up in. After a daring escape plan finally frees Ma and himself, both individuals must find a way live a customary lifestyle again, but things are much harder than it seems.\"Room\" works simply because of how unembellished and dreary it's narrative is and how seamlessly Larson, Tremblay and Joan Allen fit into this world of hopelessness. The acting from the two leads are stunning; you will not see a more genuine and heartbreaking Mother & Son relationship as this for a long time. Their rapport and on screen chemistry was dazzling. Larson exudes that devoted motherly persona, doing her utmost to keep her child protected at any cost and blames herself forcefully for the situation they find themselves in. She doesn't care about her own wellbeing; everything she does, all her actions and rational thinking is about how she can get her child out of this nightmare and how to bring his life back around to normality. If you loved her in Short Term 12, she takes it up another notch here with a monumental display of sadness, anger & pure unadulterated love. Amazing, Oscar worthy stuff and if she won it would very much deserved; a performance that packs an almighty wallop.Tremblay couldn't have played this role any better and he can easily join the ranks of the greatest child performances I've ever seen. It's a difficult part to play, but like Larson he gives his character so much depth and complexity and carries the same amount of care and affection for his 'Ma' that she has for him. Being such a young age, he doesn't quite understand what's going on, so he takes whatever his Ma says as gospel. He only knows 'Room'. He only knows what he see's on the TV in Room. He only knows the sky is blue. He doesn't know there's a huge universe out there waiting for him, that there are more people like him and Ma, that the dogs and cats and trees he see's on TV are real. The growth we see Tremblay's character experience and the way he conveys it is utterly transfixing; it's hard to believe he's just 9-years old. A big, big future ahead for this hugely talented kid.And credit must also go to Joan Allen, whom I've admired for a while now but hasn't had a role like this in years. It's such a delicate and thoughtful performance, perfectly nuanced but enough there to feel her woes. It reminded me of Dern in last year's 'Wild', and I was so happy when Dern got a nomination because I loved her in that. I feel the same way about Allen. The direction is very much on point and the gorgeous score has been criminally under-appreciated. It's not in your face but it doesn't need to be, as composer Stephen Rennicks elects to keep a smooth, perfectly apt melody whilst only increasing the strings slightly for the more intense moments. \"Room\" is a film that will stay with you for days. It's subject matter is dark, leaving very little leeway for humour or any sort of respite from a grim situation. What we're presented to us is a highly grounded tale of human nature, the ugly side of it, but also the true beauty and strength of a Mother-Child bond.",

For Jack it is his home, a seemingly safe haven filled with all he knows and with the security of the only parent he knows. Jack's world is exclusively his Ma and Room. They share a bed, toilet, bathtub, and old television. The only window is a small skylight. In this sealed environment, Ma heroically tries to shelter Jack from their circumstances: telling stories, creating toys from egg shells, and weaving imagination into their daily routine. Room seems normal for Jack since he knows nothing else. Read my entire review at: unhealedwound.com",

            "content": "*SPOILERS*The movie has two very distinct parts. In and out of the room.In the first part we are shown the mother and her kid stuck in that room and the situation becomes almost overwhelming to the viewer. We learn through his eyes what the room is for him: his entire world. We learn how things like TV make sense to him and we learn that these stories were told to him by his mother, rather than the cruel truth. Of course this must be a seven year long nightmare to her, but for some reason it hurts almost more to see the boy, Jack, not knowing anything about the world outside. Although it is fiction, it still gives you a gut punch, because similar cases really happened. I have to admit I didn't even think about cinematography (a very good sign for a captivating movie), because the situation just takes over your brain. But, of course, the camera work brilliantly portrays their claustrophobic prison. The rather rushed escape is very tense, the movie handled it perfectly.Then we enter the second part, where the movie crumbles a bit. First the boy is confused and understandably scared by what is around him. Nothing makes sense to Jack and the performance of the young actor is just absolutely convincing. It is kind of heartbreaking when he asks when they can go back to the room. Jack's level of comfort rises slowly, as does his relation with other humans (and animals). He seems to be less fixated on his mother and I'm not sure how realistic this whole development would be from a psychological standpoint. I mean: This is the only other human he knew for his entire life (as he said, he was never sure if the rapist was real or like the people from TV.) At the same time the mental state of the mother suffers, fueled by regret, memories and mostly by (silent) blame of others and herself. It should be noted that the media people behaved absolutely disgustingly - as I'm sure they would if all this was real.It was a good decision to feature the life outside of the room rather than ending the movie after the escape. Life is not instantaneously perfect for them. But all this felt a bit unfocused. The movie doesn't really build up to anything. For example: it's only a couple of minutes between her trying to kill herself and then being completely healthy again. And then we have a happy ending.",

Jack is cheerful and finds new ways to amuse himself every day, playing with shadows or a rat that intrudes into their \"home\". Joy is biding her time, waiting for Jack to grow up so that he can be told the truth. The bond between mother and son in that claustrophobic Room is extraordinary. This is the better half of the film. In the second half, Jack and Joy gain freedom in a rather ingenuous and dramatic way. They have to now come to terms with the real harsh world. As they struggle to cope with their newfound lives, so does the film in keeping pace with their struggles. We can see Joy's pain, but cannot empathize with her. How does fortitude desert her so quickly?

Room has to be the best films I have seen this year. Everything worked incredibly, from the acting to the cinematography. This is the first film from Lenny Abrahamson (who previously directed Frank in 2014) that I've seen, an honestly I now have an urge to watch the rest of his films; the directing is a major way this film works - Abrahamson blends together an incredible mix of Ma's lament for life and also her extreme happiness for Jack very well, and constantly makes the film go from superbly tense to emotional highs in split instants. There was some very good work from Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the novel) on the script, which was beautifully and delicately written, and in my opinion never had a false note. This film, unlike most, is split into two acts instead of three, both of which last for around 55 minutes. The structure is very tight, and very event seemed very carefully placed and vital to the overall story. This is an incredibly depressing film, which doesn't let go of you for a moment, nor does it ever cease with its emotional highs. The imprisonment of Ma and the general story are very carefully handled. However, perhaps the most impressive aspect of this film is the incredible work from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, who were both mesmerizing in their own right. Brie Larson portrays Ma's struggles and adaption into the new world very well, and overall convincingly - perhaps one of the most worthy Best Actress wins of all time. Jacob Tremblay is a thing to behold - never before have I seen such an utterly authentic and amazing performance from a child, especially one of just 9 years old. Joan Allen and Tom McCamus both add their own impact on the movie and add great performances, even if this is ultimately Brie and Jacob's movie, who both seem to outshine anything or anyone else.In the end Room is an excellent film that you are sure to never forget, in which Lenny Abrahamson's fantastic directing and the lead actors' performances do justice to the heart-wrenching story.",

That is, of course, to be expected. But at times the movie just feels like it takes certain moments from the book and puts them together, without any coherence. One example would be the interview, which is built up great in the book, but just seems to randomly happen in the movie, without any exposition or explanation. And that's just one scene where the movie fells short in comparison to the book. If I haven't read the book, I would probably give the movie 8 or even 9 stars, but I just can't knowing the source material.",

The whole film is from the perspective of 5 years old boy Jack, who'd been living whole his life in an enclosed room since he had born. It is when, as the film progresses, he starts comparing his previous life in enclosed imaginative world in the room than to the open real world. His little comparisons will blow up your mind. The tale about unconditional love of mother and son & how they balance each other, is one of fewer films which should be watched as little knowing about it before. And, the film gonna stay with you for long.Acted top-notch by both the leads. Brie Larson brilliantly played the mother with a heart of cotton. Jacob Tremblay will just steal your heart with his ease. The most wonderful thing about the film is that how the director have chosen it to be shot, mostly with the eyes of the little boy. Trust me sometimes you'll just feel in the seat of that boy. Without been preachy & forcing any ready-made thoughts on you, the film forces to think and let you feel about many of things. Some moments in the film are so soulful that if you didn't have shed your tears during that, you'd probably lost your heart somewhere, better start searching before it's too late. It is just personal opinion that the director should have showed or conveyed more through the mouth & heart of Jack, may be I was craving for more thoughts.I think this movie will be experienced differently by every individual depending on how he/she feels the emotions, the bond, the world. The true fact is, there's too much to learn from the character of Jack.",

There were moments where it felt like Larson was reading from a blurry teleprompter. Ma was tragic without being weak. Larson was not able to provide that feeling. The supporting cast were outstanding enough to carry the slack. I was gobsmacked when she (Larson) won the Oscar.

Room depicts his perspective as his world changes. Although the movie works on an emotional level without feeling too manipulative, I disliked the scenario and was bothered by the questions it raised. How believable is the main characters' captivity, the extent of their trauma, and their attempts to escape it? I have my doubts, but I think the audience is supposed to be too in awe of their maternal bond to care. I, however, wanted a little more intelligence from the tantrum-prone duo. The mother is saved by a five-year-old with a facile understanding of his environment. Ignorance is bliss, I suppose, but let's not pretend it's lovely or enlightening. One could argue the mother protects her son's purity, but even this seems a matter of luck given her limited control over the situation. I guess I can't abandon my intellect to appreciate a child's innocence, especially when it could have been more effectively preserved by a little adult cleverness.Rating based on five factors, each worth up to two points: Sound: 1.5; Acting/Characterization: 2; Script: 1; Visuals: 1; Concept: 0.5Total: 6",

            "content": "The movie starts with tender and curious gestures like Jack (Jacob Tremblay) greeting inanimate objects from his Room like they were friends. It immediately immerses you into Jack's perception, and, due to the uncertainty of the first minutes of the film, the viewer is left asking what happened to these people to be disheveled and detached from the outside world. Progressively one discovers Ma's (Brie Larson) situation and can't help but feel sympathy and horror at imagining the cruel 7 years that she had to endure in that situation.The kidnapping, isolating, deprivation, impregnating, and raping depicts an almost unbearable landscape for both protagonists, only to have them build a bond that made them inseparable, and this was the bond that helped the mother survive even after escaping the confinement. The movie takes an interesting dive into Jack's phenomenology. It continually reminds you of his perception, understanding that deprivation to that level will have sometimes unimaginable effects. The story that Ma gave Jack about there not being any other place but their room is a beautiful symbol of compassion and care, a profound level of navigation of their connection and mindset that is displayed brilliantly in repeated style.The movie made me suffer, squirm, highly conflicted by the understanding of both their experience. Is there beauty in not teaching people a bout the horrible nature of the world? there is...this movie is an epitome of \"ignorance is bliss\". The issue was when to present Jack the idea of there being an infinitely complex and spacious world past the walls of his room. One of the clear lessons of the movie is that there is always functionality and benefit to abstaining from sharing some crucial information. Would you describe in detail to a paraplegic the beauty and freedom of dancing? There is always a place and a time to maximize the benefit and pleasure for anything.It is a morbid, pathologic topic, but nonetheless one that exists past the confines of our comfortable and privileged lifestyle. The movie is conducted with beauty and curiosity, like an experiment of naivety. It is the endearing feature that could be digested in such a tragic story.",

I immediately picked up on Brie's painfully unconvincing performance. The next thing I noticed was the terrible, soulless child actor who managed to be irritating and unlikable throughout. It felt as if the mother character was supposed to exhibit the pain and torment of both a captive prisoner and the mother from The Babadook, in which both were pulled off horribly. Looking up the movie brings up that its genre is Drama/Thriller, but I honestly could not pick up what this movie was supposed to make me feel. The man holding them captive is not intimidating whatsoever, he poses no threat and does not make me feel scared when the mother and son start taking risks. The tone changes constantly when your child actor cannot emote, stop screaming, or repeating themselves. Compared to decent child actors, the choice here doesn't feel intentional, as if the kid was mentally damaged from living in a shed. It felt like a lazy choice and I didn't care in the end if he survived honestly. The movie did not make me feel any sympathy for him. The kid totally breaks the pacing multiple times, ruining any form of suspense or thrill. He will say something stupid and unrelated, yell, etc. while another character is trying their best to perform. I know he is supposed to be an irritating kid, but I can't help but feel like he could've been done better. His monotone voiceovers come off as cheesy and uninspired, too. Total bore.The worst part? Nothing happens. It's damn boring. Events just kind of happen one after the other - I can barely tell when each act starts and the resolution just felt too.. easy? Simply getting out a-okay from the shed after having to vomit on her son didn't feel like a nice payoff. And the movie just keeps going - never ends. I hope I never have to sit through this again thank you Hanni for making watch this boring, loud, overrated movie. I see a gold film in here, but as of now I cannot fathom how this got any awards. The whole thing felt almost laughably bad if it wasn't for the lack of literally anything happening at all.",

In a sea of crappy art films and overdone remakes of old classics. Today's ease of filming anything makes viewing films these days a chore. Maybe that's why all the oldies are rated so high. I saw the rating for \"Room\" and thought it was worth a go. Sometime during viewing, I glance back at IMDb to get another view of opinions or plots. Although the first ones are usually on par, others tend to have an opposite opinion which their entitled to have. I had to write something on this film because of some of the opinions expressed about their views on the story. It's one thing to have an opposite opinion of someone but, I think it's an injustice to categorize a movies has a \"Housewives\" story or \"Lifetime\" quality. This film is waaay beyond that! And I'm a Man in my mid 30's. Movies are our gifts to escape ourselves and take a break to immerse ourselves in someone elses shoes and see things through the eyes of the characters. This story is about an abducted girl who was abducted, raped, and locked in a shed. Her child, only knew for his 5 yrs. of existence what happened in Room. Our job as a viewer is to put ourselves in Jack's place and realize a world he thought was only on television. To cast this experience aside is to belittle our human emotions. I personally felt for both the main characters. To try to comprehend what they are going through,.......this film does better than average to try to begin to convey what it would be like. To try to feel their situation. That's what makes this film so good! I wonder about the world I'm trying to raise my children in knowing how easy it is for some to dismiss our humanity. To care about people, even for just a few moments before going back to reality. This film IS NOT just for housewives and women folk! This is for any human who feels. Who understands what emotions are and how to feel them. Don't let anyone sway you from watching this!! It's a reminder of a sick world and how to come back from the dark into the light",

I guess now would be a good time to say once again...***SPOILER ALERT*** ***SPOILER ALERT*** If you don't want to know why I didn't like this movie very much then you should stop reading now.Brie Larson was pretty great, and the little kid was even better especially his narrative parts. The movie had plenty of touching moments, no doubt. I mean, even I couldn't keep the water works from flowing when mother and son were re-united in the back of that police car. Sadly, the main issue with this movie is that it peaks in the middle, and the last 58 minutes of the movie is filled with a bunch of useless drivel and irritating performances by some pretty decent actors (Joan Allen, William H. Macy, Wendy Crewson). Lit'rally, there was one seen that irritated me so bad that I wanted to reach thru my TV screen and smack someone. It's a scene where a \"better-than-you\" talk show host asks the mother if during any part of the seven years they were held captive if she ever thought of sending the boy away to a hospital or a shelter so that he could have a chance at a normal life. I just wanted the mother to say something like, \"Hey, ya dimwit, do you even know what was going on? The guy had us locked in a soundproof shed with an electronic keypad lock on the door for SEVEN YEARS!!! The only way to \"send my son away\" would have been to send him with said abductor who probably would've just as soon slashed my son's throat and left his body in a dumpster than to risk having someone find him out because he was trying to give my son a chance at a NORMAL life!!\"But, unfortunately, those lines were never spoken. The other detraction from this movie is that it doesn't take too long to realize that once the movie peaks that it's not going to have a succinct, defined ending. It was just a matter of waiting to see what scene the director decided to end it on. It could have ended a half hour sooner, or it could have played on for two more hours, but there was just no way to wrap it all up in a nicely wrapped package.Yeah, usually I like it when a movie doesn't have a typical Hollywood ending...but not when you can see it coming from 35 kilometers away. In the end I give \"Room\" 4 out of 10 stars; two for Brie Larson and two for her son. Everything else in the movie is just pure, unadulterated nonsense.RECOMMENDATION: Check out Spotlight instead.

Beyond words, but let's give it a try.Room?Joy Newsome (Brie Larson) was kidnapped when she was seventeen years old and locked up in a shed, left completely at the mercy of her kidnapper. Two years later she bears a son, called Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Not being able to leave 'Room', as she calls it from then on, Joy decides to raise him in that tiny enclosed space, as if it were the only place in the world. This is the devastating story of a mother and her son; who, for five years, literally only have each other. And how they're able to continue their life after that.Jack's storyI can't even make a joke about this. This might very well be one of the most uncomfortable movies I have ever seen. Especially during the first half; I was constantly cringing and my heart was racing. Which is weird because there is nothing explicit to cringe at nor is there a lot of suspense to get nervous about. Everything about this film excels at telling a story but without showing it. It's something you have to see for yourself because however difficult it is to watch, it is also extremely compelling. The way Jack narrates their lives as a story, talks about items in Room as persons and how they spend their time everyday. But especially how Joy creates a world, within a room, for Jack to grow up in; out of reach for 'Old Nick', as they call him.There is this one scene where all you see is five-year-old Jack, hidden in the wardrobe, listening to the creaking of the bed and just counting. But you know what is happening and the filmmakers even make it look like it's an everyday routine. It's Room's strongest feat, an uneasiness that creeps in and stays for the rest of the film.Of course all of this would amount to nothing without a stellar cast. Brie Larson as Joy Newsome is nothing short of excellent; in between her boundless love and dedication towards Jack, she shows a constant air of frustration, dread and desperation. The film's creators are brutally honest about this too; she's not a saint, she's a mom.The real revelation however was Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Working with child actors is never easy and that goes double for a role like this, but this kid gets it. You don't just feel sorry for him, you feel with him. To the point that Tremblay's character almost feels familiar. Which might sound effed up, considering the situation, but everyone has their 'Room'.ConclusionSeemingly effortless, Room will touch you and Room will hurt you. Director Lenny Abrahamson made a brilliant piece of cinema that is not easy to watch and even harder to forget.How to watch? -surrounded by your loved ones, on any screen Score: 8/10For more reviews go to www.blaudruk.org",

This movie is refreshingly different and focuses on the personal experiences of the boy in particular and his mother, with almost half the movie dedicated to what happens after the escape. Because of this it's very effective at making you feel for the characters and connect with each rise and fall. Not an instant happy ever after that people swaddle themselves with, but a true raw connection with the human difficulties and consequences of a horrible ordeal. It's celebrating how people adapt and dust themselves off that is inspiring, not a whitewashed instant gratification. Well worth the watch, best movie I've seen in some time.",

With the help of her small but incredibly talented co-star, Jacob Tremblay, Larson gives the performance of a life time. The relationship between the two of mother and son was one of my favorite aspects of this film. I also appreciated that they gave the audience an inside look at the aftermath once the victims finally were blessed to escape from captivity. I was blown away to see what life had brought for Carol and George, now 17 years old! Director Lenny Abrahamson creates such a big story in a small space.

I assumed it was a story of the mom who happens to raise her kid in awful conditions but the focus is really on Jack and how he has to grow up in those awful conditions. Jacob Tremblay is an amazing little actor for being as young as he is here. He carried half the film on his own.\nI wish we learned a little more about Old Nick and why he was doing what he did or what happened to him after, just a tad more than the tidbits we saw.\nI do appreciate the fact that this didn't focus on the physical or sexual abuse, I can only think of 2 times either of those were shown or heard and they last maybe 15-30 seconds at most. The rest of it is implied and we can instead focus on Jack and Ma reacting to their situation and finding a way out of it all.\nBrie Larson also does a fantastic job as Ma. I know those feelings of frustration and patience when it comes to kids and she absolutely nails it. Facial expressions and all.\nI enjoyed the end most as Jack finally experiences a bit of real childhood making friends and playing with a dog.

The casting was impeccable and their performances spoke mountains. My only concern with the movie is that Brie Larson was cited as the lead actor while it was quite eminent of Jacob Tremblay being the lead, hands down.

            "review_title": "An Innocent Take on A Dark, Multifaceted Story",
            "content": "DISCLAIMER: This review is an analysis, please keep in mind.The film Room tells the story of 5-year-old Jack and his mother, Joy, told in Jack's perspective. All of his life, Jack has lived in a small world known as \"Room,\" which his mother convinces is his reality, and that everything beyond is fantasy. The room is small, fixed with only a bathroom, a small kitchen, a television set, and a skylight. They essentially live in an average bedroom.To the audiences, it becomes apparent that their living situation is much darker than Jack perceives it. Through her sugar-coated stories, Joy explains to Jack why they are in \"Room;\" Joy was abducted as a teenager and kept in a security-locked garden shed by a man only known as \"Old Nick.\" When Jack becomes old enough, Joy uses him to finally free the two of them from their prison. From there, Jack experiences the outside world for the first time and begins adjusting to his new life beyond \"Room.\" What makes Room such a great film is that it places the audience into the world of Jack. It lets the audience experience how Jack comes to know \"Room\" as his whole world, and how he processes seeing the real, outside world for the first time. The photography employs hyper-focusing on objects in \"Room\" to accentuate Jack's familiarity and never shows the outside world until Jack finally escapes. From there, the direction of the film manages to make the audience feel so acquainted with Room that everything else seems alien for a moment.The film is multiple films at once, which is a good thing. The entire premise of the film touches on Platonic themes explored in the famous The Allegory of the Cave and incorporates those themes into a contemporary issue, making it philosophical. At the same time, the film deals with the emotional drama and friction that occurs not only with Jack, but also with Joy. Joy struggles with trying to teach Jack about the outside world, as well as trying to gain her family's acceptance of Jack, since she is dealing with the fact that Jack is Old Nick's child, while dealing with the media circus surrounding her story. The film details the emotional experiences and side effects that occur when one leaves the world and sees it for the first time again. It's philosophical, psychological, and emotional.Fantastic performance from Brie Larson as Joy; she encapsulates the deep emotional scars that her character carries from Room. She takes on multiple roles as Joy; a strong mother figure for Jack, but also a helpless, adjusting woman to her family. Jacob Tremblay gives an excellent performance as Jack as well; he helps bring the film's innocent perspective to life and provides a great emotional dynamic and contrast to Joy.",

            "content": "Every now and then a film will not only effect me emotionally but effect me on how powerful I view and feel the medium of film itself is, Room is one of these films in question, it's just phenomenal and I'm not an individual who gives out fake praise in order to gain views/notoriety.Like me you may have (or did have) preconceptions of what this film would do with its subject material & how it would progress, now throw those preconceptions out the window & glory at what this film has to offer you on a purely human level of storytelling.Now I'm going to begin this review in earnest by stating that yes this film created a truly unexpected emotional reaction from me and despite the premise of the story I also came out the cinema saying that the film gave me a sense of great hope and was uplifting in how individuals/characters can positively react to horrible situations in a completely human and believable way.The story focuses on Brie Larson's 'Ma' character who is a mum to her five year old son 'Jack' played by newcomer Jacob Tremblay who have been imprisoned in a 'Room' for going on five years since Brie Larson had been kidnapped & presumably raped (resulting in Jack) by her captor by her unknown (to the audience) assailant.Brie Larson deservedly won the Best Actress award all across the board with a truly powerfully gut-wrenching and emotional performance, now the performance of then eight year old Jacob Tremblay is something nothing short of phenomenal, the interaction between Larson and Tremblay is mainly where the films storytelling and emotional heft comes from, if you don't believe that mother and son relationship you don't get the truly fantastic film that we end up with.The film plays with your expectations of what this kind of film is expected to do and how it should play out and midway through it it throws you a curve-ball, they actually escape, yes that's right that is what would usually occur in the final act of a film of this type but no now we have to deal with what occurs from the fallout of this situation, suddenly it takes you somewhere you don't get led very often which is what happens next after that kind of event, what is the personal trauma that is taken on by Brie Larson's 'Ma' and Jacob Tremblay's 'Jack' characters? Who has coped best with it? Who is going to cope best with their reintroduction into society (if that's even possible), it's wonderfully done from a psychological point of view and also a pure emotional drama point of view, the reintroduction to family, a family that has been torn apart by the apparent loss of their presumed dead daughter.True credit has to go to the director Lenny Abrahamson and probably more poignantly Emma Donoghue the original novels writer and screenplay writer for the film, she and the director have clearly managed to translate her books tones and emotional message into the medium of film which is no mean feat at all.Numerous times throughout his film I was either close to tears or had a tear or two actual roll down my cheeks and for good reason as they were heartbreaking moments of interactions between Jack and certain individuals.The film is a true triumph of fabulous storytelling, superb performances, emotional heft and a film of the utmost highest quality and is now in the company of being listed as one of my favorite ever films and I can give it no more higher a praise than that.",

Period.It completely draws you into this world that both of its characters inhabits and never lets go. The story of a mother and son kidnapped and living in a room for years is equally haunting and beautiful.Movies of kidnapped inhabitants are a dime a dozen these days, but what makes Room so special is the realistic and empathetic approach to its story. The \"villain\" isn't astonishingly evil, but frighteningly real.So is Joy, the mother of Jack. She isn't Jason Bourne, she has no particular set of skills. All she has is her love for her son and that keeps her going for the both of them. Instead of focusing on the gruesome details of rape, abuse and kidnapping, Room chooses to focus on the humans in the story, and their survival through mutual love.You might be surprised most by Jack, the boy who grew up in Room. You cant help but be heartbroken as you see how much he loves the jail cell he grew up in. Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson both give performances for the ages. As is the direction and music. This could have so easily fallen into the clich\u00e9 revenge plot or melodrama, but it never falls into those trappings.Visually, the movie intentionally traps you into the Room for the first half, never letting you see outside of it. It really makes you feel the characters predicament and the \"Room\" itself becomes a character.Of course, they do escape as written in the plot, and i wont spoil what happens after. Just know that the performances are incredible, and you will leave the cinema with memories of this film that will stick with you. You will remember Joy, Jack, and Room.As the hype for Room increases, i suspect certain audiences might leave slightly disappointed from how grounded and realistic the film is. No, there is no twist, no gimmicks and no flashy moment or revenge plot. And the film is all the more better for it.Despite its subject matter, Room manages to inspire, and is surprisingly heartwarming. I didn't expect myself to love the film that much but i can say wholeheartedly that this film is a triumph of human emotion and it is the must see movie of 2015.",

This could be seen as properly measured, of course, and preferable to most viewers, but I'd expect a more incisive and explorative recount, with all the squalor and darkness such abuse and rehabilitation would entail, before the opening to a new life. One also wonders about the missed chances of making enough noise to be noticed, and I spotted an obvious stylistic error in the camera vehicle's shadow as it follows the captor's truck.

There's a television set also on which everything is perceived as unreal and false by Jack for the lack of exposure to the outside world.\nIn an attempt to make it more plausible for us to believe, and probably for Jack too, that they can survive and get out of there someday, there's a skylight at the top of the room through which sunlight enters in the room during the day. All in vain of course. \nThere is basically no story. You see them living inside a room first and then living outside the room after when they manage to escape in an episode that could not have been more childish where Ma instructs Jack to lie still after rolling him into a rug so that she can pretend his death and mourn over it when Old Nick comes home at night to have his daily quota of sex with her. The plan works and Jack escapes finally, until he is caught by Old Nick and surprisingly, is left behind safe by him after one fat guy watches him get manhandled by Old Nick. You almost feel like screaming,\"Why O Why?\" Nick never comes back in the movie should be a serious enough indication about the kind of logic that was applied in the writing of this film. Nor does Ma ever get involved with him again. \nThe real drama happens afterwards when the mother son duo have to live in Ma's parents house, who apparently have separated. Ma can't stand that house even since she isn't at good terms with her parents. Especially her father, whom she believes has been deliberately ignoring her son since they both stepped into the room. Ma also tries to commit suicide in a genuine attempt to apologize to Jack in a fanciful manner for ruining his childhood and treating him the way she did. The moment you think there's an interesting development being made the scene ends. And this happens enough times that you give up on the film altogether. \nAs if the it wasn't enough tragic that both Ma and Jack visit that 'room' again towards the end of the film. That's when you realize your last couple of hours could have been more productive washing your car or making toast.",

            "content": "Room completely blew all of my initial expectations away with a very empathetic and human story with phenomenal performances from its two leads, as well as an incredible screenplay and fantastic direction.Going into Room as someone who didn't read the book that this film was based on, I was expecting a mystery/thriller that centered around the escape/finding of the mom and son that the film focuses on. Instead, what I got was a very emotional, and very human look at the relationship between a mother and her son, as well as how these two are damaged by what they've experienced within a very confined space, and how they recover from and cope with said damage. Emma Donoghue, who wrote the book that this film is based on, did a beautiful job writing the screenplay, and part of that is because these characters she created felt like real people with real problems that pretty much anybody can relate to no matter who they are.However, the characters wouldn't have been so realistic if it wasn't for the actors who play them. Brie Larson is an absolute revelation, and is, in my opinion, the front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar this February. I've always been a fan of her's, from her commercial work in films like Trainwreck, 21 Jump Street, or Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, to her smaller work in films like Short Term 12 or Don Jon. Her performance in Room is some of the absolute best work I've ever seen from her, and this is because she portrays the shock and stress of returning to a world that's been snatched away from you for seven years so brilliantly. She captures the heartbreak, and sadness, and anger of this sobering situation perfectly, and it shows it the incredible transformation her character undergoes throughout the film. As great as Larson is in this film though, it would be unfair to overlook her son played by Jacob Tremblay, who is as important as Larson is, possibly even more. This is because Jack is the character that the audience sees the film through; he's the person that guides us all through the events that take place. And that is absolutely fascinating to me, because essentially Jack is experiencing the world for the first time ever. So because of this, he is filled with wonder about this new world, especially in a fantastic scene involving him laying in the bed of a truck looking at the sky, and the score is just overwhelming the entire scene with how loud it is. And that's the other thing about him; he's overwhelmed and apprehensive about what the world holds, but he doesn't always understand why. And as an audience member, we're able to piece extra bits of the story together without being told, but instead shown what things are like. When you're able to understand something without having to explain it, that's great storytelling, and it makes the character of Jack one of the most fascinating of the entire year.This film wouldn't be what it was without its director, Lenny Abrahamson. I've heard that Abrahamson took a lot of inspiration from learning how to raise a family for directing this film, and it really shows in every scene that he directs. You really get the sense that this was a film that was made with care, and love, and not just towards the respect that the book and its characters deserve, but in crafting something that felt genuine, that felt relatable to anyone who experienced growing up or raising their child. It feels like the director just wanted to tell a good, relatable story with the material that he was given, and he did just that.Room is a movie that really affected me. I'm notorious for literally never crying in movies, but in Room, I cried for literally the entire second half of the film. And that's because the characters of Ma and Jack, what they go through, and particularly how this affects other people that Ma knew before being taken away from the world she once lived in, felt so real to me; I actually believed that these events actually happened. And when a film does that to me, it's film that I know that I'll be revisiting time and time again, and Room is exactly that kind of movie. If I had seen this before the end of 2015, it would've been my favorite movie of the entire year. Without a doubt.",

            "content": "Room starts off by introducing us to Joy and her 5-year-old son Jack and their lives as captives inside this small room (that they cleverly call \"Room\"). I went into this movie expecting it to be entirely about their lives within the Room and about their eventual escape. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it actually tackled Joy and Jack's life after Room and their adaptation to life after a massive trauma.Instead of flawlessly embracing freedom from their captor and captivity, Joy and Jack struggle to assimilate back into their lives, back into the real world. Things, understandably, changed from how they were before Joy was kidnapped, and it follows her as she tries to understand those changes. As it usually is in these kinds of situations, escaping a man who has kidnapped and raped you for years doesn't mean that life after escaping is perfect. I like that it showed their initial happiness with escaping and their gradual downhill fall as they (Joy mainly) have to face the emotions that come after the fact. Throughout it all, Jack has romanticized Room as a safe haven against the huge world (and eventually has this romantic fantasy shattered at the end of the movie). Joy wrestles with frustration with herself and Jack, asking why she isn't happy now that she's free. I thought the movie did a great job of portraying how people really are after events like this happen and how complicated life after can truly be. I wanted Joy and Jack to be happy, but it just wasn't that easy.Brie Larson was really great as Joy and gave a genuine, heartfelt performance. Jacob Tremblay was pretty good, too, which is fairly rare for a child actor.Overall, I was really impressed with this movie and would definitely rewatch sometime.",

            "content": "Okay. Wow, did I just fall in love with Brie Larson? Hell yeah! But was it the soft gentle Brie I've grown accustomed to over the years, or the Brie who was Jack's mom? Possibly the latter. This movie is a must- see for so many reasons: good directing, great score, amazing acting. I mean, Jacob Tremblay can act. There is no question he is the main character of the film, the reason why this story is being told. And of course, where there is a yin there is a yang. The reason why it's so easy to be sucked into Room right from the get-go is Brie Larson aka Joy. While I was watching this, I guess I was waiting for her to take over the action but she never quite did. Instead what happened was that she and Jack shared this beautiful synergy, which signified what this movie was all about: the bond between mother and son. Some points in the second act (of the story) were dull, but the relationship between these two made the first 45- 50 minutes of the film grade A. In my opinion, Room is definitely worth the watch. The facts aren't all that pleasant, but just hearing \"The Mighty Rio Grande\" during the bridge between the first and second act, is enough to give you goosebumps. Wasn't surprised by the acting, but more so by the creativity, and that's always the toughest component to find in movies today.",

Brie Larson really succeeds to show the fear and desperation that Joy/Ma felt. There are parts where she seems so tired and exasperated and I thought that it was a spot on reaction for someone in her position. Jacob Tremblay is a phenomenal child actor. It's too often when children in movies are two dimensional characters, whose range as characters moves from 'cute' to 'annoying brats'. Tremblay was more than that - he showed feelings and variety. He was accurately childishly annoying in some scenes but I never held it against his characters because it made sense that he would behave in such a way.The director also handled space in an excellent way. In the beginning Room doesn't appear all that small which showed nicely how to Jake it was his only known world. In the end we are shocked to see how small Room truly is and that combined with the camera showing Brie Larson's face makes her character all the more tragic.",

It is not simply an exploitation film though that this clearly there in the background. That is not to say that the first half of the film is easy to watch. However, we are shielded from the worst of it much like how Jack is by his mother. For Ma, Room is a living hell but for Jack, \"Room\" is his whole world that goes in \"every direction, all the way to the end\".As the trailer shows, the entire running time is not dedicated to the confines of the room but how the two- particularly Jack- cope in the real world. We see this strange new place often directly through the eyes of the young child and being able to hear his internal monologue was just so cute yet incredibly emotional.The direction from Lenny Abrahamson is simply outstanding and the two central performances from Larson and Tremblay were perfect.

If it were a young adult novel with fan following, studios would have teared the novel into at-least 2 movies so when one watches it, should remember that he is getting double the fun and why not, Room is a powerful movie with all the elements a blockbuster entertainer lacks these days.We open our eyes to the screen and we are in a small room with two inhabitant. We spend a substantial amount of time in that tiny room but never we ever feel suffocated because of the freshness maintained by the director and drop dead performances by both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. One wonders if it is going to be a usual torture or survival movie but it is bigger then that. It is very much common that movies are taking a more realistic and social approach towards crises then that of only physical ones.Room is based on a very strong idea and is made by a brilliant director. Performances are of worth watching. Brie Larson is magnificent, although much appreciation should be given to the casting director who opted for her, as most of the praise Brie is getting, is due to the persona she brought to the movie which is different then regular cry baby. And that was the decision of who ever casted her as they at that time gave the movie something other lacked. Jacob Tremblay is brilliant in his role and it's very disappointing to see that many of the award organizations have over looked his work. Although the script is very strong and to the point but the Jacob's escape from the room seemed little weaker. Second half of the movie was much inspired from Irwin Winkler's 'At First Sight' and Clind Eastwood's 'American Sniper. Brie's performance is very good but not as much as she is getting rewarded. As I explained, it's mainly her personality which brought something new into this genre of movie. Rest of the cast were good too.

How would living in such confines define the person? What happens to that world view when the outside comes crashing in? This is the story we watch unfold in \"Room\".In a complete change from his last film, \"Frank\", Lenny Abrahamson's \"Room\" stars Brie Larson as Ma and her now five year old son, Jake, played by Jacob Tremblay. Ma and Jake live together in a room with two chairs, a table, a bent spoon, a bed, a sink, and a wardrobe. Why they live in such a confined space is the basis for the first half of the movie. The second half is what happens when they break free from the room and Jake discovers a vastly bigger room on the outside. The film is told mostly from his perspective, which could be disastrous, but with Tremblay's magnificent acting, and a script which carefully understands a child's perceptions, this technique works to the film's advantage. It is not too saccharine and for the most part, believable.I would be shocked if this film does not net Brie Larson with at least an Academy Award nomination. Her portrayal of a mother in unbelievable circumstances is nothing short of brilliant. Easily the best movie of the year that I have seen so far, but one so emotionally engaging, that it left me drained. If you chose to watch \"Room\", and I do recommend it, bring plenty of tissues.

Sometimes a man comes over, during the night, and then Jack must sleep in the wardrobe, not to be seen.

They put very little focus on the villain, and told the story from the perspective of the child. I like that they give no real screen time to him, taking the romanticizing out of the equation. It's heartbreaking to see how the boy who has very little world knowledge and mental maturity handles dark subject matter like rape, kidnapping, mental and physicsl abuse.I love the that by the halfway mark, they focus on reintroducing the child to normal society. Most movies would choose to end after the main characters escape their captor. I like that this movie took a psychological approach to the aftermath that this kind of abuse would cause. In a lot of movies, the big climax is defeating the villain and the movie ends and we are meant to believe it's happily ever after.

I expected it would be about the difference in feelings between mother and child about their situation (In the Room as well as outside). And in a way it was, especially the first half of the film, which was really good. The second half disappointed me a little bit. It even was a bit boring and sometimes over the top sentimental. Where the movie made me cry in the first half, the second half made me laugh. Because it was funny to see how over the top wise Jack was. And everything was done to make the viewer feel something. However sometimes less is more. Over the top is funny. But the American audience will love it.",

            "review_title": "Emotional and Dark, Depressing yet Uplifting",
            "content": "Simply put, \"Room\" is an emotional film. And it seems as though half the time you do not even know what you're feeling. Seamlessly the film manages to portray happiness in a tragic way, depressingly dark situations yet present some optimism and make you feel genuinely scared and/or worried about its fictional characters. Room is emotional in a very real sense; it's not just another movie where a romance falls apart, or where a loved one gets a terminal illness and it doesn't tug on your heart strings with cheap bullshit. Room doesn't try to trick you into feeling things, its realistic tone and grim story is enough. Not to make light of the cinematography, music or any of anything else which made the film, these are all good too, however we are really in this one for the writing and acting; the story and characters. The film follows its protagonists as they live their day to day lives trapped inside a small dirty room with no way out. Locked in by a nameless man that they call 'Old Nick,' The characters are a mother and son 'Jack,' 'Ma' has been inside this room for seven years and her son has never experienced anything beyond the room in his life. For around half of the movie we stay in the room with these characters, we as an audience never leave the room until the characters do. Personally I was beginning to feel the claustrophobia myself, the movie makes you feel as trapped as the characters are. The room feels hopeless as it does small and the atmosphere is actually quite haunting. Now though, that Jack is five years old, Ma believes that it's now time and that he is finally old enough to help her make their escape. Through a series of events, the two do make it out of the room, however we are still only about half way through the film as we follow their lives after leaving 'room.' The films point of no return; leaving 'room' is both scary and cheerful for both us and the characters in the film. The juxtaposition of being stuck in the room and the freedoms of such an open and unknown world is mind blowing. Yet, before they leave and it is uncertain whether they will succeed or not, you almost don't want them to try. Jack pleads his mother to wait till he is six years old and this is a terrifying theme throughout the film; Comfort and security over freedom. Jack's life and world may have been horrible, however the thought of leaving was frightening and almost made no sense to Jack. The movie manages to portray a horrible situation without feeling like a cheap horror movie, this is to be taken seriously and manages to portray despicable acts and conditions of the characters, without reverting to gross out moments or cartoonish dark villains. The villain of the film, is definitely disgusting and hateable, but ultimately is not the point of the film. The maturity of the film dealing with a sickening character and subject is appreciated. Another running theme of this film was the experience \u2013 or really inexperience of five-year-old Jack. He'd never known anything beyond this one room his entire life, basically; 'room' was his world. And this is such an interesting concept to me. Jack's concepts of fiction and reality blur and at such an age he is vulnerable to information. It's important to learn the truth however almost incomprehensible due to his extremely limited knowledge. Possibly my favourite shot of the film, has Jack creating shadows with his hands in the partial sunlight that comes through via sunlight. This shot has obvious relation to 'The Allegory of the Cave' philosophical theory. Put simply, if a caveman never leaves his cave, and all he ever sees are shadows, this is what he believes in, this becomes his reality. And the same goes for the child in the film. 'Room' is all he knows, and beyond stories he's told or what he sees on their television, Jack's sense of reality is inaccurate. He knows about animals such as dogs and cats, he knows about grass and trees and he knows about general bits of information, however due to his isolation he cannot separate reality from fiction and therefore will not know which things are real and which are not. A dragon for example is as real or fake as a dog in his mind. The themes throughout the film and the emotion that these themes bring are all portrayed through the actors; who all did a fine job, but the performance that really stood out was child actor Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Children are often not the best actors, they're still young; still learning, but this kid is ahead of his time, ahead of his age really. For such a thematically complex film as well as a mature and grim one, Tremblay did an amazing job making me believe in his character, as well as his collaboration with Brie Larson as mother and son, their relationship is strong and convincing. The film gave me chills when it needed to in moments of pure intensity the beautiful moments were made that much nicer in comparison to the dreary and depressing ones. It even gave me a new perspective on the world and the way we might look at it. What if we are all experiencing some version of Jack and Ma's 'room?' But, this is just a movie review, I don't want to get too philosophical. \"Room\" is saddening yet uplifting. It may be hard to watch for some yet I'd think also hard to stop watching, and overall the film has the ability to change ones' perspective. \"Room\" is shocking, yet beautiful and most of all unforgettable. This is Drama at its' best. 10/10",

            "review_title": "Short Shelf Life Following Awards Season",
            "content": "'Room' is the harrowing story of isolationism, and then, later on, immersion. We're first introduced to our two main characters, twenty-something Ma (actress Brie Larson) and four year-old Jack (up-and-coming Jacob Tremblay), inside a garden shed. We are, of course, unaware that this is a garden shed, but the size is what's immediately noticeable. Small, dark, and dank, with a single skylight. Jack, the product of Ma's kidnapping despite her insistence of his immaculate conception, is oblivious to the space of the room, or lack thereof, and equally of the world outside it. Ma, we're later told, has been living in the confines for seven years. It's seven too many, and when she decides quite suddenly that some attempt must be made to free one or both of them, plans are quickly set in motion at her behest and against Jack's wishes.I'm hesitant to mention their escape at all, but the always inexcusable trailer not only alludes to the escape but presents it as a first- act occurrence, mostly using the opportunity to list the other notable actors of the production. It's an unfortunate introduction to the story, as the audience does benefit from the time spent in the shed, however fully expecting the scenery to change in a moment. We come to understand their lifestyle: stretching in the morning, TV, eating canned slop, TV, running from one end of the shed to the other, TV. They have each other, and TV. It's been the source of Jack's entertainment, and no doubt his education, for much of his life. So when Ma tries to explain that TV holds some truth, that other people exist, and so too does a world outside of Room, it's hard for Jack, now 5, to grasp. \"How does it all fit?!\" he asks out of a serious incredulity (a single line delivered in a way that certifies Tremblay is one to watch).Nevertheless, he does grasp it, or he pretends to. He audibly bounces back and forth between acceptance and some acting form of denial, but his trust in Ma ultimately outweighs his fear of something larger, and then, halfway through the film, the outside is revealed to him. It's an abrupt and belated transition and his daring escape doesn't seem at all plausible but paints our everyday surroundings so empyrean that you more than forgive it. Triumph of the realization is replaced with a terror. Talking to the strange people he's only just recently come to see as real instead of \"magic\" is too much, too soon.A female officer warms to Jack, and his bravery leads to Ma's rescue. The two are reunited with the family he's never known, but a reluctance to engage with anyone besides his Ma is apparent. By this time, the film feels unbalanced. Its pacing is jarred, and the idea is that it's supposed to, but it feels less like a new, eye- opening experience and the slow understanding that comes with it, and more like a train wreck in slow motion. The second half offers little to the viewer. The meat of the story is left behind, and while it wasn't exactly Kobe beef, what we're left with is little more than the canned slop our duo had been subjected to in the beginning. Joan Allen does her best with what little she's given, William H. Macy isn't much more than a snapshot and a stepping stone to Ma's character development, Tom McCamus surprises, and Sean Bridgers eerie acting as the deluded kidnapper is oddly missed after his exit, which is without any real resolution.This proves to be a compelling story, and is at times emotionally gripping, but is ultimately ill-fated for a film adaptation. Best suited as prose, or as a journalistic publication on which the narrative is based, it falters in being brought to screen. Neither first-time feature screenwriter Emma Donoghue nor Lenny Abrahamson are at fault, as both do greatly with what is to be offered, and the casting, particularly the ever-impressive Larson, is inspired. Still, in leaving the theater, something is left to be desired.\"Room\" will prove to be a nice addition to the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of any involved, but with little shelf life beyond the awards season.B-Andrew Paul, occuris.com",

A power outage ushered in a good chance to escape. The mother began to plan an escape plan.

I must admit I tried to avoid this movie as I knew it would be a difficult watch, but ended up seeing it as someone else's choice on pay to view TV; I may have lost some of the impact of \"being there\" that I would have got from the big screen. By now thousands have reviewed the wonderful casting of and acting by the two leads and I concur completely. By five minutes in or less it's impossible to imagine the roles being played by anyone else. And child actor Jacob Tremblay is just astonishing as Jack, who was born in captivity so knows nothing but the claustrophobic world of \"room\". This really matters in the later stages when he has to cope with the wider world and we are truly drawn into his struggle to adapt and understand. As I always do, I have checked out one or two \"hated it\" reviews here and worry about some of those critics' ability to empathise, almost to a psychopathic degree. To me, Joy's behaviour is 100% convincing. After so long in captivity and with her child to protect you would absolutely expect her to have constructed a strategy for survival above all else, even if that means taking a submissive role with her captor. It's not like it's just her own life that's on the line if she fights back and fails.",

The movie's great too! and it does justice to the book, its just the book was something else. and there's no reason to compare the two as both mediums have inherent strengths and flaws. Anyway, coming to the movie.. absolutely loved the initial part..I thought the casting's pretty good. When Jack gets into the truck and first stands up and looks at the world, I thought that shot was absolutely perfect! I kinda was wishing the whole escape thing got done and over with pretty quickly and i wish that was longer and the 2nd part could have shrunk but I guess there's also much to appreciate as by showing the entire journey post escape, it was made more wholesome and real. My other qualm is that when Joy meets Jack after the escape..like..there should have been some dialogues around how jack did a fantastic job! I mean..he's 5 years old for God's sake.. and he managed to pull off the whole thing..but thats buried under the carpet. also some insight into how she taught him to speak, alphabets etc.. Idk if all this was in the book but things I was wondering about now. But having said all that, fantastic movie. worth a one time watch for sure. and DO read the book guys!Top 5 moments\n1. Loved the last scene where Jack says bye to everything. I absolutely loved that!\n2. Loved the scene where Jack's in the truck and then stands up to look at the world. Phenomenal shot!\n3. Loved the shots with Jack playing w/ the dog and with the friend and with Leo. Basically how he slowly opens up. Its lovely.\n4. Love the scene where Jack discovers the mom's unconscious in the bathroom. His expressions!!\n5. Love the scene where they're planning the escape after the mom finds the car in the dustbin and how he is so uncomfortable and yet cooperating with everything but says \"i HATE YOU\" and yet you can see just how much he loves her.

Jack felt like everything is happening with a reason, just the way it should be. His imagination made him believe that. It was also quite interesting watching how Jack's thoughts broadened up as time was passing by. I was surprised how well he adapted to new surroundings, unlike his poor mother.

            "content": "When I first heard the tiny voices of a five year old child describing how he/she (Sex wasn't specified at the time) has made a connection to every object in a shabby \"Room\", I opined in my mind that maybe it was a cheap ploy to draw out pity from the unsuspecting audience, who were totally unaware what they were in for. But without enough information on the context in which the child's words were conjured up, blended with the fact that the film was within a time frame of 5 minutes, I resolved to continue. And for the remaining 90 minutes I was left astounded because I had never seen a film that is so \"tortuous\" and \"touching\" at the same time-each \"T's\" given their own half and ground work to manifest, shine and totally connect with the audience in ripples.It all starts in a room-claustrophobic it is: a room that serves as a \"world\" to 5 year old jack and his Ma/Mum (played by Brie Larson). Immediately, it becomes visible to the audience that the duo are inhabiting in a poverty stricken situation, especially when you hear ma telling 5 year old Jack that the vitamin he is currently taking is his last or even when she tries to kill a rat, which is normal but with a discomfited explanation: telling jack that \"It might steal our food\". Enough bases are laid to show how deprived they are living with little exposition for their living conditions. Lo and behold, while concerned with their state of affairs, there is a high tendency to forget that all this takes place in just a \"Room\". No movement is shown on how they move into other quarters, which sort of leaves the viewer in a state of guesses. Is Ma a prostitute- considering that she locks Jack in the closet when a male visitor comes around? Or Ma might be living on government support while trying to maintain her crack addiction (far-fetched though). My guess was the first question and the most logical for anyone to conjecture. But it also goes to show how the hush-hush of the plot forces one to reason otherwise. A water closet without a lid, virtually no windows except the small glass sun-light entry at the roof with a lavatory, bed and a bathtub-all in one small space-a \"Room\"! The most intense moments in the film come with how Jack views his environs. It is his world. He was born in it-very in touch with the virtually non-existent happenings that take place. Things like cars, trees, the sky and even other humans are all abstract. At first sight, I thought Jack was a girl because of the long hair, but given the circumstances, one would understand why that came to be. I remember that scene where Ma tells him that there is a whole other world out there and not a planet like she had previously told him-his feedback was with disgust-vocally and vehemently hostile to Ma's words. Even when he goes out of \"Room\"-the yearning to go back guides his every being, how he reacts to every touch and fails to connect. Jack is played by Jacob Tremplay in one of the most pitiful as well as endearing performance from a child taken from his small confines and thrust into the world-finding it hard to fine-tune into the larger- than-\"Room\" earth. But his recovery is visually soothing-done in a step by step manner though with a little touch of let's-do-it-for- convenience-sake.It was a kidnap by a middle aged man that put Ma and Jack in the \"Room\". Only he knows the code to the room. He kidnapped Ma when she was 17, raped her and Jack was the product. Ma waited until Jack was 5 before she used him to find freedom. The scenes leading up to their escape no matter how valiant swings back and forth between borderline irresponsibility of a mother and last minute attempts at freedom-literally. Unfortunately for Ma, it takes Jack a little while to understand why Ma rolls him up in a rug or why she places a hot rag on his head so he can pretend sick. And in the process convince the captor to take him outside-a means by which Jack escapes. Brie Larson has played a mother before. See the film (Train wreck), in which she played Amy's sister: 2015's best romantic comedy yet! That protector/guardian/Mother role is a comfort zone for her; she plays it as if it is a second skin. But here, her work is laden with a puddle of grief and she lives up to the billing wedged between a downcast figure who reserves strength and optimism and a woman who struggles in the aftermath. The scenes after her character is rescued shows how much she is in touch with her sorrowful side, which is aided by the poignant feel of the film's score. \"Room\" is a harrowing experience. 2015's best-----yet! From my own perspective, this is the film to beat. Last year (2014), it was the dark, brooding, righteously-themed business drama: A Most Violent Year, but this year (2015) presents a melancholic-esque claustrophobe: \"Room\". It's usually small scale, little budget, independent, non-franchise films like this that makes the most sense-telling a story that reaches out to the heart and apprehension of its audience. I would bear false witness if I said it wasn't distressing-it is! The perturbing narrative claws at the gorge of human consciousness, and replicates itself there like a cell undergoing meiosis-it spreads and plants, adhering, which leaves the viewer to imagine him/herself in the same gloomy hopeless picture of a woman who has lived in a particular room for 7 years-no sun, no air, no human contact. This is the kind of film that will uplift the mood of prisoners after seeing it-who will in turn thank their stars for their plight-at least they get to feel the sunlight and interact with humans.",

The bond of them and their growth literally moved me.Moreover, the actors well show characters' emotion even Jacob Tremblay who acted Jack.

            "content": "When I read the book a few years back, I absolutely couldn't put it down. The story is incredibly powerful and your heart aches for young Jack. The part where he escapes literally had my heart pounding in my throat. It was an overall incredible reading experience, and because the book set such high standards, I didn't expect the movie to be able to top it, as usually happens with movies based on fantastic books. However, \"Room\" took me by surprise and really impressed me, albeit in different ways.In the book, Jack is the narrator, which was particularly powerful...since the reader is essentially blind and can only know what Jack describes, you largely have the same amount of knowledge about what is going on as he does for the first half of the story, and slowly put two and two together. Not being told what was explicitly going on was a great driving factor in the book, and Jack's escape was one of the most heart-pounding reading experiences in recent memory. I don't necessarily totally fault the movie for not being able to pull off quite the same experience as the story couldn't be told quite the same way in a visual medium, and obviously knowing the story I already knew what happened. However, I would have loved more shots from Jack's point of view in the movie, maybe even completely from his point of view. The richness and blissful ignorance of Jack's world and the interplay between his inner and outer mind was a very important theme decidedly missing from the film.However, one aspect of the film I did enjoy was the second half, post-escape. This part of the book I thought paled a bit in comparison to the first..once the reader 'knew' much more than Jack did the story lost something important, in my opinion (in fact, because of this, I thought the book should have ended with their escape) But in the film you got to explore beyond Jack's eyes and this second half is where this mattered most, for example you got to see a much better view of the implications for Jack's mother (helped in no small part by Brie's powerful performance, whose Oscar was well-deserved), and for the pair of them together as they navigate their freedom together, one learning for the first time and other re-learning. The way they presented this part was powerful and inherently had greater depth without the narratorial confines, and I liked it much more than I did in the book.Overall, although I have to be that annoying person with the obligatory \"book was better\" comment, I did very much enjoy the film for the reasons stated. It would have been interesting to see it without knowing the story already. I am very glad they brought this beautiful and heart-wrenching story to the big screen - the acting and cinematography was simply superb and young Jacob Tremblay clearly has stardom in his future.",

It is truly a moving film which interprets a story that must be known and share for people to be more aware of what the movie is trying to show the viewers in reality.

            "content": "Overall, this is a beautiful film, driven by a brilliant story and outstanding performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay.Larson is hugely deserving of her Golden Globe win, and I hope to see it replicated in the BAFTAs and Oscars. Conversely, Tremblay's lack of Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations is mad, his performance was one of the best parts of the movie! How does an 8-year-old even begin to portray the role of a 5-year-old who has only ever lived in a tiny room, while his mother is routinely abused by their captor, before being expelled into a harsh and alien world? I saw a quote from a review that said Tremblay's performance is \"a revelation\" and I couldn't agree more!However, I was surprised to find that the author, Emma Donoghue had also written the screenplay and yet changed so much from the original text! I'm not naive that films can't be rigidly faithful as certain things do not translate. For example, one of the most innovative elements of the book is that it's told completely from Jack's point of view, so work needed to be done to map that onto a film script, and naturally some changes would have been needed.But why change things like names? Officer Oh became Officer Parker for example. It's a trivial change, but having read the book only recently, it jarred and seemed unnecessary.Then there were the larger changes that undermined some of the story's power. Where Ma and Jack originally stayed in the hospital for what felt like a much longer time (admittedly from Jack's perspective), and greater care was taken not to expose Jack to the world before his immune system was ready, the film seemed to accelerate his transition. The passages in the hospital highlighted the desperate contradiction between Ma's need to heal and Jack's need to always be near her, which the film seemed to gloss over. Overall, the speed at which Ma and Jack progressed from escaping Room, through a brief hospital stay, her suicide attempt and their eventual adjustment to life Outside, undermined the complex emotional and physical struggle for both characters that Donoghue describes in the book.All that said, it was still an excellent film. Horrifying subject matter, told in a way that was moving and funny without being trite or disrespectful. If I hadn't read the book, I would probably have rated it a 9. Ardent lovers of the original book might find themselves a little disappointed in places, but I'd recommend it to all.",

            "content": "I didn't know anything about the movie until the Oscar buzz started. To say the least, I had my apprehensions before getting into the movie. Why? Because, I read the synopsis which implied that Brie Larson would be playing a mother. That didn't make a lot of sense to me, cause until 2 years ago she used to portray the role of teenagers in high school.Anyway, once I did actually start watching the movie, I was totally captivated by what I saw. The first 10 minutes hook you into the story and I kept wondering what will happen next?Brie Larson shines in her portrayal of the psychologically petrified, abused, yet selfless mother who gives everything it takes to protect and nurture her child. I was pleasantly surprised by her performance, because prior to this, I've only seen her in 21 Jump Street and Trainwreck, which are fun and campy movies, but her performance didn't stand out. Here, her performance is very nuanced and subtle, that it didn't feel like I was watching a movie, the events were unfolding in-front of my eyes and most of the credit goes to Larson for giving a stellar performance.Jacob Tremblay is phenomenal as Jack. Apart from Jacob, part of the credit goes to the casting directors who chose him, because you can't easily teach 7-8 year old to act, you need to choose a child whose demeanor and personality corresponds well with the character he/she will be portraying so that his performance comes across as natural one. If they hadn't chosen the right actor to portray Jack, the film wouldn't be getting the recognition it's getting right now. I'm excited to see what Jacob does next.The rest of the cast, which included the likes of Joan Allen and Matt Gordon play their roles beautifully.Lenny Abrahamson is a great storyteller and I'm really pumped to see what he does next. Let's see if he beats this one.I won't divulge much into the story, cause you need to experience it for yourself. The IMDb synopsis is enough to give you an idea of what you would be getting into. My only problem with the movie is that it felt 15 minutes longer than it should have been. The movie deals with the repercussions of what the characters endured in the room, which in my opinion was stretched longer than what would have sufficed.PS. Don't take my word for it, experience it for yourself. You might even cry at a point in the movie, when the characters achieve redemption.My Rating: 8.5/10",

Another positive thing about this movie is that it does not only tell the story of being prisoners and the escape - but also the life after; adapting to \"reality\".

            "content": "'Room' tackles a very dark and complex subject matter. It is centred on a fictional incident of a man abducting, imprisoning and raping a young woman for several years. There are many ways a writer or a filmmaker could approach this topic. Some may choose to play up the abuse to invoke a visceral reaction from the audience while others may focus on the resulting media blitz. 'Room' does depict both the abuse and the media reaction but it does not dwell on them. Instead, its main focus is the relationship between the woman, Joy, and the son she birthed in captivity, Jack. This is a great way to approach the premise as it allows the audience to get to know them, which makes us care for them. In some moments, I found myself rooting for the characters and hoping that they would succeed. In others, I felt bad for them when they irrationally acted out in anger instead of feeling annoyed. These well-developed characters are brought to life further by two very strong performances. Brie Larson (Joy) and Jacob Tremblay (Jack) bring out the emotional depth to their characters that makes us empathise with them. Although Larson has been touted as the lead of the film, Joy shares the position of protagonist with Jack. Many shots were filmed at low angles including those from Jack's point of view, allowing us to see the world from his perspective. This directing choice also makes Room, the name Joy and Jack gave to the garden shed that acts as their prison, seem a lot bigger than it actually is, reflecting how it makes up the entirety of Jack's world. To top it off, there are montages that feature voice-over narration by Jack, which reflects the images on screen. Unfortunately, I found myself focusing on the visuals and missing the narration. I don't know for sure why I did this. Maybe I wasn't in the mood to listen to prose read aloud. I'll have to wait for my second viewing to get a definite answer.The one complaint I have that does feel definite \u2013 although minor \u2013 is the music that accompanied the start of an important sequence. The piece of music was designed to be emotional and intense in a way that would be more appropriate for the climax of such a sequence. Fortunately, the sequence did become emotional and intense as it progressed. I admittedly find it difficult to connect with characters on an emotional level but the time spent developing the characters made me feel the impact of this scene.I will need to watch this film again before saying I loved it but I definitely liked it a lot. If you are looking for an emotional film with strongly written and acted characters, seek 'Room' out when you can.",

            "content": "With moments full of beautiful lyricism mixing with deep questions about the proper fallout from serious trauma, Room is a mostly successful turn of tiny cinema. It leaves a lasting mark in the obvious but very well done climax. But with what seems to be the theme of the year, what starts and ends strong stumbles along the way to that ending, often rambling itself into too much. Certainly, here would be a film that could have been just about the best 45 minute short anyone could ask for... But I'm not sure it works for me as a feature.When it breaks into lyrical musings on Room, World, Space, etc. is when this film is at its most effective, memorable, and thought-provoking. This is probably in no small way a telling sign of the wonderful \"book author adapts screenplay of her work\" aspect. Without having read the book, I imagine those sections are lifted straight from the prose. If not, they felt like it, and it was a feeling of a fairy tale story that reminded me in some way of \"Another Earth\" in style that I longed for more from this film.As far as the narrative goes... Based on the logline, I have to say that the whole plot played out just about how I imagined. There were no surprises for me, and I only felt that nagging me because it seemed like the direction was pushing this as 'shocking surprise.' But for me, it felt right into what I figured it would be.The performances are of a very high-quality... But I found Brie Larson's character to be the supporting role here. It's a great performance, don't get me wrong... But it's not the knockout punch she gave in Short Term 12, nor is it the knockout punch I expected from the awards season hype machine. On the other hand... Jacob Tremblay gives one of the best performances of the year by ANYONE- regardless of age or gender. Here is one of the finest performances by a young actor I can recall. Goes right up there with Ms. Tatum O'Neill and Mr. Haley Joel Osment. It is truly a wonder... The power he holds in his eyes, in his understanding (or certainly the directors) of the confusion of the situation... It's the glue that holds the movie together. It is well worth the price of admission just to see this child light up the whole world.After they break from room, the movie rambles and stumbles until the final scene. Again... a SHORT of this- around 45 minutes in run time... Would be perfect. I didn't feel enough holding my interest for a good hour after the escape. But all in all, this is one that I am very glad Hollywood made. Brie Larson is the future. I always enjoy her more than J-Law, and can't wait to see what she does next. Her maturity and focus is beautiful, and I'm definitely a fan.Room asks big questions, and I am still thinking about what the answers are... I've always been fascinated by the feral experience, and this almost went there. I'd love if it had, but that would probably take away too much from that perfect, perfect performance by the actual lead of the movie, Jack.",

This is an incredible film with fantastic performances from the 2 leads. Brie Larson is, as is always the case, excellent, but is blown away by an unbelievable performance from young Jacob Tremblay. It can only be because of his tender years that he didn't receive Oscar recognition as I don't believe we will see a better performance this year. Of course a lot of the credit for this must go down to fantastic direction from Abrahamson. As for the film, it is abhorrent, terrifying, warm, emotional, uplifting and life affirming, and not necessarily in that order. Your emotions change from one way to another many times throughout the run time. The genius of the film is that it shows the world from the child's perspective, after watching imagine how it would have looked if it had been showed from the mothers and shiver.",

First of all, you should avoid watching the trailer of this movie if you really want to experience the movie as it should be.The story takes place within ''Room'' , a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight. The condition of the room is bad, it looks all dirty and not sane at all. You can quickly see what's going on, within the first minutes of this original Drama film. I don't want to say too much, because you just need to experience it yourself during the viewing, and you will quickly understand what's going on. It made me cry, it made me smile, it made me have a hell of a good time, that's for sure and also, it made my heart beat so fast during some scenes, and really care about this kid and his mom.The acting is superb.Brie Larson (Ma) delivers one of the best performance as an actress, if not the best, for this year. Jacob Tremblay (Jack) is one of the finest young actor I have ever seen in a movie. Normally, young actors bother me, but this young man did a really good job. The movie deserves the Oscar nominations, as Brie Larson.All in all, i strongly recommend you to buy this movie at full price if you are looking for a good drama movie. Comment Comment | Permalink",

Sure, he's young, but there is no way he's undamaged after that. The mother, raped, abused, inprisoned, had some brakedowns, but none were solved onscreen. Also, how the hell does that acting win you an oscar? Not saying it was bad..but it wasn't Oscar worthy. With that script there's not much you can do. But there was no emotion on her face at the end when she saw the room again. No reacton. A lot of actresses would've dona a much, much better job. She just wasn't convincing enough. In fact, nothing about this movie was convinsing. Their escape? Behaviour of their kidnapper? Completly unrealistick. Some of it (him living the kid so he can spill his dirty sicret) was just ilogical. There were some nice shots there, though. Jack (the kid) narates the story. To him that small room seems big. They've managed to capture that, so points for that. Also, the kid is a pretty good actor for his age. But that's about it. \nAll in all, this movie was a dissapointmant and a waste of time.",

Jack and his Ma have to separate at two critical points both will struggle and Joan Allen as the mother of one and grandmother of the other offers support, help and tenderness as she copes with what is both joyous but painful aided by her boyfriend who Jack takes to as another source of support ,comfort and understanding.

            "content": "Envision spending your entire life confined to a single room, the size of a shed, with just a small skylight as your only perception of the outside world. For Jack (Jacob Tremblay), this was his life. This was all he knew. Room (2015) is a film based off of the best-selling novel by Emma Donoghue, told through the eyes of Jack, the five year old son of Ma (Brie Larson). Jack and Ma escape from this small confinement and attempt to adjust to something Jack never knew existed, the world.Room is a small story driven independent movie. And like many of its kind, Room has to rely on a great screenplay, solid acting, and moving character development for it to get wide recognition. Room delivers on all of these aspects. You know a movie really tugs on the heartstrings when you notice multiple viewers in the theater crying during specific scenes. Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson are near flawless together on screen as they depict the highs and lows of being confined to a single room for years, as well as their transition back to society.It was very interesting to witness the depictions of what a child would believe as real, or not, based upon what he has been deprived of. Luckily, Jack and Ma have a television, but Ma has had to shelter Jack from some aspects of what really is going on outside of the 10x10 shed because she fears what this knowledge might bring to him. Real, TV world, space, aliens, and people are concepts that are different to Jack. The only other person he sees besides Ma, is old Nick (Sean Bridgers), whom Jack only sees through the cracks of the wardrobe he sleeps in.Once they escape this world called room, director Lenny Abrahamson is tasked with showing how Jack adjusts to this seemingly alien planet. Both trauma and confusion seem accurately depicted as Jack and Ma both have mixed responses to what Jack has never known, and what Ma's life used to be. By the end of the movie, it felt satisfyingly complete, as it touched back on the initial openings, reoccurring themes, and feelings of closure for Jack and Ma.As mentioned above, the film does receive a standing ovation from bringing the viewers to feel deep compassion for the character. However, the times of suspense should only get a pat on the back. The sense of danger, fear, and urgency does not seem to suck you in. Part of this was attributed to the score that at times seemed more redundant and annoying. What seemed to be the same piano notes only appeared during scenes of sadness, awe, and joy, but nothing was there to enhance the other scenes.The only criticism of the directorial style was the lapse in direction that the story was supposed to take towards the end of the film. The entire time the story was told through the eyes of Jack. However, towards the last part of the movie, there was a shift that included some of Ma's point of view. This slightly took away from the ways a five year old would try to explain certain behaviors or actions of adults. Also, for those who have read the book, don't expect the movie to include every aspect of it. Just like every other film based on books, graphic novels, comics, or even true events, only certain aspects can be adapted and some must be altered in order to try and make the best move possible.Room is definitely an emotional journey through trauma and discovery. It has very strong storytelling and acting. Room fell short in some aspects, though they did not sufficiently diminish the overall experience of the film. It brings different concepts for those to learn from, such as the importance of family, experience, and empathy towards others. If you want to escape the confinements of recent big budget films, or want to experience something moving that you will not forget, go see Room. Room earns an unwavering 8/10.Read more movie reviews and discussions from graymattermovies.wordpress.com",

From the first shot you're instantly struck by the superb cinematography and the way one room can be portrayed. The simple and beautifully easy way of life for the 5 year old boy is fascinating to watch and draws you into their world with ease.It's a long, slow film but doesn't feel like it in either case. Full of emotional, nail biting scenes it's a brilliant roller-coaster of emotions; you can't beat the odd tear of happiness when watching a film.Bree Larson is up for Best Actress at the Oscars for this role and it's easy to see why, some wonderful acting on her part and indeed the entire (quite small) cast.

As the story develops, I was thinking of a dramatic scene to turn the situation over but it was done naturally without a flaw. That makes it powerful and convincing enough to add to the genuine feel to the movie. The best part of the story comes when joy was rescued. The tensions between her and her son, dad and mom are so real and strong yet subtle. The protective-possessive syndrome of Joy just highlights the essence of the whole captive situation. Victim victimises. I highly recommend this film to anyone who are interested to explore something deeper into human emotion especially to all the child psychologist or therapist out there.",

To raise a child in such a small and strange place, she names it Room, and brings it to Jack as if it is the entire world. When Joy and Jack find the opportunity to escape Room, they have to adjust to the world together.Whilst it may not seem so, Room is a very, very wholesome movie centered around the redemption of a depressed woman and her son. Just imagine being 5 years old, having seen nothing but a small shed and the sky, and then escaping and seeing the entire world in front of you.The movie deals with mature themes such as rape, depression and suicide. The acting is wonderful in this movie, coming from both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, who was 9 years old at the time! The story is very gripping and realistic, so it has a different kind of impact on you. Besides that, the plot and the dialogues are greatly written.One of the best movies I have ever watched.",

The writing had me invested in the story, the acting had me invested in the characters and the film making was incredibly unique giving me even more of an appreciation for the movie. As I said though, what had me hooked the most was the fact that the content of the film was hitting me on an emotional level. Whilst following their own personal arcs, I was experiencing the same emotions and understanding where they were coming from. That's intelligent movie making.I can only say good things about this film. The only reason I didn't give it a ten is because I'm a sucker for sweeping environment style cinematography that obviously didn't have relevance in this kind of film, however, upon a rematch I may be inclined to change this and give this movie a rating of ten.",

            "content": "This story about a young mother, stuck in captivity with her innocent five-year old son, is among the finest shown in cinema over these past couple of years. Though there is a glimpse into the horrors of being what it's like to experience being locked up by a twisted, cruel captor for many years inside his small garden shed, the plot also emphasises the struggles they face when having to face the real world that lays outside of 'Room'. Yet through it all, the deep and unbreakable bond between Ma and her little boy, Jack, which punctuates virtually every scene, is what makes this film so moving and never ceases to uplift.Brie Larson's performance as Ma is absolutely phenomenal; her portrayal as this woman protecting her little boy while battling the gut-wrenching struggles of being stuck inside Room, and then facing the difficulties of transitioning back to the outside world is so beautifully authentic. It was no surprise, and certainly no injustice, that she gained a 100% deserved Oscar win for Best Actress that year. Jacob Tremblay's portrayal as this sheltered, innocent little boy born into this dark world without a full awareness of what's truly going on is also fantastic. The outstanding chemistry between Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay is a huge contributing factor in successfully bringing across this story onto screen.But aside from the emotionally powerful storyline and excellent acting of the two leads, it is also a brilliantly shot film. Lenny Abrahamson fully deserved his Best Director nomination at the Oscars (despite never standing a chance against the likes of Inarittu that year) as he makes excellent use of cinematography, editing and set design to give an authentic picture of the character's perspective of what Room would be like, as well as the outside world later on. Some of the shots are truly beautiful, in spite of the lack of flashy special effects or lavish set design. Just in case you thought this film would only be good for its acting or emotional capacity, it is a genuinely well filmed movie.It's great to see that this film on the IMDB Top 250 list, that it's at least come close to getting it's deserved recognition. I would confidently proclaim this as one of the best films of this decade, right up there with the likes of Inception and 12 Years a Slave, not something many people would say.",

I cry and I feel like my whole body feels every emotion Brie Larson conveys through her portrayal of Joy. As for Jacob Tremblay for such a young actor I feel he nails his character Jack on the head perfectly. For anyone who has children you will most definitely get chills watching this film. I believe it was written so well and executed beautifully. The way the story is told and how was absolutely genius. I feel as if its a hard movie to describe to someone without giving away any aspects to the film. Room is a movie that makes you look at things a slight bit different. Makes you questions things you might not normally question. Gives you a contrary perspective on how what may be \"normal\" on the outside isn't what it seems.",

With a very hard and deep topic, solid performances and the greatest photographer, screen-writers, directors,etc ever, Room will be one of my all-time-favorite-heart-breaking-movies. You want to cry? Just give this movie like, ten minutes, ant then we talk. Another great thing about Room is that, yeah, it's heart-breaking, it deals with a pretty taboo topic and is very real; but at the same tame is fast-passing and its so easy to connect with the characters...

            "content": "Right from the beginning of this film, the director establishes the theme of the movie by giving us extreme close-ups of Room, and narrating through the eyes of the boy named Jack. Jack takes us through his whole world, giving everything a name, and gives the audience complete view of the space in which Jack and his mother, Joy, live.The points of view used this in this film are quite amazing. When the view is directly from Jack's point of view, you feel as if you are inside him. Especially when he is rolled up in the rug and Nick carries him out of the shed. He is seeing the \"world\" for the first time, and it makes you feel first as if you cannot breathe, and that you can actually feel the tightness of the rug wrapped around you. Then the awe and wonder that he feels when seeing the sky for the first time as he is lying in the back of the truck, and the sights and the sounds, makes you feel like you are seeing them for the first time. The music adds to this feeling. The awe and wonder is short lived, and replaced with a sudden and powerful fear that comes when Jack jumps out of the truck and Nick comes after him. The film then transitions from being in a very tight, routine driven, small world, into the \"real\" world, and the rest of the movie deals with how Joy and Jack adjust to this new life.The psychological drama that unfolds during this part of the film is very deep and emotional. The struggles of both Joy and Jack adjusting to living in the world outside of Room become very real through their eyes. The dialog used throughout this second part of the movie is done very well, and the use of the close-up shots draw the audience right into the emotions that the characters are feeling. This is a roller coaster of emotions, from anger, to sadness, to wonder and absolute joy.The acting in this film is absolutely superb. As a child actor, Jacob Tremblay, does an incredible job at conveying his feelings through his facial expressions. I have never seen a child as young as he is with that kind of ability. The relationship between mother and son in this film is intense and deeply moving. The chemistry between Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson is both believable and touching. In the end, the audience is left with the knowledge that there is much to be learned through the eyes of a child.",

I'm a big reader of crime news and Ma's story and reasons for her actions were very believable and reasonable. The first half of the story was very thrilling and the second half actually falls a bit flat, but it's a realistic representation of life. People who expect things to continue with \"and they live happily ever after\" will be disappointed.The story is also meant to be seen as it is - focused on the psyche of the two main characters.

The child actor Jacob Tremblay, who plays Jack, is very good in this, one of the best child actors I have ever seen.

I suspect she could have sold the film rights to a big name director like Peter Jackson or Steven Spielberg. We would have been treated to a talking egg snake or an animated plant. Sometimes too much money doesn't make a better film. ROOM is proof of that. ROOM is proof that less is way more, that subtlety and nuance is far more valuable than every special effect that money can buy. Ms. Donoghue was protective of her work and it paid off. She went with a director who understood the novel and who was willing to collaborate with the author. Director Lenny Abrahamson has brought ROOM beautifully to life on the screen. The director is true to the feel of the novel. Donoghue has done a terrific job on the screenplay. And the two lead actors totally inhabit Ma and Jack. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deserve every great review, every award they can get. Tremblay isn't just a talented child actor. He's a talented actor. He's extraordinary, present in every moment he's on screen which is pretty much every scene of the movie. Larson shows us so many layers of Ma, a young woman who is trapped and needs her young son to help her win their freedom. We feel her love for her son, her fear for his future, her frustrations and her battles with the after shocks of life in Room. ROOM is a beautiful film about the life saving love a mother has for her child and his love for her. The only thing I wish was that ROOM had gotten wider distribution. It's a film that is a must see.",

I am sure he will has a successful career before him.I just resent the fact that Ma's character did not get developed thoroughly. There are a couple of lose ends there, and his discomfort with the whole story is not really explained properly.It's worth for the story, and for the acting.

Very subtly done. A child is deprived of any experiences for his first five years except his mothers love in a cloistered room devoid of nature. This allows the watcher of the movie to experience this hell vicariously which is very disturbing and upsetting. I admired the mother for protecting her son as much as possible from her suffering yet in the end once she was free from that responsibility she had a breakdown and could no longer function.

We were shown how Joy who was held captive for seven years copes with the world and have her five year old son who has seen nothing but the room entire life.

It is a story of five years old Jack and his Mother, Ma who live together in a room. Young actor Jacob Tremblay played the role of Jack. He was tremendous, he acted like everything a five years would do. He is happy kid, with lots of interests, loves his Ma and gets angry sometimes. His Mother told him room is the world and there is no outside when he was young. When he became five, she revealed and tried to convince him about the existence of world. Jack got out and amazed by the outside world. He became attached to his Grandma, her friend and their dog. But his mother needed some time to adjust with all the changes. Actress Brie Larson did so great in portraying Ma character that she won an Oscar award for her role. She is the most deserving candidate, the emotion and attachment she showed for her son was impressed.The direction, story-lines and acting of all the casts is great, so is the background music and cinematography.

            "content": "I will start with the second half of the vovie - the acting was good, so this is why I rated the movie with 5 Stars... But the plot feels flat and yes is also boring (as sometimes mentioned in other reviews)... Not enough for an objective style of telling like it is based on a real case and not entertaining enough to spend another hour... When Joy first entered the house of their parents and the mother said something like \"You know Leo from earlier days, right?\" I hoped so Bad that there is at least a twist in the end like \"I loved your mother since I first met her, I told old Nick to bring you and kill to distroy your family, but he had his own plans\"... That would also explain why Robert (the father) stay close to their former Family - because the things Nancy and Robert had to Deal with Family and all emotion... Nevertheless, Robort could return to their Family because he overthink his feelings and rude reaction and has the Chance to rescue his from Leo... But in the end, Leo is just a nice guy... There are (as sometimes mentioned) a lot of subplots, questions and inner feelings that the viewer want to know - but they just end somethere... So the end, when they visit \"The Room\" again and apparently just go back to grandmas house to do whatever and however long, okayyyy... It's nice to see that Jack found a friend before and everything seems more normal... But I think it would be way better, if Jack turned 6 in the End and statt visiting a school - maybe in same class as his new friend - to Show the World moved on and this is a new chepter in life...So, I talked a lot about the second half of the movie - for me, the real problem is the first half...I don't know where to start - the whole escapeplan is based on the fact that Jack exactly do what Joy said, Old Nick totally Do and act like Joy want/hope - are you Sure?!... The whole preise with \"The Room\" has a lack of fear and hopelessness... Like if you Show someone an old fantasymovie and for him there is less magic and mystery today as it was in the 80s - because of the kownledge about certain things... It's more or less the same with \"The Room\"... with the difference that it really plays nowadays and you just have to be a thinking human... Compared to \"The Room\" - every Escaperoom (the ones I Was) you spend money for fun, seems like a deathtrap and every \"Saw\" movie seems realistic... The room is in the garden, a simple cabin, no room in the basement of an old factory behind a heavy mechanic door... How long would it take, that everyone who is imprisoned and able to move free around start inspecting the room... And if there aren't cameras or something like this, so there are no signs that you are observed all the time, I would start to make plans how to escape... Even if the room wasn't equiped like this when Joy moved in, there would be something in the room to throw and smash against the sky Light, so you know since the first hour what kind of window it is and could it be possible to destroy it someday to escape (what would even be possible with a Baby)... I'm sure, in the last years she had enough stuff to build something like a stairway to reach the window and smash it... In the case, that the window is some super mega window that is also used in the White House - there is at least one other way to escape... After years of visits, there should be marks on the keypad on the used numbers (old Nick is the only one who used it and he problebly always know the right code - the code itself isn't very long, three to four digits... So she has enough time and nothing to lose... Even if you can't the fitting digits after a long time... You have enough time to find and try out which things in their household make almost marks, so if you arn't aware of it during typing, you will not notice... It would be also possible to wish something for handcraft for their eggshells - like glue and glitterpowder... So the some days later you can show what you made to old Nick an if he touches the egg most likely that he has something on the finges when he uses the pad (I think he isn't that smart)... Everything is better than doing nothing or wait for an risky plan like the hat with the death... I was really upset the first hour auf the movie... And thats not a good Sign... The strangest Thing for me - everything happend in 21th century, Joy is in their district, passed the house of old Nick lives in a cabin in the garden... Normally the police uses mantrailer dogs to find people, even with a decent scent... That wouldn't be that hard... Thats why I am not okay with this movie...Additional: If you are in the same situation an have some knowledge in technics - these kind of Electronic locks on the door you can most likely trick out with a stronger magnet... Due to the fact the whole room is like a giant magnetic board, Joy could wish a bunch magnets for Jacks arts...\nAnother way to \"cry for help\"... Due to the fact Joy and her mother have Smartphones show that Everything happend nowadays... Because I can't see an antenna at the roof of the cabin, I think the TV in the room is connected to cablenetwork... Besides TV, today every Provider delivers Internetservices over cable... Because they haven't the Equipment, they can't send anything, but they are able to disrupt the whole cluster they are connect to (and I don't think old Nick is clever enough to link to with activities in the room... Due to complaints of others in the area, the provider sends a Team with an equipted car to find the source of disruption (thats what providers do worldwide)... And when the find out its from that house, they are looking whats wrong - if necessary with the help of the police...That are all things, why I say the movie isn't thrilling, there is n\u00f6 real hopelessness...",

But the darker things written in the novel, although they escaped they still had to face complex societies, and even the cruel reality that the victims are still subject to moral doubts does not show much. That the film focused more on the child at last is cured but also weakened the intensity. I felt a little pity about this.

I wouldn't have been surprised if the movie had been just about the time spent in Room with an escape finale (the typical on this subject), but being able to get a glimpse of life outside hell from more than one perspective, made the movie complete. I've read the reviews that said the movie is about nothing. It's true. It's about nothing but inner struggle, nothing but constant moving on, nothing but parental worries&strategies&love, nothing but inner conflicts, nothing but life. So it's not the movie that lacks depth, you just need your own personal depth to relate.",

            "content": "Warning: This review contains an overuse of the word \"complete.\" Rarely have I seen a movie that comes together so completely and is without a flaw from beginning to end. I'm struggling to think of a scene or even a shot that was out of sync with the rest of the movie or that needed improvement. Every shot and every scene is written, acted, filmed, directed, scored and edited in such a complete and perfect way that, honestly, it makes most other movies feel and look incomplete. One doesn't have to have a degree in film or even attended film school to enjoy this movie, but it was amazing to see my film class lessons brought to life on the screen (especially when I re-watched the movie). From the way \"Room\" is written and filmed, to the way it's acted and directed, and to the rises and falls and tensions of the story, the movie uses all those elements to present each shot, each scene and eventually an entire movie that feels complete from beginning to end.As an example, the dinner with Ma, Jack, grandpa, grandma and Leo is full of so much tension and drama and the great William H. Macy gives these subtle looks that say so very much without him saying the actual words. And Ma's/Joy's reaction is equally great not only in this scene, but throughout the movie, in that these little, subtle looks and gestures add up to say so much more than words could ever say. Another example of this 'completeness' comes in what Jack says to some of the objects in the room in the beginning of the movie, and then repeats them in the end, but in the opposite way. What this means is that the writers, cast and crew of this film know exactly what they are doing, know exactly how to do it, and, amazingly, then set out and achieve what they wanted to achieve, which, sadly, is rare in movies and even rarer in real life.So at this point if anyone (including myself) wants to argue my point that this movie is \"complete,\" Webster's defines the word \"complete\" as \"having all the necessary parts; not lacking anything.\" So in that sense of the word, \"Room,\" to me, is, well, complete!",

I thought the premise was super interesting, I'm also a huge fan of a number of films where people are held captive, trapped, or otherwise confined to one space, like \"Misery\" or several Polanski films or the Spanish movie \"Buried\". \"Room\" however pales in comparison. I was hoping for some suspense, some drama, but I found the movie to be emotionally flat and not very well-acted. I get it, this is supposed to be a \"quiet, gentle\" film, to quote the reviewer below me, but that's exactly what Hollywood is not good at, in my humble opinion. They will give you something that looks emotional on the surface and - no offense - will fool many people into believing that they saw something special, something beautiful and touching. But seriously, when I think about \"Buried\", this was also a very low-key movie, but it left me dumbfounded and shaken to the core. Around the time I watched \"Room\", I also stumbled upon the Danish film \"Anklaget\" (English title: \"Accused\") on Netflix. Now, this was an emotionally harrowing movie, by the end I had tears in my eyes. \"Room\" however left me strangely cold. I was also shocked to read later that Brie Larson got an Oscar for this completely forgettable performance. Is that really all it takes nowadays, Academy? I also found it absolutely not believable that the man would not check if the boy was really dead inside the carpet, but I could live with this if the movie had been better overall. I know 1 star is a little harsh, but I simply can't give more, seeing how many far better movies have a much lower rating. In reality I would probably give it 5 stars.",

            "content": "This is a dazzling movie.The film is superbly built; the first half is set within 'Room'; for Joy (Brie Larson) it is the shed where she's been held hostage, for her little boy Jack (Jacob Tremblay) it is the only world he knows. Joy has told him that the only thing outside of Room is outer-space and anything seen on TV only exists in TV-land. One of the most intriguing aspects of the film is the contrasting lenses through which Joy and Jack look at the world and specifically Room. For Jack it's all he's ever known; he affectionately names each object - sink, bath, plant, wardrobe. For Joy, it represents oppression, for Jack, it's life. And yet, the promise of trees and leaves and dogs is still alluring - Joy eventually lets Jack in on the truth about 'outside' before hatching a plan to escape. The intensity rises throughout the opening sequence as the desperation of their situation becomes more apparent. As Jack plays dead and their evil captor loads him into a truck wrapped in a carpet, I have never wanted anything more passionately in a film than for their plan to succeed - it had to. My heart wouldn't cope if it didn't, such is the strength of connection that Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay create through their incredibly forceful and convincing performances.Thankfully their plan did work and the film could easily have ended here; a story of brutal oppression, despair, hope, uncertainty and ultimate victory; a classic tale. Mother and son out in the open. Free with trees and leaves. Granny and Grampa. It would have been a good film.The reality had far more depth. Joy had escaped; it'd been all she'd wanted, all she'd thought about but now she was there, she wasn't happy. Jack wasn't happy either, although his reasons are more immediately apparent; losing the comfort and security of home and the close proximity of his Ma. What Joy was processing was far more nuanced; perhaps an element of guilt-ridden anti-climax, what-now syndrome, a remorseful and personal look at how life had moved on without her - her parents had separated and gotten on with their lives. Did she even matter? Overwhelming insecurities over her parenting naturally arose.All of this drives her to the edge of death as she attempts to end it but this moment gives her some perspective. Jack cuts off his hair - his 'strong' - and sends it to her in hospital. This display of love and affection empowers Joy and she comes back a stronger, happier woman and a stronger, happier mum, scarred by trauma unimaginable but on the road to a better life.It's two magical performances from Larson and Tremblay. It's a mesmerising tale that is expertly woven together into an exceptional film. In my opinion is deserves Best Picture and if Larson doesn't win Best Actress then I will eat my hat and wonder what the world is coming to.",

At the beginning of this film, I felt claustrophobic, uncomfortable and a little bit confused, and what is more incredible is that I felt the same exact things at the end of this film. From the very ord to the very end, it span me 360 degrees with such emotional might and main that my head wouldn't stop spinning for quite a considerable throw thereafter. I think this is the best complement I can pay to a film, in that it is something new and fresh, something which the most part of men have never laid eyes upon, a thing completely distinct, but more than that is that unlike thousands of other movies that I have watched in my lifetime this is one of those rare few from which I walked away feeling something very strong for quite some time and that is worth a lot in my humble opinion.\"",

Brie Larson gave one of the best performances by an actress that I have ever seen and in return took home the Oscar for Best Actress. At only 9 years old, even Jacob Tremblay gave an amazing performance. I honestly think he should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor, despite his age. Overall, I don't think the movie could have been cast any better than it was.Throughout the whole two hours of this movie, I was glued to my TV. There are very few movies that have ever had my attention like Room did. No other movie has made me feel so sad, happy, stressed, and relieved all at once. In fact, before watching Room, I had never in my life cried over a movie or TV show, but that changed when I watched Room.If you have not seen this movie yet then I highly recommend that you do.

Also, that's why I like it so much ;) The director choose to give us only vague guidelines about the core events, through little everyday interactions of the two main characters: a mother and her son. For those hungry for more, sometimes you'll get bits and pieces of kid's internal monologues, interpretations of things happening... But as far as the mother's character concerning - it's reduced to a minimalist, somewhat 'live stream' point of view, not even a documentary one, cause that one would insert at least some of her reasoning, points of view. We get none, just her actions and those are all about dealing with her son's reactions. It's a tricky little world, just a tiny little Room; yet left wide open, for us to imagine her emotions and thoughts about it all... I love it. You may not.

            "content": "Room is based on, among other incidents, the crimes of Josef Fritzl, but it's not a horror film: it's a drama about people who are habituated to imprisonment. From the opening moments of Room, we are guided by five year-old Jack(Jacob Tremblay), as he tells us what his world is: Plant, Sink, Ma and TV. Everything else is Outer Space, where Old Nick(Sean Bridgers), owner of Room, gets them Sunday treats.Ma(Brie Larson) is the only one who takes care of Jack, but she's no saint: she gets upset, she gets frustrated, she lashes out, and so does Jack. But none of the drama is overblown, instead staying firmly in reality: Larson and Tremblay give naturalistic performances, while Abrahamson's direction shows us Jack's perspective, without being showy or distracting. Instead his camera simply hovers between the characters, and we feel we are observing life from Jack's mind. For an Irish-Canadian-British production, it seems to take more cues from the humanism of a Dardennes Brothers film than a Hollywood drama. The story develops unexpectedly, even if you think you know where it's going, seemingly unfolding without any plot contrivance. Emma Donoghue's screenplay has a rare understanding for how children speak, with cries of \"liar, liar, pants on fire\", but never talks down to her audience. Casual references are made to Room, and Ma and Jack's past, so that it feels like they exist beyond just what we're seeing. You will also cry. It's unavoidable. Jack lives in the young world of exaggerated emotions, and we join him. There are big moments when he discovers the world, emphasised by slow motion and an emotional score; but there are quieter moments, such as when Jack meets a dog for the first time. While only brief, they are handled honestly and provoke a reaction from the audience without demanding. It's not a perfect film, as a couple of interactions feel forced and the second act could be trimmed down. But these are just quibbles: Room is a drama that manages to tell a moving story without resorting to sappiness or melodrama. You could argue that by the time the credits roll, many of the plot threads are left unresolved. But that would be missing the point: Abrahamson is telling the story of Jack and his Room, not Ma, or Old Nick or anyone else: and for him everything if finished.",

            "review_title": "Mythic",
            "content": "From womb to Room to tombLast week we saw the Oscar nominated film, Room, whose star Brie Larson won best female actor. On its surface, it is obviously a story of trauma, rescue, and recovery. A teen-ager in high school, Brie (Ma) is kidnapped and held prisoner in a backyard shed. After two years, she gives birth to a child (Jack) fathered by her captor/rapist. She raises him for five years, keeping him safe from her kidnapper, and creates for Jack a belief in a world no bigger than the small area contained within the shed's four walls, lit by a small skylight above. Seven years after her capture, Brie and Jack get free and the second half of the movie is their difficult integration into a new/old world of family and society.I read the book a couple of years ago when it appeared on the Booker Prize list, but the movie clarified for me central images and themes I missed earlier. Room is, in fact, a contemporary retelling of Plato's \"allegory of the cave\" and illustrates, as well, the process of spiritual awakening from life to death to rebirth.Plato's uses the allegory to describe the depths of illusion and fear that keep individuals clinging to their ignorance of reality. A group of people are chained in the cave facing inward toward its wall. Behind them is a fire. In front of them, but behind a curtain, other people go back and forth carrying sticks with objects upon them that cast shadows upon the wall.The prisoners mistake those moving images as reality, as Ma tells Jack the characters on television are actually as flat and unreal as they appear on the screen. To protect him, the only world she reveals to him is the one they jointly create within the shed.Even when a prisoner is forced into the world outside the cave, he resists opening his eyes. When he finally does he cannot accept the objects in the sunlit world as real. Similarly, Jack does not believe his mother when she first reveals to him the existence of a real world he has never seen. Essentially, to make their escape, he must have faith not only in her, but in an unseen reality outside Room.Jack's awakening or better yet his illumination is preceded by symbolic death. Acting as if he is dead, he is wrapped in a carpet/shroud and placed in a truck bed to cross into the next world. Peering through the end of the red carpet, we can imagine Jack sees the strange sky and light as an infant perceives what lies outside the birth canal.As in Plato's allegory, Jack has difficulty trusting the new people and objects in his environment and expresses a wish to return to Room. Wearing a face mask against possible infection and sunglasses, Jack has difficulty negotiating the stairs that take him from one to another level of his new reality.Jack's mother, however, did an extraordinary job within Room maintaining his capacity for attachment, love, and curiosity. He shows interest and empathy, for example, toward Mouse when he appears in Room.Jack eventually begins a process toward individuation. His mother finally rejects his wish to nurse and he accepts this. And when Ma begins to experience the expected obstacles toward recovery following the initial euphoria of rescue, he gives her a portion of his newly cut 5 year old hair to as a restorative sacrifice and symbolic offering of help.Gradually with the help of the love and wisdom of his grandmother and the patient tutelage of her companion, Leo, and Leo's dog, Jack is led further from Room and the unconsciousness of his prior relation to Ma. Jack is now, as Joseph Campbell would have it, a hero.I write this piece not simply for the intellectual pleasure it provides me, but for its parallel to what is possible for us. From the loss of the first taken for granted world of Ma when she was a teen, and for Jack the loss of Room, the only world he has known, we can see ourselves having to adjust multiple times to the changes wrought by the progression of chronic illness . And if Jack and Ma can adapt and even flourish in each strange and ever new world, so perhaps can we. And, of course, we miss our former world, as Jack does Room, but then, as with Plato's freed prisoner, we turn toward the light.",

At its depth it's a simple story of a moms love for her son, and the bond that they share. A story that will always stand the test of time.\u00a0Jack (Jacob Trembly) gives us an amazing performance. Kid actors are hard to come by. And good ones are rare, and ones where the entire story revolves around one is next to impossible. Jacob does an amazing job as this kid who has no clue what the world is. Most kids can do an OK job at acting a kid. But he is ten, he is obviously past this age. But it's never a time they remember, so they have nothing to draw from. That's what makes this performance impeccable, it's genuine creativity at its absolute.\u00a0Ma (Bri Larson) is outstanding. The only flaws I would have are just nitpicking. There were some lines I didn't like how they were delivered. But I'm not a Mom, I'm. It Ma, maybe that's how she talks. The movie did a great job of putting us in the situation.I love the changing perspective. With seems focused on Ma, and others just From jack. We get a carousel point of view that flows well.\u00a0My one major complaint about this movie is it has a pretty cookie cutter ending. It was a predictable ending and one that brought a close that was to easy. This is the same ending as the book. But I wished the author and director came up with a new ending. But it doesn't stop me form giving it a perfect score. I love this movie, I love these characters, and I can't to watch their stir again.",

            "content": "My journey with Room started in July last year. I saw the title on the source material I use for film release dates and I was intrigued by it. I read the plot and viewed the trailer and very quickly decided I really wanted to see it. Extremely rare for me. I thought it was strange. Then I read up. I discovered there was a novel to this point I was unaware of and that the novelist had done the screenplay. Nothing changed opinion wise until three weeks to a month ago when the reviews started arriving. On reading them numerous people were saying from all sides how emotionally affecting it was and how marked Brie and Jacob's performances were. Fast forward to yesterday when I finally sat down to see it. At this point I felt as if it was equal in significance to any film I've seen accounting for my emotions towards it and feedback response.Believe me it did not disappoint. Incredibly emotional throughout and I really felt it. I think because the seriousness of their situation is so expertly vividly outlined. You understand that they are struggling to survive without many essentials and there's obstacles at almost every turn.Brie and Jacob's performances were astounding and filled with tenderness and massive emotion. Lenny Abrahmson dealt absolutely brilliantly with portraying the situation without overdoing the dramatic feel. In fact he captured it perfectly. I've never reacted to any film in the manner that I did to this one. I extremely rarely show my emotion anywhere but particularly in public. I found myself on the verge of tears multiple times. Had I lost my composure I would have struggled to regain it. It wasn't because I was emotionally heightened for it due to it's ultra significance to me. Only due to the fact of the massively raw, stark, immensely powerful nature of it. It's possibly the most important film to me I've ever seen at the cinema. Certainly equal as stated earlier. I won't forget this for a long time maybe never. Bring tissues it's an extremely difficult harrowing watch at times. Totally absorbing, incredibly moving and to echo Mark Kermode you must see Room. It's my film of the year as of yesterday. I don't envy the films charged by me with the task of surpassing it. I am forever grateful to all involved. Unforgettable. 10/10",

Upto this point it's a story that has already been told a million times, but, here comes the spark of this movie, this one is told from the child's (born in captivity) point of view. From the first scene on, the director takes us on trip inside this little 5 year old kid. How he structures his word, his conception of what the word is, and isn't. What is real, what is imagination, what is TV, and so. On the side we see an extremely strong Mom who somehow managed to make of that terrible reality a happy one for her child. And then they finally get out and the movie starts... A wonderful movie indeed. I strongly recommend this movie to all psychology students or those who are interested in such topics.

The boy is an only child and he lost his mother in a car accident so he has to live with his widowed father. Gwendoline try to help his friend the best she can, and a miracle appearsThe acting of the mains characters Clara Busin and Pierre Foliot was really great, Clara gives a beautiful and very convincing performance, especially during the more emotional scenes.There were moments in The dreaming girl that were so intense that I barely breathe. He is a gripping movie that will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions, but it's well worth the ride !!!!",

The plot was gripping and had you wanting so much for help to hurry up and find them. This movie showed the lengths a mother will go to for the child she loves so desperately. I would watch this movie over and over again and it is certainly not just a chick flick but something everyone needs to see. If you have not seen it you missed the best movie of the year.

            "content": "This is a genuine feel good movie, the book was incredible in my opinion, but I guess it was harder to show emotions in the movie. A lot was changed from the book, and a few character names were changed as well, which annoyed me, especially since Donaghoe became the screenwriter. After the rescue, Jack becomes a quiet, respectful kid, without too much personality who mainly talks through his mom. In the book, he is separated from his ma for a week or so where he struggles a bit to make sense of everything in this big, new, scary world, and has some problems with his grandma. I feel like including this break from his Ma, would have been a productive dive into his character. Jack is shown by himself for a bit during Ma's suicide attempt, but the only deeper analysis we get is a 10s or so phone call where Jack asks Ma \"Why'd you try to go to Heaven early?\" and drops the phone. Ma has a decently shown character, she is seen arguing a bit with he mother and father, but seems a lot angrier at everything in the book including the interviewer. I also don't think she had enough dialogue, like when she met her mother and father (contrary to the book), she didn't say a thing, and Jacks grandfather wasn't shown to hate the thought of Jack very clearly. In the book, even Jack knew that Ma's dad didn't think he should of been born, under the circumstances, which was a realistic plot line that could have gone into a bit more depth. I don't, I guess this follows the 'book is a lot better' category in my opinion. I also think there's many Criminal Mind episodes that dive deeper into character than Room if I'm being brutally honest. (I'd give a 6.7 or so, don't know how to go into decimals on the stars)",

And what happened to her when the door opened forever? This is no longer the whole world, but just a small room without special amenities, gray, broken, lonely. Jack saw the world outside the room, in a couple of days Jack matured and realized how limited he had been all this time.And I keep thinking, what can we face in our life to get such emotions? Are we limited in something as much as Jack? Perhaps we just don't know about it, because Jack didn't know about the world outside the walls for all 5 years, only in recent days Joy told him, but, as it seems to me, he didn't fully believe it.I assumed that the whole film would be dedicated specifically to escape, but it turns out it was easy to escape, it was more difficult to get used to the real world again, to learn to communicate again, to get acquainted, to sleep peacefully. And that constant question, \"Ma, when are we going back to the room?\"",

The subject matter of a teenage girl abducted, repeatedly raped, who bares a child to this man, who has just turned 5 in this story, locked in a soundproofed metal shed for 7 years could not be more bleak.However, Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson provided an amazingly strong performance as actors depicting something so dark with immense sensitivity. Their relationship is key, especially when Brie suspects her captor may be beginning to take an unhealthy interest in their son. Which initiates an escape attempt, placing her son at immense risk in the process.There are two parts to this movie, the first when the mother and son are confined in the \"room\" or shed and the other when they are navigating their way through the complex issues created by them escaping and returning to Brie,s characters mothers family. These are cleverly left understated, matters they don't want to talk about as a family but which have a considerable impact on the whole family's relationships.Jacobs performance is key here, he has no idea of the link between his father and the man who imprisoned his mother and therefore cannot understand why he is treated negatively by some of his mother's relatives.On both of these matters, there is no direct reference, they are hinted at and that leaves the viewer to become angry and fearful at the same time.Very good film.",

Than the second half feels much more refined with its shots and you feel more like an observer which works perfectly. The music is very good used at the right times and builds emotion very well. The editing is phenomenal as this feels like a thriller in the first half and drama in the second which is such a unique combination that works perfectly.

A film with a difficult subject, that is the stuff of nightmares, but tells it so beautifully with an interesting approach that works better than all the potential traps that films of its genre could fall under.\n\nWhat could have easily have been told in a lurid, gratuitous way (being inspired by the true-life case of Josef Fritzl) is instead told in a careful and restrained way. There is even an innocence in 'Room', due to its very fascinating decision to tell it from the viewpoint of a five year old, in this case Jack, one that comes off very movingly and gives a sense that there is a little ray of hope in a seemingly hopeless situation. The source material, equally brilliant, is to be thanked here, its author Emily Donoghue adapts it to screen here and none of its power is lost.\n\nReally appreciated the careful and restrained approach to the storytelling in 'Room', and for me and many others it was something different considering the subject. It does though affect some of the pacing in the middle act, where a little of the tension seen in especially the first part is lost a little.\n\nFor my tastes too, though it probably did fit the film's younger and more innocent viewpoint it's told from, the music score does lay it on too thick with the treacle.\n\nHowever, loved how the story was told and its approach. What 'Room' also strongly benefitted from being told this way was that the mother and son relationship was able to shine through and really resonate, which it may not have done as effectively with a heavier tone. And shine through it does, with great charm and poignancy. Also appreciated that none of the characters were painted too black and white, even Old Nick.\n\nProduction values are effectively claustrophobic and the nocturnal parts chillingly nightmarish. 'Room' is beautifully directed by someone who understood how claustrophobic thrillers worked, how mother and son bonds do in dire situations do and the ability to combine both to ensure a powerful experience. A directing job that's both unsettling and empathetic. Similarly 'Room' is written with effortless skill and deft thoughtfulness.\n\nCan't find anything to fault the performances. The superb one of Brie Larson, that was a very worthy Oscar (Golden Globe and Bafta too) win in her category, is an obvious starting point, but one mustn't overlook the beyond-his-years turn of young Jacob Tremblay, one of the best child acting performances in recent years, and William H Macy and Joan Allen both giving some of their best work in years. Sean Bridgers also gives much more to what could have been a standard clich\u00e9 role.\n\nOverall, great powerful film but the somewhat fascinatingly unconventional (for the genre) way the story was told won't work for some. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Such unspeakable crime can be committed only by the most perverted individuals. As a result of this highly emotionally charged issue, \"Room\" is highly engaging. Towards the middle of the film, I find every cell in me wants the woman's plan to succeed. I held my breath, I welled up and I sincerely hope there would be some humanity left in the world. Another very emotional scene is the brief TV interview. The interviewer seems so caring and empathic, but asks very biased questions which leads to another emotional zenith. This film depicts the horror of captivity, which I am sure doesn't even match the true abuse and desperation that the victims face.\n\nI hope the victims can recover and lead fulfilling lives.",

The main character was kept in a glorified garden shed in the suburbs rather than some remote location and somehow nobody heard her screaming at any point, she only attempted to escape once, none of the neighbours thought it was weird that the house owner regularly slept in his shed, and neither of the main characters ever got ill enough that they needed medical attention despite living in a tiny room with mice and no sunlight. Furthermore, the guy fell for the 'my son's dead' trick and didn't check that he actually was dead, allowing him to escape. Why would he risk that? The other issue with the plot and pacing was that the second half felt a bit lost. However, the main characters, especially the boy, were quite well thought out. The rest of the characters never got that much development. For example, the main character's dad could have had more of a role in the film. The acting was solid, with a very impressive performance from Jacob Tremblay, even if his voice was frankly annoying. There was also a decent amount of emotion, although the suicide attempt was predictable. Then the cinematography, visual effects, and soundtrack were well executed.",

            "content": "From \u2018Room' to the outside world \n\nRoom is a movie directed by Lenny Abrahamson. The film is based on a book written by Emma Donoghue. The lead roles are portrayed by Jacob Tremblay Brie Larson, Sean Bridgers, Joan Allen and William H. Macy. The author is inspired by a true story related to Elisabeth Fritzl. She was locked up in a cellar for 24 years by his father, Jozef Fritzl. She was sexually assaulted and gave birth to seven children. The movie differs slightly from the true story. In the film, the relationship of the kidnapper with the main character namely Joy is not clear. This film really impressed me literally and figuratively speaking. I can compare this film with the other film namely \"3096 years (also based on true story)\" which also had to do with kidnapping. \n\nThe whole story revolves around two people, Jack and Joy. Joy, the mother who lives in a room with her son. She had been kidnapped by a man named Old Nick seven years ago and locked up in a room ever since. Joy is regularly sexually abused by him. She gives birth to a child namely Jack. For him the room is the world and outside the room the space. His mother tells him all kinds of stories, stories that have nothing to do with the real world. Which later causes a problem, because when Jack is 5 years old, she wants to tell him what happened to her but he doesn't believe her mother. Finally, she can convince Jack that behind these walls lies another world that is much more beautiful than this one. And so she tries to convince him to escape from this room. \n\n \nJacob Tremblay's acting as Jack was impressive, enchanting and nice to see. How he acts as someone for whom the room is the world. The material such as chairs, sink, .. etc was real and the world behind the TV screen was not real. How he looks at the world he doesn't know. That was done so perfectly by him. Brie Larson as a mother / victim, her acting was so realistic. When they consider his child's upset as something normal. She tries to keep Jack in touch with the outside world when they are liberated. \n\n \nIn the film I was looking for certain elements such as flashback and the relationship between the kidnapper and the victim, Joy Newsome. Why flashback? When the mother tells his child how she got into this room, I would have liked a flashback to get a better picture of the happening. It's still not clear to me who Old Nick, the kidnapper was. Was he a stranger, neighbor, or someone from the victim's family? Why I am now asking this question is because the film is based on a true story where the abductor and the victim clearly had a relationship. \n\nThe film has a heartbreaking story, the story that is not a fantasy but is the truth, which is almost unbelievable. In this peaceful world, there are also monsters that cause unrest. In this film, there are also messages that convey the following, never give up, and there is always an end to evil. The film is a must for those who find true stories interesting or films based on the true story. \n\n \"Closed in a room, my imagination becomes the universe, and the rest of the world is missing out\" (Criss Jami).",

            "content": "The movie tells the story of Jack and his mom Joy who live in a 10 by 10 ft. shed they call \"Room\". Joy has been held captive for seven years by an abductor named Old Nick, also known as Jack's biological father. Joy takes care of Jack alone and never lets Old Nick come close to him. Joy hides Jack inside the wardrobe every time Old Nick comes to the shed to sexually assault her. She teaches Jack that only the things inside \"Room\" are real, and the rest happens only on television. Not long after Jack's fifth birthday, Joy learns that Old Nick has lost his job and is unable to provide for them. She decides to teach Jack about the real world. However, Jack cannot understand and becomes frustrated towards Joy. After a while, he eventually begins to learn and identify what is real and what is not. After having the electricity and heat cut off one night, Joy takes the opportunity and helps Jack to fake a fever but Old Nick refuses to take him to the hospital. Joy tries once again by faking Jack's death and folds him in a rug. Old Nick reluctantly agrees to bury him somewhere. While Old Nick drives, Jack follows the instructions given by Joy and successfully jumps out of the truck and calls for help from a passerby. The police come to the rescue soon after and figure out the location of \"Room\". Joy finally gets out of the shed and reunites with Jack and her parents whom she hasn't seen for years. She then finds out about her parents' divorce and struggles with depression. Joy attempts to commit suicide but is sent to the hospital when Jack discovers her in the bathroom. During Joy's absence, Jack becomes adjusted to the new world as he slowly comes out of his shell. He decides to cut his hair (which he considers his \"strong\") and sends it to his mom so that she can have strength to overcome her struggles. Joy finally returns home and Jack suggests that they revisit \"Room\". They return to the shed and Jack says goodbye to each object in \"Room\". They walk out and smile as they begin their new journey.  \n\nWhile it may be difficult for the audience to relate to the actual situation, there exist several themes and meanings behind the story of Joy and Jack that each can learn from. By looking at Joy, one can recognize the beautiful qualities of a mother. In several scenes, we sense Joy's great despair and hopelessness, but she always hides them in front of her son. She tries to stay optimistic for Jack and does her best to protect him from Old Nick. Her sacrifices, unconditional love and care for Jack are perfect symbols of motherhood. \n\nEven though Joy takes care of Jack and protects him, Jack, in a different sense, also protects Joy and gives her the strength and hope she needs in order to survive. Moreover, Jack is the one that makes the escape possible. There is a famous quote by John Donne, \"No man is an island, entire of itself.\" The movie supports this quote perfectly and shows that we are never alone and that we are meant to help one another along the way in life.\n\nThere also exist two interesting themes that contrast with each other: freedom and exploration. Leaving \"Room\" has a completely different meaning to Joy and to Jack. To Joy, it means to be free and to be back into her comfort zone while to Jack, who knows nothing outside \"Room\", leaving it means to step out of his comfort zone to explore the unknown. Though we may not be physically stuck inside a room, there may come a time in our life when we feel stuck in a situation or in a relationship. Regardless of what \"Room\" may be to us, the film teaches us to let ourselves be free and to explore for the world is so big and there is so much to see. \n\nI strongly recommend this movie as it is one that makes you ponder and reflect on your own life. It gives hope and comfort to all those who are going through difficult times. From the beginning to the very end, we can witness the changes and the growth of each character. It is not just a fairy tale with a superhero coming to the rescue, but a realistic portrayal of all the ups and downs we go through in life and the emotions and feelings that we may experience when facing fears and challenges. The film touches hearts and gives strength. It motivates the audience to set themselves free from fear or past pains and to explore the big world out there.",

A trait we all hold dear in our day to day lives, a theme we can all personally relate to which I think is the films strongest point as we can all feel a deep sense of empathy for each character within each scene.

Even in later house, the close door cinematography was done with great angles of stairs.\n\nIts the little things that I loved, learning to walk down the stairs, world outside being TV, the attention to details. Movie starts with Goodmorning and ends with Bye Bye.\nThe thrill that was involved in the escape sequence was perfect.\n\nI love that they didn't waste time on things that I thought they would, 'oh whole 2hr movie is ganna take place in a Room... nope' , 'oh the other half will be about finding the Ma... nope' realistic use of Satallite to find the truck, fabulous writing of 3 Stop Sign.

Like any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but typical--they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has euphemistically named Room. Ma has created a whole universe for Jack within Room, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet: the real world. \n\n\nAnalysis of the caracters \n\n1)\nJack's 5th birthdayall takes place within 'Room' where he lives since he Washington born: a confined space with only a single skylight for daylight and no means of escape. For the mother, Joy, was abducted as a teen and locked away for sex in the style of the dreadful real-life . Jack is the (presumably) unintended result: a boy with no perception of the real world beyond his four single-sided walls and with the staunchly-held view that the things he sees on a flickering TV screen are in 'TV land' unreal.\n2)\nMa is a young woman in her mid-twenties. She has a son named Jack, who is the result of a forced sexual encounter with Old Nick. While in \"Room,\" Ma provides a relatively safe atmosphere for her son, Jack, putting his well-being before her own. As a result, Ma has a painful, rotting tooth for which she can get no treatment. She sometimes becomes quiet and retreats into herself, though most of the time she is able to put on a brave face for her son. However, Ma suffers from depression and suicidal thoughts and even tries to kill herself. She is clearly and understandably psychologically damaged by her trauma, but her love for Jack is strong and unbreakable.\n\n\n",

            "content": "I'm not the biggest fan of Brie Larson so I am not thrilled with the fact that she has a Best Actress Academy Award when the far more talented Judy Davis, Barbara Hershey and Eleanor Parker do not. I was pleasantly surprised by her performance in this film, although I do not think she is a patch on Charlotte Rampling in 45 Years (2015). The film as a whole is a decent little film that focuses on an emotionally heart wrenching experience and it's effect on the lives of what seem like very natural, realistic characters but it was hardly one of the best of 2015 and there are unfortunate weaknesses that the film's screenplay gives into.\n\nIn a small locked shed, Joy Newsome, Brie Larson, lives with her son Jack, Jacob Tremblay, because she is trapped by Old Nick, Sean Bridgers, the man who kidnapped her seven years previously and is the father of her son. When conditions begin to significantly worsen and Joy realizes her son is becoming more mature she begins to look for ways to escape. After devising a clever scheme involving her son faking his own death she is able to escape the room and is reunited with her mother Nancy, Joan Allen, who now lives with a new partner Leo, Tom McCamus. Joy struggles to adapt to normal life in the outside and after being asked an invasive question during an interview she attempts suicide. Eventually she is able to move past her trauma as her son becomes more comfortable with his new lifestyle and the two say goodbye to the room forever.\n\nThe opening scenes of the film are very good at setting up the abject horror of the situation that this very regular woman and her sweet young son are trapped in. It is hard not to feel sympathy for these people as you watch an innocent little boy struggle to comprehend what a man who is the closest thing he has to a father figure is doing to his mother. The film loses me slightly when the two leave the room as while I think Allen and McCamus are two fine actors I found that their characters were not used very well and the use of suicide just seemed a tad too much in a film that benefited from it's restraint in telling a difficult story. I felt a little sad as the film began to lose me because it set up such great expectations from it's beginnings but it struggles to smoothly transition to an uneven second half.\n\nWe see interviews that turn into interrogations, Joy's suicide attempt and her son trying to acclimate to his new environment with the help of his stepfather. I didn't need all of this to be thrown at me immediately and I think that Larson's performance erred the most here as she failed to carry a lesser screenplay through the end of the film. I wanted to see more of Allen and McCamus although their use in small doses probably benefits them because they feel like the realest characters in the film. Tremblay was grating at certain points for me and I could have used less of his voice over which seemed like a very obvious attempt to emotionally manipulate the audience. The best scenes come when Allen and Larson argue, they feel very Terms of Endearment (1983) and yet they were the most appealing and relatable moments in the film because they borrow some of the warmth and intelligence that the 1983 film has in spades.\n\nI am rather shocked that this film managed to get a Best Picture nomination in a year that boasted The Lobster (2015), Carol (2015) and of course 45 Years. I can see why Larson received recognition and the screenplay has some bright spots but overall it's hardly a great film and certainly not one of the best of the year. The film is worth a viewing but it may not be emotionally effecting enough for the crowd looking for a decent weepie and it's not intelligent enough in it's examination of it's subject matter for a more cynical audience. On the whole a mediocre effort from a group of fairly talented people.",

            "content": "Room provides harrowing trauma and cathartic release.\n\nLenny Abrahamson's Room (2015) is a indie drama of massive heart and daunting terror. It is a bottle film with the majority shot in a single room, but Room creates an endlessly imaginative space for its actors and actresses to perform. Emma Donaghue's writing is adapted from her own novel with a stylish realism and incomparable thoughtfulness.\n\nDirector Lenny Abrahamson uses tight spaces to build suspense with a sense of frustration, anger, fear, and claustrophobia. He effortlessly invents new ways to shoot in a single set to constantly keep things interesting for the viewer. Room is beautifully directed and shot with intimate close-ups of tender moments between a captive mother and her son. Danny Cohen's cinematography ranges from creepy and horrifying to frightened and loving. The use of blue is quite affecting and magical in Room.\n\nEvery emotion is captured within Room as this film takes the world out of you trapping you in this tiny space with the cast and characters. With a run time of less than two hours, the film is not that long, but it feels like 3 hours. This is actually a fantastic thing for 2 reasons.\n\nFirst, Room takes the time to flesh out its characters with tremendous depth and agony alike. You are witnessing their elongated captivity and innovative coping methods.\n\nSecondly, Room bravely goes a step further than a story of captives, but dives into the perilous uncertain waters of survival after trauma. Room continues into their rehabilitation and into their reintegration back into society and the eternal struggle of those attempting to reclaim their lives and happiness after traumatic events.\n\nAbrahamson crafted a dynamic of trust through his use of tender quiet space is impressive. Stephen Rennicks composed an astonishingly lovely score that just mesmerized me throughout Room's entire running time. I was not expecting such a stunning sympathy of empathy and understanding.\n\nRoom gifted us with dual magnificent acting roles for Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. \n\nNotably, Brie Larson is resplendent as Joy \"Ma\" Newsome. Her leading actress role is a true tour de force of human emotional range. Larson portrays a kidnapped woman with a clear understanding and respect for the female victims of sexual assault and rape. Her depiction of motherhood with all its joys, frustrations, fears, rage, patience, and kindness is remarkable unto itself. But, when you pit parenting against forced confinement, Larson evolves the role into a complex display of brave resistance that I found profoundly moving. Brie Larson encapsulated a brilliant dramatic performance for the ages in Room. I hope to see more affecting dramatic roles from Larson in the near future.\n\nSimilarly, Jacob Tremblay gives one of the finest performances from a child actor as Jack in Room. His nervous and indignant reactions to his constraint against his will is gripping. Tremblay displays a fervor for acting that I anticipate seeing again in his upcoming roles.\n\nLastly, Room features a few neat supporting roles. Sean Bridgers is creepy, unsettling, and disgusting as the rapist kidnapper Old Nick. William H. Macy has a heartfelt infuriating role as a disappointed and awkward father to Larson. On the other hand, Tom McCamus is excellent as the kindly father figure to Joy and the gentle grandfather figure to Jack. Finally, Joan Allen delivers a shocking performance as Joy's mother with a surprising level of authenticity and brutal honesty.\n\nIn all, Room is a harrowing experience to endure, but rewarding with its hopeful ending. The catharsis I felt by the finale of Room is something akin to euphoria and relief. Room is easily one of the greatest films ever made.",

            "content": "- Pain can't be confined to one Room -\n\nWarning:  This film and article contain references to explicit sexual content\n\nAs a young woman, a very present fear, often in the back of my mind, is of being abducted, molested or snatched from the safety of what I know and to be raped and murdered in a back alley.  I carry mace in my pocket when I walk down an unfamiliar street at night in New York City, where I live. Brie Larson (Trainwreck), in Room, is that girl our mothers feared we might become.\n\nShe encountered that strange man our fathers warned us about. By the time the film opens, she's been living as a captive in a single room for seven years, and every week she suffers nightly visits from her captor. She is so young, so painfully young. It's heart wrenching to know that her sufferings extend -even beyond rape- to being forced into a mockery of companionship with the man who stole her life.\n\nLarson, Oscar winner for this role, does not play a majestic, longsuffering young mother in Room -- a character type we so often see in literature and film. Emma Donoghue, author of the original novel and the film's screenplay, has not given us a soft-spoken damsel. This woman does not have it all together, pressing on cheerfully despite her circumstances. She has sallow skin, bad teeth, and vitamin deficiency. She screams at the skylight and snaps at her son.\n\nLarson's performance is noteworthy for how normal and unheroic she is. She didn't make me feel like I was watching a legendary role on the silver screen. She made me curl up in my seat, aching for this nameless young woman who is probably not so different from me.\n\nAct One of Room lets that premise really soak in as we learn about \"Ma\" through the eyes of her newly-five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay, The Smurfs 2). This room, with its stove, single bed, and ancient TV, is the only world Jack has ever known. It's not \"a\" room or simply \"this\" room for him -- it is Room. Beyond Room is \"outer space,\" and beyond that, \"heaven\" (where Jack came from, he explains).  \n\nIt was captivating to watch Jack, in the true spirit of childhood, go about his cramped routines in relative contentment. After all, he had no outside world to compare his life to. I wondered, in that situation, what would I have taught my son about the world? Would I have told him -- a child, who only understands by seeing and touching -- anything different?\n\nAs we get to know the routine of this tiny family, it's impossible not to feel gutted at the full life this young mother has somehow created for her son despite their prison. The \"mom\" part of my own brain immediately worried about how this boy could thrive on canned food -- but she makes sure their captor brings him vitamins and fresh fruit. She oversees exercise routines so that Jack's muscles grow strong. They do laundry together in the bathtub. She tucks him to sleep in the wardrobe on nights when \"Old Nick\" comes to stay in Ma's bed.\n\nIn a way, it was delightful and encouraging to see how innovative and committed she has been to raising her son to be strong and joyful. But only delightful like watching a flower bloom from wreckage of a nuclear disaster: so much agony underscores every smile, every sign of life.\n\nThe first half of the film shows Ma continuing in survival mode: concessions, abuse, frustrations, and failed escape attempts. But Jack is five now, Ma explains to him. She has reached her breaking point, and he is finally big enough to help them find their freedom.\n\nAs hard-hitting as Act One is, the film's latter half is a reminder that life can't be compartmentalized. Pain, ache, and regret doesn't just live in one room. So many escape films end with elation -- with that tearful moment of freedom and embrace. Room shows us how hard it is to build life after trauma and abuse. When everything is broken, it can't be fixed overnight.\n\nTremblay as Jack is an absolute light in this film. He's precocious and adorable, but also a raging ball of too many feelings for his tiny body (as all children are, at five years old). At one point, his Ma tries to explain to him the brutal reality of their situation, and the largeness of the world outside that he just can't comprehend. He looks into her face and protests, \"I wanna be four again.\"\n\nOh, my heart. I know, Jack. Me too.\n\nIt feels hard to write the right kind of review for a movie like this. Maybe it's because Donoghue's story and script is not pretty, it's brutal. It's a terrifying glimpse into the rotten core of humanity, of what it looks like when we reach the end of ourselves. I've never reached anything like that kind of breaking point in my own life -- but I've still felt the sharp, needling sting of regret.\n\nRoom isn't all heartbreak and despair. It's also a testament to how we make each other stronger, how we aren't meant to go at it alone.\n\n\"I'm not a good enough Ma,\" she admits to Jack, running over all the could have, should have's in her mind.\n\n\"But you're Ma,\" he responds simply.\n\nThat small moment summed up the whole emotional experience of watching Room, in a way. We all deal with rotten luck and our own failures. There's no escaping either. But through it all, we're in it together. Healing hurts, but hope might be the most resilient player in the human story.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/room, and was written Debbie Holloway.

Theres no viewable violent rape scene! Thats as best as I can pit it without spoilers.\n\nThe emotion is defi Its my felt during the movie!

It's dramatic, emotional, suspenseful and a phenomenal film. The story is intense and heartbreaking (times 4 or 5). The acting performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscar recognition. While I haven't seen all the performances nominated thus far, young Jacob Tremblay is jaw-dropping. I was excited to see Brie Larson, one of my favorites, finally show her stuff, and that she did. I hope she gets the win. However, Jacob blew me away. There were no words to describe how incredible his performance is for someone so young. Better than any adult actor I've seen this year. I'm serious. There is an incredible career in the making there. The screenplay, based on the novel of the same name, is beautiful. Aside from one scene that bugged me a little, the dialogue is so real. The director did a masterful job pulling the screenplay, performances and the perspective of \"Room\" against the much larger world Brie and Jacob are denied for so long. I'm so glad at least 3 of the 8 Best Pic nominees are worthy.",

Hell, I think even Joan Allen should have been considered. Room is about a woman who was abducted and held for seven years, and how she copes on a daily basis while taking care of her 5-year-old son. With this premise I thought the movie would surely be dark and grim, but on the contrary I think *hopeful* is the best way to describe it. There are plenty of instances of levity, especially from Tremblay, and even some parts to smile and cheer at. Make no mistake it does have tension. There is a scene in the back of a truck where I dared not take a breath. Of course a part of the movie focuses on dealing with post-traumatic stress and the effects it has on people around you. Remember, all Jacob's character has ever known in life was \"Room\" and I thought the director and actor both did a marvelous job showcasing what kind of impact that has.",

Seeing how Joy (Brie Larson) lives in a tiny room for years with her son is rough enough, but when we see that Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), their captor, returns almost nightly to continue raping Joy, it hits another level. Add in that Jack (Jake Tremblay) is in the closet when these things happen and it becomes extra rough to sit through. The story and script are both high points, but the real success of the movie comes from the performances of Larson and Tremblay. Tremblay does very well for someone his age. Meanwhile, Larson absolutely deserved that Oscar she won for this. She looked the part of someone who had experienced these things. The buildup to their escape was exceptionally done, as was the escape itself. The cinematography and direction are both tremendous. They give this film a unique feel that perfectly matches the story.\n\nWeaknesses: As much as I enjoyed the back half of the film, it lacks the tense and gripping feel of the first half. You're on the edge of your seat as they try to escape the room and overjoyed when they do. Watching them adapt to the world around them is interesting, but doesn't hold you as well as the first half. The storyline surrounding Joy's father (William H. Macy) had potential, but disappeared. He's happy his daughter returned, but won't even look at Jack, most likely because he was conceived through rape. There was some good tension in the second half with that scene and I'd have loved to see more of Macy and Larson going at it. Instead, once he leaves that scene, he never returns and it feels like a missed opportunity. \n\nOverall: An emotionally gripping story led by phenomenal performances from the leads. The survival aspects of the first half are the best part. A second half with more of a battle between Joy and her father would've been ideal. However, the post-room stuff is still very good, making for a great all around film.",

When we know being in such places we know where others go in dark places when mad to only make room for 1 place, when others were never intended to be in such a place with us but happened.\n\nWhen such places are too much for those to handle in places we have never been. When some places others have never been we see they know based on surroundings they learned in smaller places. When some places lead us to the places we need to go to free those from places. When we see the only safe place we know are the places we are kept in to prefer those places when outside places are foreign to us. When we see being kept in poor conditioned places we need to go to places to see if we are alright. When such places we see are different when we don't know such places exist when such places have bigger perspectives to see how big other places are then others. When we see we haven't yet left some places when such places we followed a routine to only know such places holds our day to day life and nothing else. When everything in such places are out of place to not know what is the right place to revolve around. When such places takes time getting used to when we are not used to what such places brings when our body, mind and soul needs to get out of such places to know there is much more to life that needs exploring. \n\nWhen only we know what such places are like to see that those who don't know want to know what such places were like. When we see that being in familiar places we feel at home and others not at home when all this is new to them. When there are many things we need to figure out that are out of place we need to put in place when it's our life, our case, our family, and story. When there are many things we used to make place for when we make due with what we had to take such places as knowledge. When we see there is plenty of space on tables others wish not to sit when other's company is a reminder of a place we are trying to put behind us. When what we try to fill such places we see we make a new room in other places with much more stuff to do. When such places we left behind we see we can no longer return to when we are in a new place to see now. When we see going places was our ambition to be stuck in such places with those we are conflicted with. When being in bigger places we know there is much more to do when we are free to go any place. When such places holds us right where we are when we need to take steps into seeing we are alright to fill those places. When others places we see we need to get to when it takes us to other places. When we see such places we adapt but cannot connect without being old places that we see others find it difficult to recognize new places as their own.\n\nWhen we see others rather inhibit closer places with those when it's comforting. When we see we all left off in such places we left when somethings remain the same. When what others see too much to know what places people go to know what questions to say. When what places we see others go we know there is much more to see in what such places would do to us all in nurturing a child in a place where we are seen fit or unfit to know do we rightfully belong in such places.\n\nWhen such bad places remain inside of us that we need out. When such places remain when it's how we only seen such places with those we have only learned to live with. When some places we pass on to others when it's the place we left off before our life was taken from us to see it still remains. When what others see they can't erase they try to go to places that is less hurtful when we see there is no place for us. When we know what places we want others to be to make sure they do. When we know what places are suitable for those to not hold them back. When we see that even horrible places we come from, we make them beautiful when everything little we had we appreciated, connected to it and make a place in our heart that gave us strength to enjoy such places. When such realities of such places we never knew how long we will be in for we see we did it all when our mind have travelled many places to see that what we did we did when we were in a bad place & time. When we say goodbye to such places because that's what we are taught to do and be when being in bad places doesn't change who we are inside as a good person to know such places we need to move on from.",

            "content": "More Room to Love\n\tRoom is a stunning and heart-wrenching drama about a young mother trying to raise her 5-year-old son in a traumatic situation. Ma (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) endure unimaginable trials together, proving how strong the bond between a mother and her child can be.\n\tMa and Jack's situation is slowly revealed to us in pieces through Jack's perspective. As we gain more information about Room, the tiny space Jack and his Ma are confined to, we discover they are being held captive by a man called \"Old Nick\". He kidnapped Ma long ago, and she has matured into an adult and a mother in Room. Old Nick is a typical abusive kidnapper type, but his violence toward Ma is devastating from Jack's perspective.\nMa does everything in her power to keep Jack safe. When Old Nick moves to touch Jack, Ma fights fiercely to protect Jack, showing how strong her love for him is. She does whatever she can to shield Jack from the realities of their captivity, including telling him stories to explain away their horrible situation. It works to keep Jack safe and satisfied until she realizes their survival depends on their escape. It then proves to be more difficult than she expected to get Jack to give up the cozy stories she told him. When Ma finally convinces him that there is a world outside of Room, the movie reaches a pivotal climax. The fate of Ma and Jack rests on Jack's shoulders, relying on the strength of their bond to save them.\nThe second half of the movie is very different. They escape from Old Nick, but adjusting to freedom proves to be more difficult than attaining it. This is where the strength of their bond is truly tested. Jack has never been exposed to anything in the real world, and Ma desperately wants to go back to the way things were before she was kidnapped. Devastatingly, they begin to drift apart as their individual challenges divide them. It isn't clear if their tight-knit bond will remain outside of Room. Jack sees Ma is struggling and asks Ma's mother, \"Can my strong be her strong too?\" She responds with what I think defines the central theme of the film, saying \"Of course it can. We all help each other be strong.\"\nSome might say that Room's second act is unnecessary. I would argue that Room's second act is the most important, and the film would lose a crucial part of the story without it. Often a kidnap drama is resolved as soon as the protagonist goes free. They rarely go beyond that to tell us what happens next. Room provides a deep and critical exploration of what happens to Ma and Jack in the second act. It suggests that the most important challenge for them to overcome isn't the kidnapping at all; it's figuring out how to be normal again. This leads to meaningful discoveries for both characters, and through their growth, the audience grows too.\nAs heartbreaking as much of the film is, the ending is intensely satisfying. It is more rewarding because of how Ma and Jack are challenged. By exemplifying the strength of love, Room reminds us to be thankful for what we have and love a little more fiercely.",

The second half of the film explores the complex emotions which come from the resolution of such an ordeal. It isn't all ice cream and rainbows.\n\nLarson and Tremblay are remarkable. It's a good thing the producers found Tremblay, because this movie would've fallen flat without a believable child in a difficult-to-portray role. And Larson was just masterful.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of us will never endure what Room's protagonists endured, but I think Room helps us ponder what it means to be human in the face of such depravity and isolation.",

When they finally manage to escape their confinement Jack finally learns about the world outside of his small room. \nThis is a truly fantastic film and a lot of it rests on the 2 main actors performances. Brie Larson is simply amazing as Ma/Joy, who is a captive and mother who manages to protect her son from the horrors of the world around him. Larson's performance has a great deal of intensity, strength and vulnerability and really draws you into the plot and emotion of the film. Jacob Tremblay is also fantastic as Jack, capturing the fantasy of his little world and the fear and intrigue outside it. The two also have excellent chemistry together and form a really strong but somewhat complex Mother Son relationship that is very captivating.\nThis is a film about captivity like no other, rather than exploiting its characters or focussing on the horror aspect of its narrative, the main focus of the film is the bond between Mother and Son and how their realities shift inside and outside of the room. \nThe cinematography in this film is excellent. We, the audience, experience a lot of the narrative through Jack's eyes and the camera work reflects this through its use of tight close ups and steady cam shots and in how it manages to make a tiny shed seem expansive and not at all claustrophobic. The juxtaposition of sound, colour and light between the room and the outside world is also excellent and really highlights Jack's otherworldly experience. The musical score also adds a lot to the film in its more emotional moments.\nThe plot is also well told, initially only showing and not telling and leaving the interpretation to the viewer and later filling in the blanks with some exposition. However there are some scenes where the dialogue is too expository and there is a bit too much of an information dump. \nThis is a very well told, immersive film that focuses on its characters, their emotions and their relationships with one another and is very moving experience overall.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, do you have room in your schedule?\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) I d like a room with a view. A viewing of our latest movie Room to be precise. Let s recap:\n\nSCOTT: The opening scenes of this movie occur inside a small room where a young mother named Joy (Brie Larson) and her 5-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) are living. We aren t sure how or why they are living in such an odd small space until it becomes apparent that they are being held captive by a man named Nick (Sean Bridgers), who kidnapped Joy seven years ago and fathered her child (through rape). The  room  is actually a shed in Nick s backyard.\n\nGREG: One day the power goes out and Joy and Jack nearly freeze to death. That s when Joy realizes that she needs a plan to help Jack escape. She begins to teach him of the outside world, a thing he s never seen. Then she coaches him on how to be sick, even how to act dead. Nick falls for the rouse and takes Jack out of the shed to bury him. But Jack escapes. And that is when his real journey begins.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, Room is the perfect name for this movie. It refers, of course, to the location of the trapped mother and son, but it also refers to room for growth and the spaces we need to become what we re meant to become as human beings. Joy and Jack turn out to be buddy heroes who need each other to escape their physical prison and then later their psychological prisons. I enjoyed this movie s ability to take us from small scary spaces to large scary places.\n\nGREG: Scott, this is not your usual hero s journey. Often, the hero s ordinary world is exposed to the viewer in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Then, an  inciting incident  happens that takes the hero to an unusual place. Room starts in the unusual place (which is the only place Jack has ever known). We spend half the film there, getting to know what it is like to be trapped for seven years. The inciting incident comes at the halfway mark when Jack escapes into our ordinary world - but his special world of  the outside.  But he is so overwhelmed by the openness and vastness of the world that he is hardly able to talk. Jack befriends a police officer who gently coaxes information from him so that they can rescue his mother.\n\nSCOTT: The film s unusual presentation of the hero s journey is one of many elements that captivated me. For Jack, the room is his ordinary world. For Joy, it is the unfamiliar world. So our two heroes start out in different worlds, yet ironically they re in the same room. The movie must end with them both safely ensconced in the same world. That s a highly unusual journey for two people to travel, and so no wonder it is rife with tension, pain, and suffering for both of them. We often talk about good heroes needing to transform themselves, and there can be no transformation while trapped in the room. So our heroes must escape, and after they accomplish this feat, the doctor who examines Jack makes the point that Jack is  plastic  -- a term pointing toward his malleability being greater than his mom s. Indeed, Jack s ability to cope in his new world is less problematic than Joy s return to her original world. It doesn t help that her original world can be cruel. Joy s father behaves badly and journalists ask her insensitive questions. Perhaps Jack derives his resilience from his long hair, which turns out to hold the hero s secret power, much like the ring s power to aid Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit.\n\nGREG: The supporting characters around Jack are mostly seen through the haze of the young boy s inexperience. Besides his mother, the only person Jack sees in the room is  Old Nick  - the kidnapper/rapist. And then only through the slats of a wardrobe Jack hides in when Nick visits from time to time. Once outside, Jack meets a police officer who acts as his mentor in the new world. Later, he meets doctors and nurses who, I believe, are shot in such a way that we never see their faces. Next Jack meets his grandparents. As Scott mentioned, the grandfather (William H. Macy) can t accept Jack. The grandmother expects her daughter, Joy, to be the same little girl she lost seven years ago. These aren t strong characters - which is fine - as we need to focus on Jack and his struggle to make sense of a world far more immense than anything he ever imagined.\n\nSCOTT: Yes, exactly, Greg. Once again, we encounter supporting characters who are either instrumental in helping our heroes accomplish their goal or who hinder the heroes. You re right that the woman cop helps nurture Jack and guide him to safety. Her mentorship is pivotal, occurring during the crucial initiation of his journey. But Jack s lifelong mentor is his mother Joy, who teaches him about the world of the  room  and then helps him unlearn those lessons in order to adapt to the world beyond the room. Joy therefore plays a dual role in this story; she is both a hero and a mentor figure. A wonderful coda to the story occurs when the heroes return to the room at the films end. In any good hero tale, the hero returns home but sees home in an entirely new way. Joy takes Jack back to the room and he can t believe how much smaller it seems. Isn t that the way all of us see our old homes and neighborhoods? Even Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz realized that home is now much bigger than her original geographic conception of home. Like any good hero, Jack now realizes that home is not what he remembers it to be, that he can never return home, and that he is forever changed by his new experience of home.\n\nGREG: Room is a welcome disruption to the classic hero s journey. While we spend a long time in the Room, it s all put to good use. We learn what it s like to live in a world that is only 100 square feet and the only reality is what you see on TV. I ve seen Brie Larson in other films, but she really commanded the screen in Room. Young Jacob Tremblay also deserves praise for a performance that even seasoned veterans would have found challenging. For two actors to hold us in rapt attention for 60 minutes with nothing but a shed to work in is an achievement. I give Room 5 out of 5 Reels. It s unclear if this is a buddy film or some sort of hybrid. We start out with Joy as the main character taking care of her child. In the initial scenes, she is driving the story. But soon we learn it is a symbiotic relationship where Jack sustains Joy s sanity as much as Joy sustains Jack. So it moves into buddy territory. When Jack and Joy are released into the world, the symbiosis continues. But when Joy has a breakdown, it s Jack who becomes the lead character - sustaining Joy. It s not clean, but nothing about Joy and Jack s life is clean. I give the symbiotic duo 4 out of 5 Heroes. Finally, the supporting characters aren t much in this story. Old Nick, the villain, is barely in it and is dispatched at the halfway mark. Then, the villain becomes Joy and Jack s inner pain and reemergence into reality. Joy s mother doesn t have much to do but bake cookies and her new husband is there only to be a swell guy. As I said before, these secondary characters are downplayed to give Jack and Joy the limelight. I give them only 2 out of 5 Cast points.  Movie: Cast: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Room is one of the year s best movies. Brie Larson turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as a young woman who must overcome horrific circumstances to survive, and if that weren t enough, she must help her young son overcome those same horrific circumstances. I was riveted by their dual journeys and deeply felt their every triumph and every setback. One could argue that the movie represents a wonderful metaphor for how we all must break out of our prisons, help others along the way, and overcome our personal demons. This movie grabbed me in many ways and deserves the full 5 Reels out of 5. As you aptly point out, Greg, this film takes the conventional hero s journey and turns it on its head in a unique and masterful way. Our two heroes start out in different worlds but end up in the same, beautiful world together. They are forever transformed by their journeys and truly needed each other to triumph on their individual missions. This story captures the hero s journey in clever and satisfying ways. I give Joy and Jack a rating of 4 Heroes out of 5. The supporting characters play pivotal roles in assisting or blocking our heroes from their development as characters. The most important secondary characters are the woman cop who intuitively reads Jack s cryptic verbal and nonverbal cues during his escape, and Joy s family members whose dysfunctional qualities make you wonder why Joy didn t run away from home sooner than she did. Joy and Jack are clearly the stars of this movie, relegating the supporting cast to minor status. These team of players gets a respectable 3 cast rating points out of 5. Movie: Cast: Heroes:",

It is a film to see on the big screen because such resolution and closeness, when holding on a child's luminous face, will drop you into that child's mind more vividly than a smaller screen in a lighter space with a weaker soundscape. \n\nRoom is a film to see on the big screen because quality always trumps quantity. \n\nFilm is an old, classical art.

It is not trying to extract every drop from every beat.\n\nBut it is emotionally raw, shot with humour and pain. Every image is transfixing. It is unique.\n\nIt is less a drama than a portrait; a single picture of a mother and child, drawn with immense depth and care; spread over time rather as an oil painter slowly layers his composition.\n\nWe are not taken on a classic protagonist's journey; we start with a young child who is brimming with innocence, passion, love, common sense and honesty... and finish with a young child who is brimming with innocence, passion, love, common sense and honesty. But this is not to say the film lacks momentum or suspense. His journey is fractal; one of symmetry at scale.",

I don't want to say too much because the less you know about this film going into it, the better. Suffice it to say that this kid absolutely sells not only his own character, but also the situation and by extension, everyone else's characters too. It's riveting from start to finish; alternatingly funny, tense, and emotional, and had me thinking about it long after the credits rolled.

The answer is probably that Brie Larson won the Best Actress Oscar, I liked her in Short Term 12, and I didn't look at the plot description when I placed this in my queue.  But I'm glad that I did, as painful and affecting as it was.  Larson plays a woman who has been kidnapped and locked in a small garden shed, kept as a sex slave by an evil Ohio loser for seven years; she's had a son, played by Jacob Tremblay, and he is now 5 years old and has only known the shed (which they call \"Room\") as his entire world; the outer world he knows just through TV and it is not treated as real.  Their life is seriously horrible but as it is all that Jack knows, he accepts it and even cherishes it.  He does not dream of escape as \"Ma\" (Larson) does.  The film makes you wonder how he (or they) would cope if escape really did come true, the effects of this kind of sheltered existence on them, and the severe trauma of it all.  It is all so devastating and executed with nary a hint of falseness in the acting by all involved.  Watch it.",

The film explored a variety of aspects of the impact such a devastating event would have on a whole family and it felt completely true and real. It had so many ideas around fairy tales and yet was also bleak and grey and ever so present in the actual reality. I also appreciated that the choice to cut the film in half between before and after actually removed a lot of the tension of the first half and yet the second half brought potentially even more emotional depth to the film. Just stunning.",

She kinda came from nowhere and started showing up in many things. Always solid, and she won an Oscar for this (in my opinion, her best role yet is in Short Term 12). \n\nI watch Dan Patrick daily and he raved about the little boy. For the first part of the movie, I wondered what in the hell DP was talking about. Later, the boy truly does take over and gives  great performance. \n\nThis is a neat but tragic story. The book is told from the little boy's perspective, and it's hard to imagine living the first five years of your life in a single room the size of a small shed. Kudos to the writer of the novel and everyone who made this movie a success. This is what storytelling is all about.",

Room is about a mother who was kidnapped by a man they call \"old nick\". A couple years later he impregnates her with her son Jack, even though he is the offspring of her captor. she still loves him with all her heart, because Jack has been with her through most of it, and their bond is unbreakable. Old Nick has never met his son Jack because the mom is very protective of him and won't let him touch him or even speak to him. Every night when the captor comes back, he comes into the room, that is when the mom puts Jack into the closet, to hide him from \"old nick\". The mother has been put through horrible mistreatment for seven long years, and is still remaining strong but not for herself, for Jack. \n\n\n    What helps the mom and her son to escape reality, they make up fairy tales, and are very imaginative. The mom has lied to her son all his life, she told him that the room is all that there is in the world, and there is nothing else. This makes the boy become attached to the room, because it is all he has ever known. He wakes up everyday and says things like \"hi\" \"hello\" or \"good morning' to inanimate objects like a lamp or a tv, or even a rug. The mom soon comes clean and tell him the truth one day while they are watching tv. The little boy and the mom talk about dogs on the television. jack thinks since he has never seen a dog that it is not real, and does not exist, he thinks that everything in that room is what exists. The mom tells him yes there is a dog, and it makes him angry, she explains to him how there is a whole universe and earth he has not discovered. Jack now has a hard time telling what is real and what's not, or what exists and what doesn't, leaving him very confused and hateful. \n\n\n   The mom soon decides she has had enough and she has Jack help her devise a plan to escape, but it's going to take Jack's help, jack does not think he can do it, or go through with the plan, but the mom's faith in him pushes him to go through with their plan. Their plan involves Jack pretending to be sick due to lack of nutrients, and sunlight, which has weakened his immune system,  jack and his mom pretend that he has died so she wraps him in a rug, and has old nick go and bury him. Now him and his mom practiced how to escape from the rug, so he can essentially escape and jump out of the back of the truck. Jack is in the truck and successfully escapes the rug, but is mesmerized by the sky seeing it for the very first time, he just stares at it in awe, but then wakes up and remembers the plan, so he jumps out of the truck, but Nick heard him and chases him, but luckily Jack bumps into a police officer, that rescues him and the mom from their captor. \n\n\n     They eventually move into their grandparents house once they are some what ready. Facing the world is going to be a challenge for these two especially Jack who has never faced the world ever, being born into captivity. Jack has a hard time being away from his mom because he is used to being so close to her, but now she is free to do what she wants. Jack's grandfather holds resentment towards jack simply because he is the offspring of the mom's captor. Jack has to adapt to his surroundings, and so does his mom, even though they are out of captivity, the movie still does not get any happier, the mom has severe depression and Jack still has a hard time learning what is reality from fantasy, the mom and jack are still really close. Jack not being old or educated enough to understand what has happened to the mom, he holds resentment towards her as if it is her fault. This triggers the mom's deep state of depression and she tries to end her life, but fails. The mom recovers, and while she was away the grandparent's looked after jack and just told him more lies which did not really help his situation. The mom comes back to her son and they try really hard to mend their bond back to how it used to be, and they do. \n\n\n\n\n    In conclusion, this is an outstanding movie from the perspective of people who are kidnapped, what they go through, how they handle it, although it varies from person to person. This movie is a great example of how love can get you through the worst of situations. The mom and her son showed bravery and courage when it came to facing every day being locked up in the room, but when it came to the outside world they were fearful and scared. Their bond was still there but they were slowly drifting apart. They were a team, and together they could get through anything if they got through that. There is nothing more special than a bond with a mother and her son, and if the mother had not been kidnapped who knows if their bond would have been so strong, who knows if she would have cherished their love so much if they had not been kept in that room. This is one of my favorite movies, and I will always appreciate its rawness, and its truth. This world is full of terrible things, which make you value the greater things way more than you normally would, just how jack appreciated the sky more, not because he has never seen it but because it was something good and beautiful.",

The acting performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscar recognition. While I haven't seen all the performances nominated thus far, young Jacob Tremblay is jaw-dropping. I was excited to see Brie Larson, one of my favorites, finally show her stuff, and that she did. I hope she gets the win. However, Jacob blew me away. There were no words to describe how incredible his performance is for someone so young. Better than any adult actor I've seen this year. I'm serious. There is an incredible career in the making there. The screenplay, based on the novel of the same name, is beautiful. Aside from one scene that bugged me a little, the dialogue is so real. The director did a masterful job pulling the screenplay, performances and the perspective of \"Room\" against the much larger world Brie and Jacob are denied for so long.

The idea of room is such a brilliant idea and the technique used to achieve it (I won't tell but see if you can spot it) so clever that I feel it's criminally underused. Critics talk about not spending too long getting to the set up but if you're trying to create a universe indulging yourself isn't always a bad move and once you're outside of room the scenes just don't seem to flow as well but the are minor details won't spoil the beauty of this picture. Honest trailor described this film as a \"ducked up boyhood\" but the film-s main character is a boy, you see tragedy through the eyes of innocence and that's it.

Their captor, \"Old Nick\", occasionally comes by to give them food and to rape Joy Newsome (played by Brie Larson). It is only through the quick thinking of Joy and the bravery of her son of captivity, Jack, that they manage to escape. What ensues is a story of struggling to cope with, for Joy, what she has missed, and for Jack, this brand new world. The story follows Jack, at times with voice over telling the audience what he thinks about this great big world. The first half or so of the movie takes place inside of this cramped and worn-down shed where we find Joy (called Ma for most of the movie) and Jack on his fifth birthday, reminding the audience that he has been in this room for all of his five years. Events occur, which are better to see rather than me tell you, that makes Joy say enough. She needs her child to have a life. The escape, done by Jack is thrilling (even though is is slightly obvious that they do get out of the room), in fact, it is breathtaking when we see what Jack sees, the world. Lenny Abrahamson (director) makes us feel as if this world is truly new and Danny Cohen (DP) films this beautifully. The writing is amazing, with very realistic dialogue between Joy and her parents and interesting dialogue between Joy and Jack. The chemistry between Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay is clearly there as it is believable when Joy is frightened for her child and Jack for her. Jacob Tremblay gives a truly stunning performance as Jack. Everything from the cadence at which he speaks, imitating a five year old, and just being a good actor (everything was believable). This movie could have been very different if not for such a great performance by Jacob Tremblay. Also giving an amazing performance, Brie Larson, knocks it out of the park in this one. Her performance as a mother who has to balance the stress of having a five year old child and also being in captivity is great. Another great performance that may not get mentioned enough is the acting by Joan Allen as Joy's mother. While she has a rather small role compared to the previously mentioned actors, she still gives a great performance as a mother coping with her daughter coming back to her after seven years as a changed person. Also, on a less serious note, the writer of this film (and book) definitely has children because the things that Jack say and do are really realistic like talking through his mother to other people or hiding behind her when strangers come (2 things that I used to do at around that age). This film tells the breathtaking story of a mother and son discovering the world and it is a must watch.",

The film adaptation of that novel, from a screenplay written by Donoghue, has already garnered critical acclaim and even been nominated for Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards. With such high expectations, I knew that I was in for a treat.\n\nFive-year-old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) has never known of a world beyond the small room he shares with his mother (Brie Larson). The small garden shed that they call home is equipped with the bare necessities: a single bed, toilet, sink, table, wardrobe. A skylight is the family's only view to the outside world. Their only connection to that world is a man they call Old Nick, the man who captured Ma when she was a teenager and fathered Jack.\n\nMa has done her best to shield Jack from the horrors of their life. She plays games with the boy and never lets Old Nick come into contact with him. But Ma knows that she can't shelter her son forever. This life they share is simply not sustainable. Jack is already asking questions about their situation and she cannot keep him in the dark much longer. There is only one thing left for them to do. After seven years of captivity, they must find a way to escape.\n\nRoom is the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore. It is a small, character driven narrative that subtly implants itself into your consciousness. Director Lenny Abrahamson, who directed the under appreciated Frank a couple years ago, deftly gives his actors the space to explore the innermost layers of their characters. Both Larson and the young Tremblay rise to the occasion. Larson in particular gives a nuanced and powerful performance that makes her a safe bet for this years Best Actress Academy Award. This heart-wrenching story about the lengths a parent will go to for the love and safety of their child is a brilliant adaptation of an extraordinary novel and an absolute must see film.",

A lot of the themes in 'Room' are heavy, and it's difficult to watch some of the scenes. That said, it is a beautifully shot piece of cinema. The fragility and vulnerability of Ma and Jack make them character who people can actually root for, and the fight they must put up is one that puts them against all odds.\n\nWhile it was not deserving of best picture, nor did it earn the honor, 'Room' is one of the strongest drama efforts in a long while.",

The films that fall into this last category are all, more or less, based on real people or real events.\n\nROOM also has its roots in reality. The movie is based on the best-selling novel by the same name written by Emma Donoghue, who came up with the story after hearing about the Fritzl case in Austria. (In that case, Elisabeth Fritzl had been held captive by her father, Josef, for 24 years in a hidden basement in her family's home. During that time, Josef has physically and sexually abused her, and raped her numerous times resulting in the birth of seven children. Four of the kids remained with their mother in captivity (one had died a few days after childbirth), while the other three were raised by Josef and his wife.)\n\nInterestingly, in 2013, Amanda Berry and her six-year-old daughter escaped from Ariel Castro's suburban Cleveland, Ohio, home where they had been imprisoned for 10 years. (Castro had also imprisoned two other women at the same time.) Berry had apparently set up a kindergarten for her daughter while in captivity, acting as her teacher and \"walking\" her to school every morning. While this case was revealed after Donoghue's book after written, it more closely resembles the story. It makes one wonder how many other people are being held in captivity that we don't know about.\n\nIn ROOM, Ma/Joy (newly awarded Oscar winner Brie Larson, DON JON; THE SPECTACULAR NOW; SHORT TERM 12), 24, has been held captive in the soundproofed backyard shed for the past seven years. For the first two years, she cried every day, being repeatedly raped by her captor, \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers) and seeing no hope for the future. Then Jack (Jacob Tremblay) was born and Ma stopped crying. She had something to live for. In their tiny room, which they call \"Room\", Ma has carved out a safe and peaceful life for herself and Jack in between regular visits from Old Nick who drops off food, clothes and supplies for the pair, and continues to rape her.\n\nEverything in Room has a name. There's Lamp, Sink, Rug, Plant and Cupboard. There's also TV - Jack's only window to the outside world, which he has been taught to believe is imaginary. Room is the whole world and everything outside Room is Outer Space. Skylight gives them a view of the sky and the occasional fallen leaf but not much more. As limiting as it sounds, Jack is happy in Room. He and Ma do yoga together, he runs track (Ma, we learn, was a high school track star) and he plays with Egg Snake, his favourite toy. Ma has created a whole world for Jack where he has everything he could possibly need.\n\nWhen Jack turns 5, Ma decides that it's time for the charade to end. She concocts a plan to get Jack out of Room and find someone to help them. For Jack, it's a terrifying prospect. For the first time in his life, he'll be apart from Ma and in a world that he's still not sure even exists. But he and Ma do find freedom and then they have to deal with living in a much larger and more complex Room - the real world.\n\nROOM is a tour de force for both Larson and Tremblay. The two actors developed a strong bond during the production and it's apparent in their performances here. Tremblay, who is acting in only his first film, shows the depth of emotions that we would expect to come from someone who has been in front of the camera for years.\n\nThe film started racking up audience and critics' awards screened since it premiered at Telluride last September. By the time it hit mainstream cinemas two months later, it was being touted as one of the year's best films. Everyone was also predicting that Larson would walk away with a Best Actress Golden Globe (R) and Oscar (R), which she did. (She also won a BAFTA (R) along the way.) Tremblay, too, was also mentioned as being Oscar-worthy but, sadly, he was not nominated. He should have been because we have not seen acting like this from such a young person since Tatum O'Neal won an Oscar for her performance in PAPER MOON. (She still holds the record as the youngest winner in any category.)\n\nThe film was directed by Lenny Abrahamson, who has a brief but impressive resume. In 2014, he directed Domhnall Gleeson (STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS) and Michael Fassbender (STEVE JOBS) in the quirky musical comedy, FRANK. Abrahamson was also nominated for an Oscar (R) for ROOM, but with strong competition coming from Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (THE REVENANT), Tom McCarthy (SPOTLIGHT) and Adam McKay (THE BIG SHORT), it wasn't going to be his year. It's a safe prediction, though, to say that this will not be his last-ever Oscar (R) nod.\n\nROOM is a must-see film. After you've seen it, then go find Larson's other films and watch those too.",

            "content": "I went to see Room in what has become an increasingly rare situation: I was pretty much going in blind. I'd seen the trailer only once, and wasn't familiar with its adapted novel. All I knew was the very basic elements; that it was a film about a mother (Brie Larson) and her child (Jacob Tremblay) who are victims of kidnap and their struggle to escape. So, when I sat down to watch Room I was expecting something very specific, given what films on this subject tend to feature. I expected desperation, and anguish and the wretchedness of captivity. I predicted I'd feel heavy and slightly depressed by the end. What I actually saw and experience was artistic, heartfelt and ultimately whimsical. It broke my heart, and made me cry, but also left me smiling.\n\nJack (Tremblay) is our 5 year old narrator, and we experience the story through his eyes. His life in Room (the only life he has ever known) is not one of despair or abuse. He is successfully protected by his Ma (Larson), who has spent 7 years as the kidnapped captive of 'Old Nick' (Bridgers). During these 7 years, she is raped and imprisoned by her capture, giving birth to Jack in captivity and raising him with a sense of innocence about where he is and what exists outside. In a context that could have fallen into the risky territory of fetishizing crime, instead we watch the relationship of a mother and her son. Jack must learn that space and time exists beyond their room and TV, and must bravely attempt to escape if he and his mother can ever have a normal life.\n\nIt hits the right notes on all the important levels. Direction, cinematically, performance wise, narrative and in particular the dialogue. I'd go as far to say that Jacob Tremblay gives the best child performance of all time, with maturity far beyond his years. I recently listened to Mayo and Kermode's podcast interview with Lenny Abrahamson, and he talked about his considerations while directing Tremblay. This involved long takes, experimenting with different expressions and emotions while he delivered his dialogue. The youth and naivety of Jack's character feels totally genuine, especially during the narration sequences, and his interactions with Larson as his Ma are perfection.\n\nRoom is most definitely one of the best films at the cinema right now. I have deliberately tried to avoid its primary plot points so you can experience it for yourself. See this movie.",

Director Lenny Abrahamson and Cinematographer Danny Cohen create incredibly natural feeling atmospheres for their characters to live in, and Brie Larson as Joy and Jacob Tremblay as Jack deliver everything you could ask for while portraying a mother and son held captive in a shed for several years. Emma Donoghue adapted the screenplay from her own novel and chose to tell the story in two parts instead of focusing solely on either the imprisonment and subsequent escape or showing what life is like after such an unthinkable event. \n\nWhile there's no denying the incredible tension created in the first half of the film, and the nuanced attempt at showing the messy fallout in the second half, Donoghue misses the mark on too many plot points. Too often the film seemed structured to showcase the acting chops of the two leads (which are substantial) and to set up and knock down emotional pins instead of painting a fuller portrait of the insanity, confusion, and otherworldliness that must surround this kind of unimaginable experience. While it's facile to say the movie fizzles and dies in the second half, the filmmakers' unwillingness to go deep and really explore (not exploit) the the vast complexities of their taboo subject matter, limits the overall impact of Room to technical appreciation and praise for incredible performances. Room was good, it could have been great.",

Actually, now I remember that I had a hard time believing the escape that took place...like c'mon, you don't think a crazy psycho kidnapper would take an extra 1 minute to examine the kid and make sure he is indeed dead before risking his whole carefully executed kidnapping plan by simply throwing his 'body' in the back of the truck? Rookie, rookie kidnapper mistake lol, that I have a hard time believing would actually happen. Anyway, not a bad film at all, but get ready for a snore fest after they escape.

This film, based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, left me in an emotional wreck, with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's unforgettable duo performance. Lenny Abrahamson's direction brings to life every feeling, every tear, and every last bit of hope this mother and son feel in every minute of the film. Parents will love this film, as it is a reminder to always embrace their children and love them through every moment of life. Young adults will love this film, as it is a reminder that parents do anything and everything to protect them. \n\nROOM is undoubtedly the best film of the year and deserves every Oscar it is nominated for. It is a drama that you will never forget, and definitely makes my list of favorite films of the year. I look forward to a successful career for Larson and hope to see her appear in many great films. All I can say is \"WOW!\".",

            "content": "Earning Brie Larson the Academy Award for Best Actress, Room's guarentee of solid acting sounded like a remarkable experience.\n\nIn comparison to most of the Academy Award-recognized films of 2015, Room's budget is a minuscule $13 million. As a result, it is clearly a film which cannot disguise any shortcomings underneath a spectacle. Instead it relies on writing and performances to carry it, and that is precisely what it gets. \nGiven the recognition Room has earned it is difficult to go into the experience without at least some awareness of the narrative. However, upon careful analysis of the narrative its interesting to note that the storytelling is not explicit. While concepts are hinted at from the beginning of the film, it is difficult to ascertain the context of why Joy \"Ma\" Newson and Jack Newson live in a room and pretend that the world outside doesn't exist. We are given the perspective of Jack in which we see things happen but are given no explicit confirmation of what is occuring. Sensible audiences can probably determine the story context based on their own common sense, but the way in which Emma Donoghue's script cleverly leaves Jack in the dark provides an interesting perspective for the story. Occasionally it may take the focus away from Joy who is arguably the character that audiences have come to see, but even if it detracts from her into some rather slow territory at times there is still a remarkable feeling of childish wonder that comes from this. It doesn't always provide us with a direct perspective on the drama thats occuring, but the way in which viewers are connected to the child protagonist of the story is really an admirable achievement. The cinematography can also be largely credited to this because it often gives viewers a first-person perspective of what Jack is seeing and adds slight shakes to offer a sense of realism to add to the experience. The cinematography is a key factor in supporting the script ambitions in Room, and the technique also manages to consistently provide viewers with an understanding of how confined the characters are regardless of where in the world they physically stand.\nEven though it has such dark themes and harsh context, Room is not a thriller obsessed with condemnation of crime. Instead, it is a gripping yet uplifting story of surviving it and appreciating the virtues of life that exist beyond its harsh reality. The film never loses sight of its drama, but the undeniable human spirit in it gives such a rich heart to Room that succesfully encourages audiences enough to occasionally forget the cold nature of the story's context. Room manages to consistently strike viewers with unpredictable drama and lift their spirits without being emotionally manipulative about it, and its a new standard of filmmaking for director Lenny Abrahamson.\nEven when Room veers into slower territory, the one aspect of the feature that is completely flawless is the strength of the leading actors.\nBrie Larson's leading performance is a truly captivating effirt. Both her performance and appearance echo memories of Summer Glau's role as River Tam on Firefly (2002); both characters carry emotional trauma at authoritarian mistreatment and severe depression yet are supported mainly by the love of one close family member. Obviously the realism of Room is quite a contrast to the space western context of Firefly, but the similarity between the characters made a real connection with me. This is partially because Firefly is my favourite TV show of all time, but also because within their respective contexts there are key similarities between the characters. In the case of Brie Larson, she grasps the emotional complexity of the character with instinctive dramatic talent. The bleak look of emotional withdrawal her face contrasted with the intense chemistry she shares with Jacob Tremblay provides audiences with a clear sign of her headspace. Brie Larson finds the perfect balance between restrained and tenacious intensity in Room, grasping a powerful realism in her performance which is likely to be appreciated most of all by actual mothers. It's impossible not to sympathize with the character, but its audiences who can empathize who should appreciate the mother-son relationship most of all. Brie Larson leads Room with a truly exceptional performance.\nJacob Trembley's performance is the kind which raises the standard of child acting for a new generation. There are so many themes in Room which a child of his age should not be able to comprehend, but given the nature of his performance you would never have guessed it. There are so many times when I can't tell whether Jacob Trembley is executing powerful acting through a tenacious understanding of the narrative universe or if he has been told as much as the character is meant to know and is expressing genuine childish innocence. It is surreal that Jacob Trembley was only 8 at the time of filming Room, but the real skill that he carries as an actor is sure to take him far in his career. Jacob Trembley shares a remarkable chemistry with Brie Larson in which he works with her to battle for audiences attention through a remarkable chemistry that integrates raw intensity and gentle interactions as a means of grasping the full scale of their relationship. It is perhaps the most realistic depiction of a mother-daughter relationship I have ever seen because it encapsulates the close interaction between the two, the somewhat antagonistic reactions on behalf of the child and the mother's fight to manage it all to ensure long-lasting love is maintaed between them. Jacob Trembley and Brie Larson provide audiences with a rich depiction of family which carries too much realism to disregard.\nJoan Allen also supplies an intense supporting performance.\n\nRoom is a powerful depiction of a mother-son relationship and childhood innocence which celebrates life without neglecting powerful emotional drama, and even at its slower moments it is consistently bolstered by performances of pure transcendence on behalf of the amazing Brie Larson and Jacob Trembley.",

Today, I finally got around to checking out 'Room'.\n \nStarring Brie Larson and youngster Jacob Tremblay, 'Room' centers around a mother and son that live in a very small single room. It isn't revealed where the room actually is at first, but Joy 'Larson' is frequently visited by a man her and her son, Jack, refer to as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). Old Nick comes to Joy seemingly for sex, and to give them small amounts of amenities at a time.\n \nJoy reveals to Jack, after his 5th birthday, that she was taken by a man that asked for help with his dog and has been in 'room' for 7 years. \n \nJack has never left 'room' and has no concept of the outside world, though Joy tries her hardest to explain things. Joy tries to escape 'room', including Jack in her plans to trick Old Nick. She succeeds in faking Jack's death so Old Nick can dispose of his body, wrapping him in a rug and telling him to run once he's able to. The plan succeeds and the police eventually find and free Joy.\n \nJoy and Jack, after being released from the hospital, go to live with Joys mother and new step-father (as her parents divorced while she was missing). Joy has trouble re acclimating with the world, going so far as to attempt suicide, while Jack, slow to take to the world at first, begins to thrive in it. Jack's strength ultimately gives Joy strength as they move on with their lives.\n \nThe story is both heartwarming and heart-breaking. Seeing how Joy and Jack had to live, being prisoners for years was awful yet inspiring to watch. Joy's love for Jack is what kept her going all along. Both actors were marvelous in this film and it is one I would recommend checking out.\n \nMy rating: 8 out of 10",

For Jack, the world he now is confronted by is a very foreign place.\n\nA wonderful movie: highly original and incredibly emotional.  Just the initial plot - a mother and her son imprisoned for several years and how they escape - was original enough but then we have the psychological and emotional implications of returning to society (or, in Jack's case, joining society for the first time), and this takes the plot to another plane.  \n\nJack being confronted by and adapting to his new world is wonderfully and very sensitively told.  His mother having to deal with all her doubts regarding Jack adapting, and any residual guilt she feels from their time in captivity, is a great, and quite natural, story line too.\n\nGreat, emotional ending that perfectly ties up the movie.\n\nBrie Larson got a Best Actress Oscar for her performance and deserved it.  Jacob Tremblay, 8/9 years old at the time, is fantastic as Jack, showing acting skills well beyond his age.  Solid performances from a supporting cast that includes Joan Allen and William H Macy.\n\nMy favourite movie of 2015.",

The acting is superb from Brie and Jacob and you can't help rooting for them, when they were plotting and executing there escape but it was sad to see how the whole ordeal took its toll on Ma. The way that Jack's character was written, was perfect and for such a young boy, he really did bring realism to his character but I would have liked to have seen more scenes of them in the room, which was the most enjoyable part of the movie. It was amazing to see them make the most out of everything in that little space, including the mouse and the little birthday cake, so it wasn't surprising that it took so long for Jack to adapt to normal life. That wasn't the same case for Ma, who was locked up for 7 years and forced to have sex for food but I have to commend her for bringing up Jack under such abnormal and cruel circumstances. When she eventually came to terms with what she had been through, it was good to see her back with her little boy but I'm sure that it's something that will stick with her, for the rest of her life. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie and I'm glad that it got all of the recognition that it deserved. Original & Enjoyable!\n\nRound-Up:\nFor such a small movie which is based in a little room around 2 characters, it's good that it made such a profit at the box office, and with Brie Larson winning an Oscar and a Golden Globe award for the \u00c2\u00a0Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, it certainly went down well with audiences around the world. Personally, I think that Jacob Tremblay, equally put in a brilliant performance and it's a shame that he didn't get any awards for his amazing contribution. It was also up for an Oscar in the best picture of the year category, along with an director award and screenplay award, so it was a smash hit, in terms of the recognition that it received. The movie was directed by Irish born, Lenny Abrahamson, 49, who also brought you Adam & Paul, Garage, What Richard Did and the extremely strange movie, Frank starring Michael Fasbender. He certainly got the most out of the actors, who all put in emotional and believable performances but he did take his foot off of the gas towards the end.\n\nBudget: $13million\nWorldwide Gross: $35.4million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramatic movies starring Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Sean Bridges, Wendy Crewson, Joan Allen, William H. Macy and Matt Gordon. 7/10",

Some people might not get what's going on at first as it doesn't explain much in the beginning, but I figured it out quickly. What I really liked is how half the film is in the room and the other half deals with recovery. In many ways readjusting is as hard if not harder than being kidnapped at first. Which is why the boy at first longs to go back oddly enough where things r less complicated yet destitute. I liked that it was told from the little boys perspective so it doesnt get quite so bogged down in being depressive. The love btw mother and son is wonderfully shown and great performances abound esp the two main characters. Some parts were a bit exaggerated tho like why the kidnapper didnt take the kid back or why the interviewer was so rude to main character or else id give this movie 5 full stars.",

Jacob Tremblay seemed like he was made for the role. How he didn't get a Supporting Actor nod over a character Stallone could play in his sleep shocks me. The \"room\" scenes are very well crafted and brutal (in a good way) to watch. The escape scene is amazing, but rather unbelievable. How did Larson's character know old Nick drove a pickup truck 7-years after she was captured which would've been the ONLY way he could escape? From then on the film relies completely on Larson's acting to overshadow the stretched out PTSD scenes. It's nauseating and predictable.",

But we see none of this. The film opens with the two main characters, Jack (the five-year-old boy brilliantly played by Jacob Tremblay) and his mother (played by the talented Brie Larson) going about their everyday life in the room - sleeping, eating, exercising, playing, reading... etc. with occasional visits from the mysterious Old Nick. Upon Jack's fifth birthday, the mother decides that it is about time to get them both out of the room.\n\nI won't go into the details of the extremely bold scheme and the mother-son heart-wrenching argument scenes, but they finally do it and they make it out of their prison - a crucial moment that, you might think, will bring about the two characters' happily ever after. However, Room is not a happily ever after story; it is a story about what happens after the happy ending - a story about transitions. The film is divided exactly into two halves: inside and outside the room, two places that are equally confining for Jack and his mother. In the first part of the film when we are trapped inside with the two, we could feel the sense of confinement in mother's eyes but Jack's giggles and jumping around make us feel that the small room is as big as a playground. When we leave the room - an overwhelming moment for both of them - the room's concrete walls are replaced by psychological confinement materialized through personal disappointments and people's judgments.\n\nThe two main characters are tied by blood but differ drastically in the way they perceive the universe. For the mother, the room is the strange unfamiliar grounds; whereas for Jack, the room is the only universe he has ever known and the outside world is the unfamiliar, intimidating terrain. Despite the change of perspective, the bond mother and Jack share helps them become stronger, reach out to each other and overcome the difficulty of transition. Regardless of the melodramatic undertones, the story shows that it doesn't matter on which side of the wall you're standing because the only walls there are are the ones we build around ourselves and around other people, and that love is the only power that can overcome those walls.\n\nThe natural chemistry between Larson and Tremblay is phenomenal. Period.",

Director Lenny Abrahamson has derived from the source material in the best possible way.\n\nThe story is about the five-year old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) and his twenty-four-year old Ma (Brie Larson). She was abducted by a man called Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) when she was 17 and since then was locked in a room with a kitchen, toilet, bathtub and a TV. Old Nick abuses Ma on a daily basis and Jack is a result of it. Ma tries to hide the truth from Jack to maintain peace in his life, unless he is 5. Ma explains the truth to Jack and uses his help for a permanent and subtly written escape plan. Jack and Ma successfully manage to escape and now the coin flips it's sides in the movie as Jack adapts an update in his life, living in the outside world for the first time and Ma goes back to her normal life after seven years. They reunite with Ma's parents and she learns that they have been divorced and her mother has a new husband. Her father feels horrible whenever he looks at Jack and thus, decides to leave. Jack finds the outside world difficult at first and misses the room at first but later he manages to make new friends and is able to create a bond with his grandma and her new husband. Ma on the other side struggles with anger issues, is saddened due to her father's behaviour and has worries about Jack not adapting the normal life quickly. After facing a lot of problems at adapting the normal life at start, Jack and Ma finally begin living their normal life in piece and have fun in the outside world, but that does not deprive Jack from missing his early and lonely life with his mother in the Room.\n\nThe height of realism and suspense in Room is at the peak level and couldn't be any better. As suspenseful and dark it's first half is, the second half makes it a brilliant drama with adorable performance of the wonder kid Jacob Tremblay and praise-worthy acting by Brie Larson, who has been nominated for an Oscar for her acting as Jack's Ma. I'd crown Room as my personal favourite movie of this year. Room is a movie about love, life difficulties, darker sides of life and never giving up. Room answers questions that life may raise. It depicts a legit display of what life may become after all our troubles vanish and how to deal with it.",

It should be said right off that bat that for those that haven't yet seen this movie it is not an easy movie to watch.  That is because it is that powerful.  That being noted those that can steel themselves ahead of watching this gripping drama will find it to be a completely engaging piece that is both gripping and moving all at the same time.  The main reason for this is the movie's script.  This includes both the movie's central story and its more minute details. The work of the movie's cast is just as important to note especially considering the story and its setting.  That will be discussed later.  Last but not least to note is the bonus material included in the movie's new home release.  Each element is important in its own right to note in the overall presentation of Room.  Collectively they make this presentation one of the biggest surprises of 2015 and just as big of a surprise now that it has been released on Blu-ray and DVD.\n\nRoom proved in its initial theatrical run to be one of 2015's biggest surprises.  That is because it was the polar opposite of all of the prequels, sequels, and remakes churned out by Hollywood 's major studios.  In other words it proved to be an original story even having been adapted from a book published by author Emma Donoghue roughly five years ago.  The story follows mother and son Joy(Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay) as they try to survive and escape their captivity.  All the while their captor \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers) maintains his control over them by providing for them.  It sounds eerily like the case of the Ariel Castro kidnappings.  However, one must keep in mind that said case didn't break until 2013 when Amanda Berry escaped Castro's house and notified authorities of her captivity and that of Michelle Knight and Georgina DeJesus.  Donoghue's book was published two years ahead of the case breaking.  So any connection between the two is purely coincidental.  That maintains the originality of Donoghue's story.  What's more Donoghue largely controlled the adaptation of her story from book to big screen.  This is perhaps why the story was so enthralling in its presentation here.  It's not the first time that an author has had direct say in how his/her work was adapted from book to big screen.  However those scenarios are rarer than people might think.  Considering this Donoghue's direct hand in the movie's translation is important to note in the final product.  It's just one aspect of the writing that makes this movie's script so powerful.  The script's more minute details are just as important to the script as the story.\n\nThe story at the center of Room's script is an undeniably important part of the movie's success.  That is because of the simple fact that while it was a literary adaptation, it wasn't just another prequel, sequel, or remake.  What's more there's no chance of the story producing any of those movies, either.  And considering the fact that a story very similar to that of room proved to be reality two years after it was published proved to be reality, it makes Room's story that much more believable.  It's scary but true.  Even with this in mind the story at the center of the script is just one part of what makes the script so important to the movie's success.  The script's more minute details are just as important to the story as the story itself.  The fact that the story can stand on its own two feet with Joy not even being formally named until more than halfway through the movie is a powerful statement in itself.  More than likely Donaghue did this intentionally as a sort of way to illustrate Joy's lack of identity during her captivity versus her new-found freedom later in the movie.  It shows the importance that something as simple as a name can have in a movie's story.  On another level, the relationship between Jack and his mother is worth noting in regards to Room's script, too.  As difficult as the pair's situation is in their time in the shed, the emotional connection that is exhibited between mother and son is both moving and beautiful even.  It is moving when Joy finally tells Jack about the reality of their situation and he doesn't believe it.  It is sort of that end of innocence situation in a manner of speaking and will really tug at viewers' heartstrings.  The other moments are just as moving in a number of ways.  The happier moments are beautiful while the more difficult moments are moving in a painful way.  It makes seeing their situation in whole all the more painful for viewers to see yet just as gripping.  Believe it or not this is actually a good thing.  It is a good thing because it makes suspension of disbelief all the easier for audiences and in turn makes maintaining engagement in the story just as easy.  It also shows that as with the 1957 classic 12 Angry Men it is still possible to write a good story even with the story's characters confined to a given space for most of the movie.  Staying on that note, Donoghue is to be commended just as much for the manner in which she explained how long Jack and his mother had been there.  At one point Joy tells Jack that she had been kidnapped by \"Old Nick\" seven years prior to being in the shed.  Keeping this in mind and that the story opens with Jack telling Joy that he is now five years old, one is led to believe that \"Old Nick\" got Joy pregnant and she in turn gave birth to Jack.  The fact that \"Old Nick\" bought a toy truck for Jack for his birthday solidifies that even more.  It's a small plot element.  But it is so important.  And the way in which Donoghue executed this element is just as impressive as the script's overall story.  It's just one more way in which the script's smaller elements prove to be just as important to the movie as the story at the heart of the script.  There are plenty of other ways in which the script's smaller elements prove just as important to the movie's overall presentation as the central story.  Audiences will find plenty of those other ways when they watch the movie for themselves.  Moving on, Room's script is just one part of the movie that makes it stand tall amidst all of its prequel, sequel, and reboot counterparts from 2015.  The cast's work in front of the camera is just as important as that of Donoghue and director Lenny Abrahamson.\n\nThe combined efforts of Emma Donoghue and director Lenny Abrahamson to bring Donoghue's book to the big screen is a big part of what makes Room one of 2015's biggest surprise theatrical releases.  It also helps to make the movie just as surprisingly enjoyable for first time audiences now that it is available on DVD and Blu-ray.  The cast's work in front of the camera is just as important to the movie's success as its script.  Brie Larson shows throughout the course of the movie's nearly two-hour run time why she received the Golden Globe (R) and Oscar (R) for her role in the movie.  Viewers' hearts will hurt terribly for Joy as she struggles to raise Jack essentially on her own in the confines of that shed.  And the emotional pain that she exhibits as she comes up with her plans to get Jack out of the shed is just as difficult to take in.  The seriousness with which Larson approached these moments is what makes them so difficult to watch, but not in a bad way.  When she places the hot cloth on Jack's head and face to feign him being sick, it is clear that Joy did not want to take that route especially as Jack expressed the pain at feeling its heat.  When she gagged herself and wiped the result on his hair to make him appear even sicker his momentary disbelief is just as painful to see.  This applies both in the case of Joy and of Jack.  Speaking of Jack, Jacob Tremblay is just as impressive as the five-year old boy.  The innocence and naivety exhibited on the part of the boy, especially when he yells at his mother in disbelief about their situation, is just as spot on.  This is especially important to note considering that Tremblay is, in real life, almost twice the age of his character.  Audiences know that the shed is all that Jack has ever known.  So he doesn't believe that there is anything else in the world, just like any small child.  He doesn't overplay the moment either.  Being that he doesn't he makes viewers' hearts go out just as much to him as to his mother.  Regardless of that moment or any other, both Larson and Tremblay handle their roles perfectly, never once allowing themselves to go over the top.  It makes both mother and so fully believable and sympathetic characters.  They make viewers want the pair to get out and see \"Old Nick\" punished for what he had done to them.  That is a powerful statement about Larson and Tremblay's work.  On the same note, what happens in their attempt to adjust to \"normal\" life after having for both escaped the shed is just as powerful.  It is obvious just how difficult that adjustment was for both Jack and Joy.  Jack doesn't want to play with his new toys or talk to his grandmother's new boyfriend at first.  And Joy sadly attempts suicide at one point.  She does survive the attempt, though not to give away too much.  Yet again neither actor overdoes it at any point.  Rather they make viewers' hearts hurt for Joy and Jack that much more but fill with so much joy in the story's finale. There are so many other moments that could be cited which exemplify the outstanding work of both Larson and Tremblay.  Regardless of which moment(s) viewers find for themselves, viewers will agree that from beginning to end the pair is outstanding together.  The duo proves from beginning to end why their work is just as important to the movie as the movie's story and its associated elements.  Even as important as both elements are to the movie they are not the only important elements to note of the movie's presentation.  Now that it has been released on DVD and Blu-ray the movie's bonus material can be noted, too.\n\nThe writing behind Lionsgate's adaptation of Room and the work of the movie's cast that brought the movie's cast to life are both key elements in the movie's presentation.  As important as both elements are to the movie's presentation they are not the only important elements that should be noted.  The bonus material that has been included with the movie in its small screen release is just as important to note as the movie's script and acting.  The behind-the-scenes featurettes are enjoyable enough.  There is the standard \"Making of\" featurette and a pair of featurettes that examine \"Old Nick's\" shed and the importance of the shed in the story.  As much as they might add to the movie's presentation, the movie's bonus feature-length commentary proves to be the most important of the movie's bonuses.  Audiences get to hear from director Lenny Abrahamson and Emma Donoghue throughout the course of the movie as well as other members of the movie's crew.  And they cover a number of topics throughout.  There are discussions on the movie's shooting angles, the importance of making the shed look dark yet not overly foreboding (this will be discussed shortly), the movie's pacing, and so much more.  The discussion on the setup of the shed is important because as is noted in the discussion, it was meant to look and feel like a place that ironically enough Jack felt safe even despite what it really was.  It really plays into the discussion on Jack's innocence and Tremblay's handling of that innocence and naivety.  The note of the movie's pacing is just as important.  That is because it serves to drive home how easily Donoghue and Abrahamson were able to keep the story moving even as Joy and Jack try to readjust to something similar to normalcy.  Those that are interested in movie production will appreciate the discussions throughout the movie on its various angles and how they are used to evoke certain emotions from both the movie's viewers and its cast.  These are just some of the discussions raised throughout the course of Room's bonus commentary.  There is much more in-depth commentary provided over the course of the movie's nearly two-hour run time that audiences will appreciate.  Collectively it shows clearly why the movie's commentary is such an important bonus addition to the movie in its new home release if not the movie's most important bonus.  Most important or not it can be said that the commentary, along with the movie's bonus featurettes, complete the movie's viewing experience and show once and for all why Room is just as surprisingly powerful now in its home release as it was in its theatrical release last year.\n\nRoom was one of the biggest surprise movies of 2015's new theatrical releases.  That is because the movie, based on Emma Donoghue's book by the same name wasn't just another heartless, soulless prequel, sequel, or remake.  It was a movie that exhibited real heart, depth, and originally.  What's more there's no way that it could lead to a prequel or sequel.  It is a movie that, thanks to its power, absolutely demands viewers steel themselves going into the movie.  It is that deep and powerful; especially for those viewers with children.  The work of lead stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay in bringing Joy and Jack to life adds its own share of heart to the movie.  Their work expertly illustrates the mother and son's close relationship and how it manages to survive amazingly even the most difficult situations.  That clear bond will bring even the strongest viewer to tears at times.  Their relationship is just one of a number of interesting topics discussed in the movie's bonus commentary, the most important of the movie's bonuses in its new home release.  It isn't the movie's only bonus.  But it is the movie's most important bonus.  Together with the extra featurettes included in the movie's home release, the bonus material completes the movie's viewing experience.  After watching all of the movie's bonuses and taking in the movie's story and acting, viewers that can make themselves watch this movie all the way through will agree that they should make *ahem* room for Room on their DVD and Blu-ray racks and in their digital collections.

            "content": "Lenny Abrahamson, the director of this film, is determined to make everyone cry. The viewer will go through a rollercoaster ride of emotions including happiness, eeriness, and sadness. The interaction between \"Ma\" (Brie Larson) and \"Jack\" (Jacob Tremblay) is bittersweet. I couldn't help but feel delighted to see the affectionate love they share and show on screen. But at the same time, I couldn't help but feel disturbed by the fact that they were held captive in a shed.\n\nThe room was evidently small, but the way Jack and Ma played around to keep themselves busy made it look like the biggest and happiest playground in the world. The playground would turn into a disturbing hellish nightmare by night. While Jack was trying to sleep, their captor named \"Old Nick\" would rape Ma. The actual horrendous activity was not shown on screen. Instead, we see Jack in a closet trying to sleep while we hear the thumping and thudding.\n\nMa and Jack's time in the room contain most of the film's best moments. After Jack escapes and the police find out where Ma was, the film becomes more intriguing. Jack's interaction with the real world kept my attention. From interacting with other people to playing with a dog for the first time, I couldn't help but smile. Although I realize that the third act was longer than it should be, I was still entertained. The film's most uplifting scenes are to be found when Jack experiences the real world.\n\nThe cinematography was nothing special, but I specifically liked the way they filmed in the room. I felt claustrophobia, which I think was the intent of the cinematographer. Jack's face when he sees the blue open sky for the first time is one of my favorite moments in this movie.\n\nThe chemistry between Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay was very authentic. I felt the love that they shared for each other and the tense arguing against each other. Brie Larson received numerous accolades for her performance, including an Oscar win. Her performance was raw. From shedding tears, screaming at her movie mom, to her subtle moments with Jacob, she couldn't have done any better. Jacob Tremblay's performance was equally great as Brie's. He was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Nevertheless, he still won numerous awards, including the Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, beating the legendary Christopher Plummer. I have never seen a child actor give out such a phenomenal performance ever since Haley Joel Osment in \"The Sixth Sense\". His facial expressions were surreal and authentic. There was never a scene where I felt that he was just \"acting\", his performance felt real. Their on-screen chemistry is arguably the best thing about this film.\n\nThe dialogue between the characters was natural. A very simplistic, but at the same time, powerful screenplay, written by the author of the novel, Emma Donoghue.\n\nI have never felt affected by the soundtrack of a film ever since watching the movie \"Drive\" (2011). The music perfectly portrayed the tone of a scene. From the empowering song, \"The Mighty Rio Grande\", to the even more empowering song \"New End\", the soundtrack played a crucial part in this film.\n\nThis film was a refreshing watch. A true modern cinematic masterpiece. The best movie of 2015.",

            "content": "Having read the source material, I came in to this film as someone who was not the biggest fan of the book. The film is actually better, particularly when it comes to Larson's performance. \n\nOne of the dynamics of the book that I found tough to gauge was the sort of shifting and limited perspective that we gain from the first half. The story itself can really be broken in to two parts, and in the first there is the mystery of the room and the questions of why and how and what. Both in the book and in the film the answers kind of float in as we centre in on to the dynamic of this mother and son bond. But there is little room for actual character development, especially given that the film steers away from any interest in a back story or much immediate context. This is where both the film and the book narrow in on the experience itself (of being isolated as a mother and son to a single room where they have built a life for themselves apart from the world), specifically in putting us in to the perspective of the child himself. \n\nThis is where the film has the added benefit of the visual portrayal. Much of the progression that we find in the story is of the boy's transforming experience of reality and the world. The film does a great job of letting us sit in this tension as the boy responds to his reality slowly being shattered a piece at a time. \n\nIt is not until the second half that the story brings in some of the different relationships that surround the mother and the son. Here the plot finds some opportunity for development, and again, the film gains a better handle of fusing this with the first half in a less disjointed fashion. Both the first and second half have some heart breaking moments, but it is in the second half that we are able to give it a bit of context as a dramatic story. As well, in the second half, Larson's character (as the mom) fades a bit out of view as the larger drama takes it's place, but the strength of the film is that Larson's captivating and patient performance in the first half manages to linger and stay in the back of our minds in a much more visual and haunting fashion. \n\nI am not so sure this is a film that I would watch again. It doesn't mean it's not a really good film, but it is the kind of film that is difficult to watch. I know it was up for best picture, with some predictions of taking home the big prize as well. The jury is still out on this one for me. But if you did enjoy the book, this adaptation should service the experience of the novel very well. And if you weren't a big fan, this film should heighten that experience and add to it in a positive way.",

To the mother the room is a living hell which he does her best to cope with each day. To her son, who was born in there, Room is all he knows, it is his entire world, and he has no knowledge of the world outside. \n\nNow it's going to be difficult to review this movie without giving away a few minor spoilers (I say minor as we're not going to give away anything that you wouldn't have seen in the trailers), but here we go. It is very much a movie of two halves, the first half inside room and second half (minor spoiler) outside room. Though both are filled with directly opposed experiences of both mother and son throughout. \n\nSo the first half depicts life inside room. And instead of doing the expected lazy montage which we have become accustomed to in so many films, room takes its time to show you the day to day lives of the two characters, in a slow and subtle way but without ever making you feel bored or that the movie is slow. Each day presents a different challenge for the mother and a new form of entertainment for the son. And each day really does feel different- an amazing accomplishment when you consider the tiny size of room. \n\nThis is then juxtaposed by the second half of the film which takes place outside. Of course not spoilers as to how or why they are out of room. But once out, again the two characters find themselves dealing with very different realities. Brie Larson having to somehow piece her life back together after 7 years, while coping with depression and post-traumatic stress, Jacob Tremblay trying to acknowledge the new world and people that exist within, but ultimately missing his more simple life back in room. \n\nThe acting in this movie is some of the finest you'll see, Brie Larson, deserving of her Oscar nomination and Jacob Tremblay is a revelation, with a long career ahead of him - the finest child actor since DiCaprio in what's eating Gilbert Grape. \n\nThe cinematography is exceptional, and evolves throughout the course of the movie, beginning with close up shots and a high depth of field to show the claustrophobic nature of room, and gradually changing to wider shots to convey the helpless sense of space that Jacob Tremblay feels on the outside.\n\nIn conclusion, I find it difficult to find fault in room. It is without question one of the best films I have seen for years. As you may know I'm a believer that there are very few \"perfect\" films, where everything single frame is conducive to advancing the story, and not a line is wasted. I really looked and thought as I was watching that I would take points off in the second half for a slowed down pace. But the change of pace was for a very powerful reason that I won't spoil now. Get ready coz you are unlikely to see me do this again for a long time, but I refuse to give Room anything less than a 10/10. It is a flawless masterpiece, and a crowning achievement in cinema, the sort of film you feel privileged to have watched. It is that good!",

I heard 'Room' and immediately thought sombre tale about a mother and child trapped in a room, kinda like 'Panic Room' without the panic.

This direction works, benefiting the movie by providing a wider range of emotional strength in comparison to a thriller/horror captivity atmosphere. Nevertheless, I was going to inevitably find a story about two characters trapped in a room quite limited and therefore didn't take to it to the same extent as critics.",

Room is a rare movie that is almost perfect. It has spectacular acting on all fronts but mostly I have to say that Jacob Tremblay is the best even of the year. He's a 9 year old (8 at the time of filming) that already has the range of Leonardo DiCaprio. He is able to show how confusing it is to be born in captivity and all of a sudden thrown into the world and having to save his mom. The fear and confusion is vividly shown from him and it makes you feel and think about the feeling. Brie Larson also has such strength in showing a mother wanting to protect her child but how hard it is to also comprehend being back in the world and processing everything that happened. \nThe movie is beautifully made and for almost two hours you don't even realize that you're watching a movie. It's finely made with a great cast and a director who knows how to get the camera to do all the right things. The only complaint I would have is the lack of use of William H Macy. He's a fine actor to be in only about five minutes. It's not a deal breaker whatsoever just a little thing that I thought about after. This movie is a roller coaster of emotions so be prepared.",

For all that, there were only brief moments when I was genuinely moved to a tear or fury and disgust at the perpetrator of their horror. There was a disconnect which even the undoubted cutesy charm of the little'un couldn't transcend for me. Perhaps I simply don't find BrieL engaging?

            "content": "\"You can watch the movie and focus on the kidnapping and the crime story, or you can see it as a story of love and freedom and perseverance and what it feels like to grow up and become your own person. That's more of what I see in it,\" Brie Larson explains to \"The A.V. Club\" when asked about her reaction to last year's \"Room.\" The crown jewel of 2015's year in movies and the film that won Larson an Oscar for Best Actress after years of great work, \"Room\" is a tour-de-force of the understatement.  It's a drama that works with the constraints of the minimum and ends on an emotional maximum.\n\tYou might have heard what its story entails by now.  It is a tale of survival that depends solely on two characters to tug at our heartstrings.  They are Joy (Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a mother/son duo whose relationship is built on extraordinary circumstances.  Seven years previously, Joy, now twenty-four, was kidnapped on her way home from school, and has since been held hostage in a minuscule wooden shed in the backyard of her captor (Sean Bridges).  Enduring years of sexual abuse and malnourishment, she gave birth to Jack in her second year of captivity - in his life, he has never known anything other than \"room,\" other than \"Ma.\"\n\tBut now at an age where he is able to distinguish that something might be off about his existence, Jack begins the line of questioning Joy has been dreading since the date of his birth.  Fantastical stories have been made to cushion the complexities of the outside world, of other people, of life itself.  But knowing that escape could be imminent now that her son is capable of thinking for himself, it's a necessity that she deconstruct his walls of illusion.\n\tAs expected, the two do eventually escape and do eventually have to adjust to a life of freedom.  But \"Room\" never provides easy answers, stripping away tabloid filler and analyzing the intricacies of Jack and Joy's relationship, and the hardships that befall them once they have to move on from imprisonment and into normality.  The film itself is an adaptation of Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name (unread by me), and a balancing act it is.  Already delicate is the way \"Room\" so grittily portrays a crime story without a hint of melodrama; so it's all the more impressive that it, more or less, is told from Jack's perspective.\n\tIt's a masterpiece in empathy and performance, a visceral exploration as we are so fully placed in the shoes of its characters.  We can feel Joy's excruciating need to put the past behind her, to be the mother she was never prepared to be; we can see the world through Jack's eyes as if we were a child ourselves, as comparatively stubborn to see the world for what it is.  Their relationship is so poignant because it feels so genuine; Larson and Tremblay completely disappear into their roles, and startling is how much we identify with them the more we get to know them.  To shed a tear in response to Joy's brutal adjustment to an unlocked life, to the first time Jack ever tells someone other than his mother that he loves them, is to be anticipated - it's an emotional journey, and \"Room's\" unflinching authenticity makes it worth the trip.\n\tAnd what a collaborative work it is; Lenny Abrahamson's direction, nuanced and sensitive, makes the film the story of overcoming trauma it so desperately needs to be.  Larson and Tremblay, so barefacedly magnificent, are the very forces that make Abrahamson's subtleties come to life in their compassion.  We need more films like \"Room,\" or at least ones that know something by way of commiseration - it's proof that cinema is just as effectual when enamored with people, not mere aesthetic skill.  Here is one of the best films of 2015.",

The captivity seems less psychologically harsh than I think it should come across, partly because (spoiler alert, to some extent) we don't see up-close the nightly raping of the captive woman--instead, a kind of softened and removed sense of it as her son experiences it when closed in a closet.  I think this is lamentable distancing from the captive's ongoing torture and torment.  I don't know whether this corresponds to the book on which the film is based, but I found it troubling that we're not subjected to more of that routinized horror of the woman's existence. The pace is a bit slow during the scenes in a claustrophobic shed where the mother and son are held, then becomes more intense and jagged after they escape.  The struggle for the mother and son to adjust to freedom is more gripping, and helps establish more of an emotional grounding.  Brie Larson's performance is generally good, but not outstanding as I expected.  Other performances vary from strong to artificial. The film deserves to be seen but is not the powerful tale it could have been.",

In Room 2015 they displayed perfect acting, a beautiful, yet thrilling story; the concept of this film was on point in all ways.\n\nRoom is one of those films that everyone should check out, the way the team put it all together just couldn't have been any better; perfection to say the least. Room (2015) is a film in which will be in our tops for a very long time.",

This is a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle that will thrill you and leave you fighting back tears. Rarely did I ever feel my heart pounding out of my chest as in Room. Easily one of the most emotional and haunting movies I've seen in a while. Whereas the first half shows us the lead's life in the \"room\", the second half focuses on both mother and child adapting to the \"world\". I was quite surprised how well thought out the whole story was. Just to give a few examples: when both Joy and Jack are in the hospital, the doctor gives them sunglasses because their eyes aren't adapted to the sun, Jack first learning to go up and down the stairs while already being five, Jack wanting to go back to the room etc.. A lot of attention is paid to the details, this making this movie quite excellent and real.\nThe true meaning of drama is depicted beautifully in this movie. An absolute work of art. Room is incredibly powerful all thanks to the masterful work of director Lenny Abrahamson and the acting of Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. They are both stunning and have fantastic chemistry as mother and son. In addition, the writing is fantastic. Touching, moving and strong. All of the dialogue really hits you hard and makes you sit back and think. Room might be quite a \"small\" film but in plays in the bigger league of cinema, standing tall against all the competition.\nRoom also managed to get me choked up quite a few times and by the end it made me realize just how much damage and suffering can be done to a person and last, even when the worst of a situation is over, but at the same time, it also made me realize how strong we can all be deep down in our ability to overcome even the worst as long as we have family or someone there for us. Overall, it's without a doubt one of the hardest movies to watch, but it really deserves your attention all the way! It's a film that truly humbled me and is a shining and welcome reminder that the human spirit and will is indeed alive.",

Donoghue was aware that her novel had become great inspiration to many women, mothers (especially single mothers), female victims, and many of her fans actually wanted more of \"Ma\", even requesting for a prequel or a parallel narrative. So in a way, the 2015 film adaptation to me shifted the anchoring perspective and created the opportunity for \"Ma\" to step forward more. This can be a good or bad thing, as one of the main selling-points of the novel was how readers are deeply moved by experiencing the storyline from the cherubic, fragile and beguiling world of a five year-old. Some may want to hold on to that, which will not be the case in Lenny Abrahamson's film. For me, the adaptation came off accomplished.\nAlthough in a different way, it remains thoroughly absorbing and the performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are equally compelling. Being the slowest reader that I am, there are not many instances where I have the liberty to review a film with the knowledge from having read the novel version prior. Room is one of them, and I'm glad the film did not disappoint.\nRegardless of its success, the film is far from an easy watch. Ma, or her real name Joy, is kept prisoner in the garden shed for seven years, consistently raped by her captor, Old Nick. It's into this oppressive and inadequate world that Jack has been born, as Ma devotes every second of her life in making him happy, creating their very own universe within the confined space, protecting him from the cold, brutal truth. Watching Jack living his entire life in the room with Ma, being the only \"world\" he knows, interacting with the only friends he has, the wardrobe, the lamp, the rug, can be really heartbreaking. Soon the time comes when Ma realises that she can no longer fully safeguard Jack's well-being and his psychological vulnerability is spreading like a ticking time-bomb.\nWorking from a screenplay by Donoghue herself, Abrahamson delivers the story with precision, both visually and psychologically. Donoghue absolutely nailed her adaptation, transforming her poignant tale into a different format, yet sufficiently, if not equally, gripping. There are several differences which did not deter the film from staying true to its source. The narration of Ma and Jack's lives prior the escape is definitely shorter, where the novel spends more time on how Ma constructs Jack's \"world\" in detail. There are lesser characters, giving Grandma and Leo (Step Grandpa) more focus in the film. Ma's rotten tooth kept by Jack as his \"courage\" also receives a different treatment, but I shall not elaborate further (no spoilers, of course). One of the strengths of Room is how it moves from grim to inspiring, the limited space will against all odds translate a powerful, gargantuan message.",

The story follows a mother and son who live in captivity, held in a shed, but after the son's fifth birthday the mother attempts to explain to him that there's a world outside of the shed and that they need to escape.  Brie Larson gives an outstanding performance, and has great chemistry with co-star Jacob Tremblay, who's quite impressive for a child actor; crushing the dialog, delivering it in such an innocent and earnest way as to be quite heartbreaking.  Additionally, the writing is incredibly well-done; especially in how the mother creates a fantasy world for her son.  And, the director does a remarkable job at making the room a world in itself by never showing too much at once and keeping the shots focused on specific objects that define different sections of the shed.  Room can be a hard film to watch due to its disturbing psychological themes, but it also has an inspirational quality in what is overcome and the power of the bond between the mother and son.",

Brie Larson even got her recognition on 21 Jump Street (2010). The poster of the film looked awesome though. It looked promising. And it indeed promising!\n\nRoom concentrated on 2 acts: life in the Room and life out of the Room. This isn't a spoiler because you can see the 2 acts in the trailer. We weren't suppose to concentrate on the whole act, but the filmmakers wants us to concentrate on the people acting inside the movie. It explored deeply on the possibilities of the emotions developed by the story.\n\nBut, don't feel spoiled just after watching the trailer. Because the trailer is just a trailer - not the whole movie. There were a lot of surprises in the whole film.\n\nBrie Larson were amazing in this film. She proved that research and experiment were crusial to build the foundation of GOOD acting. Preparing for the role was pretty hard for Larson; she had to locked herself inside her house without phone or internet; even though she consider herself as introvert, she cried at the very last days her own house.\n\nAnd Jacob. He could be the next star child who we were waiting for all these years. He was amazing! He really knew what he was doing. I'm very excited to see his next movie.\n\nThe cinematography looked hard; tight space is a challege to all of us filmmakers. There can't be so many people inside the set. When they started rolling the camera, I predicted it was only the cinematographer and the director who stayed behind the camera.\n\nThe set had a very great mood-building things. It didn't create that awkward feeling which sitcoms or cheap drama have. I really like the look and the mood, especially in the Room.\n\nThe verdict:\n\nThe movie concentrated primarily on the emotions that the actors produced rather than the whole story, which was the key-selling of this movie.",

            "content": "The best of the 2015 Best Picture nominees.  So this is about a mother (Brie Larson) and her son (Jacob Tremblay) in a room.  There's very little interaction with the outside world.  What exactly is going on here?  When I say you should watch a film cold, this movie is exactly the reason why the saying exists.  Seriously, I think the plot synopsis on IMDb gives away way too much, and a lot of what makes this movie so bonafide fantastic is in the intrigue in the setup.  The way this film presents its story and the manner in which the story unravels is some of the best story-telling of they year, in this writer's humble opinion.  I will, of course, avoid spoilers, but I fully support you halting the reading of this immediately so you can go and take this movie in: it really is that good, and I recommend it to all.  Now Brie Larson has been turning in some quality work for quite some time now.  I have yet to see it, but people rave about Short Term 12, and she's been having commercial success as well, with small roles in Trainwreck and in one of my personal favorites Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.  She is nothing short of breathtaking with the performance she delivers here, but if she didn't have somebody to play off of, her job would have been so much more difficult.  The kid they got for this, Jacob Tremblay, is also equally amazing.  It's so rare to see a child pull off a role this well, and he is right on the same level as Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense in terms of quality.  Room is a movie that is set apart by its script and performances.  There's not a whole lot to work with as far as the set goes, and it is, for all intents and purposes, a bottle movie.  You know there has to be a good reason behind all this, and once it gets there, everything starts to click, and you can't wait to see how it will play out.  The level of drama this reaches is high, and there is fascination behind the psychology of it all; how to explain everything that has transpired to a little kid is not a task anybody would desire, and to watch Brie Larson deliver emotionally charged monologue after emotionally charged monologue is truly a sight to behold.  I'm going to wrap this up so as to avoid spoilers: please go watch this movie.",

It's a film that leaves an impression and shrouds itself with both unspeakable darkness and unforsaken love. The premise, sparsely elaborated on at first, finds a mother and her young child confined to space not even qualified to be called a large room, yet a space that through imagination takes on a profoundly vivid expanse.\n\nRoom is really one of those films that the less you know about it going in the better. For this reason, any review should focus less on the mechanisms of the plot and more on what the film achives. Its achievements are thus many, doing a fantastic job transporting us to a world that we don't understand, and only get glimpses of its true nature. Much of the perspectives, including narration, are done from the point of view of the young boy-Jack. The director Lenny Abrahamson does a phenomenal job of capturing his thoughts, feelings, and worldview-a rather daunting feat for such a young child.\nThis unique perspective is also extremely well balanced by the reality of the situation, resulting in a film that both transports and informs the viewer. It is bolstered by excellent performances all around, especially by the young child actor, Jacob Tremblay, and Brie Larson-a rising start of near limitless potential.\n\nThe writing is intelligent, the themes well handled, and the emotions authentic. \nThe film can be thought of as a bit uneven, in that the first half is so extremely well done, that anything following it is necessarily hard to replicate. Still, it represents one of the finest films of 2015.\n\n4.5/5 Stars",

Usually, I want no part of children in leading (or supporting roles), but this was not the case.\n\nThe direction from Lenny Abrahamson is exquisite with views from multiple perspectives.  The music blends really well with all the tense moments, which there are tons of throughout the film.  \n\nWhat I really appreciated though was the connection that builds to the characters.

            "content": "Based on Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name, Room showcases the intense bond between mother and child, illustrated through an inspiring and hopeful tale of survival and courage.\n\nThe film opens with Jack, played by Jacob Tremblay, celebrating his fifth birthday with mother Joy, played by Brie Larson. We soon discover that their location has been the same since his birth, a 10\u00d710 ft. garden shed with an electronically locked door and a skylight as the only window. Larson's character has been held captive there for the past seven years, after being tricked and abducted by \"Old Nick\" while walking home from school.\n\nTogether, Jack and Joy spend every day creating the best life their situation affords. Jack names and speaks to inanimate objects around the room, as well as the occasional rodent or insect. Although they have a television and limited cable, Jack only understands what the shows depict as being in a separate \"TV world,\" due to having absolutely no contact with anything or anyone outside the shed. To him, \"Room\" is pretty much all that is real.\n\nJoy comes to terms with the fact that she cannot allow her son to continue the life they've endured and hatches a plan to free him by faking his death. As he's being driven to a burial site, Jack escapes Old Nick's truck and, despite the utter shock at seeing the world outside, manages to give the police enough information to find and free his mother.\n\nHaving lost the last seven years of her life, Joy must now begin the struggle of recuperating, while somehow finding a way to help a significantly under-developed son assimilate into the real world.\n\nPart of the film's strength is its ability to indirectly inform the audience as to Jack and Joy's situation. This helps create a dark and perilous atmosphere throughout the first half of the movie without venturing too close to being outright disturbing, which would discourage more faint-hearted viewers. For instance, Jack's father is Old Nick, a result of his nightly visits to rape and abuse his mother. This is found out not through graphic scenes of brutality, but rather is revealed through reasonable deduction. Joy puts Jack to bed in a closed wardrobe shortly before Nick's arrival every night. He is told strictly not to come out until she returns and instead only hears what goes on between them in the other bed.\n\nAt the center of this survival story is hope. This is where Larson earned her Academy Award nomination and win for Best Actress. Despite the peril of her situation and the possibility of never escaping her torture and giving her son the life she desires for him, Joy never gives up. She tries to be kind to her abuser so he will continue bringing food and random gifts for her son. She reads Jack complex novels and explains cartoons like Dora the Explora to help him learn language skills. When Old Nick visits in the night to force himself on her, she doesn't resist so that what Jack does hear, and perhaps see, will not confuse or frighten him. She repeatedly combats emotional fragility with strength and forgiveness for the sake of her son.\n\nLike fellow Best Picture nominees, The Martian and The Revenant, this film highlights the triumph of the human spirit. While Joy doesn't survive a vicious grizzly bear attack or being left to die on Mars, her struggle is just as admirable. The most virtuous and most despicable aspects of humanity each have their turn to shine in this film, but it's the hope that Joy grasps so tightly that ultimately puts her in the position to make a better life for herself and her son.",

This is exactly what the movie portrays! Room was adapted from the book \"Room\" written by Emma Donaghue and it's the story about a young mom (played by Brie Larson) and her son, Jack, (played by Jacob Tremblay) who are captive in this Room. I will not go into detail of how the movie progresses but it's not as depressing as it sounds. The movie ends on a good note. What is so brilliant about the film in terms of the technical aspect is the camera work! The cinematographer, Danny Cohen, shot most of the movie from the perspective of the child and how he perceives the world or what situations are happening around him. You get a look of what it's like to be five again. The time when we were innocent, curious, inquired about everything, and never knew what was actually happening. You start feeling a bit nostalgic back when you were five, when everything around you was magical and optimistic. The acting in this movie was brilliant and Brie Larson's performance for best actress was well rewarded. The complex emotions she had to go through were convincing and well worth the praise. Room is great for a character drama but it does lack replay value as this is a heavy movie to swallow. I wouldn't mind seeing it again with someone who has not seen it.

            "content": "Director Lenny Abrahamson's Room plays like a non-science-fiction version of The Matrix. Like the Wachowskis' action landmark, we're introduced to its characters in an \"unreal\" world before they're able to escape and discover (or rediscover) what's real. Obviously, the two films vary in big ways - particularly when it comes to the mechanism that drives this shift from unreal to real - but the idea that reality works better in your head than it does in practice is something that drives both films. It made The Matrix one of the most thought-provoking action films of all time. And it makes Room one of the most emotionally grueling moviegoing experiences of 2015.\n\nIt all works in Room because it's told from the point of view of a five-year-old boy who doesn't know the \"real world\" exists. Neo Jack (Jacob Tremblay) was born in \"Room,\" which is nothing more than a shed converted into very meager living quarters where a man we come to know as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) has kept Joy (Brie Larson) as his sex slave for seven years. (Jack was born after the first two.)\n\nJoy has told Jack stories that Room is the whole world and outside is the planets and heaven, but when a mouse disrupts their daily routine, she realizes she can't keep her growing boy in the dark forever, and why would she want to? It's time to get Jack out - to let him see the sun, breathe fresh air, meet his grandparents (Joan Allen and William H. Macy), and grow up like a normal young boy.\n\nThe film's two halves couldn't be more different. The dividing point is a sequence defined by extraordinary tension - something even readers of Emma Donoghue's novel will experience thanks to Abrahamson's eye-opening directorial skill. Before this sequence, it's a story about an awful reality that our two protagonists have defined in such a way that helps them survive it psychologically. After the sequence, it's more about living in the moment and how hard that can be when their imaginations kept them going for so long.\n\nThe problem with the film - and it's a minor one - is that the story feels extremely self-contained. Room washes over you, and while it involves you emotionally, there's not much after the credits begin to roll. Sure, you'll linger on the clever production design, lovely score, and especially, the magnificent performances from its actors, but those looking for intellectual meat to chew on will leave Room hungry.\n\nLet's talk about those performances, though, because Brie Larson, in case you hadn't noticed from films like 21 Jump Street and Short Term 12, is quite the actress. Room will likely win her an Oscar in a few weeks, and it's a tough acknowledgment to argue with. She runs the emotional gamut, from impossibly resilient to completely withered. She completely puts herself out there without ever dipping into transparent manipulation. It's a thing of beauty.\n\nJacob Tremblay is remarkably her equal throughout, giving one of the finest performances from a child actor or actress in recent memory. Jack is our window into this world even more than Joy is, and so Tremblay's excellence is absolutely vital to the film's success. Joan Allen's lovely work as Joy's mother doesn't make or break the film, but it's wonderful to see her imbue an arguably under-written character with depth and real humanity.\n\nAbrahamson and his crew, I'd argue, make the best version of Room possible. It's a film that wears its heart on its sleeve, and while it will never escape some of the cinematic limitations of its scenario, it also embraces them without pandering or - hey, The Revenant! - devolving into misery for misery's sake.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/room-review/",

            "content": "This is an excellent movie with some pretty damn amazing central performances.  I know Brie Larson won the Oscar for Best Actress, but, I thought, that Jacob Tremblay pretty much stole the show, to me.  And that's not taking absolutely anything away from Brie Larson, who did a fantastic job at balancing the reality, and desperation, of her situation versus her attempts to keep some sort of normalcy for her son, whose entire life has been spent in this shed without any actual interaction in the real world.  Her body language in how she tries to hide her frustration to make it so that everything is fine is excellent and a testament to Brie's dedication to her role.  But, like I said, Jacob pretty much steals the show here.  The film, while featuring some really disturbing elements and a story that's a little too close to reality, also does feature some really beautiful moments.  The relationship between Jack and his Ma, as he always refers to her, is definitely rocky, particularly once they are saved from the shed that's been Ma's \"home' for seven years and Jack's \"home\" for his entire life.  It's interesting to see how, at first, Jack views his shed as anything and everything in his life and how, he feels, that everything that comes from his TV is fictional.  And, obviously, that's his mother's influence on him as that kept his curiosity to explore the outside world at bay.  During certain scenes there's also some narration from Jack into how he sees the world and those are actually really well done, because it does provide some input into how he views the world from when he's inside the shed and, later on, when he's out of it and actually part of the 'real world' as it were.  The 'real world' parts of the film are also really strong and well done.  It's interesting to see how Ma sort adjusts to all of the changes in her life, from her parents divorcing, to her mother remarrying and her father movie away, much more poorly than Jack adjusts to them.  Interesting considering that everything that Jack experiences out of the shed is the first time he's ever seen many of the things he once thought were fictional.  Brie's character mental breakdown is fairly understandable given the circumstances, but she also starts to push those who love her the most away, even her son, who's learning to function without her but also needs and loves her more than anyone.  But, again, the film finds beauty in this story, even if it can get ugly and dark at times.  Before the film ends with Jack and Ma going back to the shed for closure, there's this really sweet and touching montage of Ma and Jack finally getting back on the right path.  It might be seen as corny to some, but I felt it was earned given everything that the characters had been through on their journey.  So, yes, this movie was pretty excellent.  I forgot to mention the writing, but it was pretty fantastic all things considered.  Without that writing, the actors couldn't have shone the way they did.  It really is a rewarding film to watch.  The fantastic acting from both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay is worth the admission alone, but the story will definitely hold your attention.  Highly recommended film right here.",

Taking directly from the headlines, the entire premise seems plausible, but the characters fail to become real or believable. The one high point of both the acting and the story in the young boy, who becomes the central figure of the film and the most interesting ethical issue of the film. It raises the difficult issue of raising a child conceived of a rape and how society views such a child. I really wish that a better director had tackled this material, because there is a lot of meat left on the bone, but ultimately, after I departed the theater having watched \"Room\" I was still unsatisfied and hungry  for something more.",

It is the most difficult to watch and emotionally powerful movie I've ever seen -  a film that will leave you in a very fragile state.

            "content": "And exceptionally popular being for crimes villains and horror movies young woman kidnapped by a madman and kept in prison in a small, windowless room. Inevitably the dominant thread of the story is to extricate the victim from that room and the complete control of her kidnapper. In almost every instance shortly after freedom is an attained the end credits roll as the dramatic situation has been resolved. Was exceedingly rare story that considers the psychological changes that former victim must face in getting used to a world but haven't seen in years. The latest film one of independent cinemas rising filmmakers, Lenny Abrahamson, addresses that issue spectacular style. This Dublin born director has been making a splash of the festival circuit over a decade now although in that time is only released a handful of movies being far more concerned with exceptional quality rather than quantity. His latest film 'Room', screenplay by Emma Donoghue was based on the novel by the same name. Last night of the 88th annual Academy Awards ceremony the film had been nominated for best picture of the nominations going to Mr. Abrahamson for his direction and Ms. Donoghue best adapted screenplay. The film did receive one major win last night, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, by Brie Larson. There's incredible captivating quality about this film the hold your attention throughout. The film begins, as pointed out, in such a typical fashion the drawer initially lulled into a false sense of familiarity. But even from my point the most crucial theme in the story remains one of the most powerful expressions of love and emotional involvement, the bond between a mother and her son. It takes the foundation of so many horror films the changes the pattern of the tapestry it weaves one of the most endearing and emotionally powerful movies you're likely ever to see.\n\nIt is been many years since Joy (Brie Larson) at even thought of herself by that name. She is now Ma, a captive of a man known only as Old Nick (Sean Bridgers). During the long years of captivity joy has been repeatedly raped and abused five years earlier she gave birth to her son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay). The extent of their world is the claustrophobic shed with the only source of light looking down at a bed, toilet old television set. Whenever Old Nick is in the mood he places the boy in a wardrobe, at least bearing the young boy having to watch his mother being sexually abused. Jack has only known the interior of the room, from his perspective is the entire extent of reality. The rest of the world is just the images seen on the television. In some ways this is a macabre interpretation of Plato's cave. In every story there is to be a pivotal moment, a spark that upsets status quote intensifying the dramatic circumstances. This occurs when Old Nick tells Joy that he has lost his job and no longer has the means to supply the provisions. Joy is faced with the very real possibility that Nick will either kill them out right or worse just leave them locked in their to starve to death. She has Jack feign a fever hoping that Old Nick would take Jack to hospital. Instead he said that he would go out for the antibiotics himself. Desperate joy wraps her son in a carpet instructing Jack to play dead. Old Nick falls for the ruse and places the wrapped up boy in his pickup. As they drive through a residential area Jack manages to free himself from the carpet and escape. Get the attention of somebody and soon the police are on the scene.\n\nEmotional impact of this film is reinforced by how freedom affects both mother and child. For joy so many elements of her previous life have been drastically changed. The parents have divorced and her mother, Nancy (Joan Allen) is now living with a man named Leo (Tom McCamus). Her father, Robert (William H. Macy) is on willing to accept Jack, sired as he was by a criminal and leaves rather than have anything to do with the boy. The manner in which the psychological state of the boy is depicted is amazingly textured with nuances carefully infused in most every scene. Jack is considered to be drawn only speaking to his mother. This because for his entire life she was the only one who would engage in any meaningful conversation, the only source of lovingkindness he has ever known. Much of the shock of most, Jack wants to return to Room, although it was a source of pain and hardship is the only place he has ever known.\n\nIn all the stories rare the end comes right after the escape the audience is never permitted to see the difficulty faced by joy as she must re-assimilate the life outside Room. For Jack his entire sense of reality has been pulled out from under him. It is reminiscent of that moment in 'Wizard of Oz' when Dorothy opens the world moves from black-and-white into Technicolor. As well written as the story is what really captures the essence of these changes is the performance by Jacob Tremblay. For one so young and was previous acting experience have been in lighthearted family comedies, considerable, albeit nascent talent is given a solid showcase with an exceptionally demanding role, particularly for one so young. He so embodies the character of Jack that as you watch will become completely enveloped in the performance. For a couple of hours you forget that this is a young actor playing the role of an abused victim and accept them as Jack, a boy was able to rise above his fear and become instrumental in saving both himself and his mother.\n\nMs. Larson has previously appeared in several sitcoms on television and just prior to this film opposite comedienne Amy Schumer in her raunchy romantic comedy, 'Train Wreck'. Once you watch her performance in this movie you will see why she so well-deserved to take home that the statute. This could very easily have been structured more like a Lifetime Movie focusing on Joy's sacrifices for her son. The emotional intensity sustained by this movie stems from of embodiment of a mother's love and the maternal instinct to sacrifice everything just to make sure her son is safe. One of the most forceful emotional scenes that Ms. Larson has his towards the end of the film when she taps into some of the inevitable psychological damage a character as accumulated over the years. It is difficult for her to accept the changes, not only from being outside of Room but in facing the immutable fact that the memories she held onto about her family are gone. Of reality has been rewritten relationship she had held onto for so long has evaporated. The brilliance of all involved in this film has taken a hack the premise from horror and turned it into one of the most remarkable examinations of human spirit and the strength that love brings people. This is a film you will want repeatedly just to appreciate the sheer artistry it manifests.",

            "content": "Lenny Abrahamson's Room is poignant. Room is evocative. Room is devastatingly beautiful. There is a magic in creating a world in a child's perspective. To capture and display the innocence, the purity, the sheer amount of confusing vastness of the world is no mean feat. Writer Emma Donoghue, who is also the writer of the book that the film is based upon, and director Lenny Abrahamson manage to do just that.\n\nThe film starts with the pair of mother and son, Joy and Jack, played by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay living their lives while scrapping for resources yet finding solace in each other's company, in a room. That is right. In a single room (which later revealed to be a garden shed with a skylight as the only source of sun). The reason behind this ordeal revealed to be that Joy had been abducted by person referred only as 'Old Nick'. Old Nick kept Joy and Jack, who is his biological son, sans any means of communication with the outside world and had them live a life devoid of any hope to go back to the world. \n\nWithout revealing much about what happens next in the film, it can be said that what follows is one of the heart-wrenching and heart-warming story about love, innocence and those little joys of the world that we often overlook. There is a slight tonal shift in the second half as the tension of escape and sweetness of the love between mother and son gets replaced with Joy facing the reality of the world. But the change is in coherence with the story and that helped in underlining the difficulty both protagonists, especially Joy, is facing in their new world. Even without reading the book, I must say that the screenplay immensely helped in establishing the dichotomy of the emotions that the protagonists went through. Lenny Abrahamson's direction complemented that aforementioned dichotomy. The first act was shot quite meticulously in the closed room, thus providing a sense of foreboding and an urge for escape. \n\nAlthough bolstered by a good support cast the film largely centers around the mother, played by Brie Larson and the son, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson, whose hitherto best performance perhaps had been in the largely underrated 2013 film Short Term 12, churned out a superlative and breathtaking performance as the mother. The role was a delight for an actor of her capability and she made the character her own. Restrained and gritty while being captive in the room and yet lovingly playing with her son; Vulnerable and fragile, being captive of her own thoughts and insecurities, while trying to get her son attuned to the big world; Brie Larson shines throughout her role. \n\nBut, the film would not have been so pure, so emotional, so magical without the brilliant performance of Jacob Tremblay, as the 5 year old. It is one of the finest performances from a child I have ever seen. The fear of the task her mother asked, then the taste of freedom, then again the intimidation of the vast world that had hitherto been unknown to him. We feel everything through the wondrous performance of Jacob Tremblay and he genuinely smiled in the film when seeing a 'real' dog for the first time, it becomes difficult to hold tears back. \n\nAt this point, it would not be fair if Stephen Rennick's score is not mentioned. The music, with the appropriate usage, bolstered the scenes and helped the film in taking the audience for the ride. \n\nRoom is a film that would provide its audiences a perspective that we often ignore; and for this very reason it is a film that should not be missed.",

It's a great character driven movie about a mother and son, nothing very conventional or cliche...just very real performances about two people in a very horrible situation, and the aftermath of that situation. So I think this film was great, you should see it, don't read ahead if you want to go in with little info as I did, I think it helped the experience. Spoilers then, it is a film about a woman who is being held captive by a man, and her son who is the product of the rape this man routinely performs on her.  The kid turns five, and she finally begins to tell him that there is an outside world beyond the shed they are in, and not long after they are able to escape...and the next half of the movie is essentially the aftermath. The kid goes from believing the entire world is a small shed, to having his entire perception changed and challenged...while the mother is forced to deal with the reality of what happened to her, and how she can deal with her parents. The film is almost entirely from the kid's perspective.  The way he sees things. It is a great character drama, told really well...and it just hooked me in. The escape sequence had me at the edge of my seat and I was almost trembling because of it. Rare for me to get this emotionally invested in a film these days. high quality filmmaking!",

But in 2015, director Lenny Abrahamson gave audiences a drama that modernizes Plato\u00b4s Allegory, and it became one of the most critically acclaimed films of its year. Does it deserves the acclaim it got?\nJoy Newsome is a young woman who is trapped inside a small soundproof room. Inside this room she gives birth a boy who she names Jack. Being born inside this room, Jack is unaware of the world, he believes that the room is the whole world, but Joy know that's not healthy and tries to correct the situation. \nThe idea of making a modern drama inspired by Plato\u00b4s work is inspiring and daring, so I was more than curious to see what the finished result of this experiment was and I will admit that I hadn't been so surprised by a film in a long time. \"Room\" counts with an impressive performance by Brie Larson that undeniably deserves an Academy Award, Abrahamson\u00b4s directing is so subtle and minimalist that you almost let go the brilliance of his use of perspective, the overall idea of having the child be our point of view is daring, beautiful and intriguing; the screenplay is extremely well written and wisely knows where to focus on, the score is minimalistic but it is used appropriately and it manages to add felling to the scenes it's in, the storytelling relies completely into the visuals, despite the use of numerous voiceovers; the themes are heartbreaking and inspiring, the balance of tone is perfect as it can go from cute and inspiring to harsh and dark, and it has one of the most impressive child actors I have ever seen. \n\"Room\" is one of the most intriguing, inspiring and creative indie films I have seen in a long time. It truly shows the magic of simplicity and how magical a story can be. Compared to all the films I have seen from the solid/impressive year that 2015 was, I dare say that \"Room\" is my favorite (followed by \"Mad Max: Fury Road\", \"Inside Out\", and \"The Force Awakens\").",

Trauma is distant to most of us But as I found out when my when friend was murdered by terrorists, that approach is ultimately of no use; sometimes the worst case happens, the unthinkable becomes your daily concern, the unimaginable your lived experience. \n\nThis is the territory we are in with Room, the film adaptation of Emma Donoghue's  massively successful novel (an adaption written by the novelist). I had little knowledge of the book personally, but the film-makers want us to be in no doubt as to where this film goes - the bare facts make this a hard sell. It's the story of a young woman (faultlessly played by Brie Larson) confined in one room for seven years where she's repeatedly raped by her captor; she inhabits the room with her five-year old son to whom she gave birth in the room as a result of the rapes. Jack's world is the world in four walls; it's all he's ever known, all he's ever seen save for what he sees through the single window in the form of a skylight and the television. This is a child's eye view film; it is through him we perceive the abuse which we never see; it's through him we learn of his mother past life on the outside; it's with him that we eventually journey to the outside world in the film's final third. \n\nJack's mum has helped him create a fantastical world within the four walls of his existence; around his fifth birthday she tries to explain the outside world to him. He's disbelieving, but gradually grasps towards something resembling truth. When he attempts to affect their escape he's just about aware enough to cope with the revelation that there are other people and animals and places. \n\nWe know there are real-world equivalents to this fictional story, but still this film is trying to imagine the unimaginable. By all rights it should be inadequate or trite or tasteless or just plain unbelievable. In trying to make a film that isn't a thriller or a drama or comedy but instead a hymn to love and relationships, the film-makers should be falling flat on their faces. Instead they've given us a genuinely unforgettable, overwhelming and transcendent film that helps us rediscover ourselves, our loved ones and the world around us. It finds beauty in the desperately ordinary thanks to some remarkable cinematography that makes the small room both a place of captivity and a universe to discover; the relationships are perfectly drawn and life-affirming thanks to Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's (the son, Jack) achingly beautiful performances. The depths of their relationship are unfathomable yet also utterly recognisable to anyone who has ever loved. The startlingly brilliant music haunts, prods, pushes and finally engulfs. We never see the rape or abuse take place, but we're left in no doubt as to its reality, its inescapability. Yet we're never without hope or beauty, and ultimately the film lets us and the characters find life in new, beautiful and subtle ways. \n\nThere's much to say about Room, but at the end of the day there's little I can properly articulate. I can think of maybe one other film (Pan's Labyrinth  - in many ways very different, in others very similar) that has come close to making me feel as moved, alive, tearful and full of wonder as this one. It's a rare work of art that leaves you speechless yet desperate to talk, but Room is one of them.",

None of which should imply that the main entree here is not the brilliantly intertwined performances of Ms. Larson and Jacob Tremblay. None of this would have held together if not for the incredible intimacy they achieve as a mother and son bonded by extraordinarily demanding circumstance.  Indeed, the only interruption of my complete absorption was from occasionally remembering the gobsmacking inexplicability of this exciting new artist's snubbing by the Academy.  In a year of supporting actor nominations lackluster enough to make Sylvester Stallone, of all people, the favorite to win, the omission of this young man's astonishing work  is beyond ridiculous.",

I became irritated by the premise that the mother so isolated the boy from the world, and that she could not wipe out the monster doing this to them in the seven years preceding the opening of the film.  I tend to be a bit claustrophobic, and that may well have affected my enjoyment of the film.  It was effective in triggering feelings of claustrophobia, although inducing that particular feeling isn't terribly difficult.  The film would have been far more effective if the reveal had been cleverly hidden long enough to make a horrible, heart-wrenching twist near the end.  \n*\nPLOT HOLES -- SPOILERS AHEAD:  \nLots of problems.  No one noticed this guy in the neighborhood going out to an AIR CONDITIONED SHED all the time?  For seven years?  Really?  I find it hard to believe that no one noticed the major plot hole that the hinges of the door were on the inside, and the door could simply have been removed by removing the pins from the hinges.  The rug plan was just silly.  Why not simply throw a pot of boiling water on the douche when he comes in?   What's he going to do, block it?  Then beat him to death with the pot.  Also, why didn't she make a break for it when the guy was carrying out the rug?  I don't buy the cop putting the location together so quickly on what she had.  The mom adjusted too quickly to bring free.  She would have been a basket case.  How about a female doctor, or at least not a male psychiatrist with a beard?  None of this was considered.  Additionally, there would be enormous assistance/intrusion from state services to make sure the mother was capable of taking care of the child and was psychologically competent.  They would never let the boy stay with Leo, not a relative, and living  unmarried with the grandmother.  Leaving him alone with him that quickly would never be allowed.  A little research would have revealed all of this.  Finally,  the filmmaker is an asshole for putting a veteran plate on the monster's car.",

The theme of the film has to do with what we take for granted -- how much of interest and value exist in a single microsphere.

            "content": "Room is a movie of raw emotionality and, at times, genuine magic. Owing much to the infamous Joseph Fritzl case, the story opens in the eponymous location, and immediately introduces us to the characters we will see grow and evolve, not just out of their secluded prison, but into their new lives. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are perfectly cast, inhabiting their respective roles with complete dedication and believability. They react to each other very realistically, and the films highlights are when the mother tries to explain to her son the concept of the real world he has never had the chance to see. We stay in Room for close to 50 minutes. A wise decision, since it gives us a glimpse of what it must be like to live a life of intense, grindingly monotonous claustrophobia. An especially beautiful scene is when the boy looks up at the naked sky for the first ever time, and is frozen in wonderment. The main issues with the movie occur, ironically, once they've escaped Room. From there we are forced to go through the classic PTSD rigmarole which, while sensitively done, seems somewhat sanitised, with both characters adapting to the outside world surprisingly fast, considering how long they were locked up. Larson deserves acclaim for her performance, but I can't shake the feeling that she received so many accolades because of the character she plays, not how she played it. On screen portrayals of trauma, if done well, are always popular when awards season rolls round. With that said, I would still strongly recommend this film. It's uplifting when it needs to be and deeply emotional when it has to be, but never makes the mistake of descending into melodrama. See it for the performances, the drama and it's take on the outside world, as seen through the bright eyes of a na\u00efve but incredibly brave child.",

            "content": "So the room stars Brie Larson and breakout soon to be mega star Jacob Tremblay as a mother and son who are imprisoned in a tiny room. To the mother the room is a living hell which he does her best to cope with each day. To her son, who was born in there, Room is all he knows, it is his entire world, and he has no knowledge of the world outside. \n\nNow it's going to be difficult to review this movie without giving away a few minor spoilers (I say minor as we're not going to give away anything that you wouldn't have seen in the trailers), but here we go. It is very much a movie of two halves, the first half inside room and second half (minor spoiler) outside room. Though both are filled with directly opposed experiences of both mother and son throughout. \n\nSo the first half depicts life inside room. And instead of doing the expected lazy montage which we have become accustomed to in so many films, room takes its time to show you the day to day lives of the two characters, in a slow and subtle way but without ever making you feel bored or that the movie is slow. Each day presents a different challenge for the mother and a new form of entertainment for the son. And each day really does feel different- an amazing accomplishment when you consider the tiny size of room. \n\nThis is then juxtaposed by the second half of the film which takes place outside. Of course not spoilers as to how or why they are out of room. But once out, again the two characters find themselves dealing with very different realities. Brie Larson having to somehow piece her life back together after 7 years, while coping with depression and post-traumatic stress, Jacob Tremblay trying to acknowledge the new world and people that exist within, but ultimately missing his more simple life back in room. \n\nThe acting in this movie is some of the finest you'll see, Brie Larson, deserving of her Oscar nomination and Jacob Tremblay is a revelation, with a long career ahead of him - the finest child actor since DiCaprio in what's eating Gilbert Grape. \n\nThe cinematography is exceptional, and evolves throughout the course of the movie, beginning with close up shots and a high depth of field to show the claustrophobic nature of room, and gradually changing to wider shots to convey the helpless sense of space that Jacob Tremblay feels on the outside.\n\nIn conclusion, I find it difficult to find fault in room. It is without question one of the best films I have seen for years. As you may know I'm a believer that there are very few \"perfect\" films, where everything single frame is conducive to advancing the story, and not a line is wasted. I really looked and thought as I was watching that I would take points off in the second half for a slowed down pace. But the change of pace was for a very powerful reason that I won't spoil now. Get ready coz you are unlikely to see me do this again for a long time, but I refuse to give Room anything less than a 10/10. It is a flawless masterpiece, and a crowning achievement in cinema, the sort of film you feel privileged to have watched. It is that good!",

            "content": "Discovering a whole new world beyond the 4 walls.\n\nWe all know the German folk tale 'Rupanzel', and this is a similar kind with entirely different motive. All the above it is not a fairy tale set in the medieval period, but inspired by many real events of the present era. A couple of years ago I saw a German movie called '3096 Days' based on the true story. When I heard of this movie is being made, at first obviously I remembered that title, but after seeing the poster alone convinced me not the same. Automatically the expectations rose, and now it's got the 4 Oscars nominees, including the best motion picture.\n\nThe both halves of the movie were entirely different from each other like the two sets of story, but the core of the theme remains same. The first half was a crucial part that takes place completely in a single room with a minimal cast. It does not go through the intro, just begins to tell the story like it's already happening and you might take a few minutes to realise the state of condition. The next half is a reaction to what happened in the previous. And again this is also an important storytelling section because like the title, it was not all about the room, but beyond that 4 walls and its roof and floor like how it affected the mother and son.\n\n\"If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.\"\n\nThe movie does not talk about the crime feature at all. Not even considered to reveal behind the motive. So the other side mystery remains as it is. The whole narration was one sided, everything was seen through the eyes of a five year old boy. He begins with the line 'Once upon a time...' like a fairy tale, because it is to him and with his cute little performance along with Brie Larson's, the movie briefs their struggle for freedom.\n\nIt was a too casual opening, like nothing bad is really happening, just they're weird people or maybe agoraphobia, except they're not. You know when we say we love to be kids again to escape this complicated adult life, sometimes we won't mean it except it was a normal reaction to the situation we're in. But what if a five year old boy wants to be four again when her mother thinks its time to him know what the real world looks like. Yeah, that's a too much to take in for a young boy, but that's the best chance they had to break free from the psycho who put her mother in that room.\n\n\"When I was small, I only knew small things.\nBut now I'm five, I know everything.\"\n\nIt was a tidy place, but the camera angles were impressive. I know it was shot in a studio with a wide open space behind the camera, but that does not the viewpoint in the actual story. When the first half ends, it is an indication of the good parts are over, at least that's what I thought of, but what came after was the unexpected expansion in narration. Usually most of the similar tales end in that part itself like for example 'Prisoners' and the rest is understandable stuff that won't be shown.\n\nWhen a tale had a ending like 'happily ever after', still some people desire for it to continue a few more minutes to know how happy really they are and that's what this film's second half.  Remember, most of the similar themes have multiple perspectives, like how victim's family is coping with, cops are pursuing the suspect, abductor's plans and motive, and captives struggle. Like I said it was all about what a mother and her son goes through those years in captivity and after that.\n\nThere were some suspicious characters and events like I had a bad feeling over the doctor's soft talking, also the mother-son's master plan when in captive. Those are tiny diversions to viewers assume differently against where the story is heading. It is all about the mother and son's mental trauma, especially for the little boy similar to when Tarzan is in a big town for the first time leaving behind his other life. It was a perfect pace as well, neither hurried nor a slow development. The movie was a big break for many, especially for the Irish director, and Brie Larson and of course for the kid. Definitely one of the finest movie of 2015 and a must watch.\n\n9/10",

            "content": "The opening scene of Room slyly reveals the single attribute that remains consistent to the very end of the film; its closeness. Inherently personal, director Lenny Abrahamson somehow manages to transform what should be a claustrophobic space into what is an almost comprehensible world of its own. This is of course a method in solidifying the point of view of Jack, the young child who was born and raised in a shed after his mother was kidnapped and held captive. The film is incredibly successful in translating Jack's sense of normalcy; Room is all he's ever known.\n\nOf course, this wouldn't have been achieved if it weren't for Jacob Tremblay, who gives what can only be described as an outstanding performance as Jack. Probably the most convincing acting I've seen from an 8 year-old. The rest of the cast are successful too, with Brie Larson (Jack's mother) and Joan Allen's (Jack's grandmother) searing performances being standouts.\n\nThe first half of the film is seriously intense. There is an inherent tension, sizzling between the innocently direct dialogue, that will have viewers emotionally invested in both the characters and the story. Room remains unapologetically suspenseful throughout, combining with its delve stating revelations to create a scathingly unsettling atmosphere. Everything is on the table during Jack and Ma's desperate attempt at survival. The same can be said for the second half of the film. When emotions are meant to heighten, the film stumbles and becomes emotionally stilted. Maybe its pale delivery was an attempt to make it more acceptably cinematic, more comfortable. I don't really know. What I do know is that the script holds back what it should have  propelled forward. There's sure to be more of an explosion of emotion from the audience, than the characters themselves.\n\nDespite the script's flaws, Lenny Abrahamson manages to portray these characters with sincerity, illuminating the toughest moments of this harrowing story. His efforts are reflected wholeheartedly in the ending scene, when Room is finally seen for what it truly is: not an endless world as previously portrayed, not the home Jack knew from the day he was born, but simply a sickeningly enclosed prison. This revelation, to Jack, and even his Ma, is enough of an achievement in itself to make it one of the worthiest films of recent.\n\nMore reviews at Deliberate (thisisdeliberate.com).",

The first hour of the film they're trapped in a shed trying to find a way to escape. In the second hour of the film they're out in the real world trying to adjust which turns out to be quite the challenge. Brie Larson is well deserving to win this year's Oscar for best actress. Joan Allen's performance as Jack's grandma and Joy's(Brie Larson's) mother is also quite loving. This is not a film for everyone especially if you're a parent with a really young child.

            "content": "In some respects, ROOM is an incredibly impressive film, one that contains a pair of absolutely unimpeachable central performances.  The movie begins with what can only be described as an unthinkably horrible situation, but this material never once comes across as exploitative in any way, nor does it ever approach conventional thriller territory, which would probably have been the easiest route given the subject matter.  Instead, we have a profoundly sensitive, humane story, and one that is deeply affecting on a number of levels.  Brie Larson does a remarkable job with an enormously difficult role; the level of emotional modulation she displays is striking, and she manages a very delicate and precise balancing act.  It is one of the great performances of 2015, without question.  She's joined by Jacob Tremblay, who gives one of the most winning and effective child performances I've ever seen; it's always unknown how much of a kid's performance is actual acting or the result of manipulation on the part of the director, but whatever the case is here, the result is totally convincing and real.  The movie's transition into its second half is deftly, beautifully handled by director Abrahamson, and the film never descends into histrionics, or emotional shocks for the sake of them.  I wanted to also call attention to the score by Stephen Rennicks, which is lovely and understated when necessary, but also swelling and uplifting when appropriate, and it underlines the proceedings in a wonderful way.  ROOM is not perfect - it's very much a character study, and once we reach the second half, the \"plot,\" so-to-speak, has already resolved itself, and though the second half contains some of the most emotional material, there's nothing in the way of a narrative drive - but it is a very powerful piece of work.",

If it were a young adult novel with fan following, studios would have teared the novel into at-least 2 movies so when one watches it, should remember that he is getting double the fun and why not, Room is a powerful movie with all the elements a blockbuster entertainer lacks these days.\n\nWe open our eyes to the screen and we are in a small room with two inhabitant. We spend a substantial amount of time in that tiny room but never we ever feel suffocated because of the freshness maintained by the director and drop dead performances by both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. One wonders if it is going to be a usual torture or survival movie but it is bigger then that. It is very much common that movies are taking a more realistic and social approach towards crises then that of only physical ones.\n\nRoom is based on a very strong idea and is made by a brilliant director. Performances are of worth watching. Brie Larson is magnificent, although much appreciation should be given to the casting director who opted for her, as most of the praise Brie is getting, is due to the persona she brought to the movie which is different then regular cry baby. And that was the decision of who ever casted her as they at that time gave the movie something other lacked. Jacob Tremblay is brilliant in his role and it's very disappointing to see that many of the award organizations have over looked his work. \n\nAlthough the script is very strong and to the point but the Jacob's escape from the room seemed little weaker. Second half of the movie was much inspired from Irwin Winkler's 'At First Sight' and Clind Eastwood's 'American Sniper. Brie's performance is very good but not as much as she is getting rewarded. As I explained, it's mainly her personality which brought something new into this genre of movie. Rest of the cast were good too. One last mention is for the art designer who worked on the interior of the room which kept us interested in it all the time we spent there.\n\nA work of art in the head of a blessed team.",

The music was surprising. It has been a long time since I have watch a film that was so rich and engaging that, upon first viewing, I was attached to the characters at once.

And at the same time, it isn't highbrow or overly complicated. \n\nRoom starts out in a padded room with a young boy, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), and his mother, Joy (Brie Larson), lying in a bed together. We're not sure why they're there at first. But eventually we figure things out. Joy was abducted 7 years prior and Jack is her son by her captor. \n\nJoy is a normal mother. She loves her son. She get's annoyed by him from time to time, just as a normal mother would. Everything is not hunky-dory, but the two of them are content there with each other. Or at least Jack is. You can sense, in Joy's eyes, that she is hiding pain. Jack doesn't know of anything that's happened. He knows of no world beyond those walls.\n\nIt's not until about 25 minutes in where we realize what's going on. But we don't mind because the journey there is just as riveting. The plot is revealed very slowly, as the filmmakers let us figure things out on our own, and do well not to spell things out for us. They don't assume the audience is stupid--at least those who are willing to commit to the storytelling. Nothing is ever stated, but we have a grasp on background and character dynamics due to brilliant exposition. \n\nRoom is slow, I admit, but consistent. Director, Lenny Abrahamson knows what he's doing at all times. Besides getting fantastic performances from his leads, I'm thrilled with every choice he makes. From what he includes to what he omits, he understands what's necessary for us to get as organic of an experience possible. This movie could very well be depressing, but it intentionally never stays in one place long enough to do so.\n\nLarson is something to behold in this film. She's pretty much gives as flawless of a performance that anyone possibly can. It's perhaps the best female performance I've ever seen. And Tremblay, for a child, is extremely believable the whole way through. \n\nThe film is ultimately about moving on. And that process can be long and drawn out and never-ending. There are times while watching this film when we ask ourselves how it will end. Not because we want it to, but because we're not even sure how any ending would be enough. But then we find out we're not looking for an ending at all, but a beginning.\n\nTwizard Rating: 100",

Led by incredible work from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, Room makes for an unforgettably harrowing -- and undeniably rewarding -- experience. This drama is as big as all outdoors in scope; poetic and profound in its exploration of the senses; blessed with two transcendent performances, by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay; and as elegantly wrought as any film that has come our way in a very long while. Amazingly - and this movie is amazing - Room is a story of hope, of possibility. Sure, your stomach will be in knots, your fingers clenched, your heart racing. But it will also fill that heart with a sense of the goodness, the courage, the enduring love that is out there to be discovered - and to be held onto with the fierceness of life itself. Director Lenny Abrahamson seamlessly translates Donoghue's work into cinematic terms with his relentlessly compelling adaptation. However, the drama owes just as much to its two stars, Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob Tremblay, whose textured performances turn outrageous circumstances into a tense and surprisingly credible survival tale. Room is simply a movie about mother and son trying to adapt to the outside world after years of forced captivity. And the surprise is how succinctly it captures this drastic life change from the perspective of five-year-old. \n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

It can take you to \"A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far, Far Away\", or it can take you to visit the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" or, sometimes - if you are very lucky - it will take you to ROOM.\n\nDirected by Lenny Abrahamson, ROOM tells the story of \"Ma\" (Brie Larson) who, as the movie begins, has been held hostage for 7 years in a windowless 10x10 enclosure.  She has dubbed this enclosure \"ROOM\" for the benefit of her 5 year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay) who is held imprisoned with her.  The first half of the movie takes place entirely in this enclosure where Ma has helped create a world for Jack.  It is very much Ma taking care of Jack.  The second half of the movie takes place \"afterward\" (I will not spoil anything here).\n\nMs. Larson, in her Oscar nominated role, is fantastic as Ma, imbuing her character with the right combination of strength and weakness of one imprisoned for so long, but you can see the love she has for her son and that she will do anything to protect him.  While the first half of the movie is worthy of her Oscar nomination (and Oscar frontrunner status), it is the realistic affects to Ma (who we find out is named, ironically, Joy) during \"afterwards\" that really cement the role.  We don't see a \"superwoman\" here, we see a real person dealing with a traumatic event and it's aftermath.  She is ably assisted by strong turns by Joan Allen and William H. Macy as her parents, as well as Tom McCamus as \"Leo\".\n\nThe surprise for me is how strong a performance 9 year old Jacob Tremblay gave as 5 year old Jack.  While Larson, rightfully so, is receiving critical acclaim, I am surprised that Tremblay isn't receiving more.  Larson is the rock of the first half of the movie, but  it is Tremblay who holds the 2nd half of the movie together.  Jack's warm and loving soul radiates throughout the back half and keeps things together when it looks like things are falling apart.\n\nDirector Abrahamson gives a strong hand to the proceedings, having us focus on just what we need to focus on without it becoming too depressing, maudlin or sappy.  He knows when to pull in and when to pull out and has you rooting for these characters from the start.\n\nThis movie is not for everyone and I am sure that more than 1 person will have a tough time making it all the way through it (I had a strong desire to go home and hug my family afterward, much to my son's chagrin).  I was warmed by the strong love of mother and son and how it takes a subject that could have been a downer and has made it heartwarming and life affirming.\n\n4 (out of 5) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",

            "content": "Kidnapped at fourteen and locked up in a room for seven years with a five year old child conceived through violence, director Lenny Abrahamson's film inspired by Emma Donoghue's novel of the same name - a composite of true events - is titled ROOM; a delicate and harrowing story of two people caught in a private space, where they live a life of extreme tenderness and tension.  The actors are excellent, Brie Larson as Ma and Jacob Tremblay as Jack create a home/neighborhood/community/country  inside a small, cluttered \"room\" with occasional shafts of light beaming down from a skylight that displays the stars and moving clouds - the outside \"world\" a dream beyond their reach.\n\n A television sputtering on the blink allows that other \"world\" entry, but for young Jack, what he sees flickering on the screen is both real and \"make believe\" ; distinctions have been erased and are unknowable. The relationship between mother and child is stunning - the  connection between them is acutely poignant, as if the umbilical cord had never been severed. Days are spent exercising, running back and forth- sharp turns are necessary after a few steps, making us aware of the claustrophobic feel of the space; and Ma's attempt to teach her son to read and maintain a somewhat \"normal\" existence is impressive and heart-rending. Jack's poetic and descriptive use of words to describe his circumscribed environment invokes the originality and charm of expressing and interpreting  what we see and feel through language tailored to one's unique cosmos. We also witness the chilling visits of \"Old Nick\" her captor whose step on the stairs on his way to the \"room\" is a sign for little Jack to hide and feign sleep behind a shuttered closet door - the presence of \"evil\" glimpsed through cracks in the battered and weatherworn slats.\n\nWhen Jack turns five his mother decides he is old enough to participate in an escape plan involving resilience and courage which eventually succeeds. Mother and child are hospitalized and the second half of ROOM begins. How to acclimate one's self to being separate individuals, after the powerful link between them is sundered - a tie which was both nourishing and restrictive? Accommodation to \"freedom\" begins, and the aching awareness of the familiar becoming unfamiliar, as well as the unfamiliar becoming familiar, are daunting and formidable.\n\n\nROOM is an exquisitely fragile story of the pliancy of the human resolve to survive and adapt to suffocating circumstances and adjust to the shock of change after flight and rescue. A child's ability to embrace the magic of his new environs - as one Dr. mentioned in examining Jack, \"he is still plastic\"; and an adult's more complex road to acclimatization which includes grieving the loss of a singular bond where the \"other\" completes you to the exclusion of everyone else.",

            "content": "Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay really carry this movie as mother and son who are imprisoned in a garden shed for seven (and five) years (respectively). Joy's days are spent creating as normal of a childhood as she can for her son Jack - full of daydreams and exercise and crafts - so that at night when Old Nick comes for his conjugal visit, Jack would never think that hiding in the wardrobe is out of the ordinary. Now that he has turned five years old, Joy deems him old enough to learn the truth and plan their escape. \n\nAnd what a riveting escape it is. I've laughed at movies, cried at movies, jumped out of my seat and yelped at movies, but never has my heart raced so fast at a movie as when Jack struggles to disentangle himself from the carpet and scrabbles out of this moving, rumbling behemoth into a loud, populated, alien world he has never seen, much less imagined before. \n\nNine-year-old Jacob Tremblay is so utterly natural as Jack, expressing shades of joy, anger, amusement, disgust, doubt, fear, and working that raggedy mop of hair to boot. My favorite moment is when Joy makes Jack repeatedly practice unrolling from the rug, and a disheveled, out-of-breath Jack tumbles out and spouts, \"I hate you!\" There is such power in his vehemence. Brie Larson is pretty dang good, infusing this young abuse victim with motherly patience and motherly ferocity, but I suppose she was good in an expected way. I expected a performance of this character to be this way, so I didn't see any surprising distinctions. In fact, the post-Room scenes with the reporter or fighting with her mom seem a bit inorganic, both in script and acting. There isn't enough nuance about Joy's PTSD; all the dialogue is too on-the-nose, so both Larson and Joan Allen end up just yelling in one note.\n\nThere are some weird must-happens in the story, of course. Old Nick must either be \"kind\" or dumb enough to not abuse his child begat from abuse, to not look inside the rug to confirm his child's death, to not wrestle his child back into the truck after his escape attempt, to not go home right away to punish his prisoner-wife. I mean, the audience probably wouldn't be able to handle more atrocity, but I wanted at least some background on what kind of abuser he is and what happens to him after the news broke. I know it's not his story, nor would a real life person like him deserve more consideration, but for a fictional character, he needs some grounding traits. What would compel the reporter to ask Joy why she didn't just have Old Nick take baby Jack to a hospital so that he may have a normal life? That would take an inordinate amount of trust in the abuser. And what if the rug were placed so that it would roll INTO the truckbed wall? And wouldn't Joy's friends have been affected by her disappearance and be interested/happy to know that she made it out alive?",

Brie Larson was also pretty damn incredible, and deserves all the awards that have been coming her way. My enjoyment of the film itself was a bit different for each of its two halves. I loved everything that took place inside of \"Room\", and all of the stuff that happened immediately afterward. Once they escaped into the real world (which I don't consider to be a spoiler, because that was shown very early in the trailer) it was still okay, but didn't compare to what had come beforehand.",

Through the camerawork, the audience is able to see how this world functions through the eyes of a naive young boy. With this, viewers are able to understand the innocence and confusion of seeing the world for the first time. The story of a kidnapped mother and her son may appear as a by-the-numbers thriller, but when the story provides fascinating characters, wonderful acting performances, and emotional depth that allows the time to rapidly fly as viewers become vastly engrossed within each character and their inner struggles, the film becomes one of the most unique films made in the past several years.

Words cannot fully describe the experience of watching this film as it is directed to perfection by Lenny Abrahamson who shoots the mundane world like a fairytale and it's a great reminder of how beautiful our world is and how often we take life for granted. The film stars Brie Larson as the mother named Joy, who was kidnapped at seventeen, routinely raped, and upon being impregnated, gave birth to a son she names, Jack, played by Jacob Tremblay in what may be the finest acting performance I've ever seen from a child! Larson is spellbinding with a very tough role to tackle, her range of emotions constantly changing due to her situation, and Tremblay matches her skills perfectly and he arguably had the tougher role having to convey the sense of wonder and discovery upon seeing the outside world for the first time. The first half of this film is infuriating, yet hopeful as you witness their day-to-day lives in \"Room\" and how their captor only stops by to drop off food and disgustingly rape the mother, but once they make their escape, the film switches tones and we get to see the inspirational side to the story as they begin to assimilate back into society. Once they're free we get great supporting work from Joan Allen and William H. Macy who play Joy's parents who finally get to reunite with their daughter after disappearing seven years prior and the resolution there I will not spoil, but it is heartbreaking. This film is beautiful, haunting, depressing, and uplifting with two flat-out AMAZING lead performances and flawless directing, though I'm not sure I ever need to watch it again, it is a film I will never forget.",

            "content": "A heartbreaking work of staggering genius set in a confined space, this harrowing ripped-from-the-headlines drama manages to give filmgoers the world through true acting and pure emotion. Dave Eggers' memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius gets namechecked above even though the author and Emma Donoghue, writer and screenwriter of this film and its celebrated source material (based very loosely on the long-term Ariel Castro kidnapping of two young women), share little in common so far as tone and content. In regards to Room, however, the words themselves just fit. Room's title, for instance, couldn't be more succinct and less hyperbolic. Like the setting itself, it boxes in our mind's eye at the outset, holding us as captive as the victims at its center. Just as with real estate, the success of a film sometimes comes down to location, location, location. This was never more the case for a cinematic work than with Room. The setting restricts our characters and us by proxy, but director Lenny Abrahamson smartly doesn't let us feel boxed in until it suits the story. The camerawork, performances, and dialogue pulls us into their postage stamp-sized home with a love and understanding that could conversely fill the universe...just before this 'world' drops out from everybody.\n\nIn this R-rated drama, five-year-old Jack (Tremblay) and his mother (Larson) escape from the enclosed surroundings that Jack has known his entire life, which causes the boy to make a thrilling discovery about life. \n\nWith graceful economy, Brie Larson conveys the courageous but depressive depth of a mother who knows that there's a whole world for her child to discover outside of four confining walls, but smartly chooses to keep this secret close to her chest for fear of his psychological undoing. Newcomer Tremblay, on the other hand, gives as good as he gets with this situation, electrifying audiences from the get-go. Their creativity and humanity in the face of shear evil makes for a powerful lesson that the film lays out with great but careful intelligence. Powerful in subject matter alone, the film could've gone astray when the world opens up to them, but director Lenny Abrahamson keeps focus on the engrossing performances, which compels all involved forward. Indeed, we're already so sympathetically invested in their journey that we feel the mother's gut-wrenching mental anguish when a reporter questions if her decision not to have her captor give Jack away as a baby was what was best for the child. Perhaps, Room's only weak point is the fact that the performances achieve such a level of perfection that the other aspects of the production can never equal that breathtaking excellence. Authentic to the last, no member of the cast speaks a false line or makes a wrong move, especially a mother and kid combo that defines flawless chemistry and provide filmgoer with the year's most uplifting story.  \n\nBottom line: Efficiency Compartment",

However, the direction of Lenny Abrahamson and writing of Emma Donoghue, in conjunction with breathtaking performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, make for a film so hauntingly beautiful that you'll forget how tragic it truly is. \nPossibly the most brilliant thing about Room is the way Abrahamson is able to make an inherently rotten situation seem so magical through the eyes of a child. Max lives in a single room and sleeps in a closet, a life so representative of Hell that the film goes as far as to name the person keeping him there 'Old Nick', another name for The Devil. However, Max's love for life reminds a cynical audience of the blissful ignorance of childhood, or maybe the ignorance of adulthood depending on your perspective. By focusing on Max, you almost forget about the horror of the situation you are watching and the inhumanity that is present. It is an incredible feat in filmmaking.\nHowever, Room is not perfect. In fact, Room is inherently flawed. It is a film that feels more like two films than one and subsequently leads to a very jarring experience for the viewer. The first half of Room is one of the best pieces of cinema ever made. It is sweet, subtle, layered, heart-warming, incredibly suspenseful and inherently terrifying. However, the following hour of film is... fine. It's definitely not bad and doesn't completely take away from the film, it just feels anti-climactic. We have an opening hour where the stakes are at their highest, the characters' lives are on the line and you feel like yours is too. However, what follows can only be described as therapy, as we watch many boring sequences of our protagonists dealing with the events of the first half of the film. It doesn't serve much of a purpose but to prolong the narrative, leaving the viewer feeling like they've seen what they came to see and now they're watching an hour of footage made solely for the purpose of making the film two hours long. \nOverall, Room is a special kind of film. You will love the first hour, it is one of the most delicately beautiful sequences of film you'll ever see. Everything after that is throwaway; but it's well-written, well-directed and well-acted throwaway, so at least you'll have that.",

But it's also the kind of experience that left me speechless, and a movie that I find so unforgettable. Something I hadn't felt maybe in a while.\n\nThe story of \"Room\" is about a relationship between Joy \"Ma\" Newsome (played by Brie Larson), and her five-year-old skeptical son named Jack Newsome (played by Jacob Tremblay). The first half of the film focused on Ma and Jack of where they're trapped inside of a 10-by-10 foot space garden shed, which they call it \"Room.\" What they've  been doing over there is making arts and crafts, baking deserts, playing games, watching TV, and a whole bunch more. But the one main thing that Ma was trying to do for herself is to keep Jack optimistic. She is saying many things to him that are so made up and it's all because she's trying to keep him happy, protected, and unafraid. Later in the film, Ma had decided that she and Jack are going to escape, but before that, she must tell him the truth about this place they're in, and that \"Old Nick\" (played by Sean Bridgers) is not who Jack thinks he is. He's actually the father of Jack, and the one who abducted Ma and put her in this shed for seven years.\n \nSo after they escaped, this leads us to the second half of the film of where Ma and Jack were recovered in the hospital. We then see that everything's different with Ma's parents. Jack's life starts to get really big when he makes a shocking discovery: the real world. Ma's life, on the other hand, is starting to shrink, meaning that she is feeling devastated. For someone like her who's been in that garden shed for seven years, that's hard to get through.\n\nYou know, I don't remember saying this to myself but I find the clips of \"Room\" more effective than the trailer. Watching the movie, however, is actually even better. Seeing that this is a movie about a relationship between Ma and her son Jack, and having him look up to the world for the first time, that's where things get very fascinating to me. The central relationship in this film is probably one of the best relationships I've ever seen so far. The way how director Lenny Abrahamson and screenwriter Emma Donoghue, (who wrote the novel), present the details to both the main story and the central relationship in a very raw, honest, and challenging manner. As far as the other things that the film goes on, such as Jack's imagination, I find them to be very convincing and believable.\n    \nThere are many reasons to why I really like Brie Larson's performance in \"Short Term 12.\" As for \"Room,\" I found her performance to be superior. For a character that has so much pain, so much misery, and so much care, Brie Larson delivers it, and I absolutely found her character to be very believable. The most remarkable thing I can say about Jacob Tremblay is not only that he is the most adorable young actor I've ever seen so far, but he's also the most perfect young actor for playing this kind of character. Every scene that he's in just blew me away. I like every single bit of his dialogue, especially the line that I brought earlier in my review. I've also realized that he's going to be in a lot of movies this year. The one movie that I'm very excited to watch this year, which he is a part of it, is Colin Trevorrow's \"The Book of Henry.\" Joan Allen is terrific as Jack's Grandmother. It was very weird for me that William H. Macy wasn't in the movie all that much, but in the few moments that he was in, he was very good.\n\nThe only thing in \"Room\" that made me feel more sad than the scene of where Ma and Jack are hugging emotionally after they were separated for like a couple hours, (which I almost cried in that scene), was that it had to end. Technically, it was one of those movies that I wanted it to keep going and never stop.\n   \n\"Room\" has got to be the most unforgettable and breathtaking film I've ever seen. I do hope that there are other people who will experience this the same way I experienced the film.  I mean, yes, it can be grim, and yes, the film is very emotional, but everything about it, (the performances, the direction, the screenplay), is so remarkable, and that is why \"Room\" is the best film of 2015 in my opinion. 4/4",

It is not simply an exploitation film though that this clearly there in the background. That is not to say that the first half of the film is easy to watch. However, we are shielded from the worst of it much like how Jack is by his mother. For Ma, Room is a living hell but for Jack, \"Room\" is his whole world that goes in \"every direction, all the way to the end\". \n\nAs the trailer shows, the entire running time is not dedicated to the confines of the room but how the two- particularly Jack- cope in the real world. We see this strange new place often directly through the eyes of the young child and being able to hear his internal monologue was just so cute yet incredibly emotional.\n\nThe direction from Lenny Abrahamson is simply outstanding and the two central performances from Larson and Tremblay were perfect.

I'm looking forward to seeing where they both go from here. Joan Allen has never been disappointing to me since I saw her in \"Say Goodnight, Gracie\" in 1982, but Bill Macy, whom I first saw on stage almost forty years ago in Mamet's \"The Water Engine,\" comes off as, \"Why am I even in this movie?\"",

The story is simple, but more than adequate to fill out Room's two-hour runtime. The movie opens with Jack narrating his day and surroundings. To hide the unpleasant, harsh reality of their situation his Ma, played by Brie Larson, has told Jack that \"Room\" is the entire world, everything they see on TV, cartoon and people alike, isn't real. She has also kept the truth about his father, their captor, from young Jack. Ma does everything she can to make a normal life for Jack in \"Room\" and does surprisingly well. Their daily routine is not unlike any other parent and child's daily normal routine: brushing teeth, cooking food, TV time, story time. Perhaps most helpful of all is that they refer to objects in \"Room\" without articles, making everything in their little prison seem friendly. Jack wakes up and says \"Good Morning, Clock.\" When their captor, referred to only as \"Old Nick,\" visits and abuses Ma, Jack hides in \"Wardrobe.\" \n\nJack's narration, which guides us both inside and outside of \"Room\" fits the film well and, fortunately, is not cutesy the way movies often present the thoughts of children on the mysterious adult world. Brie Larson is nominated for Best Actress and seems to have a decent shot at taking home the Oscar. I'm not sure that Larson would get my vote for Best Actress, but there is no denying she gives a good performance and is really believable as a woman making the most of an unpleasant situation and as a mother taking care of and protecting her son the best she can.\n\nI think Larson's work in the first half of the film is what will earn her any accolades. When I think of the second half of the movie, outside of \"Room\" and especially once they leave the hospital, Ma is largely absent from my memory. That half of the movie is Jack's story. The young actor playing Jack, Jacob Tremblay, is good as a 5-year-old with a skewed view of the world and, like his narration, is not cloying or precocious. In a scene at the hospital, a doctor tells Ma that Jack will be able to adjust to the outside world because he's still plastic. Jack whispers to his mother that he's not plastic, he's real; he is equally as endearing and annoying as I think any five-year-old is likely to behave. Likewise, Larson's believability as a mother is due to her scenes of frustration with her son, for good reasons and sometimes not, as much as the scenes of her motherly love. \n\nRoom is not as entirely dour and soul-wrenching as you might except from its premise. Its focus is the effect of the crime and abuse that's happened to the characters, not the actual crime itself. Room is ultimately a family drama, concerned with the character's interactions and relationships to each other. Jack's slowly growing curiosity about the real world is helped by his relationship with his grandmother, played well by Joan Allen, and step-grandfather, Leo, played with low-key warmth by Tom McCamus. \n\nThe movie has a chance to take a hard turn into Lifetime made-for-TV movie territory after Ma and Jack escape and a swarm of reporters descend upon her mother's house. Thankfully, Room's script is smart enough to keep the press barrage on the edges and to keep the focus on Jack. We stay with Jack, who is only peripherally aware of the conversations between the adults saying long sentences about lawyers, a possible trial, bills, and a TV interview. Ma agrees to one TV interview to cover expenses and the movie keeps that scene short. The movie keeps us with Jack, sneaking around a corner to peek at what's happening. Many more scenes are done similarly and the movie is all the better for it. Brie Larson is the star of the movie, but our narrative lenspiece is young Jack, aware and understanding in his own way the things he hears and sees.\n\nBecause Room is based on a best-selling novel, many viewers may know the story already (the fact that Ma and Jack escape from their captor was even revealed in film's the trailer), but even knowing how the story plays out does not make the visits of Old Nick to \"Room\" and Jack's escape any less tense. \n\nRoom is certainly well-made, but there is not too much that stands out to me about its direction, though Lenny Abrahamson is nominated for Best Director. Where Abrahamson succeeds best is in making the viewer feel like a fly on the wall in \"Room.\" Even after they escape their captivity and are thrown into the outside world the movie keeps us close to Ma and Jack. The more I think about Room the more I realize that what I liked about the movie had to do with its story and structure which stem from the screenplay by Emma Donoghue, based on her novel. The screenplay, performances, and wonderful score by Stephen Rennicks, are what elevate Room from being a made-for-TV fare or a dark, dour crime story. There may be a misstep or two (like the canted camera angles to show Jack's disorientation with the outside world), but overall the film works well and delivers big pathos. Room is definitely a tear-jerker, there's no way around that, whether you have kids or not. It's about family and stepping out of your own private world, in this case a world that wasn't asked for, and into the wide world of everyone and everything else. I liked this movie, but critics and audiences loved Room. It made its way onto many critics' best of the year lists, so it should be no surprise that it is included in the Academy's list as well.",

            "content": "\"When I was small, I only knew small things. But now I'm five, I know everything!\"\n\nIt doesn't feel right to call Lenny Abrahamson's latest film a small one because it is such a rewarding and emotional experience. Yes, it is a low key and small scaled film, but it has such a profound impact on the audience that it is far from being small. The first half of the film takes place in a very confined space, which makes the second half of the movie even more rewarding as the world around these two protagonists expands. Very few times in film has a director captured such an interesting and authentic mother and son dynamic as we find here with Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's performances. Larson is guaranteed to win the Oscar for her lead role here and she fully deserves it as this mother who has endured the worst of times, but found a means of surviving through her son. She truly lives a nightmare, but Abrahamson doesn't focus on that as much as he does at making us experience their  world through the young son's eyes. He is innocent and has never seen the world outside of the small room in which he unknowingly has been held captive since his birth. His mother has done everything she can to give him a happy and normal life despite the situation. Tremblay delivers an equally impressive performance, and his young age shouldn't have been a factor when it came to voting for the best performances of the year. He was outstanding and held his own in each scene he shared with Larson. The two performances are the main reason why Room has achieved such greatness. \n\nRoom is based on Emma Donoghue's best selling novel about a 5 year old boy who experiences the world in the confined space of a small room. The only person he has direct contact with is his mother. His only contact with the outside world is through a small TV, but his mother has told him that the images are of other universes far from theirs. Jack also knows there is one other person that exists in their world, as some nights a visitor comes into the room from a locked door, but his mom orders him to keep away from him and stay in his wardrobe. Jack's mother has done her best to give him love and nurture, but as his curiosity begins to grow there is only so far she can go with her story. What will happen when young Jack realizes that there is actually more to the world than the small room in which they have been confined in? What follows is a deeply emotional and profound thriller that shook me to my core. \n\nLenny Abrahamson is known for delivering original and unconventional stories. Previously to Room he had directed Michael Fassbender in Frank, a film in which the main protagonist wore a giant paper-mache mask throughout the story. Room however goes a step further delivering a thriller in a very unconventional way as we get to experience the harrowing events through the innocence of a five year old boy and the depths his mother goes through to give him a normal life. From the very opening scene we know there is nothing normal about their lifestyle, but at the same time the film avoids the typical atmosphere we are used to seeing in crime related films. I don't want to say too much about Room because the less you know about it the better, but the second half delivers even more thrills and engages the audience with even more to ponder about. Finding freedom is only have of the battle, and most of the time these films fail to focus on it, but Room manages to deliver on both ends. This is an effective and powerful film and I'm finding it incredibly hard to put into words how much it affected me.",

This movie is a haunting look at the emotional & survival aspects of child abduction seen through the eyes of a young boy. That boy's name is Jack; his mother Joy was abducted as a teen and held captive for numerous years. The despicable excuse for a human being who abducted Joy impregnated her and the result was Jack. The first half of the movie is captured in the shed \"room\" where Joy & Jack are held captive and it shows them both go through their normal daily routine, and their mother to child interactions. It is very disturbing to watch, but so resounding in how their resiliency holds them through. Jack is blinded to much of the world due to his captivity, and only envisions to be reality on what he sees on television; this is brilliantly presented by screenwriter Emma Donoghue who adapted the script from her novel. The second half of \"Room\" is stored in the aspects of adjusting to the real world after Joy & Jack are able to free their captor. Director Lenny Abrahamson helms the picture with a commanding orchestration of the inner emotional layers that Joy & Jack go through their experience in captivity and adjusting; my only minor critique of \"Room\" was in the film's unrealistic ending which obviously I won't reveal because there is no room for spoilers in my reviews. Brie Larson was astounding as Joy, and this is the real Joy who will be the next Oscar winner for Best Actress. Jacob Tremblay as Jack was a revelation, and this young actor is heading straight to the real world of stardom; he is a genuine pure talent. There was also strong supporting work from Joan Allen as Joy's mother, William H. Macy as Joy's father, and Tom McCamus as the boyfriend of Joy's mom. OK, I will free you now from this review, sorry I held you captive with all those roomy puns. Just make sure you make room for \"Room\".",

I was taken aback by just how involved I was in the fate of these two human beings that were trying to escape the four walls that trapped them for so many years. I didn't just feel tension because of their situation, I deeply cared for them as individuals. To say that Brie Larson deserves the Oscar this year for her performance would be an understatement, but just as deserving, if not more so, would be Jacob Tremblay.. I felt his fears, understood his excitement and longed for him to understand what was out in the real world. Quite often films brush past the children to look at the more complex emotions of adults, but that would have been a great disservice. Jack is the heart of the story, and seeing it play out from his perspective is far more interesting. We rediscover the beauty of our world in the two hour span of the film. The script is top notch, the performances beautiful and I find myself thinking about the film even now, days after seeing it. This may be my new film of the year. If you haven't already, take the time and watch Room. 5 out of 5 stars.",

I would say any movie in which a young child plays a\n major role falls into that category for me, particularly one that I know will feature a great deal of mother/child bonding, temper tantrums, and a child screaming and pouting  in excess. I sensed what I was in for with this movie, yet I wanted to see it anyway so I put my usual aversion aside. Overall, the movie delivers exactly the powerful performances promised in glowing reviews. It also did not prove to be grating in the interaction between mother and child, despite a few scenes of bratty outbursts and (believable) intense mother/child squabbling or attempting to communicate in very difficult circumstances. This is a movie that could've derailed if the female lead had overly milked the emotion and despair, but it's a rather understated performance, which is exactly why it is so powerful. (Brie Larson has the Oscar sewn up). I have no idea how they get such a performance out of a child, but the kid was great. Most surprising of all was the \"bad guy\" in the movie, but I won't ruin it by saying anything more about that element other than that it surprised me and added much to the movie's effectiveness. This has been a great year for Irish films and film-makers, and this movie is every bit as good as \"Brooklyn\".  Whatever nominations and awards it gets will be well-deserved as it is a most affecting movie. Other than the soundtrack music, which came on a bit too strong in a few scenes, I  have nothing negative to say about this outstanding film.",

While it is clear that the story morbidly revolves around exploring the progressive reassimilation of being trapped in a box and then subsequently introduced to a much grander world through the lens of a young boy, the progression of the story insists on several nagging and unresolved plot points.\n\nThe treatment for Brie Larson's character as a mother recovering from the horrific trauma of being abducted at youth and then being impregnated by her abductor, is insufficiently explored and leaves us wondering about her post traumatic state throughout the entirety of the movie. It is made clear that the star is evidently young Jake and his coming to terms with the \"new world,\" but our attention seems to be tugged by the interactions between Ma and her parents, her doctor, and the insisting presence of the media pushing for that frustratingly cold interview. All of which prove Ma's maternal devotions to her son Jake while giving the audience only speculative evidence to the state of a suggestive decline of her character, who we grew to genuinely care about very early into the film. Whether the incident in the bathroom was deliberate or accidental, little evidence is given to suggest an absolution, if any, to her decision - which then begs at the well being of the loved and adored Jake under the beck and call of the potential volatility of his mother.\n\nOverall Room was an interesting and original take on abduction and the morbid realities of rebuilding a life after the fact. It fell short on exploring the voice of a young mother's post traumatic state, while too much focus was spent on an under articulated exploration in the psychology and physiology of young boy being introduced to society for the first time in his life. It is not to insist that all of these resolutions questioned would further the point of the story's revolving focus on Jake however, i found the execution of some of the topics brought up in dialogue to be blatantly unignorable and found myself craving for several resolutions at the end of the film due to this dialogue, which were not met.",

Unfortunately, I was aware of some of the things that were happening, which would have been a delightful surprise to discover.  I open with this because I want to urge you all, if you know nothing about Room, then make sure you stay that way and go see this film. The less you know when you walk in on that day will make the movie that much more exciting.  Spoilers from here on:  I loved the performances from all the actors in this film.  The 2 leads (mother and son) were particularly amazing.  The first half of the film was gut-wrenching and left me in despair, as is intended.  This also made the transition point in the middle of the film, the escape, one of the most heart-pounding and intense things I've ever sat through in a theater.  It was one of those scenes where I almost couldn't contain myself and wanted to shout at the character on screen.  It's after this point that I had the most difficulty with Room.  The pace, and intensity dropped off precipitously when they left Room.  While everything felt very genuine and realistic, and I totally cared about the characters still, the dramatic change in tone was hard to adjust to that quickly.  It basically walks you through how, despite physically being free, they were still mentally trapped in Room.  It's so tough because, like the main character, I assumed freedom would mean an instant big happy ending to the film, but that's not reality.  Room is a superb film that has dark events and themes, and yet manages to hold an underlying message of hope despite devastating circumstances.",

Dark, frustratingly depressing at moments and capable of making you feel uncomfortable, this movie offers a formidable dramatic challenge which grows into a thoughtful character study.\n\nThe story of a young kidnapped girl (Brie Larson) and her young boy kept in captivity could not be less than uncomfortable and hart-to-chew. From the first moments, the audience will be compelled to follow how Joy managed to survive so many years being locked in a room and to raise a boy. The slow, detailed revelation of the true situation works formidably on the audience as it meticulously builds-up the story into the second part of the movie. The second half might be a less thrilling one, but if offers an intriguing character study of how Joy and Jack cope with the freedom and the return to the society. That is also the most polarizing part of Lenny Abrahamson's movie. If you are impressed with the first half, then the second one will certainly feel less satisfying. Personally, I would have preferred to have the whole movie focused on the \"Room\" rather than part of it.\n\nThe weaker second half is, however, compensated by the wonderful performances of Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. Both of them were worthy of receiving Oscar nominations, and the young Larson even snapped the Best Actress Award. Her extremely believable performance, her struggle to get used to freedom and her almost aggressive and uncontrollable love for her boy are contributing greatly to the overall high emotional load in the movie. On the hand, Jacob Tremblay's performance is outstanding as well. His young age probably deprived him from obtaining a nomination but his fascinating presence as Jack certainly puts him among the list of top kids-actors to be followed.\n\nIn conclusion, Room is a must see delivery. Not only because of the Oscar-winning performance of Brie Larson, but also because of the compelling and uneasy story , and wonderful screenplay.",

Easily the best drama of 2015.\n\nThe subtleties of this film are twofold: one is maternal love based on instinct, not reasons, and the inseparable connection between the two souls. Through Room, I particularly loved how the maternal love was portrayed more than just how a mother can be protective of her son, but it also shapes her into what she is: I just couldn't imagine how Joy's life, and identity for that matter, would look like without Jack in that room. The second layer of subtleties is our well familiar \"world\" but as seen from a uniquely fresh perspective of a five-year-old who didn't know it \"existed.\" All these were achieved by the genius adaptation of the namesake novel and the incredibly visceral performance of Brie and Jacob.\n\nBrie, I honestly didn't believe that you were just 26 (or even younger at the time of shooting)! How could a woman your age portray this complex character with such deep emotions and subtleties? Just brilliant, very brilliant, indeed. I'd be disappointed if you don't get the Oscar.\"",

In Room, Ma (Brie Larson) and her 5 year old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) escape from a room where they had been held captive for a long time (Jack  for his whole life and Ma for seven years). We follow them as Jack discovers, explores, and has to adapt to a world he didn't even know existed till now, and Ma struggles with her increasingly fragile mental state. Brie Larson does a great job, Joan Allen as her mother was fantastic, but Jacob Tremblay easily steals the entire show. I'd go so far as to say he was the best performance I've seen this year (It's a joy to watch him discover this new world for the first time). We also spend the most time with Jack as he is our eyes and ears into the movie, and he is the main character here. Room is a gentle, loving, sad, and life affirming film. It's easily one of the year's best (It's also easily the most emotional film of the year), and while it is super slow I will say it is most definitely worth a watch.",

Confined in a room for seven years, the film tells the loving story between a mother and her 5-year-old son and their desire for freedom. (Much more happens in the film. But in the interest of not giving out any spoilers, I will leave it at that.)\n\nThis is the first feature film for child actor Jacob Tremblay. His performance is magnificent and one of the best in recent years for someone of his age.\n\nThe film beautifully captures the family dynamics of not only between mother and son but also the immediate family when a child is suddenly abducted. Thankfully, many of us will never be in this situation. But what gives this film its weight is the striking enactment of the aftermath and emotions when placed in such a situation, which are engrossing and deeply moving.\n\n\"Room\" is captivating as it tells its daunting story through the eyes of a five-year-old as much as it does from its adult victim.",

When Jack screams at his Ma, \"I want a different story!\", you know there's more to it than just a hunger for a different bedtime yarn. Her response, \"No! This is the story you get!\", punctuates their situation, and ultimately our own desires, with such force it nearly knocked me out. Room, a powerhouse of horrifying drama and real-life suspense, breaks out from its confining premise with enough gentle moments of love to make it one of the year's best.\nIf you can't tell, I'm being careful with the details of the plot. However, know that it's a setup that's about as bleak as one can imagine. Director Abrahamson (maker of the criminally underrated Frank) creates an atmosphere of intensely palpable desperation in his small sets. In lesser hands, Room could've been either an oppressively gloomy downer or dishonestly optimistic hack-job. Instead, it's both strikingly candid and beautifully grace-filled\nThis compassion for its subjects is thanks in no small part to the much-deserved-Oscar-nominated Larson, and young actor Tremblay. His character, in particular, presents such a powerful look at childish na\u00efvet\u00e9, he gives us one of the most amazing examples childhood trauma and perseverance I've ever seen. That theme (determination through suffering) creates an experience that harbors as much exhilaration as it does tears.

The film opens up in medias res with this young mother in her seventh year of captivity, trying to survive in squalid conditions with her young son and teach him about a world he has never seen.  The first act shows some of the most claustrophobic and focused filmmaking this year.  We are stuck with these characters in this doomed situation, with only hints of the outside world.  Brie Larson impresses us as the young woman who was denied years of her life and we see how her imprisonment and its aftermath have worn on her.  Jacob Tremblay also deserves some recognition for convincingly playing a boy who has never traveled more than five feet from where he was born and never met a person other than his mother.  Room loses steam toward the end and fails to recapture the engrossing magic that had us at the edge of our seat for the first 35 minutes, but it still has a simple and definitive end that most awards season fare denies the audience.  A must see.",

            "content": "ROOM Review - Jack Fitzpatrick\n\nSimply put, \"Room\" is an emotional film. And it seems as though half the time you do not even know what you're feeling. Seamlessly the film manages to portray happiness in a tragic way, depressingly dark situations yet also present some optimism and make you feel genuinely scared and/or worried about its fictional characters. Room is emotional in a very real sense; it's not just another movie where a romance falls apart, or where a loved one gets a terminal illness and it doesn't tug on your heart strings with cheap bullshit. Room doesn't try to trick you into feeling things, its realistic tone and grim story is enough. Not to make light of the cinematography, music or any of anything else which made the film, these are all good too, however we are really in this one for the writing and acting; the story and characters. \nThe film follows its protagonists as they live their day to day lives trapped inside a small dirty room with no way out. Locked in by a nameless man that they call 'Old Nick,' (Who by the way totally looks like Will Ferrell's cousin or something...) The characters are a mother and son 'Jack,' 'Ma' has been inside this room for seven years and her son has never experienced anything beyond the room in his life. For around half of the movie we stay in the room with these characters, we as an audience never leave the room until the characters do. Personally I was beginning to feel the claustrophobia myself, the movie makes you feel as trapped as the characters are. The room feels hopeless as it does small and the atmosphere is actually quite haunting. \nNow though, that Jack is five years old, Ma believes that it's now time and that he is finally old enough to help her make their escape. Through a series of events, the two do make it out of the room, however we are still only about half way through the film as we follow their lives after leaving 'room.' \nThe films point of no return; leaving 'room' is both scary and cheerful for both us and the characters in the film. The juxtaposition of being stuck in the room and the freedoms of such an open and unknown world is mind blowing. Yet, before they leave and it is uncertain whether they will succeed or not, you almost don't want them to try. Jack pleads his mother to wait till he is six years old and this is a terrifying theme throughout the film; Comfort and security over freedom. Jack's life and world may have been horrible, however the thought of leaving was frightening and almost made no sense to Jack. \nThe movie manages to portray a horrible situation without feeling like a cheap horror movie, this is to be taken seriously and manages to portray despicable acts and conditions of the characters, without reverting to gross out moments or cartoonish dark villains. The villain of the film, is definitely disgusting and hateable, but ultimately is not the point of the film. The maturity of the film dealing with a sickening character and subject is appreciated. \nAnother running theme of this film was the experience - or really inexperience of five-year-old Jack. He'd never known anything beyond this one room his entire life, basically; 'room' was his world. And this is such an interesting concept to me. Jack's concepts of fiction and reality blur and at such an age he is vulnerable to information. It's important to learn the truth however almost incomprehensible due to his extremely limited knowledge. \n\nPossibly my favourite shot of the film, has Jack creating shadows with his hands in the partial sunlight that comes through via sunlight. This shot has obvious relation to 'The Allegory of the Cave' philosophical theory. Put simply, if a caveman never leaves his cave, and all he ever sees are shadows, this is what he believes in, this becomes his reality. And the same goes for the child in the film. 'Room' is all he knows, and beyond stories he's told or what he sees on their television, Jack's sense of reality is inaccurate. He knows about animals such as dogs and cats, he knows about grass and trees and he knows about general bits of information, however due to his isolation he cannot separate reality from fiction and therefore will not know which things are real and which are not. A dragon for example is as real or fake as a dog in his mind. \nThe themes throughout the film and the emotion that these themes bring are all portrayed through the actors; who all did a fine job, but the performance that really stood out was child actor Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Children are often not the best actors, they're still young; still learning, but this kid is ahead of his time, ahead of his age really. For such a thematically complex film as well as a mature and grim one, Tremblay did an amazing job making me believe in his character, as well as his collaboration with Brie Larson as mother and son, their relationship is strong and convincing. This would also be thanks to upcoming director Lenny Abrahamson whom I've never seen any works by, however this seems to be an early work of a promising career. (He also directed \"Frank,\" and \"What Richard Did.\"\nThe film gave me chills when it needed to in moments of pure intensity the beautiful moments were made that much nicer in comparison to the dreary and depressing ones. It even gave me a new perspective on the world and the way we might look at it. What if we are all experiencing some version of Jack and Ma's 'room?' But, this is just a movie review, I don't want to get too philosophical. \n\n\"Room\" is saddening yet uplifting. It may be hard to watch for some yet I'd think also hard to stop watching, and overall the film has the ability to change ones' perspective. \"Room\" is shocking, yet beautiful and most of all unforgettable.  This is Drama at its' best.             10/10",

            "content": "I remember seeing a trailer for \"Room\" months back in 2015 and being almost entirely mystified; it looked like a strange, almost ethereal mix of drama and science-fiction that even the trailer couldn't adequately communicate. Not until seeing it, I realized that this is a film that isn't easy to summarize in a brief two minute trailer, and I'll undoubtedly struggle to illustrate the film's genius with its review. This is the kind of film one needs to experience and feel; a film where words often feel either exaggerating or shortchanging in attempting to illustrate the film's emotional power and exceptional narrative.\n\nSimply put, \"Room\" is the emotional moviegoing experience of the season. A deeply moving film that combines the aforementioned genres of drama and science-fiction, \"Room\" is the kind of film that hits you with its most powerful shot after you walk out of the theater or turn off the TV. It lingers in your mind and the characters, their motivations, their conversations, their struggles, and their thoughts don't escape you, unlike most dramas, where character names are probably not even remembered by most following the end credits.\n\nThe film opens with a young mother named Joy (Brie Larson) and her small child named Jack (Jacob Tremblay), who live their life in an enclosed garden shed of about one-hundred square feet and their only available sunlight is a skylight. They eat, sleep, bathe, and cook in there, and for Jack, it's the only life he has come to know. At first, their routine actions and close relationship lead one to believe that they've chosen this life in order to free themselves from the constraints of society. However, we see the horror of their reality soon enough. \n\nSeven years ago, Joy was tricked and kidnapped by a man known as \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers), who raped her and had her give birth to Jack. Since then, she has lived inside this closed space; it isn't until their escape-plan is successful that Joy goes back to her mother and father and Jack finally experiences the outside world. Previously, Jack believed, largely in part of his mother, who tried to make their life seem a lot less hellish, that outside of the four walls of \"room,\" as they referred to it, was outer space. The people on TV were just flat, and nothing else besides them and Old Nick existed. \n\nUpon finally escaping and trying to return to a life that seems brand new to them, Joy struggles to get Jack to assimilate to the world. His entire life was predicated upon just him and his \"Ma,\" as he was largely kept hidden in the closet whenever Old Nick would come pay them a visit. Now, he must be socialized into the world at age five, and learn that there is not only a larger life, but a larger world outside of \"room.\" His mother, on the other hand, must grapple with her demons that have haunted her since she was captured.\n\nIf you look at \"Room\" from the perspective of Joy, you find a drama about being re-socialized into the world after living your entire life in captivity. It's a familiar story, but one that is truly sad and potent, and Brie Larson brings such life and emotion to the role for a woman so young (her precocious acting reminds me quite a bit of Jennifer Lawrence). However, if you look at the film through Jack's perspective, you see a film that plays with the realm of science-fiction. While nothing about \"Room\" deals with supernatural or \"the unknown\" in a grandiose sense, we do have a character who has never experienced life first-hand and sees everything around him not only as foreign but, for lack of a better term, alien. \n\nThis results in a film that's very lucid and ethereal, largely in part because of Lenny Abrahamson's (who directed 2014's \"Frank,\" a strong film dealing with mental illness) unique direction and cinematographer Danny Cohen's dreamlike grasp on reality. These beautiful and immersive aesthetic choices make the world and everything we take for granted and overlook on a daily basis look as if it's an unearthly object, with extreme close-ups and high-contrast depictions employed by Abrahamson. \n\n\"Room\" is a film largely bent on repetition; everything from Joy and Jack's daily actions in \"room,\" Jack's attempts to socialize with other adults, Joy's attempt to come to terms with returning to her old life, and more are all showcased as recurring events in the film. This slowburn narrative tactic allows character motivations and interest to rise and boil accordingly, creating a film that turns impacting and even emotional when bigger, more elaborate events occur (the truck scene may be one of the best sequences I've seen in film last year). With all that and more considered, \"Room\" is a wonderful treat of a film; one that will hit everyone differently in a sense that it's not a matter of if it will resonate with you but how it will eventually manage to do so.",

Both this film and The Revenant are about resilience and the power of the human spirit to overcome, but the way that theme is portrayed here is a polar opposite of how it is dealt with in The Revenant.  Brie Larson gives a performance that encompasses the intensity of her character's trauma, but does so with admirable subtlety rather than scenery chewing grand moments and demonstrates remarkable dignity and a sad sort of maturity that seems to be ingrained in the character due to the terrible events she lived with for seven years.  The character and Larsen's performance reminded me very much of the kind of work we have seen from Mary Louise Parker.  Jacob Trembley is brilliant as her five year old son.  I do not know if the child was just that amazing an actor or if it involved excellent directorial and editing skills, but his performance is flawless.  He carries the same sense of quiet about him that Larson does as his Mother, which demonstrates a detailed consistency that is spot on considering he only knew her and one place for the first five years of his life.  The score is also perfectly subtle and reflects the feeling of the film brilliantly.  The supporting cast of Joan Allen, William H. Macy, and Tom McCamus were also strong and their performances are consistent with the subdued intensity that characterizes the entire movie.  This across the board consistency in all aspects of the film, from the colors, to the music, to the performances is what makes this such a standout work of movie making.

It's dramatic, emotional, suspenseful and a phenomenal film.  The story is intense and heartbreaking (times 4 or 5).  The acting performances of Brie Larson and young Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscar recognition.  While I haven't seen all the performances nominated thus far, young Jacob Tremblay is jaw-dropping.  I was excited to see Brie Larson, one of my favorites, finally show her stuff, and that she did.  I hope she gets the win.  However, Jacob blew me away.  There were no words to describe how incredible his performance is for someone so young.  Better than any adult actor I've seen this year.  I'm serious.  There is an incredible career in the making there.  The screenplay, based on the novel of the same name, is beautiful.  Aside from one scene that bugged me a little, the dialogue is so real.  The director did a masterful job pulling the screenplay, performances and the perspective of \"Room\" against the much larger world Brie and Jacob are denied for so long.

She's paired wonderfully with Jacob Tremblay as her son, who convey's a wonderful mix of terror & wonder as a young boy experiencing the world for the first time.  Honestly, you want to talk about an Oscar snub, Tremblay should be on that list.  Behind the camera, Abrahamson does a superb job putting you into Joy & Jack's world, both inside the room and then later when they escape, especially by focusing on the perspective of Jack (simple things like the sky & trees never looked so strange & wondrous).  The filmmakers also don't shy away from hard questions, including decisions Joy makes, which may seem cruel but do make some points.  Overall, a truly inspiring film of survival and one of the best of the 2015.",

When he enters and exits she is suppose to stay on the far wall with her back turned so she won't see the code or try to escape.\u00c2\u00a0 After he goes through the door with the code on it he just pushes the outer door open. After a few days you should have devised a very good plan to escape. You should have seen that there was only one door that had an electronic lock while the other you can just simply push open. The way he entered and treated her was very odd. He would provide her with food and necessities. The \"room\" had a bathtub, toilet, sink, bed, table, toaster oven, shelves, a closet, a skylight and a tv with cable. He would then come in and lay in the bed with her until morning and repeat this same thing over and over for years. What??? Her idea of escaping was to have her son who just turned 5 play dead while wrapped up in a rug so the kidnapper can take the boy (Jack) out the \"room\" and bury him. Once Jack feels the truck stop 3 times he is suppose to jump out and run to someone. How the heck are you going to tell your 5yr. old son who has never been out in the world to do this ridiculous plan? He actually successfully does this and a guy calls the cops while the kidnapper drives off. Jack says to the cops that the truck made three stops from where they came and tells them he and his mom was in a shed. The cops find the shed and now the mom (Joy) and Jack are reunited and on the way to the hospital to start the new drama between her and her family. How the heck is that the best plan you can come up with? After 7 years where 2 of them you were by yourself, that was the best you could do? What were you doing with all that time? You have wonder why you didn't have the captor take the kid to the hospital after he was born. Did you have the kid in the shed? Wait a minute, something isn't adding up. Why would the capture keep you and the kid and willingly supply you with food, power and cable? He even does this after admitting he had been laid off for several months. This story is so off and seemingly pointless. You stay watching, hoping more details will emerge about Joy and why her mom and especially her dad are distant from her while they stay in her old house but you get nothing. The movie really does hold your attention but it's just a very odd and overrrated movie with a concept that is very implausible. The hype and surprisingly good reviews this movie gets are just unnecessary and unworthy. Sure the performances from Brie Laurson and the kid are great but the story is garbage. Its great to see Jack becoming acclimated to the world around him and the progression of the family but it's such a worthless journey without the understanding of why and how this happened. And that's how it ends. They visit the \"room\" one more time with the police to let it go from their lives but never find the captor. This was a worthless production that did not need to be done. Should have kept this a book on a shelf left unread.",

Despite getting\nsome nice year end nominations and awards, it was sort of like driving with\nthe low on gas light on.  I knew I was really pushing it if I didn't remedy\nthe situation soon (hint, hint folks).  So I did and boy was I happy.\n\n\nI really don't want to talk much about the movie itself because it has a\nvery narrow scope and the previews give you a very good idea of what it is about.\nHowever it is one extraordinary script & acting \"Oh My\".  Brie\nLarson (Ma) and Jacob Tremblay (Jack) so quickly transform you from\nthinking to you are watching a movie to thinking a watching a true\ndocumentary.\n\nYou could see and feel the movie 100% thru the eyes of Jack and watching\nhis innocence combined with his quick smart mind at times battle each other\nwas exceptional.  No clues how Mr. Tremblay really is, but playing a five\nyear old, he did an exceptional job, EXCEPTIONAL.\n\nThis film reminded me a bit of \"Boyhood\" from last year due to its novel,\nunique, special story that is quite unforgettable.  No doubt, I will flash\nto this movie several times in my over the next few weeks as I see a\nheroic \"All In\" Mom or precocious yet innocent child thoroughly enjoying\nthe world of make believe and the reality of new things.\n\nI will leave it there...GO SEE TODAY.

She puts her soul into this character, and it pays off in spades.  A few months ago I honestly didn't know much of her, but now I see her as one of the most promising new actresses in the business.  Jacob Tremblay further proves my belief that child actors can truly make our jaws drop.  Tremblay deserves all the praise in the world for his heartwarming and complex performance, completely capturing the mindset of a young boy being introduced to the world for the first time.  Its something truly spectacular, and I kept going back and forth trying to decide if he or Larson stole the show.  They both really worked perfectly together.  Joan Allen is another underrated performance, as she gives a sweet and loving performance as the grandmother.  Her giving a brilliant performance as a mother who lost her daughter and attempts to have a relationship with her grandson is heartwarming.  The script from Emma Donoghue is something truly spectacular.  She gives us a terrifying real look into the minds of these characters and bringing life to their situation.  There was a moment halfway through the film that had me in tears and cheering.  Its amazing that a fictional  story could feel so much like a true story.  Director Lenny Abrahamson",

It brings laughter to hear what they believe certain things represent and what those objects actually do. The adults would then correct the child and explain what it really is and what's really out there. Normally, adults don't have to do this twice - in two different worlds.\n\nIn \"Room,\" well, it is a different world. Young Jack (Jacob Tremblay) is locked up in a shed, known as \"Room,\" with his mother, or Ma (Brie Larson). They survive with the necessities, basic food, plumbing, a bed, but have no contact with the outside world. Old Nick (Sean Bridgers), who is responsible for locking them away, brings supplies through a password-protected door. The only natural light comes through a skylight atop the shed.\n\nJack believes everything on TV is magic and doesn't truly exist. He believes there is only Room, like it's on its very own planet. Voice-overs are provided by Jack explaining what's going on inside his head, and what everything means to him. He has a fear of ever going outside, but must if he and Ma plan on escaping to a better life. Jack is almost born twice, and experiences the world twice - once in his own and then the real one. A bond between a mother and her child can never be broken.\n\nBoth Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay shine so brightly in \"Room.\" Larson is emotional, understanding and at the same time expresses the exhaustion of raising a child, especially one who has never had exposure to the real world. She's genuinely authentic and outstanding. It's going to be a real competition for Best Actress between her and Saoirse Ronan.\n\nTremblay shows his bright future as an exceptionally talented young actor. You will fall in love with this boy and truly feel for him and what he undergoes during the film. His voice-overs are hilarious, but saddening at the same time. The writing was superb for his character. There are no flaws with the rest of the cast, as well.\n\n\"Room\" does such a fabulous job with letting us see a child grow up in this unfortunate, but unique circumstance. We have no idea how we would coup with such an experience and the psychology behind it. Being in that situation would be ever so frustrating, but Larson handles and deals with it the only way it could be dealt with. It's another beautiful film from A24.\n\nCheck out our content at ishmovies.wordpress.com!",

Jack (Jacob Tremblay), a bright five-year old boy with hair down to his shoulders wakes up every morning saying hello to his universe. He does not greet the sun, the grass, the trees outside, where he could run and laugh and play like a normal five-year old but only to the objects he knows for five years as being \"the real world\", his world: the lamp, the sink, the plant, the refrigerator. His only friend is a mouse that he feeds, thinking that the mouse also lives in that little world, the only one real for him. Sometimes a man comes over, during the night, and then Jack must sleep in the wardrobe, not to be seen. The relationship mother-son appears to be normal: they cook, dance, laugh, stretch out, read about Alice, mother tells the tale of Monte Cristo. The poverty that surrounds them is not painful. The real pain and anger I felt when Jack could not believe that outside \"the room\" exists a real world, with real people, and trees, grass, leaves, seasons, snow. Then the reality strikes: captivity. A child born in captivity, because of a madman, a rapist. A story of a child whose life started in a cage having as a talisman his mother love and her tooth, thinking that \"his strong\" is in his long hair. Real world proves to be scarier than \"the room\". A movie that should be seen, a story that must be known, a boy that deserves all the awards: Jacob Tremblay.",

            "content": "\"Room\" is one of the most vivid movies that you will ever see.  The concept is fascinating: A woman is inexplicably trapped in a room with her five-year-old son.  That's all.  As the story unfolds, we learn details of how long they have been there and where their food comes from; however, the mystery continues to be preserved as we are left to fill in the rest with our imaginations.  There are so many things that I would love to say but I want everybody to be just as surprised and on the edge of your seat as I was.  In fact, this film contains ten of the most intense minutes that you will ever see in any movie.  I swear, there came a point where I had to remind myself to breath.  The story is an endless series of emotional highs and lows that create a deep connection between the characters and the audience.  These emotional moments are enhance by a powerful musical score by Stephen Rennicks.  Its absence reinforces the hopelessness and isolation of being trapped in the room, but then the score soars when it needs to enhance the joyous and devastating moments.  I find that the most poetic piece of the film stems from one of the darkest psychological implications:  The mental well-being of this young boy is completely dependent upon his mother but, when everything turns, he suddenly needs to become her strength in a time of need.  Again, I'm doing my best to avoid any spoilers so you will just have to see it for yourself.  The acting is astounding.  Brie Larson will take home an Oscar for the endless number of emotions that she vividly portrays throughout the film.  Her character is simply known as \"Ma,\" a constant reminder that she has been stripped of her identity and her entire world is her son.  She doesn't need a cape to turn her character into a hero.  Jacob Tremblay was equally amazing.  It is rare that I believe that a child performance deserved an Oscar nomination but his acting is highly refined and brings out a lot of our emotions.  He holds his own against Larson's Oscar-nominated performance and isn't merely along for the ride.  The realism of this story is further enhanced by its supporting cast.  Joan Allen has been out of vogue for awhile but she delivers her best performance in years.  It took a lot to steal the spotlight from Larson and Tremblay, but she definitely had her moment.  Also, the very presence of William H. Macy adds a brief but necessary complication to this story.  There comes a point where you start dreading that the ending will spoil the entire story.  Dreading that, no matter what the ending, it won't live up to the rest of the film.  But Emma Donoghue creates the perfect conclusion that allows this story to come full circle.  One of the best pieces of advice that I can give is that you should NOT watch the trailer!  Just take my word for it and blindly walk into this film.  \"Room\" will keep you intrigued, emotional, and on the edge of your seat from start until finish.  More importantly, you will walk away from the film a changed person.",

Her co-star Jacob Tremblay, who plays her five year old son, also gives one of the most spellbinding and believable performances of the year. It never gets too heavy. Instead, it shifts between being uncomfortable to being heartwarming and loving. It doesn't end in the typical Hollywood crescendo. Instead, it gives much needed closure to the characters as well as the audience. It is well worth the 1 hour 23 minute runtime.",

            "content": "This is great.  If you're looking for a tense, emotionally satisfying, character driven film, this is the one for you.  \n\nI wasn't familiar with Brie Larson before I saw this, but she's a frigging brilliant actress.  I wouldn't be surprised if she becomes the \"next big thing\" in the near future, because the power of this movie is almost totally dependent on her and her performance.  It reminded me a little of 'Joy' actually (And it's just a weird coincidence that her character's name in 'Room' is Joy too) because the story is essentially about a mother who has to overcome seemingly impossible odds in order to save her own life.  This is obviously a much darker story than 'Joy', but I was struck my the similarity in theme.  Moving onto the kid, Jacob Tremblay, he's excellent too.  Now, good child actors are a rarity to say the very least, but this one has the right chops.  We see the world and events of the narrative through his eyes, and not once did his performance grate on me or make me wince, like most child actors do with such a huge role.  He was pivotal to the success of the movie and it really works.\n\nI had a concern before seeing this that the entire film would be set in the one room that the characters are being kept prisoner in.  Not that I didn't think the film could work if it was, but just because I feel the material would get a little overdrawn if that was the case.  I'm happy to say though that the protagonists escape the dungeon halfway through the movie.  I don't feel this is a spoiler because this was hinted at in the trailer.  But the reason why this is such a positive aspect for me is because I'm interested in similar real life cases and how captives manage to reintegrate into the world after being out of it for so long.  This film deals with that very well and it satisfied me.  \n\nThere were a few things that disappointed me, but I don't think they're detrimental to the film or particularly harm it in any way.  Brie Larson's father had a small role and I wish they'd expanded on some of the issues he was having with the whole ordeal, but they just wrote him out rather suddenly.  I also would have liked more closer with the antagonist, the man who captured Brie Larson in the first place.  \n\nOther than that, I don't have a negative thing to say about this.  It's the sort of film that will stay with you.",

I won't spoil the 2nd Act but things become less stressful and take a turn, and the world isn't what everyone thought.

Room is about a young lady referred to as Ma (Brie Larson) who lives in a shed with her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Ma was kidnapped when she was 17 by Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) and has been kept captive in the Room. Old Nick comes by to have his way with her and leaves her supplies. This has been going on for seven years and Ma has had enough. Ma weaves a story to Jack that there's only the Room and everything else is fake. It sort of places her in a position to think that this is life and to save her son from the horrific events happening to them. I don't want to spoil anymore, but the acting here is top notch. Brie Larson shines as Ma and the breakout star here is young Jacob Tremblay. Both really get you to care early on about them and some moments truly do get tense. Its a great film about the relationship between a mother and her child and the lengths that said mother will go to to protect her own. Only small gripe is that later in the film and by the ending there are still a few questions that never get answered! I can't recommend this one enough regardless!",

Though Brie Larsons performance was brilliant Jacob Tremblays performance as Jack was phenomenal and the fact that he's only 9 years old makes it even more impressing if you ask me. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay both have bright futures ahead of them and I look forward too seeing more films starring them in the future. Besides them the entire cast such as Joan Allen, Tom McCamus, William H Macy (though he has limited screen time) and etc does a great job with the roles they play in.

Unfortunately, Room is a bit aimless structurally; the first act provides goals for the characters to achieve, while the second lumbers along, providing some excellent scenes along the way but no sense of purpose or climax.  If you're looking for a good, cathartic cry, Room does the trick, but unfortunately the film is somewhat less than the sum of its exceptional parts.",

The eponymous room is both their prison and Jack's entire world. There is only heaven, which he sees through the skylight, the space within Room and the fictional world of TV. Their escape unveils the true wonders of the everyday world to Jack, as well as a difficult adjustment back to normality for Joy.\n\nThe two central performances are fantastic. Raw, heartfelt and utterly engaging, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay emote the pain, grief and frustrations of their journey to profound levels. They're two of the finest performances of the last twelve months, so don't be surprised if both walk away with Oscars. That's right, Tremblay is that good!\n\nLenny Abrahamson treatment of Donoghue's script allows for a poignant slow-burner that never contrives to exploit. We're given a beautiful balance of pain and hope, anger and joy. A bleak tale of survival and discovery has never had so much warmth. \n\nAn intimate and thoroughly rewarding film that will stay with you for a very long time. It deserves every award it's given.\n\n5 stars.",

A sort of fantasy story telling approach helps Ma keep Jack innocent despite everything going on around them until his fifth birthday when it comes time that she feels he can handle an escape attempt to help both of them come from underfoot and reunite with the outside world. Brie Larson and Jacob Trimbley are really note perfect in their roles as Ma and Jack, you really believe their connection and despair, and Jacob was really gradually discovering the outside world with his grandparents and gradually adjusting to everything around him almost like a newborn even though he is a 5 year old. A very deserving if unusual choice for the 2015 TIFF Audience Choice Award and I will be intrigued to see what hardware it picks up at the Oscars this year. Has a slight Beasts of the Sourthern Wild pull to it which was cool. And also best cameo of a Etobicoke landmark in the film with Apache Burger. A solid and surprising gem. .",

Both Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay present somewhat compelling depictions of a woman and child who are held for a long amount of time against their will.  However, as their predicaments change, the movie begins to hit the clich\u00e9 'notes' of a film that wants to play with your emotions, but without any insight on the suffering of its characters.  It's as if this film's downfall comes from the fact that it was written by the writer of the novel upon which it's based, Emma Donoghue; this film tries to fit so much drama into its second half, yet it still drags as it provides a shallow impression of the psyches of the characters in this tragic situation.  The film's flaccid ending seems like a halfhearted attempt at some sort resolution and relies on the viewer to imagine the changed-state of the principal characters--as it's not shown in any detail.  \n  I'm sorry to say that this movie was ultimately unoriginal (at moments it felt like Peter Jackson's similarly-themed \"Lovely Bones\"), poorly written (laughable moments in the script \"Needle in a haystack\" etc.), and boring (zzzzzzzzz).  I feel as if this film would benefit immensely if it was shot/told in a similar fashion to that of the novel upon which it's based: from the viewpoint of the imprisoned child.  This is attempted in form of narration spread at different points throughout the film, but the somewhat precocious reflections are brief and, at times, inaudible.  While I have not read the novel, I would imagine that telling/shooting the film in a similar manner would add some much needed originality and insight.  \n  I would have given this film 1.5 stars because of its compelling opening situation, but, much like the agonizingly clich\u00e9 sex-offender glasses of the character who imprisons Larson and Tremblay,  its derivative nature is really quite ghastly.",

As Jack views the world for the first time and gains an understanding of what exists around him, it's beautiful and heartbreaking and succeeds in delivering the emotion Abrahamson so desperately wants to communicate, but it's underlined and reworked and restated so many times that the film begins to lose what initially made it so effective. Tremblay and Larson are both excellent; it's a shame they weren't given the vehicle they deserved.",

The pace of the movie was in fact a little slow, as I did have to check the clock once or twice. The characters are brilliant but for me the movie is split into three the first half being the Jack's (Jacob Tremblay) story, the second half being Ma's (Brie Larson) story and in the third half it flip flops between the two. That being said theirs still something  there that stopped me from fully caring about the Ma character, don't get me wrong there are some moments but not to the full extent were it hit me and I thought  really care for her, but seeing the story from Jack's view kind of makes that a lesser problem. The script is beautifully done, but there are some question that will go unanswered in the movie or some things that I still wanted to know or for the movie to explore a little bit more. Overall this is a good movie and recommend to at least check it out.",

And, wow, was it worth it. ROOM is, pun intended, captivating! #BrieLarson (seen earlier this year as #AmySchumer\u00e2??s sister in #Trainwreck) stars as a mother being held (against her will) in a shed. As the film opens, we see Larson\u00e2??s #Ma \u00e2??playing house\u00e2?? with her 5 year old son, Jack (played by breakout star #JacobTremblay). We later come to learn that Ma has been held there for 7 years and that this room, the shed, is the only world Jack has ever known.\n \nRecent events lead Ma to make a dramatic attempt to escape (I\u00e2??ll let you see for yourself what those events are). Eventually, Ma and Jack are rescued, which sets up the last act of the film: Ma and Jack\u00e2??s reacclamation (or acclamation in Jack\u00e2??s case) to the \u00e2??outside world.\u00e2?? To shield Jack from their confined surroundings of the room, Ma had recreated a very imaginative world for Jack. Although being held captive by another person, Ma was the only person Jack knew.\n \nThe post-escape is almost as thrilling as the presentation of life in the room. It was interesting to see how Ma and Jack are, ironically, held captive by their newfound freedom. The film is indeed great and a must-see. The only gripe is that there was a few plot elements that were left unresolved (or forgotten) all-together. Some plots went in a different direction than I expected (that\u00e2??s a good thing). But others were left hanging, but were initially presented with an air of importance.\n \n#JoanAllen and #WilliamHMacy costar as Ma\u00e2??s parents. Their lives were turned upside down when Ma went missing. Now, they must piece things together while trying to comfort Ma and Jack, a grandchild they never knew they have.\n \nLarson and Tremblay\u00e2??s performances are rock solid. Larson will give #CateBlanchett (from #Carol) a run for her money come #Oscar night. ROOM is playing in limited release, but worth the effort to find it.\n \nMy score: #9outof10",

The story follows a mother, Joy, and her son, Jack, who have been living in one small room for the past 5 years. The reason is unknown until about half hour into the movie, so I won't spoil it. Anyways, at one point they get out and Jack hasn't been out of that room, ever. So, this is his first time seeing the outside world and it's really beautiful seeing that, I have to admit. How he is ignorant of everything and discovering everything for the first time. Joy has to deal with a lot of media and her parents and it's all very over-the-top dramatic. That's about the only problem I had with this movie. The overly dramatic plot revolving around Joy. It's interesting at first, but it just keeps going and going and it gets to the point where you're just tired of her character, albeit her actress is amazing. And so is everyone, really. There weren't any bad actors, not even the kid! The direction is great and the first 40 minutes of the movie which are entirely set in the small room look outstanding! I was always fascinated by the movies that are set in small spaces and how the directors manage to make them look bigger and more interesting. The soundtrack is great. All in all, Room is a movie deffinetely worth seeing as it is very emotional, the story is intriguing and the acting is brilliant. Not my best movie of the year, but near the top!",

This film shows the power that a simple story can bring to the viewer and is one that is told in such a heartbreaking and thought-provoking manner. Watching this film, I completely forgot at times that I was even watching a movie and I was completely captivated and effected by all the situations going on. The performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay are truly incredible here and together have portrayed one of the best mother-son relationships I have ever seen in a long time in a movie. With Short Term 12 and this under Brie Larson's belt, I am going to look forward to everything she does in the future and I hope she gets a Oscar nomination for this performance because it was memorable and one of the best performances I have seen from an actress in 2015. Brie Larson did a fantastic job portraying a mother who cares deeply for her son and will do anything for him and when she started having mental problems toward the final hour of the film, I felt completely sad for her and her son. Jacob Tremblay as the son was fantastic as well and he gave one of the best performances I have seen from a child in a long time and I hope that he will be in many more great movies in the future. Being a kid raised in an enclosed environment, I completely understood him whenever he would feel a certain way towards life or towards his own mother and there were a lot of heartbreaking and touching moments with them together. The dialogue in the film was fantastic as well. The conversations that Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay had were completely engrossing and her telling him about the outside world was all the more memorable to watch and listen to. There were many times during the first half of the film where I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see how they would gain their freedom and I was left breathless when those scenes ended. Joan Allen as the grandma of Jacob Tremblay's Jack was really likable and she showed a great amount of emotion in the second half of the film and gave a better than average supporting performance. While William H. Macy was a great presence as the grandpa, I could have had more scenes with him dealing with these heartbreaking situations, but because everything else was so good, his limited amount of screen time only felt like a minor problem and didn't detract from the film.  Being from a small time director, Lenny Abrahamson shows here that he can get nothing but the best out of these actors and the simple premise, and I look forward to what he does next after this. In the end, I really had no major issues with this film and this was a movie that I was completely floored by and one that I can't wait to see again when it comes out on Blu-ray.",

The boy who is 5 only knows the room its all he has seen,everything else is fake in the world. Just imagine thinking like that. Its completely mind numbing. Room is an emotional tale, that pulls on your heart strings, and touches you completely. I had tears in my eyes on my instances. The films 2nd hr loses its pace after the escape for captivity,it gets sluggish. Brie Larson and the young boy Jacob Tremblay were amazing, they showed a range of emotions. Room is an emotional must watch film.\n\n4/5*",

The film is split into two distinctive parts, Act 1 taking place primarily in Room, the shed, and focuses on a bit of the day-to-day life of its inhabitants, mother and son Joy and Jack. Captured when she was 17, Joy has been locked in Room for seven years and had her captor's, Old Nick as he is called, son. Jack is now a rambunctious, excited five-year-old who has only known Room for his entire life. Joy has made it her mission to protect her son and keep him innocent to the horror of their reality for most of his young life, but now must make him understand in order to get him on her side to escape. Their escape is a success, but leads into the next part: adjusting to life outside. Jack follows his mother through their journey to become part of the free world. Brie Larson embodies every instinct and insecurity of Joy in her performance, conveying a young mother's fears and connection with her child as well as a young woman's fears of having to be responsible for everything in her small uncontrolled world. Larson is complimented by her costar, Jacob Tremblay, a remarkably talented young actor who truly owns the screen.",

And that works wonder. It places us right in the middle of the claustrophobia of the two main characters, Joy and her son Jack. The first third of the film made me almost as uncomfortable as I was during the whole masterpiece film, \"The Act of Killing.\" \n\nThere are so many times when this film could have gone awry, sappy and melodramatic. In fact, the sappiest thing about the film was the music, being far too uplifting and loud for the themes in the movie. \n\nThe framing of each shot in the first-third of the movie augments the feeling of being trapped. The shots are as beautiful as they are terrifying. \n\nThe acting of the two main characters is spot on, especially the five-year-old boy Jake, played by Jacob Tremblay. Brie Larson plays the complicated role of Joy, the mother, who goes through untold agony. We aren't told what happens in detail; we see it on her face, in her body.\n\nThere were so many times this film could have gone for cheap sentimentality; they could have gone for the easy reconciliation and happy ending, and it didn't. Put one in the win column for small, well writing, well directed and well acted cinema that doesn't involve stunts or explosions. \n\nRating: Pay Full Price\n\n\"Room\" is excellent. While it didn't play for cheap emotion and the issues it addresses are horrifying, it could have used more detail regarding the aftermath of events for the mother. The son's issues were dealt with well if not completely. The framing of the shots? Fantastic! The music? Terrible. \n\nBrie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deserve Oscars nominations. ??\n\nPeace,?\nTex Shelters",

Both deliver breathtaking performances that seem real and utterly believable. Perhaps, the greatest compliment they can be given is that at times you almost forget that they're 'acting'. Director Lenny Abrahamson uses these actors beautifully to tell a story with a universal message of hope. A message so powerful that it makes you appreciate your own life.",

This is a film, not a movie.The movie geek in me liked it a lot...brought me to tears a couple of times (but then I am in a weepy state right now so maybe it was just me). The intermittent voiceover throughout is the little boy, trying to describe the world through his own eyes. I will only share this: It is the story of a young woman who was kidnapped off the street at 17 and then locked in a room by a sicko man for 7 years, where she also gave birth to a little boy who turns 5 as the movie opens. The title is where they lived \"Room\" which was his only world until they escaped and a world that he often misses as he's trying to figure out what is real and not real and where his comfort lies. The performances are grade A. I give it a 4.5 as a film but don't recommend it for those of you who are looking for lighter  entertainment.",

Don't get me wrong - I still enjoyed it and the actors did some great work (even though there were some false moments, such as Jack's inability to handle a phone: Really?! That bright and adaptive kid who was so curious about everything and spent so much time observing people couldn't really get the chance to see others speak on the phone in the long weeks he spent in his grandmother's house?!) but the second half had a bit of a dragging problem, as if it they didn't know where to go with that story for a while. But I was immersed in it, mostly due to the unassuming visual flair. And the performances: wow, these performance by Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson were hypnotic! I especially loved the craziness in the room, especially Brie's moments of clarity when she had to convince Jack of going through with her plan. There was something manic about her character and this ambiguity felt real to me. And Jacob Tremblay - I know this is such an extreme pitfall of a role and he makes it look so easy and there are so many layers and details to this experience of a performance. Go watch them.",

You won't want to look away from them-not that director Lenny Abrahamson lets you. He never tries to distract you from the fact that there's two people on screen the whole time. He embraces it. It's a wise decision.\n\nAbrahamson displays an unnerving knack for extracting emotion. The thinness of the plot is an issue with the source material, and what could have been a hokey feel-good or a crime thriller is instead a tribute to love, life, and human strength that (almosts) steers free of being overly sentimental.\n\nThe performances are delivered in expert hands that know just when to slow down and let them breathe, when to cut, when to jack up the intensity. We get familiar with closeups and extreme closeups, and it works. The minimalist soundtrack is gorgeously composed and holds our attention during the many diaglogue-free sequences. The same stands for set design and locations. They're inobstrusive and they complement the film's true strengths. The emotional complexity that stirs (or roars) in every scene. The flawless acting. The characters and relationships that are built with such care and attention to nuance that the film's few falters are easily forgivable.\n\nA chance for a thriller moment is fumbled in the scene when Jack and Old Nick are approached by the first stranger with his dog. Perhaps Abrahamson felt that a more amped up exchange would have been an easy gimmick, but there was definitely something lost in choosing not to dial up the intensity here. The moment called for it.\n\nRegardless, Abrahamson's intuition for storytelling is obvious and refreshing. I only ask that he trust himself more. The pacing is organic, the shots are thoughtfully structured, and he knows how to work within the confines of the story. The film connects. And it does that without the triter voiceovers from Jack and the spots of heavy-handed sappiness (especially in the haircut scene). The music supports the movie well, and so it reaches too-cheesy levels when the film does. We don't need to be cued so obviously as to what and when we're supposed to feel. If you've done the job well, and Abrahamson has, we'll get there on our own.",

To give away anymore would be giving away too much of the plot.  If you've read the book you've obviously got an idea of what happens however, for those that are not aware of this film I beg you to go in with no preconceptions and for gods sake do not watch the trailer (unless you want the whole thing spoiled).\n\nWhat you get from Room is a very powerful and emotive film with excellent performances from Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (played by Jacob Tremblay, a relative newcomer whose only previous release was voicing a Smurf).  The supporting cast including Joan Allen and William H. Macy also put in good performances.  However it's the mother and son which deserve the plaudits.  Brie Larson, who up until now appears to have been in mostly supporting roles in films such as 21 Jump Street and Scott Pilgrim vs the World, however in Room she really displays her acting capabilities and from this performance she should be a contender for best actress when award season comes around.  \n\nAs you watch Room, the second half of the film feels like there isn't much happening however, this is a film about the experience and emotions of these two characters and how their confides mold their lives and the effects it has on them psychologically.  There are moments when seemingly innocent scenarios dispense a sense of fear, paranoia and tension which are caused as a result of the predicament they find themselves in.  There are also moments elation and unexpected humour.  But it's that sense of paranoia and fear especially with regards to children which is a reflection of today's society and is depicted here so well which makes this film both true and sad in equal measure.  Room can be tough and unpleasant viewing, I saw it as part of Odeon's Screen Unseen and I probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise but I've very glad that I did.",

            "content": "A very harrowing tale about a mother and her son being held captive in a very small room.\nThe movie starts out and we are introduced to young Jack and his mother.  They are in a tiny room, and have minimal space, resources and food.  We learn that she was abducted and has been held for 7 years in a desperate dire situation.  While there she has gave birth to a boy who is now 5.  All he knows is this room.\n\nLet's get something straight here.  Bri Larson was unreal.  Her acting chops were off the charts. Jacob Tremblay however was just as good as her son.  \nHe did a phenomenal job with his emotions.  The bond felt genuine, and I really believed it happened to these two.\n\nThe first part of the movie deals with the captivity and how they interact with each other, how she tries to teach him of a world outside the room.\nPart 2 deals with their escape.  How in the world could you deal mentally with the 7 years that you have suffered?  \nNow free mother and son try their hardest to adjust. He learns of the world, and how to interact with others.  The trasnformation on display from Tremblay is just fantastic.  He grows bit by bit, and learns more of the world.  He just is awesome here.\n\nBrie Larson also has a believable trasnformation on screen and she tries to cope with her life back in the real world, and tries to raise her son and get him to a normal place.\n\nJust a fantastic movie fueled by a harrowing story that really had an affect on my emotions.   A great movie moves you and this one did just that.",

But something wasn't quite right. It should be noted that Jacob Tremblay has perhaps the best performance by a child actor ever. And Brie Larson as his mother is mostly terrific. It's one of the most emotional films of the year, and I think that is mostly its saving grace, as it helps mask some flaws. But I also can think of few films that everyone should see. This is one for sure. I could honestly go for about 2 more hours of watching Tremblay experience \"World\" elements for the first time. I can completely understand the immense amount of love for this one, but at the moment, I'm lukewarm on the overall package.",

            "content": "Based on the novel by Emma Donoghue, this film is a small story driven independent harrowing dramatic thriller. And like many of its kind, the film has to rely on a great screenplay, solid acting, and moving character development for it to get wide recognition. The film delivers on all of these aspects. Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) has adapted the best-selling novel with grace and grandeur. Here is a film so artistically unique and deviant, chock full of genuine emotion thanks to two outstanding performances, that isn't afraid to take risks and surprise at every turn. The entire idea of 'room,' the abstract concept of space, is ever-present in the production. In their bubble of room, Ma and Jack are restricted, as evident by Abrahamson's close angles and tight shots. The small space allows for high concept filmmaking, and when they get out of room, it only gets better, with a new color palette and experimental camera angles through Jack's eyes. The entire film is seen through the eyes of this child, and it's genius. The title of the film makes the film about the space in our lives and in our selves and our need to escape whatever walls or restrictions that others \u0097 or we ourselves \u0097 have imposed on us. So our experience really is reflected in this freakish story. The film is about the vast room we have at our disposal not the small room to which we might accept restriction. This couldn't be further from Lenny Abrahamson's last film Frank, a bizarre music-orientated comedy. Gone are the idiosyncrasies that made Frank wild and, for many including myself, compelling, instead we have a moving drama that earns its sentiment. The concept of a mother having raised her son in confinement then finally breaking free has many avenues to explore. Having not read Emma Donoghue's book, of whom also wrote the screenplay, I mostly expected a small scale -getting out of the eponymous room then reuniting and resolving itself there. Instead, the film goes further than I expected, getting Ma \u0096 also known as Joy, which is becoming a familiar character's name this year \u0096 and Jack back to her teenage home with her own mother. The story follows twenty-something Joy aka Ma (Brie Larson) and five year-old Jack (Jacob Tremblay), inside a garden shed. We are, of course, unaware that this is a garden shed, but the size is what's immediately noticeable. Small, dark, and dank, with a single skylight. Jack, the product of Ma's kidnapping despite her insistence of his immaculate conception, is oblivious to the space of the room, or lack thereof, and equally of the world outside it. Most nights, a man called \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers) visits the room to have sex with Ma. But Jack doesn't understand this custom, instead letting his imagination dream up a world of wonderment, all existing neatly in the boundaries of the room \u0096 where a mouse joyfully nibbles on some scraps and where his imaginary dog Lucky can frolic. In Jack's mind, the only reality is inside the room, and everything on the other side of the wall is most certainly outer space. After one particularly traumatizing night, when Jack wanders out of his hiding spot to observe the sleeping adults and is frightened by both Nick and an instance of physical violence against Ma, the fatigued woman realizes that she must coach the young boy into aiding with an escape plan to finally rid them of the restrictive imprisonment of the room. Providing any more details would soften the impact of the film, and this is one that is meant to be felt \u0096 even if it's a true kick in the gut. For the first half of the film, we as viewers are held prisoners right along with Ma and Jack. We see what a patient and wonderful mother she is as she strives to provide some semblance of hope for her son, though in a nearly hopeless situation. When Jack turns 5, Ma begins to explain the outside world to him, as she knows they must try to escape in order for her son to have any semblance of a normal life. During this time, we are in awe of this 10 x 10 environment and how it is every bit the nightmare we have imagined while reading the articles and seeing the reports on real life ordeals. The second half of the film is equally fascinating, as we watch young Jack and his sense of wonder and caution at discovering the real world. We also see the psychological trauma that Ma experiences after staying strong for so long. Assimilating into society brings different challenges for both Ma and Jack, plus those of her mother (Joan Allen), her father (William H Macy) and her mom's new beau (Tom McCamus). The film doesn't shy away from their reactions, though some are easier to stomach than others. The different approach is felt immediately as Abrahamson traps us with his two principle characters, Ma and Jack, in tight and sometimes oddly framed closeups. It's a somewhat clumsy execution to show the claustrophobia and intimacy Abrahamson wants to achieve as he uses Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay's faces as blank canvases, but the effect is thoroughly felt, and the film's following 30 minutes remain its best. The photography decides to take a step back, but it continues to catch that raw emotion. Then, in a way, it doesn't go far enough. But it's interesting to watch it play in its happy medium. It does rely on some key contrivances to get there, such as the kidnapper's wonky perception and ultimately not fighting hard enough when he could have, but that doesn't take away from the gripping escape sequence as the orchestra swells and squeezes tears from you whether you like it or not. The only criticism of the directorial style was the lapse in direction that the story was supposed to take towards the end of the film. The entire time the story was told through the eyes of Jack. However, towards the last part of the movie, there was a shift that included some of Ma's point of view. This slightly took away from the ways a five year old would try to explain certain behaviors or actions of adults. Also, for those who have read the book, don't expect the movie to include every aspect of it. Just like every other film based on books, graphic novels, comics, or even true events, only certain aspects can be adapted and some must be altered in order to try and make the best move possible. The performances are superb and so consistent with the storyline, there isn't any pretense that any of this was stage or acted. The relationships are well developed within the timeframe of the movie and are delightfully varied to reveal the breadth of human responses to such a tragedy. Brie Larson had not only shown potential but delivered the goods with 2013's Short Term 12. It's a similar environment here with devoted maternal instincts but this time it's pushed to the brink of her skills as an actress. She's drenched in this exasperation that speaks to years of exhaustion. In the tone of her primal performance, she paints a full rich portrait of Joy's whole life from her carefree teen years to her brutal capture by Old Nick when she was 17, to every little story and lesson she's told Jack. Joy's constantly revising the way she raises Jack and while there's bumps in the road, it's a complete picture of motherhood. She balances resilience and vulnerability, hope and dejection with a fine tooth comb. Most times she commands the screen and offers one of the year's best performances. It's a film about the harsh realities of growing up, operating for both of the main characters, and it's a very sensitive and emotionally potent portrayal. Speaking of which, Jacob Tremblay may be the frontrunner for most supporting actor awards as his performance is better then a lot of child actors. How they got a kid this young to pull off the necessary emotions that few adult can properly show off? I don't know, but this is defiantly his movie. Is perception on the world and the adults around him remind us why we were frightened by the rest of the world as children. When our parents aren't around, we might as well be on an alien planet, stepping around strange sounds and sights. This child made me realize how one can see the world differently at a different age. Joan Allen, as Joy's mother, is heartfelt and shows unconditional love in a wonderfully nuanced way, whereas William H. Macy, Joy's father, is regretfully underused but doing the 'in over his head' thing Macy does best. On the whole, 'Room' is an emotional journey through trauma and discovery with the help of a very strong storytelling and acting. Room fell short in some aspects, though they did not sufficiently diminish the overall experience of the film. It brings different concepts for those to learn from, such as the importance of family, experience, and empathy towards others. If you want to escape the confinements of recent big budget films, or want to experience something moving that you will not forget, go see Room. The film deserves a watch!",

I met Brie Larson and she said to me \"Nice meeting you Doc Afshan\". I also asked her the question which she answered to my full satisfaction. I really liked Brie Larson that being on such great heights of success she is such a down to earth person. Not only is she beautiful but also so warm to talk as if you are talking to your friend whom you know for ages.\nRoom is  a 2015 Canadian-Irish drama thriller film written by Emma Donoghue, based on her best- selling novel of the same name and directed by Lenny Abrahamson  The film stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H. Macy. It was shown in the special presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, after premiering at Telluride Film Festival. The film is scheduled to be released in a limited release on October 16, 2015, before being released nationwide on November 6, 2015, by A24 Films .\nIn this film I saw my Jugaad philosophy as the actress Brie Larson in order to escape from the sexual abuse she thought out of the box and came up with a successful strategy. My Jugaad philosophy is explained in detail in the book which I have written:\n My Book:  The Modern Mughal Mentality-New Strategies to Succeed in India and the Global Marketplace  (http://www.amazon.com/Afshan-Naheed-Hashmi/e/B010A8XBLG/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1)\n Hollywood and Bollywood  has always inspired me. All the actors have done a wonderful job especially Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. The movie touches the sensitive topic of sexual abuse with a child born out of this relationship. The journey of seven years in that room and also a five-year child living with her mother.  Jacob Tremblay  a 8-year-old child's acting mesmerized me. Not only me but everybody who sees the film will adore him.\nYou will love the movie and will be engrossed in seeing the movie as it takes beautiful turns and twists.. I predict that this movie is really Oscar -winning material.\nI highly recommend this movie and give it 5 stars.\n Some memorable moments from the event:\nhttps://goo.gl/photos/Q4m95YZMsT9vFkKn9\n Here is the you tube link of the Q and A:\n        https://youtu.be/B9qJsOTsFFo\n To know more about the movie please visit the following sites:\nTrailer of the Film:\nhttps://youtu.be/E_Ci-pAL4eE\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_%282015_film%29\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A24_Films\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brie_Larson\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Tremblay\nCheers from your loving Film-critic and Author!\nDr.Afshan Naheed Hashmi\nwww.afshanhashmi.com\nwww.drafshanhashmi,com",

It is also the story of a young boy whose whole live has been lived within the confines of that shed coming to experience the real world for the first time. For five-year-old Jack (Jacob Tremblay) the world is only as wide as the one room he & his mother have shared. His concept of reality is the present physical existence as he knows it versus the \"not real\" portrayed on television. When Ma realizes that Jack's youth & her protection will soon not be enough to safeguard him from their captor Old Nick (Sean Bridgers) Ma devises a plan for Jack's escape. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson from a screenplay written by Emma Donoghue who adapted her best-selling novel of the same name, Room is the intensely emotional story of a mother's love & protection of her child. Just as in her previous performance in Short Term 12, Brie Larson delivers a marvelous performance that is both fierce & heartbreaking.

Ma was abducted about eight years ago in the film plot. Jack is living in a reality that is only portrayed in his personal window to the world, the television. Ironically the real window of the world for Ma is the skylight in this room, she can see the seasons and the time of the day, but for Jack is nothing. He don't know how the real world is and his sense of space is limited but the fact that Ma is the only person that he ever interacted. For Jack the room is a confined world but is a world of fantasies, sounds, smells and strange voices ( Old Nick paying a visit to Ma every night for sex)\n\nMa tries to give Jack some education by making him read books like Alice and Wonderland, but Ma also wants to escape and give Jack the life that he deserve. The process won't be easy...The escape is a beautiful and poetic moment which is also the biggest revelation for Jack been free for the first time. \n\nThe film Room is a very difficult film to watch, is a movie about the love of a mother for his child, the wounds of a person been abducted for years, the adaptation of a little boy to the real world, but also is a movie about justice and human and family values.\n\nBrie Larson is outstanding in this role as well Jacob Tremblay, the film, is really well edited and well directed who carefully crafted with the art direction team the perfect space to make the audience feel locked in that Room.\n\nOne of the lack in this movie is the development of Ma's dad Robert Newsome (Willam H Macy) his character become important when a pivotal moment happen in the movie and later vanished from everyone's mind.",

            "content": "Which of the following situations would you find the most traumatic? (1) You are kidnapped, removed from everyone and everything you know and love, never knowing if you will ever be free again. (2) You are born into a captivity in which you know hardly anything about what most people take for granted as \"the world\" and then are suddenly thrust into that world with almost no understanding of what you're seeing, what to do or how to behave. Stop. Think about it. Either situation would be a horribly upsetting and disorienting to experience. We see both situations play out in the fictional drama \"Room\" (R, 1:58). Although the film is not based on any specific real-life story, it does have a strong basis in reality - in the cases that we occasionally see on the news or in a true-crime TV drama. A young woman is taken captive by a monstrous person who holds her for years against her will. In some cases, innocent children are born into such situations, knowing nothing but confinement, with only a mother's love to depend on. \n\nJoy Newsome (Brie Larson) was seventeen when a man who claimed that he needed help with a sick dog abducted Joy and imprisoned her in the garden shed in his back yard. The man (Sean Bridgers), whose name Joy didn't know (simply referring to him as \"Old Nick\") kept Joy as a sex slave, bringing her just enough food and other essentials to survive. He brought her supplies once a week, but visited her for sex every night. Eventually, Old Nick's ongoing rape of Joy produced a baby boy.  Joy named him Jack. Jack only knows Joy as \"Ma\". He has never even seen Old Nick. At a set time every night, Joy sends Jack to sleep on the floor of the wardrobe in the corner of the room. Old Nick punches a code into the door's electronic lock. He enters. He does \"his business\" and leaves. Jack is now free to climb into bed with Ma.\n\nThe days belong to Joy and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). He's now five years old. He has never had a haircut, never seen a doctor and never left Room. The wardrobe where he sleeps when Old Nick comes calling, Ma's bed, a toilet, bathtub, sink, toaster oven, small table and old television is all Jack has ever known. As far as he knows, the world he sees on TV is all made up and the small skylight in the roof of the shed is outer space. To Jack, there simply is nothing else but Room, the mysterious voice of Old Nick, and Ma. For her part, Joy does all she can for Jack. She \"cooks\" the meager rations that Old Nick brings and she breastfeeds Jack. She's his teacher, his playmate, his protector and, basically the only person who exists.\n\nAs hard as Joy works to make a life for her and Jack in Room, their situation is starting to change, calling their long-term survival into question. Joy has tried to escape before, but it becomes clear to her that she has to try again. Maybe Jack is now old enough to help - if she can get him to understand her plan. It isn't a spoiler to reveal that Joy's escape plan works, because that is what the second half of this movie is about. Joy is reunited with her mother (Joan Allen) and father (William H. Macy), who are now divorced. Joy and Jack move in with her mother and her mother's boyfriend (Tom McCamus) who do their best to help Joy and Jack adjust to their newfound freedom, with all that means for each of them.\n\nThese adjustments aren't be easy. Jack has to learn... everything that you and I take for granted about our world. Joy has to try to get past the emotional trauma of seven years of captivity and having raised a son in that environment. Then, of course, there are certain legal questions that a family lawyer is now there to handle... and the media circus that naturally accompanies such stories in real life. This film doesn't dwell on the legal or public aspects of this case, but those elements are there in the background, even while this dramatically changed family focuses on finding a way to forge fresh bonds and move forward in the most difficult of situations.\n\n\"Room\" is as remarkable as the story it portrays. Basing the film on the 2010 novel by Emma Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay) frees the plot to explore a wide variety of issues without being confined to the details of one specific real-life case. Telling the story through Jack's eyes (complete with a judicious use of well-written narration by the boy) helps us to understand the wide ranging implications of such an experience for Jack, his mother and his newfound family. Director Lenny Abrahamson takes full advantage of these story-telling opportunities with his use of camera angles and the markedly different tone in the movie's very different halves. Topping it all off are exceptionally affecting performances by all the main characters - especially Larson and Tremblay. Although the pacing of the film sometimes lags unnecessarily, there is no criticizing this film's emotional impact and the importance of the lessons that it teaches its audience. I have no room to give this film anything less than an \"A\".",

            "content": "Room is directed by Lenny Abrahamson and stars Brie Larson, Jacob Tremblay, Joan Allen, Sean Bridgers, and William H. Macy. \nThe film is about a woman named Joy \"Ma\" Newsome who was abducted and held captive in a room for seven years, and her son, Jack who is five years old and has been living inside that particular room his entire life. The film follows their attempt at escaping from that place and as we see through Jack's eyes, his experience of the outside world for the first time in his life.\nThis is definitely at the top of my best movies of the year, simply because it is incredibly done and perfectly portrayed. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give some of the best performances I've ever seen in my life in any movie what so ever. The kid, Jacob, is phenomenal and surprisingly he carries it all throughout. You'd think that an amazing actress like Brie, and her character would be the center of the movie but that's actually not the case. As she says so in the movie, her kid saves her many times, and that goes to show just how different and amazingly done this movie really is. \nThe director (Lenny Abrahamson) also did a very good job here, as he kept us interested and entertained through the first part of the movie when they're in the room. That is really hard to do, considering that there are not much things to do or a lot of different ways to go about it but this director did it. The music composed by Stephen Rennicks is very touching and gives those very much needed and present emotional moments meaning and heart. \nI think that one of the main reasons as to why this movie worked so wonderfully well was the screenplay written by the author of the original book that this movie is based upon, Emma Donoghue. More movies should take notice of this and be loyal to the main source because that's the best way to succeed at making an adaptation.\nI pretty much loved everything about this movie, it was touching, filled with incredible performances, very good cinematography, great directing that conclude to the perfectness that this movie is.",

            "content": "With marvelous performances from Tremblay and Larson, \"Room\" is an emotional and life bending journey that will leave you speechless.\n\n'Room\" is a novel adaptation that follows the story of a mother who was taken captivity as a  young teenager. She gave birth to her son, Jack, and was left with no choice but to raise him in a small, confined room. For five years, all Jack knew was that room, and all he had was his mother. Through life changing events, they soon escape Room and must figure out how to make their way in the real world.\n\nTo start out, this movie was amazing. Congratulations to Brie Larson for winning best female actress for her performance here because she truly deserves it. She put on an amazing emotional performance and although she was the star of the film, someone here overtook her spot as best performer in my opinion. With no disrespect, Jacob Tremblay was amazing. He is by far one of the best child actors I've seen in years, and there were more than a few moments where he left my tongue tied. He was so natural for his role and fit perfectly, and at no point did I say \"I'm watching actors on screen\", rather, I felt as though I was watching real people. Those are really the two primary actors throughout the film and they were both perfect. All of the supporting actors, such as Joan Allen and Tom McCamus, all played their roles well, and impressed in small screen time. You should see this movie for the performances alone.\n\nI really fell for the screenplay and the directing in this movie. I really loved all of the little details and the overall story of \"Room\", and the writer really knows how to put so much depth into a single story. This child, Jack, is raised in a single room with limited tangible objects, but he is raised to believe that this is the entire world. The Mother, Joy, has lived here for more than half a decade, and is at the point where she's in agony. The only thing she really has left to live for is her son, and throughout the film, you can really see the difficulties that she has to go through. Seeing one character who's mostly content, and another who can barely live makes for two strong parallels within the film. I really loved the psychological impact upon the characters that resulted due to this isolation, and this movie felt so real. \n\nUltimately, the movie isn't entirely about the people and their experience in this room, but rather the impact that this had on their lives and their struggle to adapt to the real world. It shows on both characters, especially the son, who must make major leaps at such a young age. The movie hits you at an emotional level, and is an intelligent film in every way.\n\nI actually enjoyed the pacing of this movie, and I felt that it moved at a solid pace. I was always intrigued by the current events on screen and it managed to tell this story in an inspiring way. They spent about the first hour of the movie within Room, and spent the last half of the film outside of Room. Going into the film, I expected the film to stay in Room for less than half of the run time. Although I was interested none the less, I do wish they spent less time in Room and spent more time on the outside so that we could see their struggles just a bit more, but that doesn't damage the experience of watching this movie in the end.\n\nThere were also many moments where I was on the verge of tears, and at the very lest, feeling goosebumps up and down my arm. If you think about it, this movie really is dark, but still has an uplifting an inspiring message. For those who really appreciate the art of film making, and for those who want to see amazing screenplays, then watch this film.\n\nThere were also a few moments where I saw the awkward adaptation from novel to film. When a book is put on the big screen, there are obvious moments that few eyes can see (eyes who haven't read the book) that make the film feel a bit sloppy. There are just a couple things or moments that feel out of place, and it seems as though the book went more in depth on a few things that the film lacked on.\n\nIn the end, \"Room\" is probably one of my favorite movies of the year. It was an emotional ride that impressed me throughout. However, I do wish they spent less time in Room, because it felt like they were rushing a bit in the second half to cram the story in. There was also one unresolved side plot that was left untouched, and I would've liked to see everything resolved. I still had a great experience with this film, and if it weren't for those flaws I stated above, this movie would've received a perfect rating. However, I still encourage everyone to view this movie.",

            "content": "It's hard to think of a more emotionally grueling and uplifting movie this year than Room. It drops you right into a scary world and, thanks to its carefully balanced tone, the film eschews sensationalism and gets at the beating heart of its survival story, namely the love and protection of a mother for her son. It is an emotionally powerful story that hits the big moments, the small moments, and everything in between. It left me analyzing it and rethinking it for hours, the repercussions still reverberating through me. \n\nMa (Brie Larson) has been held in a single soundproof room for seven years, the captive of an older man who is termed \"Old Nick\" (Sean Bridgers). Complicating matters is that Ma has a five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) born into this captivity. It is the only world he's known. To spare him the full horror of their circumstances, Ma has created an elaborate world for him that only exists in Room. After his fifth birthday, Ma tries speaking honestly to her son, lifting the veil of kind fabrications. Together they will scheme to escape their one-room world, but it comes with tremendous cost. \n\nIt would be easy to fall onto the more seemly elements of this harrowing story and linger on just how bad things are and the horrifying lengths that Ma has to go through to survive. Director Lenny Abrahamson (Frank) doesn't have to wallow in depravity to get its point across. There's a sensitivity that manages to temper some of the abuse in a manner that won't make you run out of the room screaming. When Old Nick enters the room for his special time with Ma, we don't need explicit detail to understand what is happening and what Ma is shielding Jack from by demanding he stay in the closet. The reality of their captivity is enough without underlining the worst of the worst for the lowest common denominator. The emotional weight of everything is clear without having to be bludgeoned. The implications are always just peaking around the corners from the safer version of reality Ma has proposed to protect her child. As the audience, we can see the cracks, we can see her front, and we can see the effort and the toll it's taking on Ma. The stakes are clear as well, and so when Ma is instructing Jack and preparing him on their joint escape plan, you'll start to feel waves of anxiety travel through your body. I was shaking with suspense that something could go wrong but also because Ma and Jack are such vulnerable characters that rely upon one another completely. I knew what was going to happen in broad strokes but I was still on the edge of my seat and that's because the movie made me deeply care about the characters and their plight. The escape scene was on par with some of the better suspense sequences in the equally brilliant Sicario. \n\nIt's not really a spoiler to say that Ma and Jack do get out of their one-room prison because the second half of the film deals with the ongoing consequences and challenges of adjustment. We'd like to think that we can be plugged into our old lives after spending time away, but that's just not how things work, let alone for people who have experienced substantial psychological and physical trauma. Ma is struggling to readjust to her old life under the care of her mother, Nancy (Joan Allen). She looks through old high school pictures and you can tell she laments \"what could have been\" and even bears some resentment for her old friends who got to live the lives she should have had. Just because she's free doesn't mean she's better. Her father Robert (William H. Macy), since divorced from Ma's mother, can't even look at Jack because of the pain it causes; Jack is a child of rape, but Ma demands he be acknowledged as her flesh-and-blood, and even that can be too much too soon for Robert. He's more about seeking justice through the courts and as a result stays on the peripheral of the story for most of the movie. There is no exact time table for PTSD and Ma goes through highs and lows, none lower than when pressed with the question of why she held onto Jack after he was born. Would he not have had a better life in someone else's care, assuming Old Nick would have abandoned him rather than kill his own blood? It's a hard question and it stings. \n\nFor an obviously punishing story about the worst of humanity, I am not kidding when I say Room is an uplifting film. The darkness is easy to identify and Old Nick is a fearsome and all too real antagonist, one who could roam our very streets in anonymity. However, what stays with me several days after watching Room is not the suffering but the resiliency of spirit, the knack human beings have to persevere amidst the worst. Ma's recovery is rockier but more understandable for us to trace and relate with. Hers is an experience where she can finally begin to focus on something other than her child's safety and deliverance, namely her own well-being. For Jack, there is no playbook. He's spent his entire life inside a small room and never seen the outside world. His sense of understanding has been extremely limited and yet his sense of exploration is alive. Jack slowly and surely builds trusting relationships with Ma's relatives, engaging in other activities, and acclimating to his new surroundings, reforming his sense of the world. It's ultimately Jack who is able to make the greatest breakthrough to his mother, and it's this moment of sacrifice and love that unleashed the last torrent of my tears. Previously I had cried two times over the horrors and Ma's love as her strength, and it was this final moment, this sharing of his \"Strong,\" that let loose the happy tears. \n\nIt should go without saying but Larson gives an exceptionally powerful performance. After 2013's stupendous Short Term 12, I knew this actress was destined for great things, especially the way she can zero in on a character and inhabit them fully. With Ma (she's never given any other name) Larson is able to convey a multitude of emotions, many of which she has to hide from her son out of loving deference. He can't know just how scared and exhausted she is, though these emotions do take over at time. Larson is tremendous as she exhumes maternal might as she does everything in her power to save the two of them. Early on, she's the character we empathize with the most because she's had her world taken from her and hoping to return. She's so resourceful, from the way she's able to answer her son's questions about the world, to the way she's able to practice and drill their escape plan to a child with no concept of \"outside,\" this is a powerful woman driven by the instinct to endure. When Larson's fa\u00e7ade breaks down with Jack, that's when the movie started stabbing me like daggers. In the second half, her character has a long road to go to recovery, if that's even an appropriate word, and Larson gives sensitive and empathetic consideration to every exhausted development. She is easily going to be the one to beat this year for the Best Actress Oscar.\n\nPaired with Larson is the remarkably natural child actor Jacob Tremblay, and his performance is worthy of awards consideration itself. At first his worldview is precocious because of how unique it is, which makes him more a figure of fascination than tragedy. He's bright and active with the world around him, turning household items into useful toys and emotional attachments. The film uses parts of his narration to give better insight into just how he's processing the world he knows versus the world as it exists. These bouts of narration never come across as cloying. As the movie continues, he learns more about how his preconceptions of the world are wrong, but he's more intrigued than frightened. During the escape plan, when Jack gets to see the outside world for the first time, it's a transcendent emotional moment. His guarded behavior around others is necessary as Jack builds positive associations with men who are not Old Nick. Tremblay is utterly magnificent; there is no hint of artifice to his performance, which is especially rewarding considering his is a role that could have been suffocated with eccentricities and tics. You feel like you're watching a child grow before you through supportive nurturing. \n\nWithin the first twenty minutes of watching Room I already knew this was one of the best films of 2015. It just connects so vividly and succinctly, effortlessly powerful and yet skillfully avoiding sensationalism and exploitation while telling an entertaining survival story that still resonates with emotional truth. The performances from mother and son are outstanding and Larson and Tremblay form a heroic duo that take hold of your heart. It doesn't mitigate the darkness or the cruel realities of its premise but Room also doesn't dwell in the darkness, castigating its characters as hapless victims forever broken from their incalculable suffering. They are resourceful and resilient and while their trauma is will not be forgotten it is not the one defining moment of their burgeoning lives. It may sound maudlin but it is the power of love that resonates the longest with Room. That love at first is about protecting the innocent, and then it transforms into healing and acceptance. I hope everybody gets a chance to see Room, a remarkable film with two remarkable performances and plenty to say about the humanizing benefit of love.  \n\nNate's Grade: A",

Following Jack around his tour of the shed, Room immediately gives the audience an idea of the experiences that Jack and his loving \"ma\" have gone through. Knowing nothing of the outside world, Jack has a limited perception of the world, his only experiences coming from television programs and a limited skylight view of the sky, \"Outer Space\". Joy, realizing that she and Jack can no longer live in these conditions, decides that Jack is old enough to know that room isn't all the world is. Questioning her proposition of reality beyond room, Jack throws a fit before calming down and accepting the truth. Soon enough, Joy wants more for her son than solely knowledge of the outside world and begins her plans for their escape. Joy, forging a high fever for Jack, heats his forehead with hot towels, hoping to sell the idea to their captor, a middle-aged and scruffy man by the name of \"Old Nick\". Nick refuses to take Jack to the hospital, instead compromising by bringing antibiotics the next day. Jack and Joy spring to work, coming up with another plan the moment Nick steps out the soundproofed dungeon-like shed. Joy rolls Jack up in a rug, preparing him with the proper instructions for what to do when he is placed in the bed of Nick's truck. Joy sells Nick on the idea that Jack is dead and convinces him to bury Jack somewhere besides his backyard, also forcing Nick to swear that he won't look at Jack's not-so-dead body. Jack follows Joy's instructions carefully and successfully rolls, wiggles, and jumps out of Nick's truck. Jack then bumps into a stranger who calls the cops who then find and free Joy from room and bring the two to a hospital, where they await the arrival of Joy's parents. The remainder of the movie follows Jack and Joy's reintegration into the society they have been held away from for so long, as well as Jack's adaptation to strangers, his family, and the world.\n\n            Though most child actors fail to impress, it would be impossible to overlook the incredible acting of Jacob Tremblay. His portrayal of emotions for such a dark concept is amazing for any actor, but truly marvelous for once so young. As Tremblay ages, one would only hope that he manages to continue to uphold the high standards he has set for himself. Tremblay's performance is truly a spectacle and his mature and emotional acting is sure to catch the eye of the Academy when Oscar season rolls around.\n\n            Danny Cohen, Room's cinematographer, instills meaning in every frame. While still in captivity, Cohen sets the camera just enough off-focus to provide a feeling of subjectivity into the perception of Ma and Jack as captives without detracting audience appeal. Once freed, however, Room's shots flash with brightness before simmering down, showing the journey of Jack as he is thrusted into a bright, sunny, foreign world, a strange reality to him, before he begins to adapt to his new life and new environment. Both beautiful and meaningful, Cohen's cinematography is masterful.\n\nAn instant classic, Room is a masterpiece comprised of beautiful cinematography and fantastic acting. My love for Room knows no boundaries.",

It's also a film that if you're planning on going to see, you shouldn't watch any of the trailers or even read the IMDB synopsis.  Just go out and see one of the best films of the year.  \n\nBrie Larson, who impresses more and more each film she appears in, plays Joy, mother of Jack.  Larson hides the depths of her character for a good portion of the film, which makes the emotional moments all the more powerful later on.  The story of a mother and son trying to escape this 'room' and their whole emotional journey is what drives Room to greatness.  The film itself has a unique structure in that it seems the film could have ended about 45 minutes before it did, but yet it keeps going.  It's not that that time is wasted, but I think the flow and rhythm of the movie isn't always there.  Which is why the emotional moments midway through are what stick out to me most.\n\nJacob Tremblay absolutely kills it as Jack.  At 5 years old and an extremely demanding role, it's hard not to think he deserves some awards attention as well.  He pulls off every emotion that is called of him and his chemistry with Brie Larson couldn't be better.  The supporting cast is really good as well, but that can get into spoiler territory so I'll stick with the two leads.  I also should mention Lenny Abrahamson's directing.  I loved the way he chose to unveil why exactly Jack and his mother are stuck in this room and the revelations that follow.  \n\nRoom as a whole isn't always as smooth as it wants to be, but the performances are among the years best, and I think the story will take you on an unexpected emotional roller coaster.\n\n+Larson\n\n+Tremblay's performance is an anomaly\n\n+Emotional journey\n\n+Meticulous directing\n\n-Second half doesn't live up to the first\n\n8.7/10",

For the son, the room (hence the title) was the whole world since he's spent his entire life in it. And initially, I was like: 'yeah, I'm not really buying this premise.' But once the two finally escape, that's where the strong screenplay and direction come into play. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay give once in a lifetime performances that feel unbelievably genuine. If Brie Larson doesn't win Best Actress then....well, I would say that the Academy would lose credibility but they already did by not giving an oscar to Leonardo DiCaprio *cough* and for not giving Best Score to John Williams for \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" Anyways, whatever faults I found with the film--I'm not even going to bring them up--because they're so miniscule that to do so would just undermine the sheer emotion that the film handles so well. Some of those scenes hit heavy, which only allows Jacob Tremblay's performance to shine through even more. There was one scene where two characters were having an argument and I felt that it could have been written better. The next scene--something happens, no spoilers--and a character yells \"call 911,\" that one phrase was said with such conviction and urgency that for a second, I thought it was real. I actually forgot I was watching a movie. \"Room\" deals with some some serious drama with right amount of subtlety and pure power. It's a film that I can easily recommend but, at the same time, I know that it won't be a viewing experience that one can just sit back and enjoy (there's a lot to admire and respect, though).

Directed by Lenny Abrahamson (Frank), the film is as horrifying as it is hopeful, and it is as beautiful as it is devastating. As dark as it often is, Room is just as inspiring as it is tragic, and its combination of tender storytelling and stirring performances makes for an undeniably affecting viewing experience.",

If you do watch the trailer that's fine, but if you wish to avoid knowing what the \"second half\" of this film is like then you should avoid it.\n\nThat being said, in order to avoid commenting on the second half I am referring to, I'll try to talk about issues explored in the film rather than plot content.\nThe basic premise is that a woman and her son live in a shed, which they refer to as simply \"Room,\" years after the woman's abduction by an older man. Their names are Joy and Jack, and they are very codependent.\n\nWhat I did not expect from this film is that it deals with the theme of perception of reality, and how much the environment has an impact on this perception. Jack has only lived in Room his whole life and knows nothing outside of this life. To maintain his innocence, Joy has had to tell stories to build a certain perspective on reality for her son. One of the best scenes of the film is when Joy decides it is better for Jack to know the truth about the world and reality, and Jack's reaction is heartbreaking and played brilliantly by Jacob Tremblay.\n\nI want to say more, but I feel like I would give too much away if I did. In a nutshell, this film deals with issues I never would have imagined to be tackled in a film with this premise. I recommend you see this film unless you find the premise disturbing, though the film is never violent or graphic.\n3.5/4.0",

Actress Brie Larson does an amazing job portraying a kidnapped victim who is abducted as a young teenager and made to live in an outbuilding in her captor's backyard.  While held captive, she has a child named Jack.  The two are never allowed to leave the \"Room.\"   The five year old boy is played brilliantly by Jacob Tremblay who deserved an Oscar for his convincing performance.  Jack captures the thoughts and emotions that a young boy must feel when his whole world during the first five years of his life is confined between four walls with only a young mother's love to guide and protect him.  Ma, Jack's mother, captures the boundless love of a young mother who is forced to raise a child alone under horrid conditions.  \n\tThe story is one that seems to touch every emotion one can feel and makes you feel each one with painful honesty and intensity.  It is not an enjoyable experience, but one you will be glad that you experienced.",

Quite the opposite. She did everything right, but this movie is extremely real in it's portrayal of such an overwhelming situation. I think this is one of the most honest looks at motherhood I have ever seen. She gets annoyed. She gets tired. She has days when she just needs to be away from him for a little bit. She gets a bit scary at times. She feels inadequate. \nBut she loves Jack. She wants to be everything he see's in her through his tiny 5 year old eyes. \n\nI think this is a near perfect movie.

Its hard to imagine being locked in a room for many years and trying every day to make everything seem like it's perfect, especially when you have a child. Watching this film just made me think about all those women who have been kidnapped and impregnated by men with no way of escape expected through their own child. You can tell that their children give them the strength for hope. Hope that they will be rescued one day and are able to see their loved ones. I was surprised to see the aftermath of them being rescued. It was interesting because the whole time, we felt as if we were them, either the mother or the child because we don't get to see the outside world until they do.\n\nI can't imagine what it must be like to be a child that hasn't seen the outdoors and hasn't been in contact with anyone apart from your mother. Brie Larson does a terrific job as always and I hope that she gets an Oscar for ether this or any movies she has out in the future which are drama. She is an underrated actor. The little boy in this movie was fantastic. He will definitely get a young Hollywood award.\n\nIn the end, I was glad that I did everything in my power to be able to see this because it is a must see.\n\nP.S.

A fascinating drama about a teenage girl abducted and held captive with her son, this movie combines daunting societal isolation with the need for long-term coping mechanisms. The young mother, Joy \"Ma\" Newsome, raises her 5-year old son Jack in captivity until the time comes to try an escape attempt.\n\nWith an extraordinary cast and riveting storyline, \"Room\" is one of this year's best films. Brie Larson, as Ma, achieves her most profound film endeavor to date-easily the best female lead performance so far in 2015. Additionally, there's no drop-off in talent from the supporting cast members.\n\nMatching Larson's exceptional effort is the work of costar, Jacob Tremblay, who magnificently portrays her 5-year old son, Jack. Look for \"Room\" to be both Larson's and Tremblay's career ground-breaking moment. Supporting firepower is provided by Academy Award nominees Joan Allen and William H. Macy--both playing Jack's grandparents.\n\nThis is a chilling tale because it takes moviegoers behind shocking newspaper headlines. What starts off as a mother and son survival drama methodically transitions into a story of a daughter and grandson attempting to reintegrate into society. Tremblay's impressive depiction of Jack's overstimulation to his surroundings packs an emotional punch.\n\nHowever, it's Larson's astonishing and heartfelt role that carries this top-shelf film. Larson's amazing transformation from adolescent teen daughter to hostage, and then from young mother to survivor. With stellar acting from both Larson and Tremblay in particular, \"Room\" captivates and grips the audience. Furthermore, it should also net the pair--and this film--numerous award nominations in the coming months.\n\nGrade: A\n\nBased upon the international best-selling novel \"Room\" by Emma Donoghue, Ma and Jack must coexist in the only world the young boy knows; a 10-foot by 10-foot windowless shed containing a modest bed, toilet, bathtub and small kitchen under an overhead skylight.\n\n\"Room\" is an engrossing film that gets stronger and more compelling with each passing minute. Viewers are given a look inside the appalling and cruel circumstances not reported in our 24-hour news cycles. Beyond the shocking living conditions, we find a physically abusive relationship between Ma and her captor--nicknamed Old Nick. Deprived of all but their most basic human needs, Old Nick can't strip away the pair's imagination and hope.",

It is tense and painful to watch, but it is also filled with hope, a hope that can only come from the love and wonder of a child.

It is an extraordinary piece of filmmaking full of raw emotion and gut-wrenching moments; it is a film that understands the complexities of child psychology, and presents the maternal bond and unconditional love that a mother holds toward her child. Every shot and every second of \"Room\" is harrowing and intense and compelling and unforgettable and heartbreaking, and through Lenny Abrahamson's sure-handed direction and the two powerhouse performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, it tells an incredibly moving story that will leave you with bruises. \"Room\" is by far the best movie I've seen all year: An instant classic and one of a kind masterpiece about love, courage, and perseverance.",

What he knows of the world outside of the shed he has seen on the small TV set they have or been told to him by his mother.\n\nThe shed has a small sink, 2 chairs, a tub, a bed, a small table, a toaster oven and a closet where Jacob is put in by his mother every time Big Nick comes to rape her. The room is decorated with drawings by the boy and his imagination sees all the things as his friends and the world visible from the very small, very high skylight unimaginable though his mother teaches him to read and explains all the things he sees on the TV as being real.\n\nWe spend the first 50 minutes with mother and son, with short visits by their kidnapper to abuse her, in what could be a claustrophobic segment but we watch the mother use discipline with her son making him exercise, learn to read, follow oral hygiene, break eggs, learn how to cook and use his imagination. Without telling too much one of the most touching scenes for many reasons is when the pair make a cake for his 5th birthday.\n\nThe second half of the film deals with their escape--leave logic at the door as it is the only misfire by director Lenny Abrahamson--and what happens to the mother and son coming into the real world.\n\nBased on her book and writing the screenplay Emma Donoghue does a good job holding our interest in both segments but I wish there had been about 5-15 minutes more regarding the relation between Joy, her mother (Joan Allen), her father (Willaim H. Macy) now divorced, and their reaction to getting their daughter back 7 years after she was kidnapped.\n\nAllen does a excellent job, Macy is wasted in no more than a cameo though his reaction is important to his daughter's freedom. Bridgers, looking like your next door neighbor, is menacing in his lack of looking menacing while  Tom McCamus, as the new man in Allen's and now also in the Joy and Jacob's lives is underplayed.\n\nBrie Larson is strong, weak, protective, questioning, as the mother who wonders whether she could have done better by her son after doing all she could while they were prisoners.\n\nJacob Tremblay is a revelation as 5 year old Jack whether it be using his imagination about the outside world or when he gets there dealing with it. There were a few times he was incomprehensible on the soundtrack where he does some key narration but just by looks and action he carries the scenes whether alone or dealing with the adults.\n\nThis sounds like it may be a depressing film and the theme certainly isn't a light one but Jacob Tremblay, at 9 years old, lifts the film up with his acting, his open face and looking at the world with wonder, showing that children can handle life better than most adults.",

            "content": "\"Room\" is by all accounts a great movie. The acting is some of the best I've seen all year, the story is compelling, the characters interesting and as you follow their plight it's impossible not to get emotionally invested. I urge you to go see it. With that said, I feel like something was lost in translation. Between this film and the novel by Emma Donoghue (who wrote the screenplay, making me ask once again \"What do I know?\") something doesn't sit right with me. Curious? Let's dig in!\n\nJoy (Brie Larson) and her five-year-old son Jack (Jacob Tremblay) live in \"Room\", a space no bigger than a tool shed outfitted with a bed, a television and some living essentials. Its all Jack has ever known. Soon after his fifth birthday Joy informs her son of the truth: there's more to the world than just \"Room\". The man who supplies them with food and clothing (Sean Bridgers) kidnapped Joy when she was 17 and there's a whole world waiting for them, if they can escape.\n\nIf you have seen trailers for this film, you know well ahead what happens in the second half. If you don't I wouldn't say that knowing this gives away so much away that you won't be able to \"Room\", but go in as cold as possible. If you're already in the know rest assured. The extra information did not diminish my enjoyment of \"Room\". It's pretty much impossible not to get involved with what's developing on-screen. Your heart breaks at the very thought of a human being held captive and of another never seeing the outside world. When there is a possibility of escape, no matter how small the odds are you scoot to the edge of your seat because if these two innocents can't be freed, then there's no hope in the world. \n\nThis story follows two people being forced against their will to live out a life they have not chosen and making the best of it and about seeing this nightmare through a lens of innocence. If you put two and two together you will quickly realize that there are some pretty unsettling things happening here (we don't actually see Joy get raped, but happening regularly without a doubt). You're getting worried, but hold on. This is not what I would call a depressing movie. Seeing the characters move through this story and getting to know them is a rewarding experience. It's like volunteering at a homeless shelter. You might not be around beauty and the situation is sad, but there's something about being there, holding the hand of someone who is at rock bottom that enriches you. This is particularly true with this Lenny Abrahamson picture because the characters are drawn in such a realistic fashion. Jack is not just a precautious innocent who always behaves and sits idly by while the world moves around. 5 year olds can be sweet. They can also be frustrating and impatient. The key is that when they're being funny or asking an innocuous question they melt your heart and you fall head over heels in love. Joy is no a saint either, despite the fact that she's undeniably a victim and a strong person for holding onto shreds of hope.\n\nThere is still hope within Jack and when I saw the bond between him and his mother it more than made up for the discomfort that I felt thinking about everything that this scenario entailed. I could never quite get over it completely, and I don't think you`re supposed to, but by the end of the film I think you'll manage to emerge unscathed. Witnessing the character of Jack really begin to evolve and grow despite everything he's missed out on ignites your own healing process. If anything, it'll inspire you to think of children and of the resiliency of the human spirit in a whole new way.\n\nI do have a criticism which I feel needs to be addressed. Ultimately this movie is about self-discovery and exploration. I don't think it pulls it off 100%. I compare the film to a book that I have not read, but I get the feeling that when you find yourself in Jack's for world the first time, you're not supposed to fully grasp what's happening. Is it a science fiction/fantasy story where the whole world really IS just this tiny? In live action, the illusion is never there. As a person living in the real world, you can immediately tell that there is something wrong. The film is essentially told from Jack's point of view but I never felt like I could truly immerse myself and understand how he thought. Similarly, I think there are missed opportunities with the unique aspects that film can bring to a story. It's not a great example, but I think of Dorothy in \"The Wizard of Oz\", where the use of actors, music and color made it clear that she is in a new world with new rules. It sucked you into this new place to help you understand how different a life it would be. A life lived in a single room could have been conveyed better.\n\nI do not think that most people will feel the same way I did about the \"film\" aspect of \"Room\". Even if you do, there's no denying that it is an emotionally successful and touching account that sucks you in right from the beginning, contains real tension without resorting to any cheap tricks and works as a profound examination of two human beings. Then you've got the performances. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay alone should be enough to compel you to get off your butt and see \"Room\" the performances are on a higher echelon than in most films. For those reasons and more, I'm certain that this is not the last time you will hear of \"Room\". (Theatrical version on the big screen, November 10, 2015)",

Room is a visual representation of the bond between mother and child, which can be heartbreaking at times but always leaves you with a sense of warmth in the end.\n\nHaving read the book, I was more than excited to see its adaptation to the big screen. I could not be happier with the way it came out. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson, for me a newly found director, Room is the story of a women (Brie Larson) who has been held captive in a shed for seven years with her five year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremlay), who was born in that shed. Jack knows nothing of the outside world and as a result, his mother tries to shield him from everything he might not ever experience, and creates a world for him within Room.\n\nThe first half of the movie focuses on this aspect. It is absolutely incredible how Abrahamson is able to portray so much in such a little space. Because of this, there are numerous elements in the background and setting that give you clues about the type of life this boy and his mother have, immersing the viewer deeply into the relationship.\n\nThe second half of the movie focuses on the reality of adjusting to the outside world after escaping and less on their relationship. It is not as strong as the first half of the movie, however, thanks to the brilliant work from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremlay, Room still manages to engage the viewer in an unforgettable manner.\n\nOverall, Brie Larson and Jacob Tremlay manage to draw you into their own little world, from both perspectives, the mother and the five year old. Their reality becomes yours and the small things in life don't seem as small anymore. With amazing direction, beautiful cinematography and set design, and breath taking acting, Room's originality succeeds in every aspect.",

Sound grim? Well, it is, but it is also beautifully life-affirming. As played by the marvelous young actress Brie Larson (\"Short Term 12\"), Ma - the only name by which we know her, spoken by her 5-year-old son, Jack - is a model of strength and resilience, though prone to occasional (and very understandable) fits of despair. Her universe\u00a0is limited to a\u00a0single room, which she shares with Jack - played by the extremely talented (and relative newcomer) Jacob Tremblay\u00a0- through whose point of view the book is told, a device mostly replicated in the film (for which Donoghue also wrote the script). The first images we see are from Jack's perspective: abstract close-ups of furniture and other objects in the tiny space, which slowly morph into shots of Ma. This is the only world that Jack has ever known, and curious sort that he is, he makes the most of it with his imagination. Mother and son have a deeply intimate bond, soon to be tested. We sense, from the opening, that we are in for a riveting and overwhelming experience, a promise to which\u00a0Room more than lives up.\n\nThe director, Lenny Abrahamson, last made a movie about a man trapped by his own psychoses,\u00a0\"Frank.\" There, the self-imposed prison was a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 head, inside of which actor Michael Fassbender spent most of the movie. Here, the jail may offer more room to maneuver, but it's far more solid. What are the effects of a seven-year kidnapping? How does one cope without hope? Jack, an originally unwanted\u00a0product of violent sexual assault, is now far less albatross than life preserver. With him, Ma's life has structure and meaning. Without him, she\u00a0might possibly have long ago surrendered to defeat. In this way, Donoghue weaves a complex tale where good can come from bad, and bad from good. If it comes,\u00a0the long hoped-for liberation may joyfully\u00a0unlock one set of doors, only to lead Ma and Jack into a new form of captivity.\n\nI haven't read the book, so a great surprise for me was how the film doesn't end where you'd expect it to. In fact, what starts out feeling like the third act turns out to be but an extension of the central conflict. It's a tribute to both author and director that they never allow their story a pure happy end. That would be disrespectful to the experience. True, most wounds heal over time, but some leave deep scars. Both Ma and Jack will forever be marked by their years in \"room\" (that's how they refer to their space), no matter what good comes later. The film does leave us with a strong sense of mother-child love, which overrides most of the horrors. And thanks to the exceptional performances from\u00a0Larson and Tremblay - and other members of a fine ensemble cast that includes Joan Allen (\"Georgia O'Keeffe\") and William H. Macy (\"The Sessions\") - the bond between Ma and Jack is a\u00a0beautiful salve that can, at least, heal the wounds we suffer while watching their plight.\u00a0",

You will be hit in the feels with this one.\n\nMost of the film is a two person show between Brie Larson and child actor Jacob Tremblay. Both of them give absolutely amazing performances. Tremblay is perfect. Every reaction is spot on, every behavior, every spat with his mother... it's just perfect. Never overdone, never annoying. Kudos to him. \n\nIf Larson hit a home run with Short Term 12, she hit a Grand Slam with this one. She's vulnerable, in one of the most extreme positions of weakness imaginable (she's been locked in a garden shed for 7 years. Tremblay is 5. You do the math), yet the love and warmth she brings to her relationship with Tremblay are just too powerful to ignore. This is just a fantastic performance from Larson. \n\nIf the film has any flaws, it's that it plays its high cards way too soon. The film is neatly cut in two halves, the first half showing Larson and Tremblay's imprisonment and the second showing their difficulty in returning to normalcy, particularly for Tremblay. Poor kid has never known any life other than that garden shed. Unfortunately, the second half isn't as powerful as the first. The rescue of Larson and Tremblay plays like it's the climax of the film, so when it happens, we as the audience are ready at the point to go \"They're safe. Movie over\". Yes, we want to know Larson and Tremblay are going to be okay, but couldn't we just have someone like a doctor or one of Larson's parents say there's going to be an awkward transition period?\n\nEven though the second half isn't as great as the first, that does not diminish Larson or Tremblay. Their chemistry and their performances are fantastic and worth the price of admission. No Tommy Wiseau in this one, sadly.",

The highly astute police officer manages to narrow the location down and successfully finds his mum, Joy Newsome.\n\nThis extraordinary story is a tale about discovery and freedom, a luxury Jack has never known. We see how he discovers the outside world in ways he could never have imagined, as he relishes in the adventure and the excitement we see how he and his Ma adapt back into society and into a life a life that had so far only been a figment of his imagination.",

Maybe not complex to everyone, if you look at the imagery, camerawork, and script choices, there really is something incredible here. After being raised in a room for five years, with no outdoor contact, Jack and his Ma Joy escape and see daylight for the first in a long time. Told through the perspective of the child, he is seeing the world, people, objects, and nature, all for the first time. The emotional impact that has on the story is breathtaking. Brie Larson gives a gut-wrenching performance and I believed every single scene she was in. Starting from a confined room, you really begin to see what the world is truly like and how we take everything for granted that is in it. I loved \"Room\" from start to finish. Although I believe this is a brilliant film overall, I have to complain about the way they were able to escape. It felt a little too easy and then that tension was gone throughout the rest of the film in order to focus on the emotional heft, i.e. the family. In the end, \"Room\" has a very raw and true screenplay, incredible performances, inspiring visuals, and a story that is once in a generation, and we do not get many of those. I wish it did not have an easy way out in the opening act, but overall, I feel I can still give it a perfect score. See this film!",

            "content": "Do you want to watch a movie that will leave you speechless for a good amount of hours? How about a movie that you\u00e2??ll probably never forget due to its poignant, painful story and heartbreaking performances? Room is that movie. Directed by Lenny Abrahamson and written by Emma Donoghue, based on her novel of the same name, Room follows the story of Jack and his mother, whose whole world resides in the inside of a shed; a soundproof, locked shed in the backyard of a creep who has held them captive for years. However, the instinct of survival, and the hope that there is something or some place better on the other side of the wall, is not something that you can lock up by walls, nor shush with sound-proof foams, and it can make a difference.\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to start off by praising the PHENOMENAL performances in Room. It is unfathomable that the performances in this film are in fact performances. The emotional strength in them is mostly what makes this film strike us, and let me tell you, it will hit you hard. Brie Larson delivers a courageous and heartbreaking performance as Jack\u00e2??s mom. Torn apart by the traumatic events that found their way into her life, but simultaneously trying to keep her composure to make sure her son is safe, Larson gives her character so much spirit and resilience. Honestly, I can\u00e2??t find an adjective that does justice to the power of Brie Larson\u00e2??s performance. Definitely one of the best performances I\u00e2??ve seen this year.\n\nSame goes for Jacob Tremblay, who is just nothing short of sensational. I mean, his performance is probably the best performance I\u00e2??ve seen from a child actor ever, on par with Anna Paquin in The Piano (1993) and Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense (1999). He superbly portrayed a boy whose world shifted from being confined to the walls of a shed, to the infinity of the world, showing at the same time the inherent, cross-generational desire of human survival. His performance is strong, naive, and smart, but also fearless. He embodied a boy who does not yet comprehend the things that happened to him; being in such an early stage of development does not allow him to make sense of the circumstances he is in. Tremblay portrays that inability to fathom what was happening perfectly. Both Larson and Tremblay SHOULD get nominated for an Academy Award. It would be an understatement to say that I will be very pissed if either of them don\u00e2??t get the nomination.\n\nIn terms of Room\u00e2??s style, its cinematography is beautiful and amazing; it immerses the audience into Jack\u00e2??s claustrophobic and subjective little world, which makes the movie almost like a full sensory experience; a textured experience where we would feel everything that Jack felt, whether it be despair, happiness, and fear or the texture of the rug in Room. The score by Stephen Rennicks is quite compelling as well, which was a beautiful complement to this moving story. Also, the production design is horrifyingly great given the circumstances of the story. That shed would definitely be in every person\u00e2??s nightmare about being held captive by a creep.\n\nRoom is the most powerful film I\u00e2??ve seen this year, hands down. It showcases not only the problem of people being held hostage and deprived from their freedom, but also the psychological effects that that ignites in social, familial and interpersonal relationships.  Now I feel really stupid about caring a lot about Matt Damon\u00e2??s character in The Martian. If you cared about him getting out of Mars and surviving, wait until you see Room. Then you will see what caring for a character\u00e2??s survival intrinsically really feels like (I still love The Martian, it was just the most recent example I could think of). Honestly, this could be my favorite film of the year. Embark on this emotional and heartbreaking journey and see for yourself the power of a great story.",

Brie Larson gives another seamless performance (she may very well be the best duogenarian actress working in Hollywood), and the 9-year old Jacob Tremblay should be very proud of how powerful his delivery is, as the story is touchingly told through his young character's perspective. If there's one disappointment to Room, it's that the second half doesn't quite measure up to the first. The film's first 40 minutes are the most mesmerizing in terms of cinematography and narrative, before it adopts a more conventional yet still compelling approach. Regardless, Room is a must-see if ever there was one, and a very welcome change of pace for director Lenny Abrahamson, after last year's Frank.",

I have a few issues with the story, mainly how we never learn much about the grandmother, her boyfriend, or the severely underutilized William H Macy as the grandfather.

The first act is harrowing and unsettling and you can feel the dread of the two. As good as Larson is, Jacob Tremblay who plays her son gives one of the best performances from a child actor I have seen in a long time. Both should be mentioned come awards season.

            "content": "STUCK HOME SYNDROME - My Review of ROOM (4 Stars)\n\nDon't let the bright wonderment of the poster fool you, ROOM is one of the most emotionally devastating films of the year, anchored by beyond stellar performances by Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay, a young Canadian actor whose focus and range rivals that of Tatum O'Neal in PAPER MOON.  Prepare to be gutted.  \n\nIt's almost impossible to describe this film without spoilers, but I'll do just that.  If you've read Emma Donoghue's novel, of which she adapted for the screen, then you already know the basic premise of a mother (Larson) raising her 5-year-old son, Jack (Tremblay) in a tiny room.  Shielding him from the world for reasons that become clear upon viewing, he doesn't know that any type of life exists beyond his four walls.  Think of this as a much more emotionally vibrant and more honest sister film to LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, which also explored the lengths a parent will go to in order to protect their child.  \n\nMuch of the first half of this film is fraught with unbearable suspense, with the mother doing everything she can to resolve their situation.  Danny King, whose work on LES MISERABLES did not make me a fan, employs a live camera and a lot of shallow focus to put the point of view squarely on the shoulders of our two protagonists.  Yes, it's a claustrophobic experience, but to feel otherwise would be doing the subject matter a disservice.  Director Lenny Abrahamson has made an intimate film about big ideas, and there's very smart economy in its storytelling.  It's overlong by at least 20-30 minutes, however, and with such a generous running time of almost two hours, you would expect a little more to William H. Macy's lightly sketched in, barely there character.   It's not that he's incapable, but he's given way too little to work with here. Not so of Joan Allen, who digs deep with limited screen time as well.  Also tremendously effective in supporting roles are Sean Bridgers, who has a knack for keeping an audience on edge, Wendy Crewson as a journalist who prods just a little bit too much, and Amanda Brugel, as a woman who has to assert herself in order to cut through the muck.  \n\nI could have done without the tin can-style of recording the voiceover, which certainly feels unsettling, but was truly difficult to comprehend at times.  The score by Stephen Rennicks is certainly beautiful and heartfelt, but he could have dialed it back a hair with the final music cue.    There was so much sap in it, I was tempted to call the film MUSHROOM!  Far from it, this is a challenging experience, often seen through tears, and not an easy sit for any parent who worries about their child.  Larson and Tremblay should be firmly in the mix come Awards season.  Larson continually surprises me with her performances.  Looking like Reese Witherspoon's sister, I keep expecting her to act goofy and self-conscious, yet her instincts are so vibrantly attuned to the material, she seems incapable of making a false move.  Whether he has natural abilities or was heavily directed, Tremblay is a highly sympathetic actor whose ability to annoy, infuriate and warm an audience's heart, sometimes within the same scene, is something special to behold.  ROOM is very dark, sad, and sometimes without a shred of hope, yet this tale of a Herculean bond between mother and son is well worth all the sobbing you'll likely find yourself doing afterwards.",

Things slow the moment the kidnapping sex offender appears on screen.  Then, sadly, the film's momentum comes to a screeching halt at the moment the villain reaches a stop sign (unfortunate irony!) and what should've been the most dramatic cinematic moment of the year, fizzles out.  The movie falls off a cliff. The second half is chemistry-free with poorly written, cartoon character subplots unworthy of a bad Lifetime TV movie.  I pray Larson & Tremblay receive the nominations they deserve, but the writer and director need a remedial course in \"Choices Filmmakers Should Avoid At All Costs!\"",

            "content": "I'm a sucker for emotional dramas, and even more so if they deal with difficult and/or sensitive subject matter. ROOM is both of those things and does so in a tasteful fashion. I also haven't been so emotionally invested in a film since probably PRISONERS. The story revolves around and Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). Ma (whose real name is Joy) was abducted as a teenager and lives in a garden shed, affectionately (or not so, depending on how you interpret it) referred to as 'Room,' with her now-five-year-old son, Jack. When the opportunity arises, Jack escapes and the real meat of the story begins. First off, I was very impressed with performances in the film. Brie Larson does excellent work, but I was even more surprised by Jacob Tremblay. Even though he's quite young, he was able to convey a dramatic range that, although suiting the role in particular, sometimes isn't achieved by older actors. Playing someone who's spent his entire life in captivity, he portrayed the wide-eyed curiosity required as well as the confusion in someone whose perspective on the world is fundamentally changed. There were a number of intense and/or emotional scenes, and he nailed every single one. I also liked how, even though the story deals with women who have been abducted, there was a bit more going on under the surface. Separating the narrative from the obviously horrible situation in which a woman is raped repeatedly, you can see the film also dealing with the psychological effect when a woman has motherhood thrust upon them, the culture shock when someone who has lived in isolation comes into contact with the \"real world,\" etc. There was a lot going on than a simple escape from captivity, in other words. The only issue I could possibly come up with is that the second half of the film doesn't quite live up to the suspenseful first half. Once mother and son are freed, the narrative drive is somewhat lost, or at least goes into a holding pattern for a while. The difference in pacing is noticeable, although I wasn't terribly bothered by it. And, the film wraps up in a satisfying way anyway. All things considered, ROOM is an extremely compelling story that will have some people reaching for a tissue. It has great performances, cinematography, score, etc., and is certainly one of the best films of 2015.",

And actually, I would venture to say that Jacob Tremblay, who plays Jack, was snubbed. He has a very bright career ahead of him. What I will say is, damn, don't watch this if you're having a bad day, because this is heavy. This gives the few moments of lightness more gravity, but still, this is a lot for two hours. What makes it better is that a lot of the truly awful things are implied. A lot of directors nowadays would go for the shock/in your face factor. But Abrahamson instead took the opposite approach, giving us the puzzle pieces and letting our imaginations put them together.

Larson her isn't so much in top form as she is at her most vulnerable, emotionally wracking, and jaw-droppingly good as she'll ever be, a performance that rocks the year so far for being one of the best acting performances we'll see all of 2015. It's the kind of role you lose yourself in, scene after scene of heartbreak and difficulty. Her role of Joy is one of the most emotionally demanding roles one could ask for and Larson delivers with astounding results. While her performance is part of what makes the film, the film itself doesn't suffer from relying on a single aspect, but is a richly emotional journey about a subject not always explored in film. Jacob Trembly is also particularly good as her son Jack, raised in the most unusual and disturbing of circumstances, a performance that was either made by the actor, the director, or the editor, it doesn't matter as it's incredibly convincing, the perfect balance to Larson's Ma/Joy that creates an unbreakable mother/son dynamic. The script, surprisingly written by the author who shows a surprising amount of screenwriting intelligence, has made a wholly convincing script grounded in reality and humanity along with a director with an eye for realism while remaining in the art of filmmaking. Room is a great film, maybe one of the best so far this year, a richly emotional film of sorrow and heart in the end. Someone may find it hard to watch, but it's also impossible to wrench your eyes away",

Macy, Megan Park, Cas Anvar, Amanda Brugel, \nJoe Pingue, Tom McCamus and Wendy Crewson.\n\n\"Room\" is an emotional powerhouse of a movie. Brie Larson and newcomer Jacob Tremblay both give fantastic performances in director Lenny Abrahamson's powerful tale about a mother and her boundless love with her son. It is mostly set in one small location, a room with no windows, just a skylight in the ceiling. Brie Larson has done good work before but this little gem is her best work yet. She's right now, the frontrunner to win Best Actress at the Oscars next February.\n\n\"Room\" is based on a great novel by Emma Donoghue and she also wrote the screenplay which is an excellent one. \"Room\" is a near-perfect movie, it's one of the best movies of the year. As I said before, \"Room\" mostly takes place in a small room with a closet, a bathroom, a bed, a toilet and a kitchen with limited food and supplies. Joy Newsome (Larson) has been captive in this room for seven years now and she has a five-year-old son named Jack (Tremblay). They are prisoners of a man named Old Nick (Sean Bridgers).\n\nAlso known as Ma, Joy has protected his son from the realities of their situation but when Jack turns five, she enlists a plan for them to escape. Jack has never known much about the outside world, his whole life has been surrounded in this dark room. After the escape plan becomes successful, Old Nick is now behind bars and Joy gets reunited with her parents. Robert and Nancy Newsome (William H. Macy and Joan Allen) have since separated and Joy has a long road ahead of her if she wants to get back to real life. Joy is also doing the best she can to bring her son to a normal life after horrific circumstances.\n\nTremblay is absolutely incredible in this movie. Since he has long hair, you might think Jack is a girl but he's not because he was held captive in a small room for five years, that's the reason why he didn't get a haircut. We are immediately captivated by him as he makes the difficult journey from a small room to the outside world. Larson has never been better, she truly deserves the Oscar for Best Actress. She's that good. If the Academy fails to nominate her, they would have to retire that category. Joan Allen, William H. Macy (in a very brief role) and Tom McCamus provide comfort and support as Joy's family members.\n\nProving that she's still one of our very best actresses working today, Joan Allen also gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Joy's mother. This movie is sad and devastating but it is truly worth your time. Please seek out \"Room\" if it's playing in your theater, it's an unforgettable experience.",

Creed, Straight Out of Compton, Concussion, Chiraq and Beasts of No Nation with actors and actresses in those movies as well being snubbed. I was going to watch those movies anyway (except Chiraq I am still on the fence about watching that). I had already watched SOC. I havent watched Concussion, but I doubt seeing it would change my opinion..laughing at myself cuz people really care what I think..\n I read the book first. I honestly did not care for the book very much.  The movie was ok. I actually wish I would have just saw the movie and never read the book, I am sure I would I have liked the movie so much more.  Watching the movie and seeing so much left out and changed effected my opinion of the movie, but I love Brie Larson and that little boy was super adorable so that made up for it. \n As far as deserving a best picture nomination, I think it was chosen because of the story not the movie. It was more enjoyable than Brookyln..but it really wasn't written near as well as the other movies in this category, now was the acting half as good. Honestly Beasts of No Nation was a more interesting story and Abraham Attah out acted Brie and Jacob..so there is a snub here as far as Best Picture nomination goes.\n As far as the best actress win..as I said I love Brie and I am happy she won..BUT I think Cate should have gotten I mean if we talking about pure acting skills in these two particular movies..but what else would one expect from Cate?",

Brie Larson, who I have been a big champion of with 21 Jump Street, Don Jon, Short Term 12, Trainwreck, and her great TV role on United States of Tara, is amazing as a woman that was kidnapped and imprisoned in a shed for 7 years of her life. It is just unimaginable the torment of being in the same room for 7 years with little supplies and obviously the sexual torment of the kidnapper that led to the birth of Jacob Tremblay's character. Jacob Tremblay is great here and there is a lot of buzz about both actors getting award recognition which is warranted but if Jacob is nominated as a Supporting Actor as he is being campaigned for, that will be singlehandedly the biggest Oscar crime in the history of the show as Tremblay is the commanding force of the movie being in almost every scene and even narrating the movie. But I digress. What it so great about his performance is the factor of only knowing what the world looks like assuming it is this room he is in. He has never seen cars, a fast food restaurant, a hospital, or other people for that matter. The scenes of him just discovering the world for the first time are really powerful stuff that makes you think about how you would have dealt with such a scenario. Joan Allen is really powerful as Larson's mom with this dynamite confrontation between her and Larson but equally powerful with the bonding between her in Jacob. William H. Macy is so great as an actor that he was only in a scene within seconds and broke my heart immediately to the point I was seconds away from crying. That happened twice in the movie, that scene and when Larson finally gets out of the room which I don't think is a spoiler if you've seen the trailer and or realize the inclusion of many other characters. The set decorator and production designer did a great job designing Room making it look very possible to live in but still a small living space as the work of the cinematography enhances. There are some really wonderful moments cinematography wise like the first time Jacob sees the sky in the back of a truck and some of the subtle things that happen in Room. That's what I enjoyed about this movie the most, it could have been an over the top hostage movie but it had so much subtly to most scenes and it was quite nuanced than other movies of the same topic. The wiring is excellent, the direction is superb, the score is powerful though was a bit impeding during some scenes, and a great ensemble. My two quarrels with the movie would have to lie with William H. Macy's character and this unexplained hostility that happens during a dinner scene. It just felt in the end odd placement and even odder that it was never explained why it was such a hostile moment. I would have liked more of Macy and maybe a few more scenes of Jacob discovering the world for the first time. Other than that, this is a harrowing but powerful movie that is a must see.",

            "content": "At the start of Room, a young woman and her five-year-old son are living in the titular edifice, a backyard shed. The woman (Brie Larson) has always told Jack (Jacob Tremblay) that \"outer space\" is all that exists outside Room; as far as Jack is concerned, this is the gospel truth and the universe consists of Room and Room alone.\n\nIt is not giving anything away to note that Ma and Jack escape Room, as the movie is more about the ability of each to cope with the outside world. For Jack, every step and every breath outside is a wholly new experience. Ma, despite having lived for 17 years before coming to Room, encounters different obstacles - the world has moved on, and she doubts her own ability as a mother to Jack.\n\nI had been expecting a suspenseful drama-thriller about a daring escape, given the various synopses I'd read. (The movie is based on a novel by Emma Donoghue, which is itself loosely based on real events.) Much of the first half of the film, though, concentrates on life inside Room for Ma and Jack. Ma uses her strong will and infinite patience to convince Jack for five years that all is well and that what they have is a normal life, that what they see on television is not real, but everything from the single bed to the lidless toilet tank is definitely real. Ma sacrifices as much as she can to keep Jack happy and (relatively) safe, even to the point of giving herself over to her captor on a regular basis in exchange for food and other items for Jack and herself.\n\nTo say that this first half moves slowly would be to understate things. We don't just get a slice of the life that the duo leads; we get the entire pie, and most of it just isn't all that exciting or intriguing. We do get to see a little into the characters of the characters, pardon the phrasing. We see that Jack doesn't like to not get his way or to have his worldview challenged. Then again, who does at age 5? We see that Ma is often calm but firm with her young charge. It's a small Room, after all; no need to go nuclear when there's really no point to it. In any event, much time is spent watching their everyday sheltered lives. Because the general plot involved their lives beyond Room, I began to grow impatient: Were they going to spend the entire movie in Room, only to escape in the final minutes? Why wouldn't anything happen? The fact that Ma and Jack would eventually escape left the first half of the movie perfectly devoid of suspense. Although still waters do often run deep, I didn't really feel like I was getting a lot out of watching a whole lot of nothing.\n\nOnce they do escape, though, things pick up. The focus quickly shifts from a struggle for survival to a struggle to understand. Ma's parents, played by Joan Allen and William H. Macy, have different reactions to the return of their daughter and the arrival of their new (to them) grandson. In the five years since Ma's abduction, her parents have separated; her dad lives on the other side of the country now, and her mom lives with her friend Leo (Tom McCamus). With Ma's return, there's a lot of media hype, and lawyers, atop a potent array of stress factors. Escaping may have been the easy part.\n\nThe acting is uniformly terrific. Larson's work is powerful, evocative, and heart-wrenching, and it's definitely award worthy. Allen and Macy also excel with perhaps the best work in their respective careers, and that's saying something. Young Tremblay is also very good - as is his character, a plucky, long-haired cherub who's more at home in Room than in the outside world (and with good reason).\n\nBut the acting cannot overcome what's basically a very turgid script. Room is punchless at its core, and it would be a total waste if it weren't for the Herculean efforts of its talented cast. When there is no action, I look for meaning. When there is no meaning or action, I look for the exit. Room suffers from spending too much time contemplating things and not enough time doing them - or at least discussing them. Forget the action, I wouldn't have minded seeing more reaction. The first half of the movie could have been subtitled \"A Series of Plodding Events.\" The second half goes a long way toward saving the first, thanks in part to additional characters and a fresh setting, but it's not enough to save the entire movie.",

Ma's suicide attempt was awful glossy, as was the interview, while other topics were barely addressed at all. I get that this is a tough topic and I'm at as much of a loss on how to address it as anyone but I wish that Abrahamson had cut a little deeper on this one. You get the feeling that there isn't anything wrong with Room as is but what it could have been might have really been something else.

The film, which rides on its two leads, is powerful and engaging, making the audience feel isolated and scared. Out of all the elements and effort that was put into this film it is really the acting, specifically Larson and Trembly who this film would not work without.\n\nRoom is a very well rounded film. It is solid on all fronts including direction, writing, cinematography, and above all acting. It is a very small film with a very small budget. This makes the film even more reliant on storytelling and character development. These two both have very emotional and realistic character arcs, with very talented rising stars to portray them. Larson and Trembly are both in the race for best actress and best supporting actor, but it is definitely Larson who will get much awards praise.\n\nRoom, though well rounded, is an imperfect film. The suspense does peak and reach its height at the end of its first act. There is nothing much it except one other scene later on in the film. After the peak, it becomes less interesting, but still entertaining and powerful. Another problem is the character of William H. Macy, who is obviously the most recognizable actor in the whole film. His character arc feels unfinished and feels as if he was only available for one or two days on set, which resulted in less appearances by what could've been a very intriguing arc.\n\nOverall the film delivers on its promises, a suspenseful film with a glimmer of hope. With great performances and inspiring storytelling, though imperfect, manages to join many in the race for best picture. \n\nRating: 8.3 (A-)",

This film follows the story of Joy and Jack; they are stuck in a garden shed after Old Nick captured her as a 17 year old. It's now been 7 years and everyday Nick comes home and sexually abuses Joy (which is how Jack was born in the first place). While Joy tries everything in her power to escape what Jack calls \"Room\", he wants to stay because it's the only world he's adapted to. There would be times where I'd be getting frustrated because of the things that Joy and Jack did, but the more I thought about it, the more sense it made. I had to put myself in their shoes and see what it'd be like if I were in those arguments. Its a difficult situation to handle, in fact, there were many difficult situations that were handled flawlessly (by writers anyhow). There's a moment where Joy is trying to describe how the \"real\" world is compared to the things on TV and in \"Room\" and Jack has a hard time understanding but it's handled super well. There has to be an understanding if you want to watch this film because it's not for faint of heart. It's a film that will tear you limb by limb. None of the emotion feels abused because of how realistic this situation actually feels. The emotion and passion on screen feels genuine and heartbreaking and I really appreciate that, especially in a movie like this. The acting in this film is probably one of the best leads I've ever seen in a movie. Brie Larson has an extremely hard role to play and she stunned me. Her performance was heartbreaking, passionate, realistic, and inspiring in the way that she was able to conquer her personal demons and those extremely hard 7 years taken hostage. Jacob Tremblay gave the best child performance I've ever seen and that might just be an understatement. Like Larson, he had a really difficult role to play, and knocked it so far out of the park! He has an extremely bright future ahead of him. The supporting cast is also very good, like Joan Allen and William H Macy. Through the amazing storytelling and performances, this movie is a massive tearjerker. Everyone in my theater cried at least once and sniffled for a lot of the run time. There's a really strong connection between characters and I felt that great bond. I felt like I knew the characters in the end. I understood their motivations and antics and it was a pleasure to watch their character unfold. Room was an absolute delight to watch. There's a lot of realistic situations that the characters are put through and it's really scary to think too deep into it. This movie succeeds at everything it was going for and then some. A",

The idea of getting lost down a rabbit hole or your life not going the way you'd imagined it when you were a child is universal. The metaphors and analogies to be made are no doubt endless with any aspect of any single person's life, but Room is a certain kind of Alice story as you can feel the loss of our protagonist both physically and psychologically. Loss is a key word, a key theme if you will given the circumstances of the situation presented in the film, but if you don't know that situation going in you're all the better for it. All that is necessary to know is that Brie Larson plays Joy Newsome, a woman who has seemingly been trapped in a single room shack for an ungodly amount of time while having raised her five year old son, Jack (Jacob Tremblay), in this confinement for the entirety of his life. There is only a single door in their room and it is protected by a locking system that only a mysterious visitor (Sean Bridgers) knows the code to. This stranger, referred to as \"Old Nick\", brings Joy and Jack food once a week, but like the majority of the supporting characters in any Alice story, he is cruel towards our heroine. Knowing little more than this myself before walking in, Room operates as a tense and unnerving thriller for it's first half before becoming an intense psychological trip in it's second. Both are equally engaging as is the film as a whole.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

The novel was published in 2010 before the news of Amanda Berry and Ariel Castro in Cleveland came to light. Since the film is set in Akron, Ohio the story definitely has the feeling of being ripped from the headlines. A young woman is kidnapped, kept captive, and raped repeatedly by a man known as Old Nick. Amidst this trauma she tries to raise her son to not despair. From Jack's point of view, which is the opposite of precociousness, the trauma of being kept captive with a limited grasp of the wider world outside the one room shed leads to an extreme innocence to balance all the heartache. His child's innocence offers some truthful observations that were at times refreshing even though his Ma and her family face a darker spirit of hurt and healing. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay as Ma and Jack lead us well through several stages (survival, escape, reintroduction, breakdown, strength and expectancy) in this tale that moves from small scale to big picture. It touched my heart and ultimately brought closure to the characters lives.",

            "content": "Ma: \"You're gonna love it\".\n\nJack: \"What?\".\n\nMa: \"The world\".\n\nRoom tells the story of a relationship between a mother and son, as she raises him while confined to a 10x10 room and what happens when they finally get out.\n\nSince the 2016 Oscars are on Sunday and I've been lacking quite a bit on seeing as many Oscar contenders from last year. Room was one of those movies, as I've heard nothing but great things about it and how truly unique it is (from what I heard). It was a real shame that I had to wait for a while to get a chance to watch this movie, because it's been a very slow month over here in jolly good England. But after finally seeing the movie after that long wait, I can say that the movie was pretty underwhelming, and that's really disappointing saying that.\n\nBrie Larson has been sweeping the award season this year, by taking home: The BAFTA, Golden Globe, Critics Choice award and the SAG award, and it's very deserving. Brie Larson delivered a tremendous performance and she was without a doubt the best part of this movie. I'm so happy that Larson is finally getting noticed since everyone pretty much forgot about \"Short Term 12\" and her performance in that film that got very unnoticed. Larson shows off her acting skills in this movie and I know for a fact that she will receive an Oscar on Sunday night. She was truly brilliant in this movie and one of her best performance so far.\n\nLenny Abrahamson (director of the movie) brought us the 2014 film \"Frank\", which I really liked and I couldn't wait to see want he will bring to this movie, and what he brought was somewhat of a mix bag for me. I'm happy for him to get an Oscar nomination, but I didn't find anything that special or groundbreaking when it came to it's directing. Most of it is just copy and past from the book that this movie is based on, so Abrahamson can look on what he's doing. I didn't read the book (and never will) but I've heard a lot of people who did read the book say that the book is better than the movie, and even the author herself said the same thing. The directing isn't anything Oscar worthy, but it's decent directing at best for Abrahamson.\n\nThe first act of this movie was very strong and it did kept my interest. That's the biggest positive I had for this movie is it's first act.\n\nJacob Tremblay is an unknown star to me and for everyone else, so this is basically he's break out role. I did look up on what Tremblay has been in before and I found out he was in \"The Smurfs 2\" which wasn't that good. But all that aside, I thought he's performance was alright, nothing outstanding, but nothing terrible. He's better than most kids I've seen in recent movies, but I also have seen better ones as well.\n\nNow for the problems: The second act wasn't as strong as the first act. The movie did lose me a couple of times as I became disinterest as it went along.\n\nThe movie did feel like a sugar-coated version of the book and as I said before I haven't even read the book, but for what I heard from other people, the book is more graphic and dark than the movie. I get this question asked a lot when I say the movie sugar-coated from the book, \"Would you rather have graphic scenes of rape from the book\", well if that's what the book is suppose to be, then yeah, and it's not because I want to see someone get raped, but if you what me to give a crap about the characters and their struggle to see how their suffered, then the film makers shouldn't have sugar-coated it. I feel like if this movie was handled by a different director, it would have been a much better movie. The movie is basically telling you that there's violence and rape that happened, but there's nothing really graphic about it. The movie tells you to care about things that it never bothers developing and if you are going to make a movie on a subject like that, and pretend that this horrible thing that happened, again, you shouldn't sugar-coat it. Take \"12 Years a Slave\" as an example: That movie was graphic, brutal, honest and that's what made it an amazing movie, because it took a real life story like slavery that's suppose to make you feel for the character's and makes you look at what their been through and say to yourself \"Wow, that was truly awful\". Now look at Room, we have a single character and the movie is telling you to feel bad for her and what shes been through, but it didn't show any of it, and it's not like it has to be graphic for the sake of it, but it didn't even try to develop it.\n\nOverall Room was very overwhelming and kind of bland. I know a lot of people are going to get mad at me for not loving this movie as they do, but that's just my opinion.",

            "content": "A24 Films, you've done it again. Without knowing a whole lot about Room other than its general synopsis, festival hype, and lack of Tommy Wiseau, Room seemed like a movie that would thrive on its hype and accolades. That doesn't quite matter, though, because Room is just a terrific movie. Following up on the very good Frank, director Lenny Abrahamson has crafted one of the best movies of 2015 full of amazing performances and genuine emotion that doesn't rely on manipulation or exploitation of sympathy. It may lose just a tiny bit of its magic throughout its two-hour runtime, but Room is still an extremely engaging movie that just feels so so so real. The general synopsis of Room sounds like a sleazy horror movie in theory--an abducted mother and her five-year-old son are trapped in a shed for all of the son's life, as they try to get out and flee from their dehumanizing captor. The movie has such great emotional weight to it that it totally avoids being the type of movie that would place its characters in unjust danger or peril for the sake of cheap drama. When there are tears shed while watching Room--and there are many--they're completely earned and feel so cathartic. The film is essentially told from the perspective of a five-year-old boy, and it does a great job at replicating the worldview of a small child. Part of this has to do with the fact that the actor that plays Jack, Jacob Tremblay, is 100 percent convincing. It's so easy for child actors to overact or simply be annoying in general, but this performance is more than a strong child performance--it's a strong performance as a whole. Brie Larson will totally get nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and in a perfect world, she would win. She gives one of the best performances of 2015 that's in turns pitiful, strong, and sympathetic, but always truthful. It's about time that the public gives Brie Larson the praise that she deserves, and after seeing her flexibility in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, 21 Jump Street, Short Term 12, Trainwreck, and now Room, it's just a fact that she's extremely talented. I haven't read the book on which Room is based, but it's a great thing that its author, Emma Donoghue, adapted her own work for the screen. There's such precision in the dialogue's word choice and its successful use of voiceovers--and I never like voiceovers. The only noticeable flaw with Room is that although it doesn't ever become boring, it does seem to lose a bit of its magic towards the end. It isn't very long--it's 118 minutes--but seeing the world from the point of view of a small child and watching the enduring relationship between him and his mother doesn't quite stay as beautiful as it can be for the entire time. Regardless, I was still very much emotionally effected, so that's far from a deal-breaker. Room is one of those movies that makes you appreciate minute things around you, and after seeing the world in a new light, it just makes you feel grateful. Its performances are outstanding, the direction is sensitive, and emotional pull is one of the most notable this year. It isn't quite as consistently amazing as it could have been had they have trimmed up the latter third, but this is still a movie that I'd love to see again. 8.8/10, terrific, two thumbs up, far above average, etc.",

That this concept is reduced to a mother-son love story is something I'm mixed about, but for sure Room is an enjoyable and touching movie. \n\nThe young Jacob Tremblay carries the film on his teeny shoulders with surprising ease. This is a weirdly good performance from a child and I mean that in the best way possible. Tremblay's mature performance effectively conveys his character's ignorance to the world and how he experiences the world for the first time. Brie Larson is great as well as the mother who does her best to protect her son and properly raise him in their strange situation. Her character isn't explored explicitly, since the film is through Jack's eyes, but we understand her through the depth of Larson's performance where she unveils years of psychological torment through her eyes. She is also great in capturing the loving kindness of a mother, no matter how imperfect she may be. Together, Larson and Tremblay have believable and often beautiful chemistry as a small family who has lived in a shed with (pretty much) only each other for five years. \n\nLenny Abrahamson's direction is effective at showing us the world through Jack's eyes. Through his camera, Room (what they refer to their shed as) feels like a home where nothing else needs to exist, and the outside world is often scary or dizzying. Off-kilter angles convey Jack's perspective very organically and the close-ups and handheld movements of the camera capture the emotion of the characters. \n\nWatching the film, I was excited to see where the film would take its concept and how it would choose to study its main characters. After all, the concept is so interesting. The film signaled to me the potential to explore themes of trauma or parenting through this unique scenario. I was let down a little by the end, when it seemed that the film wanted to settle for a sweet mother-son love story when I thought it would go somewhere deeper and more exciting. It seems to understand the psychology of the mother and son, but never quite examines it the way the film practically demands. \n\nIt doesn't fail at being a sweet movie and emotional movie. For me, the emotional peak was in the middle, but nothing made me need tissues despite many having advised audiences to bring them. In presenting a touching story of a mother and son who were each other's strength in overcoming what they did, the movie mostly succeeds, and the two lead performances are unforgettable. I just hoped there would be a little more.",

So when I finally get to watch it, I honestly really enjoyed it so much. It's about a mother who has a son with her, and she's been in a room for 7 years while her son has been in there for 5 years, so he has no idea about what the world is like. When they finally, not a spoiler since it was in the trailer, escaped from the room, Jack is curious about the outside world and has to deal with it. Brie Larson is absolutely fantastic in this and is the best that I've seen since Short Term 13. I was worried a bit about Jacob Tremblay in this as the first film that I have seen him in was Smurfs 2, and he was not good in that movie, but then again, nothing is great in that film also, but to my surprise, he's really good in Room and was completely the opposite in terms of career for this kid which makes me think that he's got a bright future. Joan Allen is great in it, and I really like the mother and son relationship between Joy and Jack, especially when Joy has to deal with being in a room for many years. When they try to escape, it was very tense to watch and just really want them to get out. The screenwriting by the author herself Emma Donoghue is very well executed and she knew what to put in that are important, and what not to put in that were not that necessary for movie sake. This is probably a nitpick for me, but the only thing that kind of stuck with me, and not in a good way, is the ending. Not that the ending is bad, it's a great ending and definitely shows the realization of it, but from reading the book and seeing the movie, I felt like the ending should've been a few minutes longer as it felt a little too fast for me. It's not gonna take half a star for me because it could a character dealing with it fast, and that's why it went on fast, and also because the movie brought Room to life so much that there's a lot to like in this, and I'm glad that they did their best to adapt the book with fantastic execution.",
