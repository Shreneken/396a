            "content": "Let me preface this by saying I have never seen 50 Shades of Grey. I've seen the reviews, I know the story, but after seeing 50 Shades of Black I feel like I've seen the actual movie it was parodying. Wayans' comedies have devolved from clever self-aware satires to blatant movie rip-offs with sporadic laughs. The difference is, unlike the Haunted House movies, there are next to no laughs in 50 Shades of Black. It's essentially deconstructing every scene in 50 Shades of Grey to show the audience how dumb it is, which would be fine if it was actually funny. But no, this humor is scraped right from the bottom of the barrel, reusing the same stupid gags from previous spoofs and rehashed awkward shock \"humor\" that comes across more cringe-worthy than anything.I like Marlon Wayans, I really do. He seems like an awesome guy and he was actually a great writer one point, and a great actor too (to this day I'm blown away by his performance in Requiem for a Dream), but his talents must have gone to his head because he isn't tapping into his genius anymore. It's just easy joke after easy joke, and as simple as the jokes are, none of them land. In fact, at one point after a painfully awkward dinner scene that went on 5 minutes too long, I couldn't help but laugh, for the wrong reasons mind you, thinking, \"Jesus Christ, this is a real movie?\" It was painful. All of me wanted this movie to be good, but part of me knew it would be a disaster. Well, that part of me was right. Sure, I chuckled at a few scenes, but I also chuckled a few times in A Haunted House 2 and that's still a terrible movie. The difference is 50 Shades of Grey is even lazier and somehow even less clever than AHH2. I anxiously await the day the Wayans brothers come out with another great spoof movie, but I have a feeling it's going to be a long, long wait.",

            "review_title": "It's time Marlon Wayans and Michael Tiddes be held accountable for ushering in the real lowest common denominator of humor",
            "content": "You would think with all the accumulated earnings the Wayans brothers, Shawn and Marlon, have obtained after being on Television and in films for years that they would invest their money and their time in projects that would be a bit more thoughtful and entertaining. Instead, ever since the runaway success of \"A Haunted House\" in 2013, the two, particularly Marlon, have been keen on making movies that fit the bill for the lowest common denominator of entertainment. \"Fifty Shades of Black,\" a horribly obvious and persistently unfunny array of cheapshots at the erotic novel/film series that is already too easy to joke about, continues Marlon's streak and incredible failing to make something out of his Baby Way Productions company.I've always found it interesting that while Tyler Perry's films are anything but consistent, and there are about an equal number of bad films in his catalog as good films, he often gets blamed for making films about black people that cater to the lowest common denominator and showcase them in a negative light, yet the recent collaborations of Marlon Wayans and Michael Tiddes go pretty much unscathed. These are films that evoke some of the most putrid and ugly stereotypes about nearly every race and, for that matter, exist simply as unapologetically crude and contrived projects that do nothing but attempt to evoke laughs based on brand-recognition. These films are just a slight notch above the dreaded works of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.As hinted, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is a parody of \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" and it takes pretty much the safest, most convenient route to parody the film by making the jokes largely centered around the absurdity of BDSM and its culture, race and ethnic humor, the ordinariness and \"ugliness\" of its lead female character, and the enigma surrounding its titular character, who in this case, is Christian Black (Marlon Wayans). Christian is a multi-millionaire mogul who begins a sexual relationship with his new intern, Hannah Steale (Kali Hawk) and what entails is a relationship filled with sex, sexual violence, and downright bizarre encounters.While whatever Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison gang is cooking up this year is likely to get plenty of Razzie nominations, Marlon Wayans and his cast of familiar faces such as Affion Crockett, Missi Pyle, Mike Epps, Fred Willard, and more should be looking at the same award. It's incredibly rare to see a cast ostensibly operate on auto-pilot and look like the end product bearing some essence of quality is the furthest thing from their minds, but perhaps given the lazy screen writing of Rick Alvarez and Wayans himself, this was to be expected.Shockingly enough, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" offers more laughs than both of the \"Haunted House\" films put together, especially during a sequence that parodies one of last year's Best Picture contenders at the Academy Awards. However, in order to get to this sequence, one has to succumb to the drudgery of enough racial and bathroom humor - so much that it gives Laura Mulvey's concept of \"phallocentrism\" a whole different angle to explore - that it ultimately isn't worth sitting through the amount of trivial nonsense to get to that particular scene.We're not even in February yet and this year has already been incredibly interesting for comedies. After seeing \"Ride Along 2,\" I didn't think many more comedies of the year would get much worse than that. Then I saw \"Dirty Grandpa\" the following week and I thought the same thing; there was most likely the weakest comedy of 2016 that I would have to sit through. Now, almost exactly a week later, I've seen \"Fifty Shades of Black,\" and if this isn't the worst comedy of 2016, I seriously fear what I have to endure in the coming eleven months.",

            "content": "People who hate Fifty Shades Of Grey (I bet there's a lot of you'se out there} will be appeased. Here, you pi..ed off many, will be compensated for your suffering. This comedy spoof, ala, Wayans, almost outdoes itself, near up there on the comedy scale with films like Bruno. They'll be chuckles aloud, in continuity. And we know if the Wayans are involved, we're not gonna be disappointed, smart brothers who know comedy but smart comedy with some gags you never see coming. They have an original style of comedy that's always a winning formula. What this film does, is that is it surprisingly sticks to the story and scene structure as the other one, almost to the letter, with some cute changes, one I particularly liked. Here, this one really takes the p..s out of the 2015 bore snore. Exciting lead, Wayans, replaces our dull Dorman, really throwing spark into the role, in top gear as Christian Black, while this time, our English lit student/journo replacement/part time hardware shop worker, and ordinary, known as Hanna, not Anastasia Steele, is wonderfully played by Hawk. From comical whippings to dejected, non helicopter/jet rides, this Fifty Shades has it all. We have some really crude moments involving male anatomy, someone who's really well endowed, shall we say. Hanna Steele's more likable flatmate here, is a chubby Rebel Wilson type who craves sex and food, and food, and food. Again we have many movie references (something I'm not really impressed by) a bit too many here, with a little bit of Zero Dark Thirty and I Spit On Your Grave 3, thrown in as well, as well as the dropping of a famous Porky's (easy lay) character. A couple of surprising co stars show up in this, like a still radiant and refined, Jane Seymour, and shocking as it is surprising, a cameo by a much recently missed Brady. This one has better everything, better script, better acting, entertainment value and appeal, for a number of reasons, most of them, laughably related. Fifty Shade's haters will love this Fifty Shades, trust me. You want something done right, different and smart, get a Wayans to do it. Good show and well made pic too.",

When i saw the preview for this movie i was actually excited to go and watch it. I eventually got tired of watching thrillers and action movies and wanted to just laugh at stupid people. The problem is i only got the stupid people part but no laughs.It's was dull, egregious, embarrassing, and just plain stupid. The funny days of Scary Movie 1 and 2 are long gone for the creators of this crap fest. Their once promising comedy future has inevitably burned out.I don not recommend this movie at all. Under no circumstances should anyone view this garbage. Side effects will include: abdominal pain, lower your IQ level, headache, anger, throwing objects at the screen, and financial bankruptcy.A huge number of the black audience actually got up half way through the movie and walked out, but then there were only 15 people in the theater opening day, I wish i did the same but i stayed since i spend $22 dollars and was trying to get my money's worth. It wasn't. Watch Kung Fu Panda 3. You'll get more laughs and joy for your money. Cheers!",

But I couldn't have been more wrong. It was more 50 Shades Of Shite. Five minutes in to the film and I knew i'd spend the remaining 1 hour 27 minutes with my palm on my forehead, cringing for my life at it's stupidity.The film had potential to be very funny but the idea was crushed by the terrible acting, and pathetic excuse for dark humor. I can account for the two times, throughout the whole movie, I let out a slight giggle- well it was more of a scoff but at least it triggered some kind of emotion eh. As a kid I loved the Haunted House and Marlon Wayans was brilliant in it; I think this is why I expected great things. I think he should stick to his PG rating films. It's crude sexual content contained stereotypical 'humor' that could be considered racist towards African American's and many people could take offence. I find it offensive that we are expected to pay as much as \u00a35 to watch this. Watching paint dry is more entertaining. I was counting down the painful minutes, praying for the movie to end. When it did, sheer disappointment and disgust was how I was left feeling about this movie. This film is a waste of time and a waste of a cinema slot.",

At the beginning the movie doesn't really know where it's going, but after a while it finds its pace and delivers. Me and my friends had good laughs.",

Marlon plays the wealthy business man that tries to seduce the innocent young girl, Kali, into his world of sexual romper room. Affion plays Marlon's rather 'talented' brother, and when I say 'talented', I mean with the ladies. There is a scene where Affion has just finished satisfying a lady and is nude as he walks by the coffee table, knocking things to the floor with his.....appendage. The movie is good and bad; some jokes are funny but most are just silly as they seem to be trying too hard for a laugh. There are a few cameos. I remember seeing Jane Seymour, Florence Henderson, Michael Epps and Fred Willard. I guess it depends on how much you like this type of humor; it's not for everyone. Marlon is a co-writer of the movie. There is a lot of graphic language and nudity, and I have nothing against nudity, but here, there is more of the male kind and not enough of the female kind. It's rated \"R\" for language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. It would be alright, as a rental, if you are a fan. Otherwise, you might want to just skip it, entirely.",

            "content": "\"Fifty Shades of Black\" is yet another film in the idiotic teenager parody genre. This overused genre consists of many movies currently on IMDB's Bottom 100 list....with the likes of \"Disaster Movie\" (#1), \"Epic Movie\" (#12), \"Date Movie\" (#24), \"Scary Movie V\" (#50), \"The Starving Games\" (#44) and \"Extreme Movie\" (#99). \"Fifty Shades of Black\", incidentally, is #65 on this infamous list of badness. Unlike other films in this god-awful genre, this film is a parody of another film on the infamous Bottom 100 list, the original \"Fifty Shades of Gray\" (#92).This film is a bit different from the other crappy parodies I mentioned above. It is more a silly version of the original film and is NOT a parody of a dozen or more other films (which the above garbage films all are). Also, not surprisingly, it's MUCH more sexually-oriented...as \"Fifty Shades of Gray\" was a highly sexualized story. But this is much more crude than I even expected...and crude and unfunny scenes were piled on atop the other! It also has a lot of content that might make the more left-leaning audience members cringe or become furious. The leading man in this film is rich and successful like the one in the original story...BUT because he's black (Marlon Wayans), he says he made his fortune selling crack and sucking....well...IMDB won't let me say more about that. This is NOT the most positive and uplifting sort of black man, that's for sure!As far as the story goes, it's terrible....so terrible I found I much preferred the original film...which I still strongly dislike. Yes, they managed to make a worse version of an already terrible movie! Offensive, brain-numbingly stupid, crude beyond belief, and, sadly, a film marketed mostly towards younger folks (whose growing brains really don't need this!). Currently, this film is #65 on the Bottom 100....I think that is way, way too generous...especially after seeing the Florence Henderson (I am NOT kidding) sex scene!",

Seems redundant, but they did it.50 shades of black has some decent jokes that poke fun at how outrageous 50 Shades of Grey is (although my favorite bit was one that parodied Whiplash with Florence Henderson playing a music teacher training young boys to use their \"instruments\"), but the laughs are not constant enough through the entire movie to justify the money spent. It's good that Wanyans has no problem making light of himself, cause it's those skits that made for the most laugh out loud experience , but he also has no problem making a joke at someone else's expense. I probability would not care if the jokes were funny. There recent though, with a joke about the 2016 presidential campaign thrown in the mix. It's packed with enough laughs to get something out of it, but the material used to make this was too weak itself for this movie to be all that good.",

The story is a direct parody of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" where college student, Hannah Steele played by Kali Hawk, falls for unorthodox billionaire, Christian Black played by Marlon Wayans, but his sexual practices put a strain on what could become a beautiful relationship. The story is there for what could have been a heavy dose of comedy, but it doesn't seem to mesh well as the film could have.The director, Michael Tiddes known for over the top comedies like \"A Haunted House\" (2013), stayed true the style of comedy. Ever comedic take had funny laced in the dialogue or visuals and then amplified to drive it home. Occasionally it was a bit much. The music that filled most of the film was very intertwining and relatively spot on but, there were a few lapses in the sound department. Some of the voice-overs missed the mark and took away from the film. Overall, it was just OK but, still an enjoyably film.",

The wife and I went to the theater expecting some lighthearted fun. But, what we saw was anything but fun or funny.This film's attempts to parody the plot of Fifty Shades of Grey were overshadowed by the stilted dialogue, lame sight gags, and ineffectual attempts to get a rise out of the audience with tired racial stereotyping and racist humor. Sexual humor was expected. But I did expect some of it to be funny. It wasn't. Most of the gags in the film were greeted by dead silence in the theater and blank stares at the screen by my fellow theater goers.We talked about walking out of the movie after the first scene, and every scene after that until we finally did walk out 20 minutes into the movie.Maybe there was a funny joke in that movie later on, but I am sure I will not be giving this movie a second chance.

Up and down, people and critics hated it. Plus it came and went like how fast the Christian in this film had sex. But, 30 seconds in, a laugh was forced out of me and I found myself laughing through to the end.That said, yes, admittedly, a ton of jokes did not work. Many forced, many just retreaded bad stereotypes they ran into the ground. But, for the times that they hit the head of the nail...I was almost in tears laughing. And to top it off, it was 100x more enjoyable than the \"serious\" movie it spoofed: Fifty Shades of Grey. Come to think of it, I laughed in both movies. Only this movie was intended to make me laugh.Like the other Wayans' project, Scary Movie, which, for the record, is way funnier, the movie is almost a shot-by-shot remake/satire of Fifty Shades of Grey. Sadly, as much as I've tried to forget that \"experience,\" I recall a ton here in \u0085Black as was in \u0085Grey. Again, there are a ton of scenes and jokes that just didn't work and were foreseen minutes in advance, but for the parts that did have me bust out loud, it worked. I know the criticisms, wait, actually, make that I *don't* know the criticisms. I haven't read, heard or seen anyone else's reviews \u2013 something I don't do before I see a movie and especially before I write my take, but I have heard people didn't like this much. I just could not hold back some laughter. I truly had a great time here. Enough to see a second time? Eh, maybe. Perhaps I was just in a good mood. I dunno. But, I do know this: I just finished this and I did have a good time here. Take that for what it's worth. Go in fresh, forget the complaints and maybe you'll laugh, as well.ESPECIALLY if you hated Fifty Shades of Grey as much as I did. ***Final thoughts: Man, I love to be surprised. Sometimes I love when my expectations are so low and the creative team of a film completely blows me away. They did it here and after what I heard about the upcoming Ghostbusters remake that I am (as of now, July 12, 2016) dreading\u0085I hope I am proved wrong there and I have a great time with their vision as well.",

What isn't surprising is that spoof specialist and kinda, sorta washed up actor/writer Marlon Wayans was the one to do so. Wayans, whose previous parody films include A Haunted House 1 & 2, Dance Flick and Scary Movie 1-4 brings forth a very important question with his newest spoof feature Fifty Shades of Black; is the spoof film finally, officially dead? Its hard to believe but, after such classics as Airplane!, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and yes, even the original Scary Movie, the spoof film may slowly if not almost entirely die off and be resting in peace very soon.The world currently is one that is obsessed with social media platforms and media within these social networks. Thanks to applications such as Vine, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and YouTube, it seems that audiences everywhere are capable of finding comedy and entertainment, not only within the comfort of their own homes, but as easily and accessibly, within moments, within the palms of their hand.When the dawn of the television was upon us, people everywhere thought that televisions were going to destroy Hollywood and the history of feature films altogether; it didn't. With the rise of the Internet and the quickly developing moment of streaming and illegally downloading films and music online, people soon thought that the future of movies and music was on its way on the decline. Yet, in 2015 no less, two of the highest grossing films of all-time were released, and more than ever, the profitability of music has never been better. So, how and why is the spoof film genre dying slowly but surely?The thing about entertainment in 2016 is that, entertainment isn't merely measured but numbers and margins, but by memories and moments of experience and spectacle, with margins and numbers as well. Entertainment is constantly evolving, and the forms in which we consume entertainment maintains the ways in which we determine whether the entertainment itself is viable, or not. The thing with earlier spoof films like the ones that were mentioned above are, in order to consume such comedy, going to the movie theatres and watching it for yourself was the only way of consumption. Now a days, not only are films, genres and characters spoofed on the daily, but pop culture, with the help of social media, spoofs the crap out of anything and everything. Don't think thats the case? Think back, just in 2015, to all the spoofs you saw online about Adele's song Hello, Drake's music video to Hotline Bling, as well as anything else flooding the front pages of your vine, Instagram and Facebook news feeds.The beauty behind the genius in the earlier spoof films of the 80's and 90's was that accessibility was limited and, these films weren't just spoofing a specific movie, having limited content to work with. Think of Austin Powers for example, it wasn't just a spoof on spy films and a filmography of more than a dozen Bond films at that time, but also a genre, the unbelievability of a lifestyle or profession little to nothing is known about, as well as providing a fantasy for the possibility of the many beauties the life of what an international person of mystery might really be like. Sure, Black may spoof Kim K for a second, the Weeknd here and there, but overall, these small and insignificant and highly forgettable inclusions did nothing to elevate the plot or humour of the film overall.If you're wondering why I haven't really mentioned the plot line or story of Black, well, thats because the film is basically a shot-for-shot carbon copy of the original Grey film, with added crass and crude black jokes included, sexual innuendos juiced up to the max and of course, taking what the original did, and making it funny by stripping away its glamorous and polished exterior; essentially, making it real world scary for real life people. No matter how you look at it, regardless of how much money you have, any girl would be scared of having a wealthy man stalking you at work asking for ropes and zip-ties and what not.What I found super interesting with Black was how the film is slowly accepting and transitioning from movie stars, to social media stars starring within feature films. Sure we've seen Vine stars make cameos in films before, like Brittany Furland in last year's We Are Your Friends, but in Black, social media icon King Back/Andrew Bachelor has a very prominent role as the not so subtle yet totally obvious best friend Jesse that wants a piece, like any other straight male friend wants from their female friends. Bach represents not only a dominance of social media within feature films, but perhaps, the next phase and new generation of movies stars tomorrow. Plus, is it just me or does Bach remind anyone else of a younger Will Smith?Sure Black states the obvious humours that we found in the original Grey film, but the beauty of Fifty Shades of Grey was that it knew that it was going to be the basis to much criticism, the butt end of endless jokes and spoof online for weeks and months after its release. Luckily for the film, made on only $40 million dollar, its return really laughed in all the faces of sceptics and all its negative criticism. Fifty Shades of Grey broke these records; highest grossing film directed by a woman, highest grossing February release and #1 President Day 4-Day Holiday Weekend (all of these numbers NOT adjusted for inflation). So I guess, the joke is on us, especially since they numbers and records are bound to be broken once the newest instalment of the series is released in 2017.",

            "content": "The Wayans Family has created quite an entertainment dynasty over the past three decades or so. Long before anyone had heard of Tyler Perry, the Wayans Brothers, as most people refer to them, started creating big and small screen entertainment that catered to the African-American audience. The Wayans brought us the sketch comedy show \"In Living Color\" (1990-1994) which, in turn, helped launch the careers of Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx and David Alan Grier, among others, as well as films like \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka\" (1988), \"Major Payne\" (1995) and the \"Scary Movie\" horror film parodies (2000-2013).The Wayans are mostly known for their parodies. 2016 adds another one to the list with Marlon, the youngest of the original \"Wayans Brothers\", co-writing and starring in \"Fifty Shades of Black\" (R, 1:31). Most will immediately recognize that this film is a take-off on 2015's very successful film adaptation of the book \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". Like most of the Wayans' films, pop culture and movie references abound, but \"Fifty Shades of Black\" duplicates much of the plot of the film that inspired its comedy. You'll see what I mean in the following plot summary (which, by the way, is necessarily risqu\u00e9).Hannah Steele (Kali Hawk) is an attractive and intelligent college senior in Washington State who fills in for her sick roommate, Kateesha (Jenny Zigrino) in interviewing billionaire business magnate Christian Black (Marlon Wayans) for the college newspaper. Hannah gets flustered in the presence of this sophisticated, supremely-confident and mysterious man. Christian is quite taken with Hannah \u2013 and take her is what he soon decides he wants to do. He shows up at the hardware store where she works, takes her out to coffee and even comes to \"rescue\" her when she drunk dials him from a bar. Despite how obvious it is to the main characters and to the audience that these two are very, very different \u2013 and despite the title character's own conflicted resistance \u2013 these two cannot resist each other. But Christian very clearly states, \"I don't do romance.\" That doesn't stop Hannah from being drawn to this man.As Hannah discovers more about the cipher that is Christian, she learns that he is wounded \u2013 both emotionally and physically \u2013 by his childhood. She seems to want to comfort this man who acts as if he needs no comforting and begins to love this man who tells her that he is only interested in her for sex. Being the woman in Christian Black's life means submitting completely \u2013 sexually and otherwise \u2013 to his whims. As he eases her towards an understanding and acceptance of his lifestyle, she has to sign a non-disclosure agreement, he convinces her to have sex (actually \"f--- hard\", as he describes it) and then shows her his \"playroom.\" This usually locked room is painted dark red, has a bed and is filled with various restraining devices and implements of sadomasochistic sex play. Hannah is shocked, but not necessarily repulsed. Christian presents his contract which describes Hannah's role as his submissive.I just did something I've never done before (or even been remotely able to do) in a movie review. The previous two paragraphs are actually cut and pasted from my 2015 review of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\"! Using the \"find/replace\" function in Microsoft Word, I changed the names of the characters and the actors playing them to match those in \"Fifty Shades of Black\" and I shortened the summary, but I did not add or change anything else. (You can scroll down our timeline to my \"Grey\" review to see for yourself.) But rest assured there's plenty in \"Black\" besides just recreating and making fun of scenes from \"Grey\". \"Fifty Shades of Black\" also seamlessly incorporates Wayans-esque versions of scenes from such movies as \"Whiplash\" and \"Magic Mike\". There are also references to a plethora of other popular movies, TV shows and books, plus a generous helping of pop culture satire and some politics. This is the kind of film which is so fresh, it feels like it was written a month before its release, but that means that its humor (and perhaps its appeal) will quickly become dated. Of course, there's also plenty of racial humor, much of it stemming from white actors Jane Seymour and Fred Willard playing the title character's parents.Like much of the Wayans' work, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is very funny in spots, but those spots are small and spread out. The few clever/amusing jokes and sight gags and even fewer laugh-out-loud moments seem adrift in a sea of gross-out humor and over-the-top acting which is often not that funny. Still, most Wayans fans will probably enjoy the film and those who've only seen a little of their work may find this one good enough for a mild recommendation. \"B-\"",

            "content": "I've been a big Wayans brothers fan ever since the release of their 1996 movie, \"Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood\". Before that I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too artsy, too intellectual. It was on \"Don't Be a Menace...\" where Marlon Wayans' presence became more apparent. \"Fifty Shades of Black\" an epic meditation on intangibility, at the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding movies. Look to the brilliant ensemble playing of Wayans, Hawk and Zigrino. You can practically feel every nuance of every human emotion. In terms of comical craftsmanship and sheer beauty of Hawk's boobs, this move hits a new peak of professionalism. The whole movie has a clear, crisp look and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the script a big boost. He's been compared to Chris Rock, but I think Marlon has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor. Take the \"Wesley Snipes tax\" gag. In this segment, Marlon Wayans addresses the problem of abusive political authority. I think that this movie is Wayans' undisputed masterpiece. The script is so witty, that most people probably don't think about deep underlying themes, but they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the author himself. Most importantly, Hannah's fiery monologue at the end of the movie encourages us to oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights, while also promoting equal rights for women. Also, the masterfully crafted politically correct script reminds us that we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people.",

Much of the humor involves racial stereotypes, but rather than being mean spirited toward minorities, it often ridicules the ignorance of bigots. The sexual content, as well as the sadomasochistic elements were low key and conservative, despite the R-rating in part for \"some graphic nudity,\" which comprised obviously prosthetic phalli and scrota, and one left breast that looked better than real. Production values were more than adequate with a refreshing lack of distracting camera jitter. Performances were solid throughout, with all the actors committed to roles that weren't always flattering. Kudos to Jane Seymour and Florence Henderson for their unabashed performances, as well as to the rest of the cast. None of the actors seemed self-conscious in the least. My chief reservation is that they didn't push the envelope a little further. The bondage scenes and Steale's brassiere and panties ensembles became a bit repetitive.

There is also a lot of discussion regarding the content (especially racial) of their films. All this aside, they have found a successful formula so can't really blamed for running for it. Hollywood has done it constantly for years now and few complain about that.I actually watched this before watching the film that this parodies. I'm unsure if that was the right thing to do or not, but if you have not seen Fifty Shades of Grey, this should still satisfy their fans, or fans or downright silly and extreme sexual humour (with plenty of racial stereotypes thrown in as usual). The film never lets up with the absurd jokes and senarios and if you have seen Grey, this pretty much parodies that film scene for scene (even down to the dialogue at times).Marlon Wayans plays Christian Black, a billionaire businessman who has made his money the way most black entrepreneurs have. No not through real estate, but drugs. Kali Hawke plays Steale, the niaeve and shy young woman who Christian quickly becomes obsessed with. Unless you have been living under a rock or in the middle of the rainforest, I'm sure by now most people are aware of the content of Shades and how much controvery and critisism both the books and the film have received.The jokes here and dumb, silly, slapstick, crude and sexual in nature, playing largely on the BDSM content. A lot of these jokes miss, a lot are funny if you leave your brain down the road before watching. I really do not understand the critisim this particular parody has recieved though. Wayons does what he does, and while of late his acting and writing may not be up to what it once was, you should know what to expect from one of his films by now. Why watch and then compain about the offensive humour? I thinksome people like to moan for the sake of hearing their own voices.To sum up, this is not a good film, but it does have its funny moments and is not a film to anylise in great detail but to watch, giggle, facepalm and then forget. If you're a fan of Wayans and of crude sexual jokes then give this a try but don't be expecting any great comical genius from it.\nThe Sage's Rating: 6/10",

Another painfully unfunny spoof that takes nearly all it's material from previously made content. That is the basic definition of Fifty Shades of Black. There was only one point during this film that I wanted to laugh but because of how bad the rest of the film was I couldn't. There are two main problems with this film. 1. The script is really, really awful and is not funny in any way and 2. Nobody in this film can act! Those are two vital things to make a comedy funny the acting and the script and if both of these fail then the film is just terrible, which is what this pile of trash is. All jokes are about Fifty Shades Of Grey and it's content and might as well be an adaptation of a joke book of painfully unfunny sex jokes. There are so many moments intended to make people laugh but just end up being horribly cringe worthy moments because of either what can be seen or just what is being said. There were points where people moaned in disgust at the goings on on screen and the majority of the film was spent in silence. In total two different people ,out of 13, laughed at two different points, 3 people walked out during the film because of how bad it was.Nearly all of the characters in the film are annoying and this is made even worse by the terrible acting. During the film Marlon Wayans character describes something as \"painfully uninteresting\" and something else as being written by someone in year 3. Fifty Shades of Black is painfully unfunny and boring and could have been written by a dirty minded 8 year old. But then again the 8 year old would have probably wrote something much more entertaining and funnier. It isn't as bad as other parody films but Fifty Shades Of Black is still a seriously unfunny film and is definitely one of the worst films of 2016. ** <-- Two Stars",

It's already starting to cause me even more pain.This movie serves as a parody to Fifty Shades of Grey, but the bad thing about it is that it is not even funny or different from the same old toilet humour that is used so often in comedy movies nowadays. There was not one moment where I chuckled or even sniggered. I think I did laugh, but that might have been at the movie not with the awful clich\u00e9 jokes that I've already heard in these comedy movies.And it's such a shame to see a talented actor like Marlon Wayans, who before offered a fantastic turn with Requiem for a Dream and then made us chuckle with the first two Scary Movie films, and then to see that talent wasted in this abomination of a parody movie. I hate it when actors just become overpaid tools in movies that they know are bad but they are just in it for the money, when they know that they are better than that.The thing is that Fifty Shades of Grey was anything but a good movie to start off with, so parodying a movie that is already bad doesn't make it any better or more enjoyable. I mean, this movie could've been funny in some places, but the dick and ball jokes that this movie overuses so many times just failed to hit.Not to mention it's out of place references to other movies, not just Fifty Shades of Grey, but you can tell from the poster that it's making those references just to try to be funnier, and to their credit, no, they failed.If you watch one movie early this year, Fifty Shades of Black is definitely not worth recommending when you really should just buy another ticket for Deadpool.Overall rating 1/10.",

Never since Birdman have I seen such a power-house of a film hilariously and truthfully mirroring Hollywood and the state it is in. By parodying Fifty Shades of Grey, one of the few masterpieces of 2015, not a year before it was made turns Hollywood's state of remakes on it's head. Marlon Wayans is fantastic, bringing his charisma, energy, and displaying the raw and powerful emotion we thought he had lost after Scary Movie 2. And how this film turned out to be the masterpiece of cinema it is is just an accomplishment. An insightful, hilarious and culturally sensitive film this is a special landmark and kicks off 2016 with art-house genius and style.",

Micheal Tiddes, who also worked on \"A Haunted House.\" How is this guy such a success. His comedy is so out there and dull, and his parody style is so grotesque that I find it kind of insane that he is still around and making so much money off of people.

So if you are a big fan of the numerous other Wayans spoofs, then chances are very high that you will enjoy this one too. But personally, then I think that formula has been worn down to the bone and it is time for Wayans to go back to the creative corner and come up with something new.The end result that is \"Fifty Shades of Black\" turned out to be not particularly funny. Sure, there were some good laughs here and there throughout the course of the movie, because of the jokes or the situations. But in overall, then this was a very generic and flaccid movie, which could have been a lot more funnier with some more creative and original writing.I will actually go as far as saying that if you have seen any one of the many previous Wayans spoofs, then you have essentially also already seen \"Fifty Shades of Black\".Now, I haven't seen the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" movie, nor read the book, and I have no intention to do so. So how much or how little \"Fifty Shades of Black\" stays true to the original source material.However, all in all, then \"Fifty Shades of Black\" was just another generic spoof comedy that failed to stand out or leave any real lasting impression.",

The film was directed by Michael Tiddes, and written by Marlon Wayans and Rick Alvarez; the same trio performed the same duties on both 'A HAUNTED HOUSE' movies (which are parodies of the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' flicks). Wayans also stars in the film, as Christian Black; a rich entrepreneur with an obsession for stalking and beating young women. Kali Hawk costars, as the virgin college student he's pursuing. The movie also features Jane Seymour, Fred Willard and Florence Henderson in supporting roles. It's about as bad as you'd expect it to be, with just a few funny moments mixed in.Christian Black (Wayans) is a wealthy businessman; who made most of his money through stealing from others (and a brief job as a male stripper). He's obsessed with stalking and domineering young women (and he already has four restraining orders against him). So when a young virgin college student, named Hannah Steale (Hawk), comes to his office to interview him, for her roommate's school paper, he immediately becomes infatuated with her. A very unhealthy relationship develops. The movie is almost as painfully bad, and crude and offensive, as the material it's parodying. Almost, but not quite. It's not as offensive as 'FIFTY SHADES OF GREY', because it's main intent is just to spoof that film; it's a joke, and not supposed to be taken seriously. Parts of it are funny, because the film it's spoofing is so easy to make fun of, but it's definitely not clever or witty in any way.

I watched this movie with my sister on an ordinary night when we had nothing better to do. None of us had seen it nor seen the trailer or read the reviews. I normally always look up every movie on IMDb before watching it, but in this case I am glad I didn't.

Please understand that it's not uncommon for movies who aim to make people laugh to have low ratings. It is simply because not everybody is into that kind of humor. It's like when people who hate horror movies watch a horror movie and then make a review on it.My sister and me happen not to like the original \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" and maybe that is one of the reasons why we found this movie so funny. It was very obvious to us that they were just making one big joke out of everything. Everything was very exaggerated which we thought was extremely funny. They have done a very good job in taking small details from the original movie and turning it into something funny and crazy - again please keep in mind that it's a parody and meant to be a little too much!This humor was so stupid that we just had to laugh uncontrollably throughout the whole movie.

Unlike the last few movies they have done though this one is more of a mock then a spoof, in the vein of Hot Shots. Rather then just piecing together parts of different movies to try and be funny, this one sticks to the Fifty Shades of Grey story and really just takes it in a more ridiculous direction.

So when the parody movies become bad themselves, then you have to ask yourself how low can Hollywood go these days??In all the comedies of the Wayans family, there are strong crude and sexual content, and no laughing. This one is no exception. It's nearly a comedy about the human genitals and excretory organs; which's disgusting and unfunny enough! So I was about to say: \"If you want to watch human feces, go and watch this\", however, WHO WOULD WATCH HUMAN FECES IN THE FIRST PLACE??!!There is no plot whatsoever. No attempt to understand the leads' characters or problems either; for mocking at them rightly. And accordingly the movie is nothing but huge jelly made of horrible sex jokes. So when you delete drama, as well as comedy, and immerse me - as a viewer - in tons of filth, then this is the perfect recipe for forgettable ugly nonsense!They could have made a comedy about a pervert soft porn masquerading as a romance. But No. Nudity, nastiness, and repulsiveness are way easier. Therefore, when this parody tries to have a conscience, and criticizes its original, Fifty Shades of Grey (2015), by saying that its novel was written by a third grader--it all falls apart. Because considering the condition of this very parody; IT IS written by the same third grader!Fairly, a few moments were kind of comic, and showed a bit of smartness; like the scene of unlocking the cuffs, and couple of lines. But the rest of the movie, namely 95 % of it, was between provocatively stupid and vomit-causing. I don't know, is that the legacy that Marlon Wayans wants to leave to the next generations, or even his own kids; \"I was unfunny dude, who used to hide his ridiculousness under nauseating language and shocking images, to be even more unfunny\"??!!Watching a Hollywood movie nowadays became a real torture. It's a heavy load of badness, which addresses the lowest desires in the human self, with superabundance of nudity, drugs, and cursing. Fifty Shades of Black doesn't satirize that sarcastically; it is that itself, yet without any workable sarcasm. So what an appalling failure and complete torture that is!There is something rotten in the state of Hollywood? No. Hollywood has become a rotten state already!",

            "content": "I honestly ducked this movie when it came out in theaters for while I find the Wayans family as a whole funny, I do feel when Kenan isn't there to reel his brothers in and hone their collective talents, they are all over the place. Yet it is hard to deny that even without Kenan at the head, the individual members of the Wayans family aren't funny. Problem is, the currently most visible Wayan, Marlon, is honestly in desperate need of someone who knows his talent and can refine it. Main Storyline (with Commentary)In probably one of the worse movies I have ever seen, yet finished, we watch as Hannah (Kali Hawk) for some reasons dates Christian Black (Marlon Wayans). This is despite him calling her ugly, basic, letting his friends insult her, him having no sex game, him being cheap, and his mother seeming kind of racist. But the story-line isn't why anyone would watch a comedic film starring Marlon Wayans, it is the laughs. Well, they are in short supply. For despite all the bondage things which could be mocked, as well as the weirdness of the 50 Shades of Grey lore, honestly what we are given is potty humor made for teenagers. We sway from just licking everything to jokes about penis sizes, Christian drops a whole bunch of pop culture jokes which aren't memorable, and ultimately you are left feeling that Marlon Wayans must be forced to release one comedy a year or else he is going to get sued. HighlightsI remember laughing once or twice. One time during a Kevin Hart joke, and I'm sure there was a second. Well, maybe there was.Low PointsTo begin, there is Kateesha (Jenny Zigrino) who is Hannah's roommate and seemingly her only friend. She is a ghetto white girl who is insufferable. I mean, she is a stereotypical big, multicolored haired, ghetto, fat white girl who loves her some big black penis. Which I'm sure is supposed to be a parody of someone, but I couldn't once find out what is supposed to be funny about her. If anything, I felt bad for the actress since I assume the embarrassment an actor would get from working in a minstrel show is what she got working in this movie. But hey, she got a check, right?Perhaps the big issue here is that along with there being a weak story, little to no chemistry between Wayans and Hawk, is that the jokes almost all flopped. To the point, I look at this movie like how some look at some musicians once they get up in age. There comes a point where you realize you only see their performances due to nostalgia and not because you think they still got it. Such is the case with Marlon Wayans. After all, who didn't laugh at the many movies he did with his brothers, as well as his TV show on the WB network? Yet here he is, still doing parodies, after it seems his brothers have moved on from the genre and he is still trying to pretend he is in his glory days. To me, I think he may have reached the point a lot of comedic actors have where it is time for him to perhaps move onto dramatic movies or start becoming a supporting character to help push future stars. Which isn't me saying he isn't funny period, for his interviews and stand-up remains comical, but like Eddie Murphy something just isn't working anymore and if he refuses to adapt, step his game up, or what have you, he is going to eventually lose that curiosity if he still has it to portray a comedic character, much less do a parody, on film.",

I have always like the Wayans brother television shows and some of their films too. Anyhoo, I was excited and looking forward to seeing this movie parody. I liked their films \"Lowdown Dirty Shame\", \"White Chicks\" and the \"Scary Movie\" parodies. The best thing about this movie is Biracial cute actress Kali Hawk. I liked Kali Hawk and pretty Biracial actress Katerina \"Kat\" Graham in the parody of their African and Jewish heritage of which both actress are in real life Black and Jewish, hint the spoof \"Black and Jewish\" video. Not a lot of cursing and it was funny making fun of both races.However, this film does have a few funny moments, but all the disgusting cursing and sexual innuendos, use of the \"N\" and \"B\" word by actress Jenny Zigrino and others mentioning of male and female body parts totally turned me off. Also films like this make African Black Americans look bad and women have been far to insulted with calling women a \"B\" just like taking a drink of water. You Never see Jewish American actors/actress degrading themselves on film just for a laugh.How can we as Black Americans complain about other races using the \"N\" word and we are using it ourselves so frivolously. Another major turn off for me in any movie or t.v show is the use of profanity and God or Jesus Christ/Yeshua in scenes.I kept thinking that the cursing would at least slow down to 20 miles an hour, but it never does. Just like the movies \"Spy\", \"Train Wreck\" and \"Dirty Grandpa\" this movie too has more hard core cursing than a porno movie. It should have been rated NC~17 if such a MPAA rating still exist.After watching twenty minutes of it, I left the theater the same as I did with \"Train Wreck\" and asked for a refund which I was given.",

First off I've seen and read 50 Shades of Grey and even though the movie wasn't as good after seeing this I actually appreciate the movie 50 Shades of Grey even more.This movie was actually pretty racist strangely enough and I'm not one to complain about racist jokes except when they're from 1992; black people liking fried chicken and hot sauce? Really? This movie tried way too hard and Marlon Wayans was a huge over-actor, even more than usual. Parodies were a lot better in the eighties and nineties when you had Spy Hard and Spaceballs. Granted the Wayans had Don't be a Menace and Scary Movie but apparently it takes more than one Wayans to write a funny movie. He needs to stop flying solo. You had A haunted House now go back to your brothers! Frankly I'd rate this lower than a 1 if I could. The only thing I noticed is Marlon's definitely been working out and interestingly enough I think he would've been a cool addition to Magic Mike XXL. He would've added extra humor to the bunch. A role in that movie would've been a million times better than this 50 shades of crap.",

Marlon Wayans was one of the minds behind the very funny Scary Movie (the first one, not the awful sequels) so I hoped that Wayans had recaptured the same comedic energy and brilliance for 50 Shades of Black.But no.No, no, no.This is a bad, bad movie. In fact, it's so bad, it's embarrassing. I never feel bad for actors in Hollywood productions; their salaries are more than what most people make in a year (Wayans makes 7.2 million a year, wow) but this 50 Shades spoof is so filled with cringe moments that you can't help but squirm in your seat and look away from the screen. If you're the kind of person that enjoys pulling the legs from spiders or capturing and then torturing neighbourhood pets, maybe you'll invite a few friends over and play this for them.Other than that, I'd say avoid.Wayans, why not open a charity or an orphanage with that money, man?

To say that this was better than the movie it was spoofing shows you just how bad that movie was. The only reason Grey was doing better than Black in the box office is due to there being a cult following of the books the Grey movies were based on. Those who either did not like the books or the Grey movies might be able to enjoy this. However a greater population do not know about the books or the movies or what they were about before watching this movie or are loyal fans of Grey. Christian Black is not a likable character as he was verbally abusive to Hannah Steel and generally has commitment issues. Maybe a little over the top but not far off from the Christian Grey character. Hannah is also just like Anastasia Steel in the way she always says 'I don't want to be controlled or submissive' but then always does exactly what she is told. Mostly at first she was amused by the idea of getting spanked and then she gets serious since Christian Grey is only in it for the sex and says she wants to find out just how intense things would get before leaving. The movie follows the same plot but ends with no to be continued like the movie it was spoofing thank god. This movie is probably worth watching only once and also does not require a sequel.",

To lower themselves to this level was utterly repulsive to me. I thought they both had more class than that. My opinion of each of them has now seriously suffered.The only other movie I've ever considered walking out of for all the same reasons was Borat, which was equally as bad.There was only one moment in this entire movie that was actually funny, and that was seeing Christian grey, black, red, white, blue, etc. listed in Hannah's cell phone. The rest of the 'humor' was clearly aimed at the highly narrow demographic of 13-year-old boys. What a colossal disappointment.",

None of the jokes land and they all depend on the concept of saying something loud means its funny. The entire movie has no plot and there is no character development and nothing goes anywhere. All of the scenes could have been rearranged in any order and it wouldn't have made any difference. I feel like the entire budget went into CGI nutsacks because there are way too many of them. This is by far the worst piece of media I have every consumed (besides 3 Idiotas).

OK. what else can i say about this movie that the 5 previous lines didn't say? marlon wore great suits and i liked the apartment's decor. the female lead tried too hard to be serious/funny, but i never read the books nor did i see the movie of fifty shades of gray, so i don't know if the female lead was like this, but being a parody, i assume she was. oh, i almost forgot, the supporting female was the best character in the entire movie and i wish she had a bigger role. i got my laughs mainly from her, but some may think otherwise, but it is a parody after all; you have to take the good with the bad.

            "content": "Fifty Shades of Black is directed by Michael Tiddes, and it stars Marlon Wayans in a spoof comedy about a college student that come across Christian Black (Marlon Wayans), and he come across his interest to her and wanting to be with her, with a paper agreement that Hannah Steale (Kali Hawk) that is. When seeing that there's a parody film of Fifty Shades of Grey be done by Marlon Wayans, is something that makes me worried about, and seeing that it has worse reviews than any of the 50 Shades Series, got me scared. So when seeing the series, of course I am going to watch it and I managed to find it on DirecTV, and while it's the best, it's more pathetic than those films. The main acting is really trying to make those jokes work, which in the right film, Marlon Wayans and Kali Hawk can be really funny together. There are some moments where I was amused like almost every time that King Bach is in this, and then there are some funny moments like Christian Black wrecking things to attack her butt, and when he spanks her butt, Hannah goes back at him, and I think it's because they did something comedic with a scene that I recognize from the film and make it quick enough that doesn't linger on the joke. Those are the only positives thing I can say, as for the negatives, there are some things that I can say. Most of the jokes don't make me laugh, it lingers on like a Family Guy joke that is never funny, and can irritate the crap out of me. There are a lot of character inconsistencies to the point that I just didn't care, and there are some Internet stuff in here that just seem lazy and tacked in. There are some stuff in there that's just gross for the sake of being disgusting, and it's really lame to watch. Fifty Shades of Black is a terrible movie that while it didn't make me as mad as Fifty Shades of Grey, I was just really disappointed that this movie could've been so much better.",

Then the movie comes, and during the sex scenes, Dakota Johnson is as thrilled as a kid in a candy shop, while Jamie Dornan is as thrilled as when I have to talk to someone I don't like, and it's incredibly painful to get through, and you should probably get some kind of award if you make it through just the first book and movie. Which brings us to this movie. Marlon Wayans has incredible charisma. However, that does not mean he is a gifted comedy writer. It is by no means a perfect parody. But, it is an extremely stupid comedy, and if stupid makes you laugh, then this will do the trick. It's also a lot less painful, the hour and a half goes by very quickly. The only reason to watch this is if you are a die hard fan of Marlon Wayans, or if fifty shades of grey ruined your life like it ruined mine. That should do the trick just fine.",

Obviously a parody of Fifty Shades of Grey, this is about a plain college student (Kali Hawk) entering a relationship with wealthy businessman (Marlon Wayans) that she quickly learns engages in some sordid sexual practices.  Hilarity ensues (but not really).  To every Yin, there must be a Yang, and I believe that if you don't take the time to brave and witness the truly dreadful that Hollywood has to offer, you will be less likely to fully appreciate a great movie.  Also, in addition to that, I want to be able to make a respectable worst of list for the year, which is the entire reason why I chose to watch Fifty Shades of Black.  I've got to say: Marlon Wayans has finally done it.  He has put together a movie that actually manages to make the awful original movie that was ripe for parody look desirable by comparison.  Honestly, it couldn't be all that hard to put together a movie that successfully pokes fun at this silly pop culture phenomenon, but he manages to fail at every single moment in this 90-minute so called spoof.  This movie doesn't do anybody any favors, and it unfortunately ends up being one of Florence Henderson's final roles on film for a really limp Graduate reference.  And everything here is just a lame, underwritten gag that doesn't hit, drenched with buffoonery at every single turn.  It is devoid of actual jokes, and this is a movie that doesn't just pick low hanging fruit, it digs up buried and dead fruit up from underground.  All of the jokes are telegraphed, and it either manages to be a bit without a punch line or a random cutaway non sequitur, like \"oh yeah, I remember when Kim Kardashian had that photo shoot\".  At this point, I've reviewed so many of these parody movies (some of which he has previously had involvement in) that they all just blur together.  From A Haunted House 2 to Superfast!, almost all of them are brain-dead, and they are comedies in name only.  This is not an exception to the rule, and I have no idea why you would even take the time with this, unless you're a masochistic movie reviewer that watches everything like me.  This really is so racially offensive that Wayans manages to set his entire race back by a couple of decades, and I am not just saying that for dramatic effect.  There's an entire bit about whips that he chooses from famous slavery movies, and it isn't funny or clever, it is just sad and filled with cringes.  The movie as a whole is flabbergasting, gross, homophobic and tactless, there's something here that will offend every single race and creed.  The most disappointing part is that I know this man has talent and I've seen him act well in projects before, so it makes it all the more depressing that he spends his days making terrible trash like this.",

I really expected Marlon Wayans to be rather funny and overall GOOD in this film, and at least be better than he was in his last production, \"A Haunted House 2\". But really, he's just the same: unfunny. And the real thing I'm worried about is that he actually thinks the stuff that he is doing and saying and portraying in these films are funny. But if you have seen his recent films, you can tell by now he's just not funny or interesting anymore. \n\nThe film started off promising and of course stupid, but in a rather funny way. That was only the first 2 minutes. After that, I had to take off my headphones because some of the things they were saying were things I really didn't want to hear. Yeah, this film is that bad. It's so bad that I gave up watching at about 1 hour and 15 minutes into the film. \n\nIf your expecting something rather funny and enjoyable, you won't get it here.

The story line focused mainly on the extremely unorthodox sexual nature between two individuals and it was kicked up a notch with beyond hilarious additions that only enhanced the complete feel of the movie. At every corner there were jokes that surrounded current pop culture situations which brought the entire outlook of the film to life. From the very start there was no fore playing around. The production team lubed up every scenario and maneuvered their way nice and easy into our hearts with each passing successful scene. This is certainly a \"Must See.\" There was a familiarity with the way the final product was displayed but it also had a new vibe of swagger that felt all new to the game. The moments that the entire theater was not on a roller coaster ride of laughs were when the true substances of the film showed its genuine colors and they sure were bright. Without a doubt lines were for sure tested and almost crossed but the just far enough concept of the entire movie was what kept our eyes glued to the BIG screen with high anticipation of curiosity to what in the world is next. Brilliant insanity is another way to describe what I just willingly viewed. Still to this point my mind is replaying scene after epic scene so to help categorize everything that happened. Even through that, it was good but not great. Awesome but not to the MAX! And for those slight downplays it receives a very sturdy standing of \"3 Stars.\" A truly fun night at the movies. Seriously one of the most unique ones I have EVER had and for that main reason, \"it is all good in the hood.\" YEAH!",

The most important element for a spoof movie, the humor and the fun, are unfortunately totally missing from the 93 minutes of shameful filmmaking. I could recollect only one single moment in which I actually laughed and this is certainly not enough to justify seeing this disaster. \n\nIn conclusion, Fifty Shades of Black is just another example that spoof movies are not fun anymore and that the makers of this kind of sub-genre should be banned from filmmaking for life !",

When you watch this and rewatch fifty shades and grey, you'll see how this movie hit it on the nose.

How can you successfully make fun of a pop culture phenomenon that in itself is already one big joke? This is a nearly scene-by-scene recap of the movie version of \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\" It's like a group of giggling 16 year old boys sat in a room, watched the original movie and came up with their own lame gags. Sadly, most of the antics and wisecracks are borderline dreadful.\n\nI'm not saying there's nothing to like here. There's the always charming Marlon Wayans and a fun homage performance from Kali Hawk. There are more than a few surprisingly original, very funny jokes that made me laugh out loud. Jane Seymour, as Christian's clueless stepmother, delivers some of the best material in the movie. The funniest jokes are the ones that poke fun at racism and the s&m / sexism that bubbles over in the original story. At least they weren't lazy and tried to write good jokes. But none of these highlights can save the mean-spirited, clunky attempts at humor.\n\nThis movie isn't nearly as bad as you think it would be, but save your money and wait to rent it on dvd.\n\nMATT SAYS:\n\nSpoof movies usually suck. And not just a little. A lot. The worst are those awful Seltzer / Friedberg reference movie collaborations, like \"Disaster Movie\" and \"Meet the Spartans.\" The Wayans brothers, however, consistently make better parody movies than pretty much everyone else. Not that they're great (they usually aren't), but the writing is pretty much always better than your average spoof. \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is no exception.\n\nNot that \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is a good movie, exactly... it isn't. But it is watchable, which is saying something for a movie like this one. There are some good jokes here, and most of them are not completely lazy. Some actual thought went into writing the script.\n\nThe problem with any parody is that it helps when the film being spoofed was been good in the first place. This is particularly true where, as with \"Fifty Shades of Black,\" the storyline pretty much follows the original. If the original story wasn't that interesting, the spoof usually won't be, either. It's hard to keep an audience's attention when the story itself is dull.\n\nThe filmmakers did the most they could with boring source material, and managed to squeeze some pretty good laughs out of it. That's still not enough, however, to make the movie one to recommend.\n\nA SCREEN ZEALOTS REVIEW",

But that isn't it at all!  The jokes come thick and fast, and if you are not alert, you will probably miss some of them. You have to be paying attention.This was one of the better and faster-paced movies made as a satire. In the showing I attended, I would say the audience was laughing at least every 30 -60 seconds. I thought they were very clever with the jokes, and even paid tribute to some other movies.........(Pushing or dragging might be of significance if you see this movie, but I won't say why.)",

Admittedly it helps to have watched the original so you can appreciate the jokes more, but it's not essential. With strong black humour running throughout, this is littered with crude racial innuendos that only the Wayan's brothers could get away with.",

It made you laugh, it was fun. The part where Hannah's friend beat up Christian with excellent Gongfu skills outside the bar, the part where Christian's spanking never worked, and the part where the two chose to communicate in a black way rather than using an emotion-squeezing method. \n2. It beat the sad, sick ending of Fifty Shades of Grey.\nThink about it, was it really a good ending when a girl as innocent and easy-going as Anastasia had to fall in love with a perfect Grey who clings to his personal issues and then had to leave the elevator and say goodbye? \nHowever, in Fifty Shades of Black, the female character successfully got Christian to spill out his childhood miseries and convinced him to work on his issues, though the two were arguing and fighting, but they made it work, eventually! Which is hopeful and nice! \nWho would you choose to be? If you were Anna or Hannah?",

In the bland tradition of Date Movie, Superhero Movie, and Meet the Spartans comes Fifty Shades of Black, a one (and a half) note send up of the one-note film spawned from E.L. James' one-note novels. Granted, taking aim at bottom-feeders allows for a ripe proving ground of comedy because these low denominators are unintentionally funny to begin with. Unfortunately, Black aims just as low as it intended victim, trying to wring easy laughs out of material that accidentally ended up to be funny in the source material. If some pointed jokes about race and sex didn't at least hit just inside the dartboard, Fifty Shades of Black wouldn't even rank one (and a half) star. In regards to skewing pop culture, Black is - simply put - whack.\n\nIn this R-rated spoof, an inexperienced college student meets a wealthy businessman whose sexual practices put a strain on their relationship. \n\nNot much was expected of the Wayans's parodic oeuvre, mind you. With Dance Flick and Haunted House having already grabbed very low hanging fruit (think: strip mining topsoil) off of other genres rather than play it straight with clever dialogue a la Airplane! or The Naked Gun, this gratuitous exercise follows in very much the same small footsteps. The leads make the most out of cheap shots but some cameos from Fred Willard, Jane Seymour, and - wait for it - Florence Henderson make for the funniest exchanges. \n\nBottom line: Meh in Black",

I didn't find the film funny on any level. Many of the scenes I felt disgusted by more than anything else. This film is full of stereotypes for African Americans. Trying to be funny but failing on all accounts. I began to wonder why this film was so stupid, and dull for me and then I saw the director. Micheal Tiddes, who also worked on \"A Haunted House.\" How is this guy such a success. His comedy is so out there and dull, and his parody style is so grotesque that I find it kind of insane that he is still around and making so much money off of people.

            "content": "You would think with all the accumulated earnings the Wayans brothers, Shawn and Marlon, have obtained after being on Television and in films for years that they would invest their money and their time in projects that would be a bit more thoughtful and entertaining. Instead, ever since the runaway success of \"A Haunted House\" in 2013, the two, particularly Marlon, have been keen on making movies that fit the bill for the lowest common denominator of entertainment. \"Fifty Shades of Black,\" a horribly obvious and persistently unfunny array of cheapshots at the erotic novel/film series that is already too easy to joke about, continues Marlon's streak and incredible failing to make something out of his Baby Way Productions company. \n\nI've always found it interesting that while Tyler Perry's films are anything but consistent, and there are about an equal number of bad films in his catalog as good films, he often gets blamed for making films about black people that cater to the lowest common denominator and showcase them in a negative light, yet the recent collaborations of Marlon Wayans and Michael Tiddes go pretty much unscathed. These are films that evoke some of the most putrid and ugly stereotypes about nearly every race and, for that matter, exist simply as unapologetically crude and contrived projects that do nothing but attempt to evoke laughs based on brand-recognition. These films are just a slight notch above the dreaded works of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.\n\nAs hinted, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is a parody of \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" and it takes pretty much the safest, most convenient route to parody the film by making the jokes largely centered around the absurdity of BDSM and its culture, race and ethnic humor, the ordinariness and \"ugliness\" of its lead female character, and the enigma surrounding its titular character, who in this case, is Christian Black (Marlon Wayans). Christian is a multi-millionaire mogul who begins a sexual relationship with his new intern, Hannah Steale (Kali Hawk) and what entails is a relationship filled with sex, sexual violence, and downright bizarre encounters.\n\nWhile whatever Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison gang is cooking up this year is likely to get plenty of Razzie nominations, Marlon Wayans and his cast of familiar faces such as Affion Crockett, Missi Pyle, Mike Epps, Fred Willard, and more should be looking at the same award. It's incredibly rare to see a cast ostensibly operate on auto-pilot and look like the end product bearing some essence of quality is the furthest thing from their minds, but perhaps given the lazy screenwriting of Rick Alvarez and Wayans himself, this was to be expected. \n\nShockingly enough, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" offers more laughs than both of the \"Haunted House\" films put together, especially during a sequence that parodies one of last year's Best Picture contenders at the Academy Awards. However, in order to get to this sequence, one has to succumb to the drudgery of enough racial and bathroom humor - so much that it gives Laura Mulvey's concept of \"phallocentrism\" a whole different angle to explore - that it ultimately isn't worth sitting through the amount of trivial nonsense to get to that particular scene.\n\nWe're not even in February yet and this year has already been incredibly interesting for comedies. After seeing \"Ride Along 2,\" I didn't think many more comedies of the year would get much worse than that. Then I saw \"Dirty Grandpa\" the following week and I thought the same thing; there was most likely the weakest comedy of 2016 that I would have to sit through. Now, almost exactly a week later, I've seen \"Fifty Shades of Black,\" and if this isn't the worst comedy of 2016, I seriously fear what I have to endure in the coming eleven months.",

            "content": "The Wayans Family has created quite an entertainment dynasty over the past three decades or so. Long before anyone had heard of Tyler Perry, the Wayans Brothers, as most people refer to them, started creating big and small screen entertainment that catered to the African-American audience. The Wayans brought us the sketch comedy show \"In Living Color\" (1990-1994) which, in turn, helped launch the careers of Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx and David Alan Grier, among others, as well as films like \"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka\" (1988), \"Major Payne\" (1995) and the \"Scary Movie\" horror film parodies (2000-2013).\n\nThe Wayans are mostly known for their parodies. 2016 adds another one to the list with Marlon, the youngest of the original \"Wayans Brothers\", co-writing and starring in \"Fifty Shades of Black\" (R, 1:31). Most will immediately recognize that this film is a take-off on 2015's very successful film adaptation of the book \"Fifty Shades of Grey\". Like most of the Wayans' films, pop culture and movie references abound, but \"Fifty Shades of Black\" duplicates much of the plot of the film that inspired its comedy. You'll see what I mean in the following plot summary (which, by the way, is necessarily risqu\u00e9).\n\nHannah Steele (Kali Hawk) is an attractive and intelligent college senior in Washington State who fills in for her sick roommate, Kateesha (Jenny Zigrino) in interviewing billionaire business magnate Christian Black (Marlon Wayans) for the college newspaper. Hannah gets flustered in the presence of this sophisticated, supremely-confident and mysterious man. Christian is quite taken with Hannah - and take her is what he soon decides he wants to do. He shows up at the hardware store where she works, takes her out to coffee and even comes to \"rescue\" her when she drunk dials him from a bar. Despite how obvious it is to the main characters and to the audience that these two are very, very different - and despite the title character's own conflicted resistance - these two cannot resist each other. But Christian very clearly states, \"I don't do romance.\" That doesn't stop Hannah from being drawn to this man.\n\nAs Hannah discovers more about the cipher that is Christian, she learns that he is wounded - both emotionally and physically - by his childhood. She seems to want to comfort this man who acts as if he needs no comforting and begins to love this man who tells her that he is only interested in her for sex. Being the woman in Christian Black's life means submitting completely - sexually and otherwise - to his whims. As he eases her towards an understanding and acceptance of his lifestyle, she has to sign a non-disclosure agreement, he convinces her to have sex (actually \"f--- hard\", as he describes it) and then shows her his \"playroom.\" This usually locked room is painted dark red, has a bed and is filled with various restraining devices and implements of sadomasochistic sex play. Hannah is shocked, but not necessarily repulsed. Christian presents his contract which describes Hannah's role as his submissive.\n\nI just did something I've never done before (or even been remotely able to do) in a movie review. The previous two paragraphs are actually cut and pasted from my 2015 review of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\"! Using the \"find/replace\" function in Microsoft Word, I changed the names of the characters and the actors playing them to match those in \"Fifty Shades of Black\" and I shortened the summary, but I did not add or change anything else. (You can scroll down our timeline to my \"Grey\" review to see for yourself.)  \n\nBut rest assured there's plenty in \"Black\" besides just recreating and making fun of scenes from \"Grey\". \"Fifty Shades of Black\" also seamlessly incorporates Wayans-esque versions of scenes from such movies as \"Whiplash\" and \"Magic Mike\". There are also references to a plethora of other popular movies, TV shows and books, plus a generous helping of pop culture satire and some politics. This is the kind of film which is so fresh, it feels like it was written a month before its release, but that means that its humor (and perhaps its appeal) will quickly become dated. Of course, there's also plenty of racial humor, much of it stemming from white actors Jane Seymour and Fred Willard playing the title character's parents.\n\nLike much of the Wayans' work, \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is very funny in spots, but those spots are small and spread out. The few clever/amusing jokes and sight gags and even fewer laugh-out-loud moments seem adrift in a sea of gross-out humor and over-the-top acting which is often not that funny. Still, most Wayans fans will probably enjoy the film and those who've only seen a little of their work may find this one good enough for a mild recommendation. \"B-\"",

            "content": "\"That's right folks, getting mauled by the bear from \"The Revenant\" would be more comfortable than sitting through Fifty Shades of Black\"\nDVD Movie Review: Fifty Shades of Black\nDate Viewed: April 20 2016\nDirected By Michael Tiddes (A Haunted House and A Haunted House 2)\nWritten By Marlon Wayans and Rick Alvarez\nStarring: Marlon Wayans, Kali Hawk, Jane Seymour, Fred Willard, Affion Crockett, Mike Epps, Florence Henderson, Mircea Monroe, Kate Miner, King Bach and Dave Sheridan.\n\nWhich of these three options suits you better? Getting mauled by the bear from \"The Revenant\"? Going out on a date with Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz? or sitting through \"Fifty Shades of Black\"?. I say getting mauled by the bear because this crass parody of \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is nearly unwatchable. Despite having vulgar gags involving semen, long hammers and big balls, the MPAA still gave this movie an R rating. \"Fifty Shades of Black\" should've gotten an X or NC-17 rating because if the entire continent of Europe were forced sit through 90 minutes of agonizing torture, they will probably prosecute the filmmakers for psychological abuse against moviegoing audiences. Who is responsible for this dreadfully unfunny spoof? You guessed it, it's Marlon Wayans, possibly one of civilizations most unfunny comics working today. Wayans along with his co-conspirators, co-writer Rick Alvarez and director Michael Tiddes have created a monstrous cyclone filled with disgusting humor and awful comedic performances.\n\nMarlon, don't you have better projects in mind instead of making more terrible spoof movies? Didn't he realize this genre died while he made the first \"Scary Movie\"? To refresh your memory, that movie also had writing credits for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer who would go on to inflict \"Date Movie\", \"Epic Movie\", \"Meet the Spartans\", \"Disaster Movie\" and \"Vampires Suck\" on intelligent moviegoers. Now Marlon Wayans has gone off to make terrible spoofs on his own without their help. He made the two \"Haunted House\" movies, which weren't any better and \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is just as bad. To nobody's surprise, it wasn't screened for critics on it's opening day because Marlon Wayans always gives the finger to them for hating his movies.\n\n\"Fifty Shades of Black\" tells the exact same story as \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" but with African-Americans in the cast, we follow college student, Hannah Steale (Kali Hawk) who goes for a job interview with wealthy businessman Christian Black (Wayans). He didn't make his money the old fashion way, he made his money through drug dealing and a stint as a male stripper (obviously riffing \"Magic Mike\"). Just when things couldn't get any worse, we meet Christian's brother, Eli Black (Affion Crockett, another Wayans collaborator) who has a \"Weeknd-style\" haircut and a long hammer that can reach the floor, Jane Seymour as Christian's racist adoptive mother who teases Hannah with a taser gun saying \"I'm standing my ground! I'm standing my ground!\" and with Christian replying \"Black Lives Matter\", and in a flashback sequence we meet Florence Henderson doing riffs on \"The Graduate\" and \"Whiplash\" as we see her teach some rhythm  lessons with Wayans. She later says, \"I thought you black guys were all rhythm and have big Ds\". WOW! WOW! WOW! What a comedy this is!\n\nOf course, we get to the S&M scenes and they range from irritating to unfunny to annoying to \"Get me out of this movie!\". In the midst of all this, I ashamed to admit that I laughed once during the whole movie. The joke that I laughed at was when Wayans was reading the actual \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" book as a weapon to torture Hannah, he exclaims, \"who reads this anyway, it's terrible!\". \"Fifty Shades of Black\" is well... How can I say this? All of the above.\nBrutally unfunny, terribly unfunny, dreadfully unfunny, not funny at all, beyond stupid, it's just plain awful.\n\nMaybe it's finally time for Marlon Wayans to switch to Netflix because theatrical spoofs just aren't funny anymore. It was all funny when \"Airplane!\" and \"The Naked Gun\" came to town but now this genre is pretty much dead. I still think \"Dirty Grandpa\" is the most horrific comedy of the year but don't worry \"Fifty Shades of Black\", you'll still show up on my worst of the year list at the end of December.",

Marlon Wayans really commits to his role. Even if the joke doesn't work, he really goes for it. The film is very hit or miss. Sometimes, the jokes land very well. But most of the time, the jokes fail hard. There are a lot of gags that are stretched out too long that aren't funny. Also, the film sometimes deviates from the story just to make more gags. I didn't like that. Also, the film isn't that coherent and doesn't give a good plot. Overall, Fifty Shades of Grey actually gives more laughs than Fifty Shades of Black. That really isn't a good thing. This is an unfunny parody where most of the jokes don't land.",

What isn\u2019t surprising is that spoof specialist and kinda, sorta washed upIt was only a matter of time that someone came along and spoofed the widely popular and highly alluring pop-culture phenomenon that was Fifty Shades of Grey. What isn\u2019t surprising is that spoof specialist and kinda, sorta washed up actor/writer Marlon Wayans was the one to do so. Wayans, whose previous parody films include A Haunted House 1 & 2, Dance Flick and Scary Movie 1-4 brings forth a very important question with his newest spoof feature Fifty Shades of Black; is the spoof film finally, officially dead?\r Its hard to believe but, after such classics as Airplane!, Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery and yes, even the original Scary Movie, the spoof film may slowly if not almost entirely die off and be resting in peace very soon.\r The world, currently, is one that is obsessed with social media platforms and media within these social networks. Thanks to applications such as Vine, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and YouTube, it seems that audiences everywhere are capable of finding comedy and entertainment, not only within the comfort of their own homes, but as easily and accessibly, within moments, in the palms of their hand.\r When the dawn of the television was upon us, people everywhere thought that televisions were going to destroy Hollywood and the history of feature films altogether; it didn\u2019t. With the rise of the Internet and the quickly developing moment of streaming and illegally downloading films and music online, people soon thought that the future of movies and music was on its way on the decline. Yet, in 2015 no less, two of the highest grossing films of all-time were released, and more than ever, the profitability of music has never been better. So, how and why is the spoof film genre dying slowly but surely?\r The thing about entertainment in 2016 is that, entertainment isn\u2019t merely measured but numbers and margins, but by memories and moments of experience and spectacle, with margins and numbers as well. Entertainment is constantly evolving, and the forms in which we consume entertainment maintains the ways in which we determine whether the entertainment itself is viable, or not. The thing with earlier spoof films like the ones that were mentioned above are, in order to consume such comedy, going to the movie theatres and watching it for yourself was the only way of consumption. Now a days, not only are films, genres and characters spoofed on the daily, but pop culture, with the help of social media, spoofs the crap out of anything and everything. Don\u2019t think thats the case? Think back, just in 2015, to all the spoofs you saw online about Adele\u2019s song Hello, Drake\u2019s music video to Hotline Bling, as well as anything else flooding the front pages of your Vine, Instagram and Facebook news feeds.\r The beauty behind the genius in the earlier spoof films of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s was that accessibility was limited and, these films weren\u2019t just spoofing a specific movie, having limited content to work with. Think of Austin Powers for example, it wasn\u2019t just a spoof on spy films and a filmography of more than a dozen Bond films at that time, but also a genre, the unbelievability of a lifestyle or profession little to nothing is known about, as well as providing a fantasy for the possibility of the many beauties the life of what an international person of mystery might really be like. Sure, Black may spoof Kim K for a second, the Weeknd here and there, but overall, these small and insignificant and highly forgettable inclusions did nothing to elevate the plot or humour of the film overall.\r If you\u2019re wondering why I haven\u2019t really mentioned the plot line or story of Black, well, thats because the film is basically a shot-for-shot carbon copy of the original Grey film, with added crass and crude black jokes included, sexual innuendoes juiced up to the max and of course, taking what the original did, and making it funny by stripping away its glamorous and polished exterior; essentially,  making it real world scary for real life people. No matter how you look at it, regardless of how much money you have, any girl would be scared of having a wealthy man stalking you at work asking for ropes and zip-ties regardless how cute he may be.\r What I found super interesting with Black was how the film is slowly accepting and transitioning from movie stars, to social media stars starring within feature films. Sure we\u2019ve seen Vine stars make cameos in films before, like Brittany Furland in last year\u2019s We Are Your Friends, but in Black, social media icon King Back/Andrew Bachelor has a very prominent role as the not so subtle yet hysterical best friend Jesse that wants a piece, like any other straight male friend wants from their female friends. Bach represents not only a dominance of social media within feature films, but perhaps, the next phase and new generation of movies stars tomorrow. Plus, is it just me or does Bach remind anyone else of a younger Will Smith circa his \u2018Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\u2019 days.",

Dont waste your time or money on this flop. Its completely stupid, not even close to being funny unless you are black and enjoy and modern likeness to the series roots. Yes, its a baste and lethargic mental attack on white people. Its nothing like his brothers parodies of other productions. We actually demanded and received our money back from Regal Entertainment and that is why we are still current customers of that company. Hopefully the peekaboo was actually Kali's top, that would be the only justification of the movie getting paid. As far as specifics.. It was rude and disgusting. A dirty rag on both races and you already know the ending...It was the worst movie since \"GIGLI\"",
