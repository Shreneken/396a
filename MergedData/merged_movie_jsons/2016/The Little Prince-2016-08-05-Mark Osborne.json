            "content": "I usually love the French animations, because unlike American, the stories, musics, characters that influences the thousands of year cultural history. Definitely not comparable to the Hollywood standards, but it had its own technical brilliance. All I wondered was why this film was in English language.It deserves to be on the upcoming's big occasion (2016 February), if it is eligible for the American Academy Awards. From the director of 'Kung Fu Panda' original movie, which was partially based on the children's novel. The book adaptation is the stop-motion animation and the remaining story's the regular 3D animation.Just remember the movies like 'What Dreams May Come' and 'The Lovely Bones', those magical worlds and breathtaking landscapes. Usually animations are associated with comedy genre, especially when a child character attached to it. This film was not even a comedy, more like those two titles I mentioned.The screenplay wise it was a very 'Neverwas' type, except this one was an animation. But appropriate for people of all ages. The kids can realise the importance of their childhood and the older people can become kids again. The film compressed the gap and erected a bridge between the two hoods, the childhood and the adulthood.\"What is essential is invisible to the eye.\"I did not know what to expect from it, but I highly satisfied with the final product. The film characters had no names, but called, the Little Girl, Mother, Fox, Rose, Snake, King et cetera as what their role is and species. Barely there are only 3-4 characters where the story was focused. Obviously it had a villain, but very unusual existence time and in a crucial part of the story.I don't remember how the 100 minutes went so fast like a ray of the light beam flashed away. The pace of narration was not a rushy, except the opening part. But once the old man character, the Aviator, voiced by Jeff Bridge was introduced, the movie turned into completely different and awesome. Yes, Jeff Bridge's voice was so good for the background narration.This story is about an old man who refused to grow up mentally and believes the existence of the magical stars and planets. The whole neighborhood stayed away from him and his troubles, until a new girl arrives at the next door. The little girl befriends him and falls for all his stories discarding her daily routines, but later it complicates their relationship after her mother finds out what they're up to. What happens to them and how the story concludes is the remaining part.\"She was not a common rose. She was the only one of her kind in the whole universe.\"This story was finely fused between the reality and fantasy. Most essential storyline for the present world. In the name of education how the children were enforced by their parents to mechanical life with less time to play out and make their own friends. Especially as they were lacking the creativity to make up their own fictional worlds with their toys like the kids from a century ago were.It might psychologically affect their characters while becoming an adult like the Aviator in this film, but as one of lines from the movie say 'Growing up is not the problem. Forgetting is', the children are losing their innocence over the adult's reality world. Who knows, someday those kids may become the greatest writer inspired by their childhood days.If you ask me, I strongly recommend it for all. It is very encouraging film for the parents how not to raise their children and for the grown ups how not to get lost is the adult world. Most elegant flick of the year, along with a very few others.You don't have to ignore it because you have read the book, like I said it was not completely borrowed from the original material. Instead, two-third of the film was freshly established out of the same name masterpiece. I'm not familiar with the book, so I've no thoughts that differentiate between these two formats. But definitely the film deserved all the appreciation from critics and movie 9\u00bd/10",

            "content": "FromPasto,Colombia Via: L. A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA&ORLANDO, FLThe expectations you have going into a film have a tremendous influence, as you no doubt have experienced, on your take away after viewing! Other than a couple general comments, only God knows their origin, that The Little Prince was really \"worth it\", I did not have much in the way of any well-defined expectations. Lucky Me! RESULT: A Nine Star experience!Although my wife, Carmen, was the only person accompanying me, soon after initiating viewing, I imagined my granddaughter and daughter in the room, sharing the experience with us! My granddaughter, as is the case with most eight year old girls, loves anything involving a princess! If you have grand kids, you must watch this with them. If thousands of kilometers separate you.... JUST Use your imagination, as I did! Little Prince seems tailor made for Grandparents/Grandkids viewing a la \"UP\" ?There are a few comments that need to be made regarding Little Prince \"purists\"...But let's first focus on analyzing it. This 2015 French version has European Production written all over it...But in the best sense! It is artistic, tells a touching and delicate story, has a number of songs in French that manage to be uplifting and, yet, simultaneously haunting, and, perhaps most importantly, interweaves the Classic 1940's Original story line with a cautionary helicopter parent tale that both compliments and underscores said original!Obviously, one of the great ironies of this 2015 version is that the old man/pilot takes it upon himself to help the Little Girl learn just what it is to be a kid! At the heart of both story lines is that one of the most important things in life is keeping that spark of being a kid alive within us, even if we live to be 100! Earlier, I mentioned Little Prince purists Well, whenever a movie brings a classic literary work to the screen, there are always viewers who want to see the original literary work brought to the screen with no changes, whatsoever, to dialogue or story line! Forget that we are dealing with the now one century old, two different medium conundrum! Needless to say, many of them simply could not get past this point. Obviously, this was absolutely no problem at all for me! To the contrary, it seemed quite a plus!IMDb Stats (Only 37 other reviews and 12,000 ratings votes) indicate that very few people have seen the film...Don't miss it! And make it a family affair! (However, kids under 7 year might find PRINCE a bit \"Slow\", or might not \"Get It\"!)9*...ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments or questions, in English o en Espa\u00f1ol, are most welcome!",

            "content": "Animation is under-estimated, perhaps because we tend to be afraid of what we do not understand.I have seen a lot of films, done a lot of reviews and thought I had seen it all.I was wrong.First, I had not read the book prior to seeing this film nor had I seen the earlier screen version.No matter. I was transfixed and stunned. I was still sitting there when the final credits rolled, which is really a feat because the credits roll for 10 minutes after the word FIN (THE END) rolls. (If you miss the credits, you miss the TURN AROUND song which itself could be highlight of one of the most incredible music scores in one of the most incredible movies ever).When computers were first being married to animation -- a marriage made in heaven I think -- I recall an interview with a senior animator who confided that when the day came that they could get the \"eyes\" right, they would have reached the pinnacle of their craft.That day has arrived. This movie is the herald.Watching the eyes in this film, I felt as though I was watching real people. Does that make me sound daft? I hope not. There is one scene where the little girl watches the Aviator go to the hospital in the rain. She is at the same time transfixed with sadness and soaking wet. The animation made both conditions \"real\" at the same time. I don't know how. But it did.Jeff Bridges, a brilliant actor with a record longer than your arm, gives the \"voice\" performance of his career here, and Rachael McAdams, former Femme Fatale, former \"against type\" actress (TRUE DETECTIVE) ditto.Running out of superlatives, something I seldom do, so I will stop here.See it. Don't argue. Just see it.",

How the pilot and the prince became friends, all the adventures and beyond, in other animations and endless other media. This movie isn't about those two characters only. It's about how this story can touch people since it was created, from toddlers to grandpas, in different ways and in different ages. I've seen people say out loud \"this is not little prince!\", but I say \"yes, it is!\". Want to see a pure version? Read the book. The animation and the characters are rich and lovely, the CG and the stop motion are perfect and well used. Everything is heartwarming. If you don't know the book, you'll read it after seeing this. If you do, I'm sure you'll cry a lot. And at the end of the movie you'll want a fox for you too.",

            "content": "The movie opened today - 29 July 2015 - here in France, and I saw the second show here where I live, the small town of Paimpol. There were perhaps 30 people altogether in attendance. I could hear that the few children among them were bored. So, first comment: 1) This is not a movie for small children. It won't interest them.2) If you are expecting a video reproduction of St Exup\u00e9ry's story, you will be very disappointed. It's in this movie, but it only comprises a small part of it. Most of the movie is a frame for that tale, the story of a small girl who meets an elderly aviator who tells her, in bits and pieces, the story of his encounter, many years before, with the Little Prince. If you go expecting just what you know from St Exup\u00e9ry's story, most of this movie will therefore be an annoyance to you.It took me awhile to accept the frame story. It's fairly banal, fairly Hollywood. Nowhere near the originality of St. Exup\u00e9ry's remarkable tale. But if you let yourself go with it, it has an appeal over time.The part devoted to St. Exup\u00e9ry's original tale is the best, as far as I'm concerned.We also see the prince as an adult, very changed. That came as a shock at first to me, but again, I let myself go with it, and it had a certain fairly obvious interest.This is not a great movie. \"Ernest and C\u00e9lestine\" is a thousand times better. But it's worth seeing.Again, however, this is NOT a movie for little children. They will be bored.",

It was stunning and great. The combination of animation and stop-motion worked perfectly. The contrast boring modern time and fantasy well pictured. The book was used well as carrier of the movie...And then the old man was brought to the hospital... and it was the movie that died. The search for the little prince was ridiculous, why did we need a chase and \"happy\" ending? Why not put more attention to the different planets the little prince visits in the book instead? It was all just touched to make space for the ending. Why not make an ending that worked out the relation little girl/old man better.Yes the movie is worthwhile, The first hour is stunning, but the 2nd part makes you leave the theater somewhat disappointed",

            "content": "I could predict the movie ending by the first few minutes or so and I told my wife \"okay, let's see if it can still be entertaining on the details...\". Oh boy, I may never been so glad to be so wrong. I mean, of course I was hoping for it to be good, but I was expecting very, very little of it. Most animations I've been watching in the past 2 years or so, including Pixar's, have not being able to move me at all. At all. And IMDb score was just below what I'd expect from a good one.( Okay, Inside Out was an exception: great and cute. Maybe my hopes for that one were too high but I was hoping for a better neural representation there, and it had some weak science behind it ( don't take my or Steve Novella's word for it, do your homework ). I would argue it is even harmful, because it will certainly create new bad myths about the mind and the brain. )Anyway, Little Prince at least isn't about science - because else they'd get it wrong at very least on the lucid dreaming there... But it's perfectly done. Perfectly. Every little detail. Right near the beginning the girl gets a new friend and starts to wonder how his stories could be possible. While she is thinking, the wind in the background is moving engines. That's art. And science, even if only subconsciously. Even if.The symbolism there is exquisite. I have watched a few french movies, I do know a little about the culture there, I've toured through France more than any other European country in my 2013 tour... I haven't seen anything like this before. Maybe I will need to take my french classes back again, eventually.Here, let me tell you about 2 math formulas that appear in there (not the only ones, the first book she does open is about math, probably algebra, but in french sorry), for a few seconds: first one is about analytical geometry, and got an Escher picture in it. Now, in Brazil we don't learn any of that in school, not even Calculus, but I've gone to first year of Statistics and 1 got semester of Math in there... That shoot is complex! The only thing I can say about the first picture is she got a great compressed writing and thinking there. This to me means more than anything that whoever wrote the script (I haven't read the book) was an avid math enthusiast (like myself) at very least.On the second one, however, she gets on to some Calculus, which to me was one of the funnest parts in school (after geometry, and I didn't really enjoy Math in college). Math was always my favorite topic in school. And that's a \"simple\" 3rd degree expression. All I can say is it's not being properly resolved, at first sight. But I bet there's a meaning there I just can't see yet. This is how this movie was made. Filled with tiny little details at every single second.I'm very good at Math and at counting, but I can't even understand what the 6 year old is doing in her book there and those are images that just don't matter to the plot or for anything else, really. They're there on their own!I'll make a real bold guess here, but I think this have became instantly my favorite film of all times. On top of Forrest Gump, Matrix, any Pixar's, Bedazzled, Terry Gilliam's, Huckabees, Stranger than Fiction, BttF, 2001, Interstellar, The Martian (still unwatched), Terminator you name it. I know almost nobody would agree with me here, but that's just how I felt having just watched the movie less than 8 hours ago.It touched me deeply, and it did so by touching both my heart and brains, like no other one ever did. 34 year old, happily married, with no kids due to life issues, no job and lots of work to do. Specially after being this inspired. =)-- Caue",

Her mother moves them into the wealthy neighborhood for the school. Their home is the cheapest due to their eccentric new neighbor. It's the summer holidays and mother has set a scheduled regiment for the little girl to prepare for her long march to adulthood. Their neighbor is The Aviator. He becomes the Little Girl's best friend as he describes his adventures with The Little Prince.I read The Little Prince for french class. It was tough enough to translate the thing. Plenty went over my head especially something like the Rose. One needs to appreciate the adult relationship being portrayed and also its autobiographical nature. The essentially literary nature of the book makes it more than a children's book. It's never been for the littlest kids although they probably like the pictures. The film takes the essentials of the book and adapts it into a cinematic Pixar-level movie. It's really the best of both worlds being combined here.There is a switch in the world around the start of the third act. It concerned me a little about the execution. It would have been a lot easier to switch to the book instead. The Fox probably kept my faith with his humor. He is hilarious. Mr. Prince is a little problematic. It's like making Peter Pan grow up and I didn't appreciate that in Hook. However, it is all very audacious and it pulls everything together in the end.There are many complaints about what this movie isn't. It isn't a kiddie movie and this isn't trying to be an \"Ice Age\" movie. It's digging into deeper material and I compare it more with \"Where the Wild Things Are\". That movie is definitely too dark for little kids. This isn't a simple transcription of the book. The book is unlikely to be good narrative for a two hour movie. This is able to translate this literary classic into a compelling movie structure. It's a heart-warming coming-of-age story as long as one haven't forgotten.",

So, when i hear the book was made into a movie, i got so excited and couldn't wait to watch it. After i watched it, i do not regret it at all. It was a good movie and make me want to read the book version ( I read some of the review, that tell me that this movie was really different from the book version, so it intrigued my curiosity )My review is as an outsider who doesn't know it real story. So, i won't compare the movie version with the book version. For the movie version, i guess i pretty much like it. I agree that this movie is not suitable for kids, since kids will find it boring. The pace of the movie is kinda slow ( also, it kinds of hard to understand for kids ). The visual itself, went so well and beautifully finished with the combination of stop motion and 3D animation.Well, from my point of view, i think the story itself tried to teach us about life, happiness, sadness, and how to grow up without forgetting who we are. All those kinds of valuable things that we tend to forget, as we grown up and be part of the adult world.I highly recommended this movie for those who do not read the novel yet and those who like philosophical things wrapped in a beautiful visual.",

It makes me wonder if it ever were a children's tale, but again to decode such an honest, sincerely beautiful written work of art, a child's innocence and naivety is the only play. Such stories don't need working out you feel the characters as they evolve through the pages and identify with you. 2015 is about to see in a re-imagined spirit the animated adaptation of Exupery's invention, from Kung- Fu Panda director Mark Osborne of the same name. It is majorly awaited. The trailer was irresistibly delicious instilling a magic like atmosphere with the equally enchanting background score by Richard Harvey and Hans Zimmer. This movie got an amazing cast from Bridges to Cottilard, it will be dream on screen. The little girl's imagination of the Prince and the fox is done by stop motion animation resembling and staying true to those old painted images. Remember the dewy water color illustrations by Exupery depicting the Prince on the asteroid, the magical rose that grew on it\u0085with flaxen hair and a scarf he just looked like a cherry boy who lost his way.

I've read it ever since I was a very young kid, and now that I'm a middle aged adult, it still holds tons of surprises and things to thoroughly think about. It may as well be my favorite book ever.So, when I saw there was going to be an adaptation of the book, I hoped for a somewhat true to the book story. Anything close to it would have been fine by me, really. I mean, the book just doesn't lend itself to a movie, IMHO. It's just too deep and complex, and too simple and sweet at the same time. The book, to me, it's the sweetest and most delicate balance of what being a human being is all about. What moves us, as seen from the eyes of a wise, sweet, innocent child.The movie, therefore, is an atrocity and an insult to Antoine De Saint-Exupery. Period. It's the grossest, vilest insult to The Little Prince I could ever imagine.First - I should have known from the ads. The Little Prince is a little icon, far away from the main characters - The Aviator, The Fox, and... The Girl???? Where did the little girl come from? Apparently, the movie makers thought they just couldn't make a movie without adding extra characters. And then, I suppose, they thought making a movie about the original story would have been too difficult, so they just tossed it all away and wrote an original story about a little girl and her mom.I wish I was kidding. I'm not. The Little Prince story is just an excuse to move along a primary story about something else. It's treated as an extra, as something superfluous, as something - I guess - they had to do because the movie was named \"The Little Prince\", If you went in, expecting to watch something related to the real story, you are going to be very, very disappointed.Second - the story never goes into what makes The Little Prince so special. You get to see the Little Prince traveling through asteroids, talking to his rose, taming his fox. Is any of this explained or explored in detail? No. It is treated as a distraction to the main story. The filmmakers never even bother to explore the symbolism behind the story. It's merely treated as an excuse for telling an alternate story.Third - and this is where the spoiler goes. The Little Prince is all about love, tenderness, anger, happiness and ultimately, sadness. It's a moving story, told in the sweetest way possible - through the eyes of a small child. What on EARTH were the filmmakers thinking when they threw in action scenes? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?!?!? I won't spoil it all, but when I saw scenes straight out of a video game, with violence, planes zooming in and out, adventure, etc., I almost walked out of the theater. The only thing that made me stay there was my child.Fourth - another spoiler. The aviator was a child with a wonderful imagination, who grew up to become a jaded person. The Little Prince helped him question his beliefs and rediscover a sense of wonder he had lost. In the movie, the aviator is a childish old man. Not \"child-like\", or full of wonder. The whole point of the book was how an adult can become responsible, knowledgeable, yet retain his sensibility and sense of wonder throughout. Nowhere is this to be seen - the aviator is just like a spoiled, irreverent, incoherent child. Which is even more absurd when you see the real Little Prince's sequences, and you realize how different both versions of the aviator are.Fifth - another spoiler. If you ever want to see part of your childhood ruined and torn to pieces, go watch this movie. You'll see where The Little Prince ended up. And believe me, you'll want to shout your lungs out at the filmmakers for destroying your childhood image of what his little Majesty would end up like. It's a travesty. It's depressing. It's false. And it's absolutely, completely wrong.This is the most misguided, insulting and infuriating book adaptation I've ever seen. It's as if Star Wars: Episode 7 was about a kid watching Star Wars: A New Hope 30 minutes at a time. It's just... wrong. Shame on everyone involved in making this travesty. 2 stars, because the animation showing what The Little Prince was really about was actually very well done.",

            "content": "This review is intended for all those fans of Le petit prince, the original book, and all those who like the character of Le Petit Prince.The Little Prince (original story book) has a very simple storyline (although it's quite rich and complex in analogies and depth), written in French, first published in 1943, shorty before the untimely death of its author/illustrator, a real pilot.I am a French teacher who has always included Le petit prince in my classroom whenever possible and for almost any age group (making the necessary modifications of course). I am a big fan of Antoine de St-Exupery and Le petit prince IS my favourite classic of all time. I don't have a problem with the storyline of this film. I actually think it was made to entertain and even educate a little. My great concern arises from the fact that this film is NOT Le petit prince.This film is trying too hard to cater to so-called modern audiences who like disproportionate faces and odd looking animations that barely resemble human faces. This is an insult to the author whose goal was to put his readers in touch with what's human, as opposed to money, business, rush and all those mundane exigences of the modern world.Instead, the makers of this film exploited a well-loved story and broke it down to pieces, placing the Le petit prince story in a totally unrelated frame story to make it what I call Hollywood-friendly. Even worse, they did not bother to give it a more appropriate title such as Discovering the Little Prince. This film is not the story of Le petit prince. They named it after the original story to attract more viewers and create a poster which makes you believe this is the story of The Little Prince. If I believed in the afterlife, I'd say Antoine de St-Exupert must be shaking in his grave.I have a three year old daughter who is very intelligent and although part of the modern generation, she already knows about this book. Do yourself and your children a favour and if you understand French, read the original. If not, read the translation of the book. Do not go for this film unless you have already read the main story.",

Bravo! but the second half: \"Little prince in the 21 century\" was rather average, and the ending more or less disappointing. I think there are works of music, literature,art\u0085 which are to be reinterpreted very carefully, or better be left in their pure original form.I feel Exupery's book is in that category. If you value the book as a treasure of human literature\u0085 it's probably better not to watch this animation. If you don't know the book\u0085 you may enjoy this animation, it is not bad, but it is not a successful interpretation of \"The little Prince\".

Despite eccentricities the little girl befriends him and discovers his written memories of an adventure he had the desert. An adventure where he met The Little Prince.Great adaptation of the story by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. Having read the book I was intrigued to see how they turned into a feature film as the book doesn't seem long enough. By packaging The Little Prince into a modern-day story of the little girl we have enough for a movie (sort of...more about that later).The first half of the movie is quite wonderful: the added-on part of the little girl works very well, making the story of The Little Prince more relatable and bringing it to life quite vividly and with good humour. It's also quite profound, showing us that we should let kids be kids rather than stifle their curiosity, creativity, spontaneity and sense of adventure with overly strict regimens and projections of ambition.It's quite the emotional, engaging, funny and eye-opening journey and I even enjoyed this part more than the book itself.However, at almost exactly the halfway mark the book wraps up so from here on it's all new plot. This needn't have been a problem: until now the added-on stuff was fantastic. However, having wonderfully woven together The Little Prince and the improvised story the screenwriters didn't know what to do with it or how to bring the story home. More than this, the story was complete by half time - it didn't need anything more. But then we'd have a 50-minute movie - not ideal.What follows is a clumsy examination of the loss of childhood innocence and the pitfalls of adulthood. It doesn't go anywhere new - the first half already made this point - and the plot is quite basic, far more standard adventure film than warm, profound comedy-drama.The conclusion is quite emotional and ties things up well, preventing the lasting memory of the film from being one of an average animated adventure. However, a better second half and this film would have been brilliant.",

            "content": "At the mall in Tel Aviv, the movie theater had pulled all the stops out. Popcorn was being sold in Little Prince containers. The movie was playing in 3D dubbed, 2D dubbed, and 2D subtitled. A bookstore in the mall was displaying a large-format Little Prince book with a picture from the movie on the dust jacket. I flipped into the book and saw it was no more or less than the Saint-Exupery original. Some kid who receives it is going to be disappointed, just as anyone expecting the movie to reflect all the beloved aspects of the original story will be disappointed too. Inside its framing story of a little girl who reads the book, the movie gives us only bits and snatches of Saint- Exupery, and sometimes the compression is jarring. The story of the fox, for example, mentions taming but the taming seems like a matter of seconds and the color of the wheat is not mentioned at all. The Little Prince mentions watching a succession of dozens of sunsets but it isn't shown to reflect on his state of mind. On the plus side, the stop-motion graphics and computer graphics are impressive and well used by the plot-- although the movie does contain the kind of gratuitous swooping sequences that obviously have no purpose beyond 3D amusement. If there were no Saint-Exupery book, I would be the first to call the movie completely successful in terms of concept, execution, and message. But the book is a bit injured by incompleteness, and it's sad to think that several years must pass before someone brings out another ambitious Little Prince movie. The people who made this one could evidently have done a terrific job on a faithful movie of the original, but I'm sure they had their reasons to abbreviate and supplement it. Especially that the ending of the original is hard to take. Just as the little reader in the movie doesn't like it, maybe the filmmakers-- even more than they feared the public reaction were they to leave the ending as is- - didn't like the original ending either.",

I was so excited to see this possibly with my daughter but it seemed like it was a flash in the pan opening and the revenue would say this is true. The thing is there is nothing bad about this film. It is heartwarming, beautiful animation and style, excellent voice performances and a lot of morals either obvious or more subtle for child and adult. A lot of die hard The Little Prince fans seem put off that this is a story within a story but I thought that was brilliant. You're not remaking a classic for a modern age but rather using the classic to demonstrate how the concept is timeless. The film has this dark sadness to it which The Little Prince original cartoon always had too. There was something sad and offputting about his adventures and his quest for his rose and the bleakness of his planet and those he visited. It was indelibly lonely and I think this version did a very good job of capturing that especially with the two styles of animation. The biggest problem is that it feels very potentially emotional and it takes you to the edge but then never really delivers the goods.Jeff Bridges is absolutely perfect as The Aviator/Old Man. Something about his voice fits the entire demeanour of the character and the child-like aspects of the old man and his acceptance of life and the little prince. Mackenzie Foy is also excellent as the little girl and the two of them together forge the perfect friendship. Rachel McAdams absolutely nailed the role of the concerned but overly anxious Mom and her voice is hardly recognizable, she disappears into the character. The rest of the cast is full of familiar voices and famous people including Paul Rudd, Marion Cotillard, James Franco, Ricky Gervais (loved his role), Benecio Del Toro...I mean they pulled out the stops to get this cast together. The problem is there were so many unique and interesting characters that I wanted to know more and see more and I think that each one had subtle nuances and lessons behind their characters.Ultimately The Little Prince had a lot of content for a little movie that was already focusing more on the modern day little girl than The Little Prince himself. Imagine this as a mini-series or a franchise of some kind but somehow it's too dark to be on par with the other animated films out there and might actually be too spiritually intense for it's own good. Mark Osborne has definite animation ability having done Kung Fu Panda, Spongebob and more but I think he tried something of great power here and maybe didn't deliver like it could have. I still loved it. I think the style was great, the story was sweet and I actually think adults will get far more out of it than youngsters might but they can enjoy the animation for sure. It's a very different style of \"cartoon\" for certain and I do think they tried to pay homage to the original material and did so. 8/10",

Jeff Bridges voices an elderly man often scorned by neighbors for his accident prone habits such as starting his plane thus causing a disaster. He was an aviator and presents his stories to the young girl living next door. She is a bright kid with a loving yet over protective mother who is pushing her to grow up too fast with unrealistic demands. She befriends the old aviator and learns of his stranding in the desert and the vision of the little prince, the abandoned rose, the fox, and the need to allow the stars to shine bright and free. These themes may be a tad heavy handed for a really young audience but its intentions are great. The animation is brought out from a past design yet seems equally creative here. The aviator is young at heart but feel the end nearing and the need to pass his tale on. Mackenzie Foy voices the girl who learns of adventure. Rachel McAdams voices her stern mother who has her daughter's daily routine all mapped out. Paul Rudd voices the eventual prince when he does appear to help piece the rest of the narrative together. James Franco voices the fox who is the symbol of companionship. Message regards pushing our children to grow up too fast and risk missing out on childhood delights. It also addresses the risks adults face if they forget what it was like to be that age and lose that innocence and creative sense of adventure. Score: 9 / 10",

I do think the first hour is stronger than the last 45 minutes, which go to being a film that is more about a quest that needs to be accomplished. Saying that, some of the segments here are incredible. The film does a nice job of telling its story in a gentle, sweet way that seems approachable and applicable to what the source material may have been. I can see this being a hit with a lot of families (although I also think many younger kids may think it is slow).

As a matter of fact if I have seen this movie as a kid, I would have been a bit confused. But watching this movie as an adult makes me truly appreciate this film. Watching this movie was like watching a dream on screen. It delves into dreams, passion, hope and love. And some of the ridiculous aspects of being too serious and following a routine path while constantly staying in the comfort zone. It's just unfortunate that this movie will probably not hit is off big when it comes to the mainstream audiences. Because when it comes to animated films, they want something more on the lines of wacky, romantic, cut and fun over a animated film with deep messages, metaphors and symbolisms. It's just clear that the main motive of the director wasn't to make a lot of money, but make a impactful movie that will make audiences gain a broader spectrum of thoughts. The animation is even marvelous with it's mix of CGI and stop-motion. To the audience that is looking for a exact replica of the book this movie is based on will be left disappointed. But this movie it carries over the essence and the heart of the book. About keeping that dream, passion and hope alive despite the harshness of reality.

            "content": "A multi-country collaboration between a LOT of studios, by the director of Kung Fu Panda adapted The Little Prince, one of France's most beloved children's books back in 2015. The film however, takes a very interesting approach to the book.For those who haven't read it, The Little Prince contains a lot of philosophical anecdotes, the first several of which have a theme of the child versus the adult. And this movie opens with a girl being raised in a strict household with her mother's intention of turning her into a \"proper adult.\" But then she makes friends with the strange eccentric man next door, who is the aviator and writer of the The Little Prince book, (in universe.)Just to clarify that The Little Girl is not in the little prince book. Also, none of the characters in the book or the movie, have proper names. The movie cuts between the story of the prince, and the little girl's reaction to the story.And in a nutshell, this movie is INCREDIBLY good. I love it. It feels like a movie that could have come right out of a mainstream Western studio; if they didn't have to force in a joke every 10 seconds, and were allowed to be subtler and metaphorical. While it does draw the lines between kids and adults in such a blatant, stark way, and maybe her transition from a mini adult into a playful kid is a little bit too easy, and MAYBE this whole lesson of keeping hold of your inner child isn't really one this generation has any problems with, there's still a lot of relatable, inspirational material here!I love the way she initially reacts to the story in a SUPER literal way, which seems to echo how much fiction is judged that way recently! Also, this film approaches the concept of belief in a remarkably mature and tactful way.But then the last act suddenly takes a SHARP left turn, and takes on a VASTLY different tactic of re-imaging the book that's an interesting idea, but completely ruined because of how over-the-top spastic-ally CONTROLLING the tone was. Also, because the moral is SPELLED OUT to the audience, which it didn't need to be.But overall, I thought this movie was AMAZING. It's beautiful, it's touching, and it gets these really complex ideas across in very relatable ways. This is a movie I would watch again and again.",

            "content": "(RATING: \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606 out of 5 )THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A noble effort by an animator whose artistic talent exceeds his narrative skills.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: Saint-Exup\u00e9ry classic tale of The Little Prince is told with a modern day parallel story about a little girl coping in an adult world.JIM'S REVIEW: Mark Osborne's film, The Little Prince, is a flawed work of art, an animated effort to weave Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's beloved novella with a more conventional story about a sweet little girl (Mackenzie Foy) dealing with an overbearing mother (Rachel MacAdams). The parallel stories never gel and the heavy-handed plotting of the more modern tale frays and unravels the lyrical narrative structure of the original classic source.Purist beware! The Little Prince is a misnomer. More time is spent with The Little Girl than our regal hero (Riley Osborne) who is merely a side story to her modern day tale. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's story is parceled out sporadically as vignettes as the girl befriends an eccentric neighbor, The Aviator (Jeff Bridges), who proceeds to tell his account of the lost boy who loves a rose (Marion Cotillard). The filmmaker takes far too many liberties with the plot and downplays or ignores some characters in the book, only hinting at the philosophical dialog of the parable.That said, visually, the film is artistry of the highest order with images and details that are lovely. Mr. Osborne's creative vision melds old-fashioned line drawing (similar to the book's actual illustrations), stop-motion animation, and computer generated imagery in telling his dual stories. At times, the techniques work and other times it creates a jarring mood swing. (It actually takes 20 minutes before the moviegoer is transported to the world of The Little Prince, and I must admit that I grew impatient and my thoughts questioned the artistic journey that took place in Mr. Osborne's sub-conscious. I thought. \"Imagine what he could have created if he only stayed more closely to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original text! If only The Little Prince would not have been a tag-along story to The Little Girl!\")Still, his images are noteworthy and masterfully done. Here are just a few moments to admire: a roomful of glowing stars, line-drawn characters that bounce and distort handwritten words, that yellow sunlit scarf blowing in the wind, shadows transforming into birds and planes, and finally becoming a free-flowing kite, aerial geometric views of streets and buildings, a colorful parachute that slowly drapes around its characters, a Rube Goldberg chain reaction involving the takeoff of an airplane. Just stunning! All of the various styles of animation are beautifully rendered.But the screenplay by Irena Brignull and Bob Persichetti loses its way, especially in its third act when the screenwriters take our heroine on a magic mystery flight and cheat death by making the story more uplifting and crowd-pleasing. It does a disservice to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's tragic fable of life. The filmmakers falter when they try to connect the modern day counterparts with the more poetic characters and their encounters. The analogy comes off forced and the journey burns and crashes at this point, becoming a trivial pursuit.Mr. Osborne is a creative talent to watch and one can only look forward to his next endeavor. Technically, his re-imagining of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's parable is well crafted and quite impressive in animation terms. Although the film's two parallel tales align in spirit, they do not in their individual storytelling. They remain literally worlds apart and the result is a mixed blessing. The Little Prince is a visual stunner but its narrative ultimately lacks the poetic vision of its inspiring and more memorable source.NOTE: The behind-the-scenes making of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's book had some strange occurrences and Mr. Osborne's animated film had its share of odd happenings as well. Made nearly two years ago, and a modest hit overseas, the movie was unceremoniously dumped, never received proper distribution from its studio, Paramount, and just opened theatrically this past weekend at select cities while being streamed simultaneously on Netflix. It deserves a wider audience and should be seen by any serious fan of animation.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",

            "content": "\"The Little Prince\" is the newest adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry famous work and the two writers here, in the past, worked on \"Shrek 2\" and \"The Boxtrolls\". And this is actually the first full feature directorial effort in 7 years by 2-time Academy Award nominee Mark Osborne after \"Kung Fu Panda\". And even if \"The Little Prince\" did not make the Best Animated Feature shortlist at the Oscars, it is still a decent watch and has a fine collection of voices actors. These include Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, Paul Rudd, James Franco, Paul Giamatti, Ricky Gervais, Benicio Del Toro, Jeff Bridges and last but not least Mackenzie \"Renesmee\" Foy for the girl who is the main character. She is probably even more lead than the title character as this story begins with her and ends with her.I think it was a nice idea to split the animation into 2 completely different styles. On the one hand, there are the modern sequences with the way animation looks always today, like for example in \"Frozen\". And then there are the sequences with the little prince, the stop-motion parts. I must say I am generally not the biggest stop-motion fan, so I am a bit biased here. This is also why I certainly preferred the more \"modern\" parts, which were thankfully the majority of the film. However, this is obviously just personal taste. Maybe you will enjoy this even more if you like stop-motion. A more neutral criticism is that the story sometimes became too fantastic and absurd for my taste with the modern Prince, the random space flying, the love for the rose etc. At least to some extent, this is still also personal perception. As a whole I enjoyed the watch. I never felt there were any truly great moments, but it was kinda nice I think and I recommend it. There is one pretty bad moment though when the girl and the old man have their crucial argument moment (or really only the girl). It felt pretty forced and the reaction from her did not feel authentic at all. That is just a minor thumbs-down though. As a whole, easily among the better 2015 films in terms of animation. Thumbs up.",

This is because The movie deals heavily with imagination. Most people will literally stop to think, unwilling to suspend their already owned knowledge and beliefs, resulting in the movie's story being hard to digest. But once someone give in and flow the story's current, they'll find that they're seeing something that has been missing from their childhood. Especially for kids nowadays. Now parents often don't have adequate time with their children due to overwhelming work. Even after work some parents prefer to spend their time on their pleasures and not with their children.Kids nowadays also lose much space for imagination as they are stuck with electronic gadgets, restraining them from imagination sparking physical activities. That is how this movie hits home to them. The voice acting is done well enough. It's nice that the weight of the cast members' name didn't overwhelm the story as a whole.",

            "content": "I grew up reading The Little Prince, an abstractly contemplative, profound book by wartime pilot Antoine de-Saint Exup\u00fary. It's a wonderful story of his adventures stranded in the Sahara desert, and a curious extraterrestrial voyager he encounters there, who calls himself the Little Prince. He asks him to draw a sheep, and tells of his adventure on asteroid B6-12, and various creatures he meets. It's a frank, heartfelt allegory for the way the human heart and mind goes through a paradigm shift when age works it's spell, and gently reminds it's readers not to forget the wonder and disposition of being young. It's otherworldy, self contained and a very specific, poetic narrative, which is why I was worried that a big budget reimagining might shatter the tone of the source material and taint it with modernized mechanics. While it is jarring to see the styles meld, the French American co-production is a dazzling, loving ode to Exup\u00fary's book. It frames the story of the prince around a little girl (Interstellar's MacKenzie Foy) who movies into a ticky tacky little suburban neighborhood with her overbearing mom (Rachel Mcadams), who has rigid plans for her daughter's academic success. Soon she meets her curious neighbor, The Aviator (Jeff Bridges, lending his warm-hearted voice to comforting perfection) a kindly old man who shares with her, page by page, the story of The Little Prince. We see these unfold in stunning, esoteric stop motion animation that compliments the CG of the rest of the film, equally gorgeous. She learns from The Aviator how to appreciate the perceptive qualities that we often lose later in life, and that the problem isn't growing up, but forgetting. We see in episodic fashion the prince's encounters with his beloved rose (Marion Cotillard), the malevolent Snake (Benicio Del Toro) who promises to help him return to his planet, and The Fox (James Franco, excellent) who teaches him that only with the heart can we see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye (always my favourite part of the book). The girl learns of the sadness and hardships that await her adult life, as reality puts a wrench in her idyllic friendship with the Aviator. The filmmakers beautifully gild the themes of the book which were so important to Exup\u00fary by adding many elements in screenplay, animation and new characters that not only make the prince's story more accessible to youngsters of this generation, but enhance the story with the parallel of The Girl. An end sequence slightly stretches the boundaries of what some fans of the book may be willing to except, but I warmed up to it, and it's inconsequential when you step back and see the film as a whole, which is stunning. The voice cast is perfect too, with further work coming from Paul Rudd, Bud Cort, Ricky Gervais, Albert Brooks and Paul Giamatti. A treasure for those who hold the book dear, a triumph of animation and a story anyone can learn from and relate to.",

            "content": "This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and I adored it from start to finish. Based around a classic French tale, The Little Prince is a truly wonderful animation that features a delightful and uplifting story, brilliant voice performances, stunning visuals, an exceptional score, and a powerful and poetic central message that will move you to your core.I think it's best to start off quickly explaining what this film is before explaining why I loved it so much. The main portion of the story isn't in fact about The Little Prince, but a young girl living in a dull modern world. Throughout, her life is changed by hearing tales about The Little Prince, which are interwoven within the story in various delightful storybook-like sequences, remembered by the old man living next door.Looking solely at the plot and narrative, this film is a good watch for kids. Its central themes aren't as light-hearted as most Hollywood family films (and I'll get onto that in a bit), but as an adventure story, I think that kids will love the imaginative and uplifting nature of this film. However, there is a lot more that makes this film truly outstanding.There were so many things about this film that blew me away, and one of the most impressive was the animation. On the one hand, you've got the contrast between modern-style animation in the little girl's story and stop-motion for The Little Prince segments. That's a technique that works perfectly throughout, as it lends a very magical tone to the fantasy sequences, and really emphasises the idea that the old man is reminiscing fondly about these tales, heightening the nostalgic power that comes in tandem with one of the film's main themes.Meanwhile, director Mark Osborne brilliantly portrays the dull, grey modern world, a setting which is furthered by the stunning animation. Whilst the characters look like typical Disney leads, the backgrounds, settings and weather are pretty much photo- realistic, giving a powerful and sombre sense of realism to the depressing world in which the little girl lives.The contrast between the two animation styles leads me onto what I thought was the true heart of this movie, and what made it such an incredible watch: its message. Although not particularly subtle in the opening act, the way the film touches on the way that many children nowadays have to live their lives, and never be able to have a true, care-free childhood, was extremely moving to watch.Throughout the movie, we see the little girl's relationship with the old man whom modern society has shunned blossom, and she begins to see the world with more wonder and awe, as a child should. In contrast to her controlling mother, the little girl's transformation over the course of the movie into a fun-loving, excited and hopeful person is wonderful to see, providing such emotional power that I was genuinely crying with joy on a good few occasions.I'm not saying that this film tells a revolutionary or extremely original story, but what makes it so special for me is its use of a classic tale in a modern context, and its deep and powerful exploration of so many fascinating themes, something that is very rare amongst modern kids' movies.Beyond that, there's even more to unpack and love about The Little Prince. For one, its stellar A-list voice cast, including Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, Paul Rudd, Marion Cotillard, James Franco, Albert Brooks and Mackenzie Foy, is exceptional throughout. All the performances feel just as special as the rest of the film, and the huge variety of voice performances in the film's more fantasy-oriented sequences give it a great vibrancy, adding further to the positive and uplifting atmosphere throughout.And finally, the cherry on top of the cake is Hans Zimmer and Richard Harvey's score. The whole film is a truly wonderful experience, and the music is the perfect detail to bring it all together. Mixing together a sense of importance and drama with excitement and positivity, it features a series of beautiful themes that were the final element that broke me down into tears on multiple occasions. It's a stunning score, undoubtedly one of the best of any animated movie, and it sums up exactly everything that I adore about this film.Overall, The Little Prince is a truly special watch. On the surface, it can be a fun kids' movie, and so it should be, but I think it's possibly even more powerful and engrossing for adults. It plays on childhood nostalgia, always reminding you not to forget the happiest days of your life, and also looks at the way that the modern world has impacted on traditional childhoods. It's animated, written, performed, directed and scored beautifully from start to finish, and it makes for what I think is a real work of art.",

While I was watching the movie, several theories came to my mind. It might have been Paramount thought the movie was too \"foreign\" for American audiences. It might have been that the movie is significantly more serious and thoughtful than your typical Hollywood animated movie instead of having heavy slapstick and flatulence jokes.But I think the real reason was the main objection I had with the movie, that being that the filmmakers put way too much on their plate. Certainly, some of the movie is devoted to recreating the famous book of the same name. Bu the movie also spends a lot of time on the story about a little girl and her friendship with the elderly man living next door. In the last third of the movie, the story changes to being a sequel to the book. The movie can't decide on what it's supposed to be about, and as a result the plot is kind of a mess - especially if you haven't read the book.The movie certainly has fine animation (both computer and stop- motion) despite not having a Hollywood budget. And there is some charm here and there. But the story goes in way too many directions. The end results would probably have been better had the filmmakers picked one story and stuck to it.",

I was brought around to this wonderful film in an ironic twist and it was just what I needed. After reading extensively in the French press about the terrible events of 13NOV15 I somehow came across a mention of this classic piece of literature disguised as a children's book.

            "content": "Proving that Disney doesn't have a monopoly on adapting classic stories with whimsy and wonder, Mark Osborne has successfully brought 'The Little Prince' to life through a beautiful mixture of computer generated and stop motion animation. It's already an instant classic, with a thought provoking, multi-layered story and some visually stunning animation. We start off the film in a CGI world where a Little Girl (Mackenzie Foy) has just moved houses so that she can be within correct district to attend a prestigious school. This is all part of her Mother's (Rachel McAdams) life plan to turn her in to \"a wonderful grown up\". This life plan includes planning out literally her entire life, giving her daughter clear instructions of what she should be doing down to every hour, including a summer break that includes nothing but revising from text books.But all this changes when her old, eccentric neighbour, The Aviator (Jeff Bridges) enters her life and begins to tell her the story of The Little Prince (Riley Osborne). Thus we are introduced to a stop motion animated world, telling a tale of how the Little Prince fell in love with a Rose (Marion Cotillard) and then travelled across the stars meeting many strange characters, including the Businessman who seeks to own ever star (Albert Brooks), the conceited man who believes all should admire him (Ricky Gervais) and the Fox (James Franco) who the Prince seeks to tame. Much is added to the original novella, but director Mark Osborne ensures that the film never strays too far from the original novellas tone or themes. Instead the messages of the novella, such as needing to explore in order to learn and grow as a person, are given an entire new layer through the girls interactions with the Aviator. On top of this every voice performance (which includes the directors own son playing the Little Prince) seems perfectly cast. This includes a great performance from Jeff Bridges who is able to balance both the eccentric and heartfelt side of the Aviator. Both of the animation styles complement each other very well. In the CGI world there's a lot of emphasis on the blandness of what growing up can be like with grey colours and the lack of any uniqueness or identity. The houses in the neighbourhood are so similar that the mother even drives past her own home since you can't tell them apart. In contrast the stop motion style is so full of life and colour. It's as if the pages are literally coming to life with the stop motion focusing on details like shadows and the crinkled paper look for each of the characters. The film does falter a little within its third act that favours trading out its focus on its characters and story, instead having the girl travelling on an exciting adventure across the stars to save the Little Prince. It never detracts from either the messages of the film or of the original book and it's still an entertaining third act. But it does depart from the rest of the films unique and subtle beauty, in favour of an action sequence that feels out of tone to the rest of the film. Although this is only a slight misstep as the films finale is emotional and leaves a deep impact that is bound to resonate with viewers of any age.",

Anyway, the film does explain what the author wanted to: When one grows to be one of the \"Adults,\"his little prince,or what he stands for, curiosity, imagination, love, friendship, the ability to view the surrounding world with an aesthetical eye, or romanticism,dies with him. In the movie, the little girl has to learn about the society's materialism, to handle the relationship between her material life and her loved and beloved ones. So basically in the movie the little girl stands for the little prince, and again IN THE MOVIE the little girls experiences, although partially, what I understand that the little prince goes through in the book. The part I don't like about this film is it's rated that children are watching it. Why on Earth should they be recommended or even marketed to read or watch Le Petit Prince, Alice in Wonderland and so on? Shouldn't they be enjoying their childhood instead of pleurnicher and worrying about losing it?

He mentioned that his daughter was a huge influence on him and his son was used as the voice of the little prince.The idea of this movie is about a little girl who reads the Little Prince stories, which are \"true\" in this universe. This is the framing device for telling the original stories in the book. The director stated that this movie was not an attempt to make the Little Prince book into a movie, which he says is \"impossible\", but rather an attempt to show how it felt to read the book for the first time. OK, cool. Sounds good so far.I will sum up exactly what this movie is: Basically, someone wrote a lousy fan fiction sequel to the Little Prince and dropped a Mary Sue into it as the lead character. If you don't know what a Mary Sue is, Wikipedia defines it as \"an idealized and seemingly perfect fictional character, a young or low-rank person who saves the day through unrealistic abilities. Often this character is recognized as an author insert and/or wish- fulfillment.\"So basically: The Little Prince story continues years later after it ends with the book and this girl is inserted into the story and she saves everything because she's so amazing and smart. If that's what you want to watch, it is nicely animated and amusing enough. It definitely has its moments of wonder and keeps your interest.

You can tell a lot of heart and effort went into the stop-motion segments. These few scenes are the best the movie has to offer, and I would say that the movie is worth watching just for those few scenes...Emphasis on \"few\".Now, it isn't an issue that this movie goes the route of \"The Lorax\" (actually it might be an issue), but it is more how it is told. The main premise of the movie (again, identical to The Lorax) is that a girl lives in a world that is highly focused on business, efficiency, money, and is ultimately fake. However, she encounters an old man who lives in the one \"unique\" house on the block (that is also taller than the rest) and listens to the stories of \"The Little Prince\" from the Old-man.This works... for a little while. If the movie were to tell the entire story of \"The Little Prince\" and make it feature-length, I would be totally fine with that. It could also make connections in the girl's life with her overworking mother, but the focus would be on the \"Prince's\" message and themes. Unfortunately, the movie is split into 5-6 acts, and The Little Prince is only in act 2 (or at least the original story).This movie feels like 3 different movies, and sadly the title of this movie is only one of these movies. The movie literally jumps ship into a new movie once it hits the climax of the first and second movie. This new movie involves the little girl going on a big journey to find The Little Prince; only to discover that he has grown up and his life is ruined because he decided to (get this) go to school, get an education, and try to enter the business world.Yes. This movie is one of those movies. It literally has no idea what it is trying to say. Is this a movie about death? Is it about love? Is it about strict parents? High societal standards? The death of childhood? Big business being evil? Education being evil? Adulthood being evil? WHAT IS THIS MOVIE ABOUT!?!?!? What makes it even more insulting is that the person who initially taught the main theme of the movie (the little prince) is the one the little girl has to teach... his own message. The more you think about this movie's theming, the more painful it becomes. And again, the biggest theme of this movie is \"Big business and the education system are evil\"... which... I don't know what everyone else thinks, but that is a very shallow message (especially when compared to the original story). To make it worse, it doesn't even truly give a fair argument for why it thinks it is evil? It just paints anyone who is an adult as evil and small-minded.All in all, watch this movie for the first half with the stop-motion segments. Those segments are beautiful, but, sadly, very little of this movie is spent on those segments.",

The third part of the story is where the two eventually overlap, which offers some amazing moments of visual poetry. The stop motion portion of the movie is by far my favorite part of the film. The way it is animated makes me think much less of more modern masterpieces of the genre like Caroline and ParaNorman and more like paper mache works of short movies from a long time ago. It has so much heart and charm that these sections give of would make a fantastic masterpiece in of itself. Now that we've covered the animation it would remiss of me not to mention the voice performances in the film. To be exact I would like to talk about the real stand out of the movie is Jeff Bridges performance as the old man neighbor, this is one of my favorite from the actor, even with the inclusion of his past roles in the Big Lebowski and True Grit. I fully recommend this film to anyone with a Netflix subscription to watch it as it is short and sweet. The only real thing that works against the film is that you can only get it if you have a Netflix streaming subscription.",

            "review_title": "The Little Prince finds what is essential",
            "content": "The Little Prince doesn't tackle adapting the classic children's book head-on. It takes place in present day, introducing an unnamed little girl (Mackenzie Foy) who is being groomed by her mother (Rachel McAdams) for life in the prestigious Werth School. After a disastrous first attempt, they move to a new house and resolve to spend the summer getting ready to try again. This new house happens to be beside the house of the aviator (Jeff Bridges), a seemingly crazy old man with an airplane in his backyard. The little girl and the aviator become unlikely friends, as the little girl finds respite from the routine of her studying in the aviator's wild tales of a boy that lives on an asteroid somewhere out in space.The decision to not simply adapt the book is a wise one. Beautiful and graceful as it might be, it is also a very thin volume that doesn't have nearly enough plot to sustain a feature length film. This movie instead holds on to the themes of the book, and recreates the wonder of the story through a whole new context. It is a little broad at times, and perhaps a little lacking in grace when deliver its messages. But all in all, the film finds really clever ways to bring this story to screen. One of the most remembered and beloved lines from the book has to do with what is essential. And this film mostly concerns itself with the question of what it is essential. The opening sequences of the film depict a world that has been reduced to everything essential: a world of adults zipping around in identical cars, going to home to the same gray boxes. The little girl in the film looks like a kid at the beginning of the picture, but she is already well on her way to becoming another functional cog in this larger societal machine. She is on her way to becoming essential. Though a bit lacking in lyricism, this is a pretty good way to bring the book's themes to the fore. The film still gets to many of the scenes from the book, but it grounds them in a smaller, personal story that does feel altogether relevant. And when the film starts to go beyond the book, it actually becomes inspired. In imagining a life beyond the ending the book, the film starts to draw from different inspirations, and develops a true voice of its own. It hits its themes a little hard, but that's forgivable in the end. The film provides enough beauty along the way that it doesn't really matter.This is a very beautiful film. The CG animation is crisp and benefits from a very strong design sense. And the scenes taken from the book are visually breathtaking. These scenes have paper and paint coming to life, capturing a sense of whimsy that is really important to the story. Voice acting is well done all throughout. Mackenzie Foy delivers a solid lead performance. Jeff Bridges is perfect as the not-quite-all-there aviator. Paul Rudd, James Franco, Ricky Gervais, Bud Cort and Albert Brooks are all pretty memorable in their performances as characters of the book. It's great stuff all around.The Little Prince is a little heavy handed, and the gap between the second the third acts is maybe a little too long. But it is quite lovely all the same. The film is clearly the product of a great love and understanding for the source material, and a real yearning to do justice to it. Whether it is in the beautifully conceived stop motion scenes that cover the book, or the cleverly put together CG sequences that go beyond it, the film always keeps The Little Prince in its heart. It is looking for what is essential, whether it be visible or not.",

With this incredible tool nothing is impossible, as far as you can imagine it, you can do it. Shots and compositions that would have been impossible to do on a normal movie can be easily done in animation. And this picture makes this philosophy real. As a big fan of good photography I couldn't be happier of how it's used. I love that 3 different techniques are used to create something original and so incredibly beautiful. This movie takes the story we all have read as kids and, in a way that only children could imagine while reading the book, takes it to another level, making it even more magical. It doesn't matter if your a kid or an adult, when you watch this movie you go back to your childhood and see things differently, using your imagination. Love the nice touch the French songs give to the film. Not only the poetic picture is insanely wonderful, but it also is full of beautiful life lessons.",

For some it has such influence that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's thoughts guide them through life and are reminding them of beauty, simplicity, but also absurdity of today's life. Reading The Little Prince several times I must say that this movie is nothing like Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Little Prince. Yes, it is hard to put such a story on screen, especially to make every book fan satisfied, but this should just not have happened. Sadly, in a movie industry called Hollywood it is already usual to make movies with a superficial plot and well known American patheticness. This 'The Little Prince' movie is not exception, it gives people who have never read a book a totally different and wrong perception of this outstanding literary work. To finish this review I will go back to the headline and say that this is definitely NOT Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Little Prince IT IS Hollywood's Little prince.",

The books were meaningful and heart-warming to read, while this film is a forgettable, boring run of the mill film. Although there is at times fantastic animation and some pleasant bits, the mistake with this film is that it shows a clear lack of understanding of the book.The plot choices of this film are mind-boggling. There were several times where I thought to myself \"what the hell is going on? Have they read the source material?\". Surely it isn't bad to take an adaption in a new direction but when that direction leads off a cliff, you have problems. Its as if a great team started working on the beautifully animated Little Prince/Aviator sequences then ran out of budget, thus hiring some Hollywood writers and decent animators to get the rest done.Theory aside, while the Little Prince scenes were the most interesting, they are under-developed and rushed to spend time with the other dull story. The relationship between the Aviator and the girl is at times endearing, but also a little forced and clich\u00e9. Past that, the film's result of the Prince's character is unsurprisingly very badly handled.To quote the Businessman, the creators skimmed through the book and stated \"There is nothing essential in here at all\". Then the Little Prince movie came to be.",

The animation style is similar to that of Pixar, which is interwoven with stunning stop-motion moments. So in general this film has a lot going for it.For the most part, I really liked The Little Prince. As I say, the cast do an amazing job, each role is brought to life with very unique voices and delivery. You can have a film with unknown cast and sometimes that works quite well but sometimes when you hear these voices and you instantly recognise them, it gives you as sense of comfort and familiarity; and the lines delivered by ones such as Jeff Bridges and James Franco make them really stick with you. Like a lot of good animated films, The Little Prince gives you a lot of mottos and life lessons to remember; some of the ones in this movie though, I felt didn't come across as clearly as intended. Something would be happening and I was left wondering exactly what it was trying to tell me, and that's the thing with this movie, there seems to be a lot of metaphors, all of which are presented beautifully, but are left up for interpretation. So in terms of cast and dialogue, I really thought the film was something special.I mentioned the animation before and I'll just elaborate. The majority of the film is computer animated and although not as detailed as the more popular animation studios can give, which is to be expected, the look and style were enjoyable enough and it seems like they took a few notes from Pixar, which is never a bad thing. The animation though is nothing compared to the visually stunning stop-motion sequences that are presented. It's nothing like I've seen before and was by far the most interesting parts of the film; a visual experience.I'll move onto the story now. The summary of which is a little girl moves to a new house with her very controlling, almost OCD, mother and meets her neighbour, an old man who has a hoarding problem that tells her about his supposed experience he had in the Sahara desert. The first two thirds I really enjoyed, some could argue it's a bit slow, but for me I enjoyed the storytelling element and the sometimes very real depictions of life spliced in with the wildly imaginative metaphors. The friendship between the little girl and the old man was a charming and entertaining watch, and the stop- motion story always had me invested. The third act however took quite a turn in the narrative, the tone changed somewhat and I was constantly waiting for some degree of explanation. I felt it got a little too mixed up into what was real, what was metaphorical, and it didn't quite give closure to some of the plot threads. According to some Internet articles both the book and the film try to base it's logic on a child's imagination so I suppose in that way it makes sense...in a nonsensical kind of way.In the end, The Little Prince was a visually stunning film with a great script and voice work but the narrative was a little shaky, especially towards the third act.",

But still i liked the message overall, but i'm not so sure the youngest audience members will get it yet or will be highly involved into the story but lets face it, the audiences today need movies like \"Finding Dory\" or \"Frozen\" and etc. - i can't imagine \"The Little Prince\" being a big box office success.

I hear some people regard this as a stop motion film, but most of it isn't that at all. I was kind of disappointed by that, because while the CGI was good, the stop motion was simply fantastic. The details were down so perfectly and the characters had more depth this way. I still like the idea of two styles being blended together.I also like the story a lot, particularly with how it deals with a little girl who has a mother who literally arranges everything in her life to happen at a specific time. Most of us know what it's like to live with someone who wants everything to be precise. I admit that the film does get weak in the last third, particularly with how it suddenly turns into a dystopian future-like world. I do like the reveal for the main villain.

While movies like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009) took the approach of explaining why there was giant food falling from the sky, The Little Prince (2015) framed its iconic story with your standard \"overbearing parent wants their child to succeed at the detriment of said child's childhood\" sub-plot.When I was growing up, I never encountered The Little Prince in all the picture books I read. Even without this prior knowledge, I could get a sense that the entirety of the book's content was contained in the stop-motion sections of this movie. I felt there was a missed opportunity to do the whole film in this style. Animated films seem to rely so heavily on CGI animation these days, that something which had a different visual aesthetic would have been a welcome change to the monotony. Granted, in splitting the animation styles, it allowed both stories to progress with little hindrance in understanding which plot was being followed.And while I understand the importance of children being allowed to play and have fun, the adult in me finds these anti-corporate/anti-job plots a bit tiring. Yes, we should all pursue our fun and creative passions, but how many of them pay enough to make a living? An individual's level of comfort will inherently dictate their compliance with the corporate structure. Sure, there are plenty of people who make a living on a meager artist's wage, but it's honestly not for everyone. Demonizing jobs and work does no good for children who will eventually have to grow up and provide for themselves.Some interesting visuals with a worn-out anti-job message, I give The Little Prince 3.0 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. There were many parts that I did not understand but I still loved every moment of it. I have never read or even heard of the book. It seems that there are many different interpretations of this story. No matter which you choose, it is a poignant and delightful tale.First off you have to suspend disbelief a little bit. Obviously in the real world a little girl secretly spending time alone with her old neighbor would not be a good idea. But in this realm we know right off the bat that everything will be fine.I found it very interesting that not a single one of the characters has an actual name. I found myself not even realizing this until halfway through. The little girl's mother had already fully immersed her in the essential world of adults and she had no friends and was not permitted to be a child. I love how no matter how perfect and rigid the mother tries to be, there is always one tiny piece of hair sticking out of place against her forehead. I thought that this was very poetic. And in the end when she finally learns from her daughter, she is wearing casual clothes to show that she has calmed down. I also thought it was very sad and beautiful when the aviator left the mother an illustrated apology note and a rose to try to make amends for the damage he had done to their house. She read the note over and then immediately disposed of it as well as the rose as they were not \"essential\" to her. This is the mother tossing away his attempt to connect with her.I personally feel that The Little Prince represented The Aviator's inner child, I do not believe he was actually a separate entity at all. We see in the very beginning that The Aviator used to love to create drawings that no one understood. The very first thing The Little Prince asks the aviator to do when he crashes in the Sahara dessert is to draw him something. I think that the aviator's troubled mind upon waiting for rescue or death conjured the image of his former self to comfort him since he was all alone. The Little Prince asks the aviator to draw him a sheep which is often symbolic of being a conformist or \"part of the herd.\" I believe that the little prince is killed by the snake in the dessert, or at least the idea of him is. The aviator's drawings in the beginning depicted creatures being swallowed whole by snakes and to me this seems like what happened to the little prince. But it was only a shell, and as the little prince said, \"No one is sad over old shells.\" So the aviator fixes his plane and moves on, but never forgets the little prince.We see the dangers of growing up too fast and also of never growing up in this movie. It was very unhealthy for the little girl to be so involved in the adult world already, her mom talking to her at length about work problems and her being able to file police reports. It was also just as unhealthy for the aviator to still be acting like a child. He could have killed the little girl several times, particularly when they are both beholding a butterfly and he runs the stop sign. Most of the adults were depicted as villains, people who had entirely forgotten their former selves and who no longer possessed love or hope for anything or anyone. \"Growing up is not the problem, forgetting is.\" The key is to grow up but to hold on to what is most essential, what cannot be seen with the eye, but with the heart instead.Even though this movie and book are dubbed a fantasy, I am fairly certain that everything that happened with the little girl taking the plane to find the little prince is just a result of the fall that she took. I do not think that the little prince was real, I think it is just the idea of him that is important. She imagined him lost on a planet of adults who had corrupted him and now she must save him and reawaken hope in his heart. It is important to her that Mr. Prince remembers who he is because she is so terrified that she will suffer the same fate, especially when the aviator leaves her. It was beautiful when he turned back into the little prince in the end and she was able to finish the aviator's story for him before his ended. I loved all of the symbolism in this movie and the all star cast. Paul Rudd's scene with the little girl in the end when the rose dies is particularly heart wrenching. James Franco also spoke very tenderly as the fox. Human connections are certainly what is most essential in this world.",

            "content": "This latest effort at adapting the classic book is not very good. The screenplay is in dire need of re-writing and the movie really needs an editor in order to excise about 45 minutes off the end. At about the 1-hour mark, the actual story ends, but it goes on and on off on its own meandering trying to find a proper ending. I guess the original ending is not something easily explained, so the screenwriter and director added to it. Those are probably the movie's biggest flaws. The animation was also inconsistent. It would've been better had they stuck with the style used for the actual story of The Little Prince. The animation used for contemporary time looked like some cookie-cutter, generic 3-D animation \u00e0 la Pixar. Mind you, it can be good, but it sits in stark, ugly contrast with the more charming style and design used for The Little Prince. It's as if the director tried to blend two different animated movies into one. The overall bad and/or miscast voice acting is nothing to write home about, either.Going back to the story, the screenplay misplaces or, worse, omits A LOT. Things that are supposed to take a longer time to talk and explain are brushed off in a matter of seconds, entire segments of the story are simply not used - at least half The Little Prince's dialogue and interactions are gone!, and things are replaced with a boring story about a girl trying to get into a prestigious academy and her controlling mother. As I said, the problem is the stark difference between the sublime and the heavy-handed.I commend Netflix for taking a chance on what would now be considered an esoteric project that few people under 40 would even know about nowadays. However, I can't help but think the writers and director simply were not into it or, sadly, probably gave up on it.",

This animation tells the story of a young girl who has a strict mother, making plans for her round the clock so that she could get into the best school. Just as she starts to think she has no childhood, she encounters an elderly neighbor who dares to dream. Of all the books written in French over the past century, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's \"Le Petit Prince\" is surely the best loved in the most tongues. Only in \"The Little Prince\" it is shown to us as comic fable rather than realistic novel. The world conspires to make us blind to its own workings; our real work is to see the world again. The Little Prince shows that a child can change an adults heart and help them remember their past and meaning in the story. And yet in a world that seems increasingly dominated by hate speech and stories of violence, it's one that we could stand to learn again. Ultimately, \"The Little Prince\" is a film that everyone should be happy to show their children. If you're ever told you have no meaning in this world, you have meaning, and have a purpose in this world. This is able to translate this literary classic into a compelling movie structure. It's a heart-warming coming-of-age story as long as one haven't forgotten.",

            "content": "The Little Prince is part of the popular imagination of many people. It is one of the most read books in the world, translated into every possible language and every now and then we see its sentences posted on social networks in a motivational way. Launched in 1943 by the aristocrat, writer, poet and aviation pioneer Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, it is a book of many fame. It is, for example, the favorite of the missions, which reaffirm its impact at each beauty contest, and it is the one that \"changes with each reading\". A book that serves all stages of life. In fact, the narrative composed of small parables may receive different interpretations over the years. The relationship of the little prince with his rose, for example, can be one of friendship in childhood, or represent the difficulties of a romantic relationship in adulthood. This complex nature arises from the simplicity with which Saint-Exup\u00e9ry presents the journey of his aviator / narrator and the boy from asteroid B 612.Not only was the ingenious idea of placing two parallel plots in the film - that of the book and that of the little girl who reads the book for the first time - Osborne had another brilliant idea: using two different animation techniques to tell the two stories - in 3D animation for the unprecedented segment, and in stop-motion for the story of Little Prince. Visually, the film is a delight in both animation techniques, but it borders on genius with the Prince's look made with the different technique. It's no surprise, therefore, that the best moments in this feature are those that adapt with extreme fidelity to Saint-Exupery's plot, bringing to life even the author's illustrations.Despite the little girl being the protagonist of the film, the heart of this production is really the Little Prince, something even reflected in the production design. In this way, the dear literary characters portrayed there, such as the Little Prince himself, the aviator and the rose, prove to be more \"tangible\" and \"real\" than those who should represent the public. The fact that the traces of these figures were taken directly from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's illustrations underscores the idea that they appear to have jumped directly from the pages of the book. Even the photography in the desert scenes, in a sepia tone, highlights a pleasant feeling of nostalgia. These passages are shown in a delicate and faithful way, with all the bittersweet lessons from the original being portrayed with extreme fidelity, even maintaining the last tense dialogue between the Prince and the Aviator (and the girl's reaction to hearing this specific passage is the best \"real world\" scene, reflecting the reaction of many readers in this passage).Speaking of which, the idea of the writers to anchor the adaptation in the impact that the story causes on the reader was great, but it was carried out in an established way. While The Little Girl is friendly and her bow reverberates in the lives of several modern children, albeit in an exaggerated way, the script misses the hand of adults. While the mother is excessively villainized in the second act, the stoic figure of the aviator is reduced, when in the \"real world\", to a clumsy and irresponsible gentleman, which equals the lesson of wonder and the eternal childlike gaze that the Little Prince conveys (literally and/or figuratively) to the character/author to an incentive of eternal immaturity, harming the film as a whole.However, this damage was less than that caused by the disastrous third act of production, in which the tape becomes a sequel to the book. Worse, an extremely conventional continuation, featuring the Prince in an adult version supported by a physical humor (!) Of the most common, stripping the plot of all the charm that made it unique. When the director chooses to mix the two worlds, the story created by the writers and the original work, the viewer is a little lost and almost all the work does not go down the drain.In general, Osborne works with the sensitivity of those who understand the children's universe and do not underestimate their child viewers. The original book is retold and explored as a great metaphor for loss, values and worldviews, in a fascinating fantasy that helps the little protagonist to face her challenges. Even for those who do not know or do not like the book so much, it will be difficult to go through \"The Little Prince\" without shedding at least one tear. The film doses small moments of humor, sweetness and drama, without ever being too heavy or too light. For children who will have their first contact with the work through cinema, there is no doubt that the film will leave a mark, as the book left to their parents and grandparents. And they will also show your children when the time is right.The great charm of this film version is the reinforced message that we always strive to keep The Little Prince alive within each one of us. We grow up and forget everything we once dreamed of. Dreams were real, we were part of them. We've learned so much, we've traveled so much across long blanket plains, we could fly with our kites, and laughter still echoes in our minds, but these are tales of an era long gone. In adulthood, everything seems to turn into a horror tale, in which we fight against time, we lose the chances of knowing new pleasures, we fail to pay attention to our surroundings and we only think about chasing success, money, material goods. All of this may sound too clich\u00e9, but it is still true in this feature film.With a charming style of representation of the characters and the modern world, this animation holds the attention of children and adults from beginning to end. Little Girl is the protagonist and doesn't have to make an effort to steal the spotlight with her huge eyes and her sweetness enveloped by the unnecessary stress of an early adult life. The friendly Aviator is the messenger, who recites poetry in each sentence and shows us how happiness is within reach. His speeches can be directed to The Little Girl, but the whole message is passed on to the audience. When we turn a page, when new characters appear on the screen, we are led to understand that each person in our life becomes essential by the simple fact that we do so.It is incredible to see the way the director manages to trace these two plots and unite them, showing the effect that the Prince's tale has on the girl: the same that the book has on its beds. She is touched by history, which shows her what is really essential ... and how it is invisible to the eyes. The adults in the Little Girl segment are cold, dry and only care about working and producing excessively, forgetting about feelings and transforming the world we know into an inhospitable and sad place. It is a beautiful parallel to what Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's book tries to teach.Entitled to hints of humor and adventure, the whole essence of The Little Prince's original story is here and, although the script preaches that the essential is only visible to the heart, the film manages to illustrate in a very clear way everything that is essential and wins over children of all ages - especially those over 18. With the magical touch of Hans Zimmer and Richard Harvey on the soundtrack, the film \"The Little Prince\" is even more enjoyable, and it is recommended to accompany the film from the side of a box of tissues. Being a short narrative, the production expands beyond the original story, developing an adventure with the girl in her search for the real little prince. This part works with the same fundamental parallels of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's work and its concepts, such as love and friendship. A connection that promotes the original work and simultaneously renews it, managing to efficiently close both plots brilliantly and intertwine them with a beautiful moral lesson that will leave the viewer extremely emotional.'The Little Prince' is a differentiated masterpiece, an animated film with touches of art that deviates from the Hollywood standard and brings a more adult theme, but enchants for its simplicity and purity. The message passed through the film - the same as in the book - will leave you thoughtful for days. After all, what is essential?",

I loved their quirky relationship, and the fact that the film centralized on the idea that young people should be free to indulge their imagination and enjoy life (rather than living to fulfill their parent's dreams.) Where I got a bit lost in the film was in the ways it blended fantasy into reality. I understood what they were doing, but for whatever reason I tend to prefer films to clearly define where the magic begins and where it ends. My brain gets wrapped up in trying to decide if we should be worried about a child travelling to different planets alone, or if that's not even happening in the first place.

You know, like how The Princess Bride movie was narrated. Though it was shown in bit and pieces, they did just that and more. A lot of the people I know who read the book and watched this movie were very disappointed. They actually hated it, thinking it was too far off and saying it isn't The Little Prince. But, to me, it was. A story is not only about the story, it's also about the impact, the emotions, the lessons and everything else that revolves around it. I get that it didn't tell the story, but it showed everything else beyond that. The ending of the story of The Little Prince will be the most annoying thing, if you read the book and expected it to be like the book. Let me tell you one thing -- I think it was the girl's choice of ending. She didn't like the ending of The Little Prince, so she gave it her own twist. And through that, you can see how much she's changed. She's exploring her mind, her imagination, letting it run wild, allowing herself to be young. Her former self didn't do this. Everything was fixed for her, scripted and dull. Because of the old man and The Little Prince, she changed. I believe a person who watches this with an open mind will love it just as much as I do. But if you're one of those people who judges a movie because you have the book glued inside your head and it's taking up all the space, not allowing the movie to wiggle in, then I suggest don't give this a shot.",

The stop motion animation is beautiful and simple, wonderfully evocative of the original illustrations. It's presented plainly and allows the moments to stand and simply display their power. However this is probably about 15% of the movie, and the rest of it is so pleased with itself it made me sick.I don't inherently have a problem with alternations or even adding material to an original work. However what they've done here with the framing story is purely masturbatory in nature. The novella \"The Little Prince\" is a poetic and metaphorical tale about love, life, death, and even faith and belief. The movie \"The Little Prince\" is about how brilliant the story of the Little Prince is. I'm not even being a jerk about it, that is literally the plot of the film.A young girl living an overly regimented life in a caricature world that feels like a child friendly version of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, encounters an eccentric old man who tells her the story of the Little Prince. And then it's about how that story affected her and changed her life. This movie is so insanely proud of itself that after it had burned through all the actual plot of the novella, probably less than an hour in, the remaining 40 minutes just drained away any goodwill the thing had from me with every passing second.The only thing that keeps this from being as appalling an adaptation as say the animated Lorax film, is that at least the makers of this one seem to actually understand the message of the original work. However they're so delighted with themselves for understanding it that they won't stop banging on about it, literalizing every metaphor from the original work in a bizarre attempt to show how well they get it. And they do get it, but the prolonged pat on the back the film gives itself made it insufferable for me.",

            "content": "The Little Prince is a modestly budgeted animated feature based on the Antoine de Saint-Exupery book of the same name. In it, a Little Girl (Foy) is told the story of a lonely Prince who once lived on a faraway asteroid covered in baobab sprouts. He leaves the comfort of his asteroid after a falling out between his lone, vain friend, a Rose (Cotillard). When he arrives on Earth, the Prince plops himself in the Sahara desert where he tames a fox and meets our narrator, a kind-hearted Aviator (Bridges). As the Aviator continues his story, the enraptured Little Girl ignores her chores and summer homework, which is assigned by her Mother (McAdams). She continues to visit the Aviator, a neighbor and local pariah who swears not only is the story true, but when his plane is fixed, he'll resume his search for the Prince.The original book is a poetic children's story whose somber tones, feelings of isolation and layers of humanism has crossed the generations to be a must read. It's a short book yet it's ambiguity lends itself to being appreciated and mulled over like first course charcuterie before your middle school English teacher brings out Tim O'Brien's \"The Things They Carried\". It's accredited for having some astute observations on human behavior. It highlights various various human faults: vanity, greed, selfishness etc. through the point-of- view of an innocent child while keeping the language whimsical and the watercolor illustrations near-universal in their simplistic grace.The Little Prince movie takes a bold risk adding another layer; a story within a story, using the Little Girl's narrative arc as a framing device. Through the eyes of the Little Girl we enter a world resembling the soulless mis en scene of Mon Oncle's (1958) modern living scenes with the frantic banality of Brazil (1985). It's a sight to behold and one can't help but be taken in by the sumptuous tactile animation even if it's meant to be occasionally grotesque. The get-up-and-go attitude of the Mother only adds to the feeling of imposing isolation, one that's motivated largely by the trappings of modern life; a life that the Little Girl and the Prince seems poised to join.Yet the matryoshka doll of a plot is also the film's Achilles heal. By framing the story just so, we get a feeling of place and time, which is to say modern. Thus we get a feeling for the ominous force pulling all the strings, making our protagonists oh so unhappy (it's the man, man!). Taking the ambiguity out of the original story and making such a strong if popular statement on contemporary wage economy problems robs an audience of their interaction with the story. It also guarantees that the film will have a shorter shelf- life while alienating those who never had to deal with eccentric neighbors, only-child isolationism and helicopter parenting.Of course as a children's movie, subtlety is not the highest of priorities and despite a third act that falls apart like the stitching of a buttoned-eyed fox, there's so much to redeem this film. It's got a gentle sense of humor, fun characters and some very solid voice- acting by Jeff Bridges, Rachel McAdams, Ricky Gervais and Paul Rudd who plays the older more world-weary Prince. Director Mark Osborne of Kung Fu Panda (2008) fame makes it clear The Little Prince is not a product, it's a delicately and lovingly assembled piece of art meant to be enjoyed by all ages. Catch it on Netflix Streaming while you can.",

Naturally, the girl connects with their eccentric, ostracized neighbour: a former pilot who tells her stories of the title character, taken from the novella by Antoine de St-Expury. This review is for the film's English-language version.The greatest delights in this film are the ways it mocks our modern world. It begins by focusing on a child whose childhood is being ripped away and compares her to an elderly man who refused to let his childhood spirit die. They are surrounded by drone people living in cloned modern homes. Brief scenes mocking office clones and uppity schools are a joy.With so much going for the film, there's almost a feeling of anti-climax by the end. There is certainly nothing wrong with it but the main story has less bite than the occasional satire that rightly criticizes the worst of modern times. But the overall message is worth it: despite the insane demands of our modern world, we can get through it if we stay connected to our childhood spirit and imagination.",

A girl living in the present age reads a book and the story progresses. The girl's mother sets daily small tasks and commands her daughter to follow them faithfully. I was overwhelmed when I saw that huge amount of tasks. This is how modern children live. It is drawn in contrast to the concept that the Little Prince wants to convey. This movie differs from the original progression of the book. Since the original of the book is a wonderful masterpiece, I felt a little uncomfortable at first. The girl was overly self-conscious and told the old man that she wasted the whole summer because she was listening to a useless story about The Little Prince. The French insert song was also weird.

When said Little Girl meets her quirky neighbor dubbed \"The Aviator\", and becomes a fascinated audience to his stories about The Little Prince, she is introduced to the importance of having dreams, passions, imagination, and seeking thrill and love. It is then through the blossoming relationship of our two protagonists (& the creative journey within), that the film's positive messages of retaining one's childish enthusiasm, simply shines.Visually, The Little Prince is also, a spectacle. The animation is imaginative as the film does a great job of creating a fantasy world, within a fantasy world, through stop motion that is seamlessly woven into computer animation.

If you search up the name \"Little Prince\" on IMDb you are going to find over 50 different adaptations of the title. In 2015 alone, there were 3 different \"Little Prince\" movies. But the question is how does this one hold up. I will say the Little Prince part of the story is handed very well. It is very creatively done and very well animated. Sadly St. Exupery's story gets less screen time than the other more boring story that is in this movie.Yes \"the Little Prince\" in this adaptation spends most of its time as a story within a story. The main story, what the movie spends most of its time on, is about that framing. Think of it like \"The Princess Bride\" if the story of sick Fred Savage listening to the story took up 70% of the runtime.That framing story is about a determined little girl and her overbearing mother. The mother really wants the girl to get into this illustrious private school, study hard and have a successful life. The mother is overworked and doesn't have the time to spend with her daughter. The girl soon realizes that she wants more than just studying, she wants to play, explore and do other kids stuff before growing up. Will she learn the value of hard work and study, or will she learn the importance of \"being a kid\"? It's all pretty basic kids movie, parents don't spend enough time with the kids, kids need to enjoy being kids type of stuff.The daughter makes unexpected friend in the elderly neighbor, \"the aviator\", and it is through his story-telling that we get \"the Little Prince\" part of the movie. Jeff Bridges does a great job in the role, he has a great wise albeit somewhat senile old man voice. The girl is also great, it is when the other celebrities jump in that the voice cast falls a bit flat.When the movie shifts animation styles and gets to the Little Prince portion of the story, it is great. It is creative, beautiful and thought-provoking. And the music just lifts everything to a higher level. It is just a shame that we have to sit through so much standard kids' movie junk to get there. Not that the kids' movie section is all that bad, it's just dull and unoriginal.It must be proof that I have forgotten my own Little Prince of life because I find the friendship between old man Bridges and 8 year-old gold more problematic than charming. And I find myself siding with the mom, the girl needs to study and prepare for the future.When the movie is good, it is really good, sadly the bad outweighs the good in this instance. I was just hoping that the Little Prince would have been a Bigger part of this story.",

Clearly, every avid reader of the book will truly admire the visual transition of Saint-Exupery's illustrations to impressive 3D paper-like images. Every detail is loyal to the iconic handcraft of the book. Though the images perfectly match its source material, its narrative jaggedly slides through the remainder of the running time. Its succession so far comes from being faithful to the story about the Little Prince. Its timeless story sweeps with fancy, even when its ambiguity gets drained by the B-plot, involving the little girl. Her character, voiced brilliantly by Mackenzie Foy, makes a remarkable innocence of a child empathetic. However, her Mary Sue presence is a tired clich\u00e9 that substitutes Saint-Exupery's ambiguity with a predictable story. One may forgive her presence, especially when she goes through a shifty (and debatable) third act where admirers might be tested. Though young readers will find it understandable.

            "content": "Have you ever heard of the animated film \"Ernest & Celestine\"? You probably haven't and that's because it didn't receive a wide release. The film was made in France, starred the fine\u00a0young actress Mackenzie Foy along with Forrest Whitaker, and focused on the friendship between a mouse named Celestine and a bear named Ernest. I loved the film from beginning to end and it was certainly a sweet animated movie. The reason I say this is because \"The Little Prince\" is another animated movie that is pretty similar. It was\u00a0made in France, also starred Mackenzie Foy, focused on a friendship, and didn't get a wide release with the film being released on Netflix in the United States. When I saw that the film was selected for completion at the Cannes Film Festival in 2015\u00a0and critics praising the film calling it a beautiful masterpiece, I got interested. I watched the movie after the film was released to Netflix and I'm sad to say\u00a0that I didn't really enjoy the movie because\u00a0I couldn't get into this film. \u00a0I'll try to explain why because honestly it was really hard to follow this film.The film focuses\u00a0on a young girl played by Mackenzie Foy. Her mother (Rachel McAdams) is trying to get her into this big academy and decides to prep\u00a0her throughout the entire summer with a giant schedule telling her to read the schoolbooks and doing complex work. However, an old aviator (Jeff Bridges) gets her distracted and tells her stories about a young boy called The Little Prince (Riley Osborne) and how the aviator met him after crash landing\u00a0in the Sahara Dessert\u00a0. The girl then skips doing her daily assignments and goes to the old aviator every day and continues listening to the story about the Little Prince, not telling her mother.From what I just said, it doesn't sound bad at all, but trust me when I say\u00a0the story is definitely the worst part about this movie. \u00a0Having never read the book it was based only by\u00a0Antoine de Saint- Exup\u00e9ry, I judged the film on it's own and honestly it started\u00a0off decently, but then I got confused with the sections about The Little Prince and then about a third\u00a0though the movie, I was totally lost. The movie just went spiraling out of control with\u00a0no focus whatsoever and when the film ended I was left so baffled and confused. The characters didn't really leave much of an impact on me either. They're a couple of reasons for this. One is that they have no names. I mean none whatsoever. The movie just credits them as \"The Aviator\", \"The Mother\", or \"The Little Girl\" and that did get me a little frustrated because I find it\u00a0lazy when a movie doesn't give characters names. The second problem with them is that, I didn't feel they had a clear personality. I mean, some I could understand like The Mother and The Little Girl, but characters like The Aviator and especially The Little Prince had very little to no personalities. As for the animation, I'm pretty split about. The stop motion elements of the movie\u00a0I think are beautiful. It may not be as good as \"Kubo and the Two Strings\", but I thought it was pretty well done.\u00a0They have a paper like feel to them and I definitely\u00a0could see the craft in them. The computer animation parts, however, seemed amateur to me. I felt like they were done by an animation student\u00a0and not by\u00a0professionals which is a problem when you get down to it. I also really hated the cinematography in the film. Most of the shots were straight and didn't have tilts or were shot in different angles, they were just straight and that kind of became irritating \u00a0after a while. Now I will give the movie credit on this though. The voice acting is outstanding. I thought the characters were well casted and performed and they definitely brought something to the characters, but not a lot.\"The Little Prince\" was just a confused mess. I could see something trying to get out of this film, but the story was just to confusing for me to grasp. I really was not impressed, which is a shame as I could see that this\u00a0film really did try. However, I thought this film was trying to be a nice and sweet animated movie and it failed to accomplish. If you want much better\u00a0animated movies that are nice and sweet, might I suggest watching the aforementioned\"Ernest & Celestine\" or even the director's previous work \"Kung Fu Panda\". Those movies had much more joy and balance than this film ever did, and besides they both got Oscar nominations anyway.",

            "content": "The filmakers made one key mistake here: the choice of title. This film is rooted in the classic children's book The Little Prince, but it is not a film adaptation of that story. Rather, it is a meta story that centers around the character of the Aviator from that tale, who may also be (in actuality or else merely subtext) the author of the book itself. There's nothing at all wrong with that model-in fact, it's a very engaging treatment of a work that has taken such a larger place in the collective consciousness of the world we grew up in and live in now. It does, however, invite an unwarranted comparison and unmeetable expectations for both critics and audiences.As can be seen by the quickest of glances through the reviews, the debate that this creates is both entirely unwinnable and fundamentally flawed. It's a shame, because if the negative reviewers had gone into this film knowing it was ABOUT the book, and the relevance and impact of the book and it's messages to us as human beings trying to find meaning in our lives in our modern world, then they may have not had such an instinctive and negative reaction. There'd be no need. It's a film celebrating a treasured classic, not attempting to change or retell or even repackage it. I, personally, hadn't read the book, so I had no such expectations or reactions. But, I was legitimately confused as to whether the original book itself was so meta, circling around the characters and how they are changed by a fictional book within the book that we never really read in its entirety. It wasn't until I did some perusing of reviews that I learned the film was a meta treatment based around the book, but that the book itself was a more straightforward fantasy story. I supposed that's about as bad as if \"Christopher Robin\" or \"Goodbye Cristopher Robin\" had been titled \"Winnie the Pooh\".Setting aside the confusing if not outright misleading choice of title, however, what we are left with is a beautifully-animated film with a lot of depth and emotion that is nothing but respectful, no... reverant, of the book. There's nothing here to feel badly about. It uses the book and its fantastical story as a focal point of introspection on the role that a childlike sense of wonder and innocense play in making us human, even into adulthood. It looks at the now-cliched contrast between the oppression and sterility of adult life in the modern world with the necessity for finding inspiration, awe, and beauty in the world around us-something we all seem to have instinctively as children, but sometimes risk forgetting as we age. But there's nothing trite here, despite the fact that it's been done before (Finding Neverland comes to mind, though a very different type of film, the underlying emotional themes about the innocence of childhood). There's a stark authenticity here that makes this film memorable and effective in conveying its core message and, for me, I came away feeling very touched and grateful for the experience. There's not much more one could expect or hope for, unless they had been expecting something else very specific, in which case they might rightly feel misled. But it still shouldn't take away from the merit of the material itself.",

            "review_title": "An interesting take on the classic tale",
            "content": "The Little Prince is an adaption of the classic children's tale, with a modern twist. The film follows a young girl who lives with her single mother. The pair are highly regimented, and trying hard to get the young girl into a prestigious private school. To do so, a strict regiment of studying is required, which books her entire summer. She has no issue with this, until the kooky old man next door fires a propeller through her back wall, and changes the young girls life. He introduces her to his story of a young prince and his travels (loosely, the Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry tale), and she begins to flounder on her studies, and opens her imagination up to the wondrous tales of adventure offered, and begins to wonder if they are really real.This is a well told story with an interesting twist to it. The Little Prince is a classic tale, and one which has sparked the imaginations of children the world over (and did so for me as well). Making a film out of such a tale can be daunting. How to adapt it to modern audiences? How to get studio backing for the project? Should it be a faithful adaption, or should there be changes? This version of the story is well told, and revolves quite a bit around the meta-story more so than the actual Little Prince tale. It takes place after the events of the story. The Aviatar is an old man, the Little Prince grown up, the stars have changed. This is more a tale of unlocking the power of imagination, and remembering the childhood we all once had, and the amazing and creative things we did back then.The film is animated in two styles. The first, is the main story, and features a more \"realistic\" style animation akin to a modern Disney film. The second is a paper-mache style animation done for the retelling of the Little Prince. Both suit the story well, although I personally preferred the more magical and innovative animation style done for the Little Prince sections of the film, over the more realistic style.Story-wise, I was left feeling lukewarm. The innovative story was interesting and fun, and sure to be appealing to kids and watchable for adults. I particularly enjoyed the interesting fantasy elements, which felt pure and innocent. The story of the young girl fit well enough into the framework of the Little Prince, as she journey's to find out what has happened since the story ended. Even so, some bits of the story felt highly manufactured. It is disappointing in some respects that the filmmakers did not give more story time and credit to the original work, and sacrificed much to a bog-standard version of childhood innocence. The Little Prince itself would have made a fantastic film (or even television series), and it feels wasteful to give it so little screen time in relation to the story of the girl and her mother, and how they don't understand each other, and how the mother forgot her childhood and so on. I unfortunately found myself constantly feeling disappointed at the films storytelling, and although it was not awful or even bad, it did not due the old story justice, and does not hold enough magic itself to create a new tale for the ages. It just felt mediocre.The target audience for the film also felt muddled. The film will surely be too childish for fans of the source work (those coming at it from a nostalgic lens). The story was also too grey and serious in some places for younger kids. The world the young girl inhibits is grey and corporate. Her life is regimented by schedules, the stars are gone, and she has no time for fun and games. Much of the movie's run time takes place in this space, and it may turn out to be to dull children.The voice acting in the film also felt a tad wooden. Jeff Bridges as the Aviator was a good choice on paper. He has a distinctive voice, and has played wonderful roles in many of his recent films. Even so, he felt too wooden. The voice acting felt like an Anime English dub, with little emotion or backing from him. Mackenzie Foy, as the young girl, was much more interesting in most place, but still suffered some of the same restrictions Bridges did, with wooden tones and such.As can be seen, this was a mixed bag for me to watch. It will be a disappointment for those who really enjoy the source work, and children may find it to grey and dull. The voice acting was wooden as well, and fell flat throughout the film. Even so, the interesting dual animation styles, the nods to the source work, and the cool fantasy elements to the film make it a more enjoyable watch than not. It is worth a shot for those with kids, and adults may get some good laughs and heartfelt moments out of it. All in all, a fairly enjoyable film with some unfortunate flaws, but still an interesting modern take on a classic children's tale. 6/10",

            "content": "It's impressive when you can really like a movie, and still scratch your head as to its meanings.THE LITTLE PRINCE is so overwhelming with messages and subtext that I can completely relate to, images that bring up the absentee father who consistently gives gifts that placate his responsibility while alienating his child. Images of a cut-and-paste world in which all of the houses are little square blocks that look exactly the same and have no color. Entrance exams that are more like trials than they are tests of excellence. These themes run throughout the movie, and they are wonderful in the way they play with the mind.On the other hand, there is almost no cohesive narrative here. The worlds mentioned do not get definition, as to their place be it metaphorical or otherwise. We are left to decide these things for ourselves, and sometimes there is too much mystery to hold the story together.Like riding the edge of the track in SPEED RACER, the car NEARLY goes over the edge, but never does. In that respect, it is why the movie has such a high rating and such a powerful impact. But the questions that we have after watching it are left unanswered\u0085 And in a case like this, there are just too many of them.The acting is spot-on, everyone gives their all to make the characters come alive. The animation is top-notch, swimming us along into its strange sequences and doing so with so much vigor that we can't help but enjoy ourselves, with the quiet, questioning voice in the back of our heads just a distant sound as we move along.There are only minor criticisms I have. One of them is that of the crossing between realities. Did she just knock herself out, and dream the whole third act? Certainly the suddenly talking, moving fox suggests that. But the plane WAS real, so\u0085 The part with the rose also threw me\u0085 The rose's death left me feeling helpless, instead of hopeful. Like a kid being told that his mother will always be with him, there's still a part of you that knows you'll never really see her again. Despite all of the nice things that people say, and the sweetness of the connection you have to the memories you've made. The loss is still there, and it's something you'll carry with you forever.Perhaps that reinforces the point, reinforced by the sudden change from stop-motion animation to full-out CGI for the Little Prince at the end of the film.Overall, I highly enjoyed the film, and would watch it again despite its questions. Maybe, after enough watches, an older version of me will finally be able to put the pieces together. Until then, it's enough to enjoy all of its other pluses, because there truly is a lot of them.",

The movie version is selling little girls a world where they get what they want with moxie, inexperience and a little magic, just like the Disney princesses do. None of this has anything to do with the story of The Little Prince, which was artlessly appended to this Disney ripoff.The book, The Little Prince is not a children's book. It is philosophic and traumatic, neither of which should be applied to children. Although it artfully depicts death as a spirit leaving a body, it does not pretend to be a book on theology. When we see someone die, we know that the spirit is gone. Where the spirit goes is theological in nature, and the book covers this only in passing. In the book, we are free to assume that the Little Prince is back on his little asteroid with his Beloved, staying busy and enjoying eternity. The next morning the body of the Little Prince was gone; does this remind you of anyone special? The book makes no claim to be a reinterpretation of the Passion, but it is a useful reference for anyone who has to explain death to a child. We all die. We all leave our body and go to meet our Beloved. We who love Logos will remain alive. One day we will be given our eternal body and we won't have to wander any more.The book The Little Prince allegorizes the beauty and errors of the universe with humor and wry philosophical ponderings. The movie eviscerates the Little Prince and twists his guts into a million Disney rebellions. Did I mention it was a travesty of the book? There oughta be a law.",

Overall, I was not that impressed by the film. It does stand out against all the unimpressive cartoons that I have seen, but yet again, it does not stand against Pixar's or even Disney's masterpieces, and in my opinion is more of a B-quality movie than an A.

It just got a bit weird so abruptly that I didn't have enough time to prepare myself. That aside, I ALMOST CRIED.I say almost, even though there formed actual tears in my eyes, because I didn't sob uncontrollably. I guess I just expected it to be a whole lot sadder. Keeping in mind though that this is a children's movie, okay. It's okay. Not the greatest book-to-movie adaptation, but it's not worth hate. The insertion of additional characters was a brilliant move.The old man (I don't even know his name!) was a perfect character. He developed well as the story went. The only thing that devastates me is that I KNOW he's going to die soon after the end of the movie. But maybe that's why some believe that nothing happens after a story ends, so it will hurt less.Filed under: Movies to watch when you're losing sight of what's important.",

Since Caroline, this is the first time I also paid attention to the story and not just the animation. It was just as superb.Little Prince storyline is full of symbolism, I think. It makes you think about life, how you live and what you chose to be. It's quite inspiring, I must say. I originally thought the kid was just a projection from the aviator.

Its a story of the the little prince traveling around the little planets. Its a good bed time story for the kids and kind animated movie for the elder kids.

            "content": "This movie is positively brimming with heart, warmth, and emotional moments, all layered over some pretty deep, thought-provoking concepts.It's rare to find a movie that can make your eyes glisten (from both sadness & joy at different points), but also inspire some good, deep conversations afterward from its rather big & adult themes.We had some great conversations after the film about what it means to grow up, about our societal views on work & play, and ultimately about how we define our own (and others') worth. There aren't much bigger themes than that, and the fact that the Little Prince deals with them all in such a charming, engaging, colorful way is a real treat.Kids will love the cute animation, the fox & the old man, the music, sure... but this is a movie made to delight & to challenge adults. Meaning its not just tolerable or \"enjoyable enough\" for all ages like a basic Pixar movie, its actually MADE for all ages.The film expertly intertwines the 4 main characters (all at different stages of life) to accomplish this. The Prince representing the naivety of youth & how that changes over time. The little girl representing the \"coming of age\" period, struggling with what it means to grow up or be more mature as she prepares to deal with a very adult life. The mother representing the challenges of parenting, of a busy work life, and of dealing with loss. And finally the old man in his twilight years, struggling with his relevancy; his ability to stay independent and do the things he loves; and trying to understand the context or worth of his past stories and lessons.The concepts are great, the characters are great, the voice acting behind them is top notch too. The music is stellar, and the animation isnt just great, its 2 kinds of great (2 separate styles used for different parts of the story, both captivating).The story is absolutely wonderful, full of surprises, twists, heart-wrenching moments and genuine laughs.To those complaining about connections with the book, I think you're missing 2 things:1st, this was never meant to be a retelling of the book or a reimagining of it, its clearly a new story, but built around the telling/reading of the book. Its not a remake, a reboot or a reimagining.2nd, in many ways this new story is meant to be for readers of the book, as a followup of sorts. The little girl represents us as readers of the book, struggling to connect with its message or believe in its relevancy in the modern world. The later parts of the movie with the Prince shows this as well, that often those who even give the messages of hope can lose sight of that message themselves.Its only in the connection between the two that the message of hope can survive or thrive in our modern world. Its takes the strength or courage of our current selves (represented by the girl), combined with accepting & embracing the hope of our youth (the Prince), to overcome the challenges of today & find that peace & joy.Its a beautiful, layered story that will sit with you long after you watch it, in a good way.I watch a lot of movies & review a ton (not on IMDB, but have a database of about 1000 I've watched & reviewed), & this was 1 of only about 25 true 10s that I have ever seen.",

I cried at all the right places, and thought that the modern framework they built to have the aviator recount his story was well done... it reminds us that the call to childhood of St-Ex is universal. \n\nSo then I discovered when the story ended that there were still some 40 minutes left to go... but why should this be?  And here is where everything went off the rails for my enjoyment: the little girl takes off into space to find that the business man has become some great existential threat consuming the galaxy.  The screenwriters apparently thought that this would be a good addition to the narrative, perhaps because they had no respect for Antoine's works.  In the world of St Ex, the beureaucrat is not someone to be feared.  Rather the \"adults\" of the narrative are prisoners themselves, trapped by false idols of \"adulthood\" that make their lives ultimately hollow and unfulfilling.  In the world of St Ex, the businessman is not to be feared, but rather to be pitied... he could have been mozart, but instead huddles over his account statements worried about numbers on a piece of paper.  \n\nMake no mistake, Tonio did see a threat of the commercial nature of the world, but it was not a fear of the businessman, but rather a fear of the thing that made the businessman what he was in the first place.  The desire to be seen as serious, the materialism of consumers, the growing banality of choices that people are left making, and so on.  The directors lose this in their anti-capitalist, anti-corporation messaging because they embody the threat of a hollow life in an external being.  That's the failure, because the threat of shallow adulthood isn't from discreet entities: it is universal and it comes for us all.  \n\nThe screenwriters believed they could add their brand of modern view to St Ex's work, and in the attempt managed to tear down the very message and warning that the book gives to us.  Watch the movie, but the second you start to wonder why it hasn't ended, turn it off.",

It's undeniably charming, touching, and with excellent characters. The real problem of The Little Prince 2015 version is the story outside The Little Prince's universe. I know that the falsely perfect atmosphere and the little girl and his mother without personality are purposeful things, but they're constantly removing me from that joyful atmosphere which I was always hoping to return. The aviator was a character who I learned to like throughout the movie, he started a little creepy but ended in a way as charming and touching as the story he was telling to the little girl. The third act is the best part, despite also being problematic. It starts thrilling, funny, and with excellent references to some characters from The Little Prince. But there's a new character (who was a brilliant idea) who makes that act return to the boring rhythm of the rest of the movie. At least, it ends well.",

Appealing to both children and adults, it is a wonderous animation, with a stylisation that really shows you how much the creative team loved the book this is based on. Not going to lie, it had me puzzled a few times, but the wonderment and awe always ease you into its next 'passage'.

I hate the way these people live their lives, so systematic like robots. That little world that she stumbles across when flying the airplane was so well done. I love how she comes in contact with the characters from the Little Prince story but in the \"real world\". Like the conceited man, played by Ricky Gervais, the king in the elevator and the business man. Crushing stars in order to make energy for your dystopian society. What a crazy concept. \n\nThat whole scene of the freeing of the stars from the giant glass dome and the plane flying up into the cosmos with them was so beautiful. I actually cried lol. Part of life is being able to say goodbye but also knowing that the person will always be a part of your life as well even after death. \n\nBeautifully animated. I love the paper textured art. This movie shows us that it's things like greed, vanity, jealousy and pride that turn people into soulless and unimaginative adults. Never lose your sense of wonder and imagination, what it means to feel like a kid. So funny how it's the old man showing her how to feel like a kid again, what it feels like to live. The music was fantastic! It actually made me tear up during some moments because how beautifully it complemented the scene. \n\nReally heartfelt movie that hits deep in its messages about growing up and becoming an adult. Also clever and smart in its writing and storytelling. Fairly deep and sentimental for a kids movie, and I love that. Kids need to be challenged that way. I thought this was a fantastically beautiful tale and I would recommend it to anyone. Definitely something I would want to show my kids. I will be watching this one again.",

            "content": "I haven't read the book this film takes it's inspiration from, but from what I could basically gather the stop-motion sequences are fairly accurate to the original story, but the framing device with the CGI little girl and old man are entirely new.  The stop-motion sequences are all great.  First of all, they look beautiful, and have an eerie hypnotic quality to them.  Their storytelling is kind of in the form of fables, and highly symbolic, but the messages are timeless.  The framing device for the most part works well.  I take slight issue with it because it does work towards grounding a lot of the fables in a concrete world, and I don't know if that's really necessary.  I think kids are smarter than we give them credit for, and we don't need to put it in a world they relate to completely to make the story work.  That being said, it's a longer story now, and since they are doing it this way they do at least do it well.  The parallels work, and they never make it too modern.  It's very clearly in a world more resembling ours than the magical realism of The Little Prince's world, but there's no forced pop culture references or overly wacky comedy a la a bad Dr. Seuss film.  The climax is where I do start to take a bit of issue though.  For one, I thought the film went a little too long.  It's not even that long, but it doesn't need to be, and at the point when I was ready for it to start wrapping up I realized there was 40 minutes left because it had to take a really weird detour that doesn't totally work.  But even the parts that don't work too well aren't that bad, they're just not as good as the rest.  Because the rest of it is so good.  The stories of the Little Prince are all beautiful, and the framing device of the old man and girl and their strange friendship is genuinely touching.  It's a great film, not perfect, but still great.  It has a strong message of holding onto childhood that did get to me a little bit, and there's plenty of other sparks of truth sprinkled throughout that will be effective for kids and adults.",

I honestly can't imagine the movie with other actors in place.\n\nMy big problem with this one is that this is actually the 3rd part of a 3 part story that just happens to reference back to the first parts in a attempt to faux multi thread and drip feed information.  Don't get me wrong, it does build a certain amount of intrigue, but it's one of the problems with \"The Lorax\", the audience is installed, just give us the story, you don't have to break it up.\n\nMy other problem is that my biggest problem isn't enough to keep me complaining.

The Little Prince has become one of my favorite movies to date. And even though there are some things in the movie that dont necessarily match with the book, the film was nonetheless inspiring, moving, and magical. Through its use of beautiful imagery, nostalgic and taught lessons, the director of The Little Prince, was able to successfully portray a story and bring it to life for people of all ages to enjoy.  \nThis film not only reminded me of what it was like to be a child but also what I missed about being a little kid. It reminded me of the ways in which I used to play, jump, run, and dance around all day without caring what other people were doing or thinking.The movie reminded me of the carefree and happy thoughts and actions I used to carry out, because of the fact that as a kid, I had no worries in the world. Life was overall great when I was young, and this movie brought back so many of those memories I made when I was a toddler. \n\tMark Osborne did an excellent job of captivating scenes that were both beautiful and deep. The movie obviously used many pictures from the book but it did it in such a successful way that it appeared as if the book itself had come to life. The characters personality seemed to flow from the book as the colorful images captured the essence of the story and immersed the viewer in a world full of magic and adventure. For example, in the scene where The Little Prince and the little girl find the wilted rose on his home planet after releasing and freeing the stars, the darkness and dullness that surrounds them on planet B612, depicts the lonely, cold, melancholy, and dead feeling that engulfed the rose and planet when The Little Prince left. When the rose came back to life, the bright oranges, pinks, and red tones in the scene and background demonstrated the warmth and life returning to The Little Princes rose. \n\tNot only did I enjoy this film because of its beautiful scenes, but also because of the important lessons viewers of all ages learned as the scenes progressed. The idea of growing up is one the strongest themes that is presented throughout the novel and the film. The little girl, who is convinced her whole life can be planned out like a map, has a maturity older than most kids her age. She feels like she has to act like a grown-up because everyone else around wants that for her, even her own mother. And this was not just for her but for every child in the movie. Being childish is frowned upon, but throughout her journey in the story, the little girl is able to find and truly discover what a childs life should be like. \n\tOverall it was a great movie, and its one of the few movies I dont get tired of watching over and over again. Yes, there were many factors left out from the book, but it did not take away from the story and the beautiful images and scenes that made this movie a wonderful one to watch.",

Paul Rudd (Mr. Prince), Mackenzie Foy (Little Girl), Jeff Bridges (Aviator), James Franco (Fox), Benicio del Toro (Snake), Marion Cottiliard (Rose), Rachel McAdams (Mother), and many others are all great here. The film works as a strong adaptation of the source material, staying true and still doing enough to be unique. It's a touching story that has plenty of emotion packed into it. What truly makes this stand out is the animation. There are several different types used throughout and all are beautifully done. It's truly stunning.\n\nWeaknesses: The second half or so of the movie feels kind of disjointed. The plotlines are separated from the real world and that of the story being told, but it still could've been meshed together better. The parallels of the Little Girl's projected all work/no play life and the world the Little Prince grows up in make sense, but are super on the nose and that makes it feel a bit cheesy. Some characters come off as clich\u00e9 and unlikable (Mother) or kind of creepy (Aviator) even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nOverall: Thanks to the combination of a heartfelt theme, a wonderful voice cast, and fantastic animation, the Little Prince overcomes some issues to provide you with a highly enjoyable viewing.",

            "content": "- Once upon a time, there was A Little Prince -\n\nIt's hard for me when I remember I'm a grown up now.\n\nI vote, pay bills, and file taxes. I plan meals, grocery shop, and cook. When I move to a new place, I have to find a new doctor and dentist by myself (no matter how much I protest). I have to do these things to survive, so I learn them and accept them without too much fuss. But I have always been a little afraid of being \"a grown up.\" Of forgetting what it feels like to be a child.\n\nThankfully, there are stories like The Little Prince.\n\n\"Once upon a time, there was a little Prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely bigger than himself, and who had need of a friend.\"\n\nThese words are familiar to many of us who grew up reading Le Petit Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, either the French original or one of the over 250 translations published around the world. Since 1943, its whimsical illustrations and deeply profound words have influenced kids and grown ups all over the world. And finally we have a modern major motion picture celebrating its legacy.\n\nIn this new version, we first meet a super-smart little girl (Mackenzie Foy, Interstellar) whose straight-laced mother (Rachel McAdams, Spotlight, Midnight in Paris) lives and breathes to create success in her daughter's life. I'm talking, class A helicopter parent-magnified by a total absence of Dad, who apparently just sends an obligatory snow globe every year on his daughter's birthday.\n\nWe're then introduced to an eccentric, elderly aviator (Jeff Bridges, The Giver, True Grit) next door who bursts into their life (quite literally) and introduces the little girl to his memories of a little Prince-a child, like herself, in need of a friend.\n\nAs the story goes on, the lines between reality and imagination blur. Friendship grows and arguments explode and the girl lets go of her mother's expectations to pursue something greater-though she isn't sure what. Buzzing in her head remains the the little yellow-haired, scarf-wearing Prince. Is he still out there, somewhere? Is he still a child and full of the wisdom that only children possess?\n\nThe film does a fine job of weaving in some of the most memorable, poignant moments from the original novella.\n\nLike the Rose, who shows me that love can transform the most commonplace of creatures into something truly unique.\n\nLike the Prince, who reminds me that love lives forever in my heart and memory, no matter what changes, ages, or dies.\n\nLike the Aviator, who shows me that growing up is not the problem: forgetting is.\n\nThe Little Prince is a beautiful blend of a classic story and a new, compelling one. The animation is absolutely arresting, full of light, shadows, and the aura of wonder. It's the sort of movie where stars hang from threads, and you can almost hear them laughing.\n\nI think what makes it most compelling, as its own story and as an adaptation, is the honesty with which it tackles both childhood and adulthood. Being an adult is not the perfect state, but neither is being a child. (We can't help which we are, after all.) But we begin to drift apart, we begin to lose each other, when we forget to be awestruck. When we put tasks and lists and self-interest above sacrifice, friendship, and vulnerability.\n\n\"It is only with heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.\"\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/the-little-prince, and was written Debbie Holloway.

It's a wonderful adaptation by director Mark Osbourne to the French novel 'Le Petit Prince' by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\nIf you're an adult with years of working experience, then you can appreciate the messages conveyed in this film. The 3 different film effects differentiate the stories within the story and are all expressive and magnificent in its use of imagery. Some of the most memorable lessons are: remember to find joy in the simple things in life like we did as young children, common objects and people can become unique if you make it so, and not letting your own fears get in the way of your children's experiences. If you have made many sacrifices for wealth, have raised children, or have lost loved ones, this film can be very moving.",

The Little Prince smoothly combines CG with Claymation under great cinematic direction.

Another property presenting a thankless writerly task.\r The solution here is to gradually seque into a complete fantasy of the litle girl meeting the grown up Little Prince. This fills the time, allows for action in the third act and--very unusually for ANY script in the last ten years I'm ware of--creates space for moment of authentic poignancy, longing, loss and wonder.  That the third act is going to sacrifice logical consistency for stronger feelings than most plot-driven third acts allow, is foreshadowed and I think a risk taken boldly and done as well as can be imagined.\r I thought the character animation in the hospital visit scene went beyond Pixar.

It's already an instant classic, with a thought provoking, multi-layered story and some visually stunning animation.\r We start off the film in a CGI world where a Little Girl (Mackenzie Foy) has just moved houses so that she can be within correct district to attend a prestigious school. This is all part of her Mother's (Rachel McAdams) life plan to turn her in to \"a wonderful grown up\". This life plan includes planning out literally her entire life, giving her daughter clear instructions of what she should be doing down to every hour, including a summer break that includes nothing but revising from text books.\r But all this changes when her old, eccentric neighbour, The Aviator (Jeff Bridges) enters her life and begins to tell her the story of The Little Prince (Riley Osborne). Thus we are introduced to a stop motion animated world, telling a tale of how the Little Prince fell in love with a Rose (Marion Cotillard) and then travelled across the stars meeting many strange characters, including the Businessman who seeks to own ever star (Albert Brooks), the conceited man who believes all should admire him (Ricky Gervais) and the Fox (James Franco) who the Prince seeks to tame.\r Much is added to the original novella, but director Mark Osborne ensures that the film never strays too far from the original novellas tone or themes. Instead the messages of the novella, such as needing to explore in order to learn and grow as a person, are given an entire new layer through the girls interactions with the Aviator. On top of this every voice performance (which includes the directors own son playing the Little Prince) seems perfectly cast. This includes a great performance from Jeff Bridges who is able to balance both the eccentric and heartfelt side of the Aviator.\r Both of the animation styles complement each other very well. In the CGI world there's a lot of emphasis on the blandness of what growing up can be like with grey colours and the lack of any uniqueness or identity. The houses in the neighbourhood are so similar that the mother even drives past her own home since you can't tell them apart. In contrast the stop motion style is so full of life and colour. It's as if the pages are literally coming to life with the stop motion focusing on details like shadows and the crinkled paper look for each of the characters.\r The film does falter a little within its third act that favours trading out its focus on its characters and story, instead having the girl travelling on an exciting adventure across the stars to save the Little Prince. It never detracts from either the messages of the film or of the original book and it's still an entertaining third act. But it does depart from the rest of the films unique and subtle beauty, in favour of an action sequence that feels out of tone to the rest of the film. Although this is only a slight misstep as the films finale is emotional and leaves a deep impact that is bound to resonate with viewers of any age.",

It's been so long since I read the book this is based on, so admittedly I've forgotten most of what happens in it. Therefore, I can't really compare the two together in this review. However, with what little bits I saw in this film that I do remember from the book, it's all very imaginatively brought to life! Much of the animation was hand-drawn and it was certainly a visual and artistic treat to behold! As for the voice cast, each of the actors and their respective characters all felt appropriately paired. Lastly and most importantly, the film carried a heartwarming and universal message and theme that hit really close to home with me that touched my heart and had my eyes watering towards the end. Overall, this is an absolute must-see for everyone who has Netflix, as it's sadly only a Netflix original but truly deserves to be seen much wider! This may just be the best animated film I end up seeing all year, as I find it highly improbable that any other can come close to topping this one for me (yes I don't care how funny Sausage Party ends up being!)",

The movie has great animation, and adapts the book perfectly with some original characters that help to deliver this message. I found myself incredibly satisfied by the end of the story. That is to say, the end of the book. Then I realized there's still half an hour left. This is where the movie's plot completely and utterly derails. Without spoiling anything, this is where the movie strays from the source material, and while I would commend the writers for trying their own adaptation, this finale isn't just stupid, it isn't just pointless, it isn't just disconnected from the entire plot, but I actually found it offensive as a childhood fan of the book. Going slightly more in detail, which will require some spoiling, the boss (you know, that guy who got a single paragraph of dialogue in the book and a minute of screen time at this point?) becomes a last minute villain, and we see the prince as an adult who has left his childish ways behind. So basically, he becomes the direct opposite of everything he stood for, in the literal plot and in the message the movie tries to convey. I could go on, but I could sum up my and every other fan of the book's hatred for this finale in three words: the flower dies. I really don't think you can possibly screw up the message of any book ever written more than that single scene does. My suggestion is watch the first hour, because it's really good, a solid 8.5/10 for me. But whatever you do, that last half hour is to be avoided at all costs.",

Definitely not comparable to the HollywoodGrowing up is not the problem. Forgetting is.I usually love the French animations, because unlike American, the stories, musics, characters that influences the thousands of year cultural history. Definitely not comparable to the Hollywood standards, but it had its own technical brilliance. All I wondered was why this film was in English language.It deserves to be on the upcoming's big occasion (2016 February), if it is eligible for the American Academy Awards. From the director of 'Kung Fu Panda' original movie, which was partially based on the children's novel. The book adaptation is the stop-motion animation and the remaining story's the regular 3D animation.Just remember the movies like 'What Dreams May Come' and 'The Lovely Bones', those magical worlds and breathtaking landscapes. Usually animations are associated with comedy genre, especially when a child character attached to it. This film was not even a comedy, more like those two titles I mentioned.The screenplay wise it was a very 'Neverwas' type, except this one was an animation. But appropriate for people of all ages. The kids can realise the importance of their childhood and the older people can become kids again. The film compressed the gap and erected a bridge between the two hoods, the childhood and the adulthood.\"What is essential is invisible to the eye.\"I did not know what to expect from it, but I highly satisfied with the final product. The film characters had no names, but called, the Little Girl, Mother, Fox, Rose, Snake, King et cetera as what their role is and species. Barely there are only 3-4 characters where the story was focused. Obviously it had a villain, but very unusual existence time and in a crucial part of the story.I don't remember how the 100 minutes went so fast like a ray of the light beam flashed away. The pace of narration was not a rushy, except the opening part. But once the old man character, the Aviator, voiced by Jeff Bridge was introduced, the movie turned into completely different and awesome. Yes, Jeff Bridge's voice was so good for the background narration.This story is about an old man who refused to grow up mentally and believes the existence of the magical stars and planets. The whole neighborhood stayed away from him and his troubles, until a new girl arrives at the next door. The little girl befriends him and falls for all his stories discarding her daily routines, but later it complicates their relationship after her mother finds out what they're up to. What happens to them and how the story concludes is the remaining part.\"She was not a common rose.She was the only one of her kind in the whole universe.\"This story was finely fused between the reality and fantasy. Most essential storyline for the present world. In the name of education how the children were enforced by their parents to mechanical life with less time to play out and make their own friends. Especially as they were lacking the creativity to make up their own fictional worlds with their toys like the kids from a century ago were.It might psychologically affect their characters while becoming an adult like the Aviator in this film, but as one of lines from the movie say 'Growing up is not the problem. Forgetting is', the children are losing their innocence over the adult's reality world. Who knows, someday those kids may become the greatest writer inspired by their childhood days.If you ask me, I strongly recommend it for all. It is very encouraging film for the parents how not to raise their children and for the grown ups how not to get lost is the adult world. Most elegant flick of the year, along with a very few others.You don't have to ignore it because you have read the book, like I said it was not completely borrowed from the original material. Instead, two-third of the film was freshly established out of the same name masterpiece. I'm not familiar with the book, so I've no thoughts that differentiate between these two formats. But definitely the film deserved all the appreciation from critics and movie 9.5/10",
