            "content": "The boy Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is raised in the jungle by the female wolf Raksha with her cubs in the pack led by Akela. The panther Bagheera saved Mowgli when he was a baby and delivered him to Raksha. During the drought, the animals celebrate truce to drink water around the Peace Rock together, but the cruel tiger Shere Khan sees Mowgli and promises to kill him when the water return. Bagheera decides to guide Mowgli to a village on the outskirts of the woods, but they are attacked by Shere Khan during their journey. Mowgli flees but the anaconda Kaa attacks him; however the bear Baloo saves him and they become friends. But Shere Khan wants to kill Mowgli and no animal is capable to stop him. What will happen to Mowgli?\"The Jungle Book\" is an awesome film with fantastic CGI. It is impressive the interaction of Mowgli with the animals and the jungle. The wolf cubs are cute and the voice of Scarlett Johansson is mesmerizing. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil):\"Mogli: O Menino Lobo\" (\"Mogli: The Boy Wolf\")",

            "review_title": "Expectations initially were mixed, expectations were exceeded",
            "content": "The 1967 animated film to me is still one of Disney's best of the \"classic era\". This is not just nostalgia talking, quite a few childhood favourites have not held up, but 'The Jungle Book' is an example of one that has.Expectations were mixed for seeing this film. The trailer looked great, the voice cast is filled with enormous talent and the featurette was fascinating. It was just that, relating it to the other Disney live action adaptations, whether it was going to be one example of a re-boot that looked stunning, was well-written and performed, respected its original source material(s) and added its fresh spin, like 'Cinderella, or a well-made film with enough other decent elements to make it watchable but also one lacking in soul and charm, like 'Alice in Wonderland'.Fortunately, 'The Jungle Book' is an even stronger example of the former, and is one of Jon Favreau's best films along with 'Iron Man'. Fans of the animation will love recognising the familiar characters and scenes and it was also really nice to see more of Rudyard Kipling's writing and story telling here, the ending being closer to that of the animated film. 'The Jungle Book' is wonderful on its own merits too, just like the Disney animated film was, which was a poor adaptation of the book but worked so well as a film on its own that it didn't matter.Criticisms for the film are very few. The first criticism is that Kaa's scene and screen-time is far too short, a great character like Kaa deserves far more than a mere five minutes or so. And it is a shame because it is a very suspenseful and hypnotic scene with some of the film's most striking visuals, and the deceptively maternal story teller approach was beautifully written and delivered. Regrettably, the other criticism was \"I Wanna Be Like You\". While one of the highlights of the animated film, and one of Disney's most iconic moments, because the scene is darker and King Louie more intimidating (in size and manner), also because it comes out of nowhere, the light-hearted fun of the song that worked so brilliantly before just doesn't fit here (if Christopher Walken really did desperately want to sing the song, it didn't show in his singing because he sounded uninterested and hesitant).On the other hand, the film looks amazing. The rich, expansive cinematography is some of the best of the year so far and the scenery and settings are so vividly detailed and colourful, that reading that it was shot entirely in a warehouse was a shock. The rendering of the animals are staggeringly realistic, especially Shere Khan, Bagheera and the monkeys. Favreau directs with a keen eye for detail and spectacle, yet doesn't forget the drama, cast or the storytelling once. John Debney's music score is full of energy, atmosphere, warm orchestration and vibrant emotion, its referencing of familiar themes feeling nostalgic and affectionate rather than cheap. As for the songs in the film, although \"I Wanna Be Like You\" was a disappointment \"Bear Necessities\" fitted right in and was as good-natured and easy-going as one can hope and \"Trust in Me\" is worth listening to if you stay for the closing credits, Scarlett Johansson with her low-register, smoky yet sensual tone does a surprisingly good job with the song.'The Jungle Book's' script is very funny (Baloo getting the funniest lines, and some of them were hilarious) without being childish or simplistic while also easy to understand and thought-provoking, there is a good amount of depth too without being too dark or sugary sweet. The story moves quickly and is constantly enthralling, one thing it does better than the animated version is expanding on motivations and making characters more interesting (as great a villain as Shere Khan is in the animated film, his motivation to me seemed clearer here). The climax is dramatically satisfying and darkly tense.A great job is done with the characters also. They're not complex, but they are likable and interesting, are very true in personality to their animated counterparts and all serve a point in the storytelling, some like Shere Khan and the wolves expanded upon. It was easy to identify with Mowgli, Baloo is a breath of fresh air and to me a great villain is one that one can totally see why the villain is hated or feared but one can also understand their point of view, which is the case with Shere Khan (this is true of the animated film too, but as Shere Khan has more of a back story here it came through stronger to me). The cast were a talented one to begin with and their talents absolutely shine through. Newcomer Neel Sethi does very credibly as Mowgli, it is incredibly hard to react against nothing and apart from a few naturally stiff moments to begin with he handles all the different emotional elements very well. The superbly chosen vocal cast are even better.Bill Murray was born for Baloo (sounding far more engaged than as Garfield), his relaxed but witty voice-work matching the character's easy-going, good-natured personality. Idris Elba effectively puts dread into one's heart as Shere Khan, he's silky, regal, charismatic and genuinely menacing, though George Sanders brought over the suavity and oiliness more. Ben Kingsley is a stern yet sympathetic Bagheera, and Christopher Walken, in a characterisation that is like a mix of mobster boss, Colonel Kurtz and Walken's own mannerisms, makes King Louie intimidating but also entertaining. Scarlett Johansson's voice work for Kaa is eerily sensual, Giancarlo Esposito is a dignified Akeela and Lupita Nyong'o's Raksha is movingly compassionate.In conclusion, a truly great film. Works very well as a live-action re-boot and works even more as a film in general. An epic visually stunning adventure, told with fun, heart and depth. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This was certainly an amazing looking film, and knowing it was all computer generated is almost worrisome--computers are capable of so much now, practical effects are becoming endangered. The story was very familiar to me going in. It was one of the most beloved films of my childhood, and the original Disney film still looks amazing today. I don't know why, but nothing about this version interested me. Some of the differences are easy to pick out--there is no comparison between the original Baloo and the Bill Murray performance for me, as I much prefer the original. Most of the rest of the movie, I just didn't care about. King Louie, Shere Khan, even Mowgli--they just feel empty and uninspired. I didn't dislike it, I just didn't feel that I would ever want to watch it again.",

            "content": "The Jungle Book is a live-action/CGI fantasy film that retells the story of Mowgli, an orphaned human boy who, guided by his animal guardians, sets out on a journey of self-discovery while evading the threatening Shere Khan. Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli in the movie. He is the only human being on screen and as his first ever role, this kid actor is truly magnificent. He is as good as any kid actor has ever been, even favorably compared to Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. The computer generated imagery is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the best ever and the 3D is just mind blowing. In every single scene I kept getting surprised and thrilled at just how amazing the CGI and 3D were. I think the main reason as to why this movie worked it's because it also has a very good story line that's mixed in with the amazing visuals. Also, the voice actors are all perfectly cast. Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he's in. That was one well made and scary villain that Mowgli had to face. Jon Favreau did a fantastic work with this movie, cause really this story has been told many times before, and yet this movie feels fresh and interesting nonetheless. I'm glad that it's doing so well in Box Office because it completely deserves it. Movies like this must be appreciated so that they can inspire more great work, and maybe one day, even erase movies like Transformers.",

            "content": "Overall: This movie is the most overrated movie of 2016 for me. It had some highs but many more lows for me. I don't think it deserves the praise it receives.Good: 1. I won't deny that the CGI in this movie is some of the greatest I've ever seen and 100% deserves the Oscar. It is practically flawless and would receive an 11/10 if I judged movies solely on that. Alas, I do not.2. The voice actors did great jobs even if I think there were some bad calls of judgement for who voiced who.3. I respect Neel Sethi for doing what he did under the conditions he was in. Despite this, I couldn't buy his acting but he does deserve respect for it.4. Bill Murray and Christopher Walken and Ben Kingsley were perfectly casted.Bad:1. As stated before, I couldn't buy the kids acting.2. I believe that both Idris Elba and Scarlett Johanson, while giving a reasonable performance, were not fit for the role they were in and much prefer the original cast for both them roles. 3. The story was quite weak for me. I don't care if it's identical to the book, I really didn't like the way it was presented and written.4. The songs in the movie were stupid. Nostalgic? Yes! Brilliant for animated film? 100%! Fit for realistic looking animals? No. It doesn't look or feel right to see a jolly bear or a huge monkey sing.5. The film is much darker and less happy than the original. I'm all up for a gritter, more mature reboot but this was so devoid of life and joy that the slight attempts at humour just fell flat and felt wrong. I much prefer the happier tone of the original Jungle Book.6. There are quite a few annoyances, such as how they clear up the fire, that I thought were annoying and lazy.5/10",

            "content": "The Jungle Book is a live-action adaptation of Disney's famous animated film, The Jungle Book(1967). It is also based on Rudyard Kipling's novel of the same name. Mowgli(Neel Sethi) has lived in the jungle, for as long as he can remember. In the jungle, he is raised by a pack of wolves, led by Akela(Giancarlo Esposito). A wolf named Raksha(Lupita Nyong'o), is the only mother he has ever known. He has an ally & a friend, in a panther named Bagheera(Ben Kingsley). When the treacherous tiger Shere Khan(Idris Elba), opposes to Mowgli staying in the jungle, Bagheera has to return the man-cub to the man village. While on their journey, Mowgli & Bagheera receive help from a grizzly bear, named Baloo(Bill Murray). Now, it is up to Bagheera & Baloo to take Mowgli to the man village, safe & sound. The Jungle Book is a mind blowing film. It is the most gorgeous movie, I have ever seen. What's extremely fascinating is that, the whole environment in the film is CGI. The animals are also CGI & yet, they look extremely lifelike. The forest the movie is set in, looks breathtaking. Director Jon Favreau & the rest of the crew, have maintained the soul of the 1967 animated movie of the same name. Kudos to the visual effects team, for making a live-action adaptation of a movie like The Jungle Book. Don't worry. This film is not a carbon copy of the Disney animated original. Favreau adds many new elements to the film, that will keep you guessing right till the end. The set pieces of the movie, are its highlight. The 3D provides immersion & there are quite a few scenes, that will make you duck in your seats. The casting is flawless. Newcomer Neel Sethi is outstanding as Mowgli. Sethi doesn't just play Mowgli, he embodies the character. Bill Murray is hilarious & adorable as Baloo. Murray & Sethi's rendition of The Bare Necessities, is as good as the 1967 version of the same song. Ben Kingsley is awesome as Bagheera. Idris Elba is spectacular as Shere Khan. Elba's voice-over of the predatory antagonist, is menacing & flawless. Lupita Nyong'o is amazing as Raksha. Nyong'o gives an emotional & layered performance, as the voice of Mowgli's adoptive mother. Scarlett Johansson is excellent as Kaa. I liked Johansson's version of Kaa, much better than the '67 incarnation of the sneaky snake. Giancarlo Esposito is great as Akela. Christopher Walken is superb as King Louie. The Jungle Book is a must watch on the big screen, with your entire family. Go, relive this timeless tale.",

            "content": "I've never been a fan of the original Jungle Book movie, but I did grow up watching it, and I did like it. This remake is (in my opinion) Disney's best remake so far.The animation and the scenery is basically a new age in CGI. Not only are there CGI characters and creatures now, but locations too. The entire jungle looks absolutely real, yet it's not, and that's the great thing about it.The characters themselves were pretty cool. I didn't care for Mowgli in the original movie, but this movie got me liking him. He's brave, not as bratty, and he's pretty inventive. Bagheera is as stern and careful as ever except that he's also got the action his book counterpart had had. And I like Baloo's character here, having a bit more of a self-serving trait his older counterparts never had but eventually becoming a nice guy. And that's the main characters. The wolves got more screen time, Kaa got a lot more dangerous (though she doesn't have as much screen time, which is my only complaint in this movie), King Louie is more sinister and less comical, and Shere Khan is a flat-out beast.I'm also glad that they brought back three songs I enjoyed as a kid. I really liked Bare Necessities, and I've also started singing this version of I Wanna Be Like You. Trust In Me made me feel like Kaa was in a spy movie.So on a scale from one to ten, I'd give it a perfect score: 10/10. It's an epic movie, and I highly recommend seeing this movie.",

            "content": "Nostalgia is a powerful thing, the original Jungle Books has been adored by many, be it the animation or movie interpretations. The new rendition takes the expectation and rises beyond with emotionally engaging and larger-than-life characters, which is no small feat considering it relies on sole child actor Neel Sethi while the rest of the veteran cast lend their voices for the animal kingdom.Story follows Mowgli (Neel Sethi) on his two feet as he ventures around the thick jungle. He meets with near mythical allies and foes alike, while learning and accepting his unique nature. A lot rest on his small shoulders, and as Mowgli he performs remarkably well. He presents an innocent vibe even though the harsh jungle is demanding and sometimes merciless.Visual is utterly impressive, these beasts look and move very naturally. There has been talking animals before, but the sway of their furs, the slight gestures different to each species and how the environment reacts to their motions are nothing less than exceptional. These subtle details give lives to characters from two dimensional then make them dreamlike lively.The famous voices another layer of their personalities, from the protective Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, merry Bill Murray as Baloo to Idris Elba as fierce Shere Khan. Its sound effects and songs are symphony of the wild, it hits just the right tune with nostalgic effect and engaging soundtracks.The new tale of one child and his fauna companions is brilliantly told by exhilarating graphic and harmonic concerto.",

            "review_title": "Such a great adaptation of a Disney Classic",
            "content": "The Jungle Book is the next instalment in the growing list of Disney live action remakes that have so far turned out to be relatively alright at best. This is by far the best of the bunch as it gives us something that adopts a slightly more serious and modern tone but still sticks to some of the qualities that made the Disney Classic so beloved. Going into the film, the most impressive aspect that i was looking forward to the most was seeing, or hearing the fantastic cast in action. Having Bill Murray, Ben Kingsly, Idris Elba, Scarlet Johannson, and Christopher Walken cast as the characters we love is enough to get me looking forward to the film. Some fit more than others but overall, the talent paid off. Even though it is a 'live action' adaptation, only like 5% of the film at the most is real, the rest is all done through some of the most impressive CGI i have ever seen. That is a testament to young Neil Sethi's ability to act, as it was essentially him in a green room talking and interacting with nothing. The overall plot of the film stays very faithful to the original film with changes here and there that are both better and worse, but it's what you expect from these adaptations. They got you invested into these completely CGI animals and you understand their emotions and relationships with each other as if it is done with performance capture. They conveyed themes of love and fear in the characters really well, and it really is those two themes that drive the plot and character development of the film forward. HOLD ON - 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' Trailer just dropped, ill be back in 15 to finish this off..... priorities. In terms of the characters, i thought the film captured their personalities and attitudes almost perfectly. Bill Murray as Baloo was perfect, he was just as fun and entertaining to watch as his animated counterpart, and completely stole all scenes he was in. Idris Elba as Shere Khan was menacing and was a real force to be reckoned with in this film, you felt that he was the most feared tiger in the jungle. Ben Kingsly was also the best fit for Bagheera as he nailed the very wise and intelligent personality, and was just a really cool character. Neil Sethi as Mowgli was fantastic, especially for his first acting role, the way he managed to show chemistry between him and those non- existent characters so well is something many experienced actors still struggle to do, so i can see him improving and getting more roles in the future. Just the chemistry and relationships between Mowgli and Baloo, Mowgli and Bagheera, and Mowgli and Raksha made many moments of the film so much more entertaining and impactful. Christopher Walken as King Louie was overall pretty good, i didn't mind hearing his voice as the famous Orangutang/Gigantopithecus. There are some issues with his scene that ill get into in a bit. But by far the most underused character was Scarlet Johansson's Kaa, who to be honest may as well have not been in the film at all. She shows up for 5 minutes max and makes no impact on the main plot, it was a disappointing use of a great character. The film did delve into some humorous exchanges between the characters especially with Mowgli and Baloo, and it helped to lighten the mood at times which helped me stay interested. A very minor issue i had was that there were some early moments where the film i felt could have been moving along a little quicker, it only lasted like 5 minutes max each time, but it could have been handled better. And my major gripe with the film was notably the scene with Mowgli and King Louie. The film tried to throw 'I wanna be like you' into this scene and it really didn't work, like at all. It was almost as bad as characters in 2015's 'Pan' singing a rendition of Nirvana's 'Smells like teen spirit'. It took me out of the film completely and should have been left out. But overall i had a lot of fun with this film. It was exciting, emotional, adventurous and it had a solid plot, great characters and performances, and unbelievably perfect use of CGI. It really is a lot of fun and you should go see it this weekend, well worth it.8/10",

            "content": "Favreau's Jungle Book is a marvel. With a Spielbergian sense of magical awe and reverent fear, it's a children's epic that not only stands-up to its legacy, but surpasses it. Giant snakeskins, intense animal battles, and daring escapes from ape kingdoms give the film a scope beyond the animated musical, all while keeping intact its persistent joy. Funny, jaw-dropping, thrilling, grand, and fun, it's an all-cylinders-go cinematic experience on every level. The story of a young man-cub raised by wolves and living amongst the animals of the jungle hasn't changed much, down to the talking beasts. Much like last year's Cinderella, they utilize nostalgia of the beloved product to dive deeper into the story without cynically dismissing it. On top of immersing us into the wilderness through meticulous attention to the smallest of details, the characters are drawn with much more depth. The bratty and paper-thin Mowgli of yesteryear is replaced by a boy with brains and motivation. Played with wide-eyed confidence by newcomer Sethi, we emotionally engage with his adventure. And he's not alone; all characters are given loving attention, specifically the foreboding presence of scary-cool bruiser Sheer Khan. The technical feat of creating photo-realistic animals that convincingly speak and emote is so impressive it feels like a benchmark in CGI. It wouldn't be an overstatement to say this is as groundbreaking and beautiful as any visual effects in years. Favreau and co. manage intense attention to accuracy without shoving it down our throats or overshadowing the story. At the end of the day, under all the computer data, there is a soulful and entertaining tale about life's bare necessity: individuality within community.",

            "content": "Not that I consider the original cartoon a classic. And I've never read Rudyard Kiplings novel. But this crap is far worse than the cartoon. First of all, the cgi in a movie relying this much on cgi needs to be state of the art. But in fact its almost as horrible as Spawn and The Scorpion King. Everything from the animals to the jungle is cgi. The snake and the tiger are the only ones that look like real animals. Making Louie, the monkey king act and sound like a mob-boss and look like Christopher Walken who is the voice, is a little funny, but not enough to make me any less bored at that point in the movie. As for the rest of the animals, if you're doing a feature version of a cartoon with talking animals, you better have that talent and the money to make it look good. They had neither here. The wolves are the worst cgi animated animals I have ever seen. After last years Jurassic World, its hard to believe they can get it this bad. The scene where the water puts out the fire in the jungle looks more fake than the water in The day after tomorrow. A 12 year old movie. The plot itself (I don't know how close this is to the novel) steals from a lot of other movies. And it does so shamelessly and bad. From The Lion King to Ice Age, there is nothing original here. The movie also doesn't know if it once to be a serious interpretation of the novel or a kiddie-friendly version. So it fails as both versions. And hearing the law of the jungle or whatever the damn thing was said out loud 3 times during the movie was 3 times too many.The kid playing Mowgli is annoyingly cute, annoyingly clean and way way too human for a boy that was raised by animals. I found myself being really annoyed in a scene where Mowgli sits on the bears stomach as it floats on a river. The bear splashes water at Mowgli but his hair never gets wet. Again, this was complete cgi and the fact that I noticed this, shows how bad that scene and the whole movie was. Had I been excited and given a rats ass about any of the characters, I probably wouldn't have noticed it. If they had had a bigger budget and made the animals real (which means they can't talk and they hunt, kill and eat each other) and they had made Mowgli a wild boy with no language, acting like an animal and made it R-rated for adults, then MAYBE they could have made a decent movie. The worst part of it all is that Jon Favreau, who gave us the original first and excellent Iron Man movie actually directed this crap. Avoid it. Even if you have kids around the age, this movie is meant for. They will find it even more boring than most of the adult audience already finds it. Let them watch the cartoon instead. At least it was fun to watch for me when I was a kid. Once again, I wish IMDb, would allow the possibility of zero stars. Or in the case of this movie stars below zero would be even more fitting.",

            "content": "Jon Favreau's Jungle Book exists in a world that is somewhere between the animated feature film and the 1994, historically grounded, live action film.The result is a beautifully bland movie. This is not a warm, well told story, with interwoven charm and wisdom, it's an kid friendly action/adventure in the jungle with lots of animated effects.I kinda knew it when I saw the trailers, but there is a strong vibe that the Jungle Book would much rather be an experience, than a movie. This means trimming all the juice out of the writing and characters until you are left with that common feeling of being in a video game.There are far too many special effects, and they are distracting. Even though there is nothing technically wrong with the CGI, the movie makes some bad choices which destroys the illusion of having animals as real as say the Tiger in Life of Pi. Like their animated counter parts, the cast of this Jungle Book have animated lips, making them un-compatible with the very real world they live in. There are also too many stagy sequences featuring unrealistic numbers of animals, which in the 21st century wouldn't even convince an eight year old that CGI wasn't needed.The film makes another very poor decision to include two of the original musical numbers but minus the one element that would make them worth while; the actors can't sing. This brings me to the subject of voice casting. The voice work across the board is surprisingly refined, and uncharacteristic. Bill Murray as Baloo is everything that Baloo should not be; dull, laid back, uninterested. Scarlett Johansson is not remotely charismatic enough for the intoxicating Kaa the snake that she inhabits, and Christopher Walken as King Louis produces a near caricature of a mafia head.And then there is Mowgli. The decision to match his age to his animated counterpart was a mistake. One of the themes of The Jungle Book is boy to manhood. The climax of the film is also heavily depended on Mowgli needing to be commanding and fierce enough to rally the jungle against Shere Kahn. This ten year old boy who looks like he's reading off a teleprompter half the time, is not that Mowgli. I kept hoping for a few good laughs in the picture, but I just saw occasional attempts that fell flat. The strongest aspect is that when it is not crammed with CGI animals The Jungle Book is quite beautiful to behold. The problem is that like its protagonist, the camera is always on the move, giving us no time to stop and smell the flowers. Unlike in a Miyazaki movie, which will take its time to get you lost in the wilderness, The Jungle is strictly 'cut-to-story'.If only there was a story to cut to. With its superficial, effects-driven action sequences The Jungle might entertain some children with ADD, but for the rest of us, the film is little more than an elongated version of its trailer.",

            "content": "We've hit a point of no return in terms of remakes: the recent announcement of yet another Indiana Jones film, Disney's intention to produce a new Star Wars film every year, and a mooted reboot of Peter and Elliot the Dragon (!) go a long way to showing the complete inspirational bankruptcy of blockbuster filmmaking. And in case that picture isn't sharp enough for you, along comes Jungle Book to crystallize the issue.The original is among Disney's most perfect creations, and simply reissuing it in theaters might have accomplished what the present abomination did financially, without any of the wasted effort. What we have here is a deconstruction of the original, where every spin on an old idea misses the mark and every new \"idea\" turns out to be pointless and predictable.In true flop-fashion, the problems can be traced to before a camera was even unleashed: the casting becomes and end unto itself, despite a weird mismatch between voice and animal or performance. That blend manages to be less convincing than Homeward Bound (and they used real critters). Ben Kingsley barely pulls off Baghera, but Murray and especially Christopher Walken are embarrassing, especially during the latter's cringe- worthy rendition of \"I Wanna Be Like You\". The real disappointment is poor young Neel Sethi as Mowgli, who is hung out to dry, too often betraying the digital fakery around him.The throwback moments are mostly appalling, and the additions, all padding, are yawn- inducing: King Louie has a huge temple? Of course it will crumble during a by-the- numbers chase scene, with none of the humor of the original. The film also awkwardly acknowledges its own pointlessness: since the only way to \"improve\" on the original is to make everything faster, louder and bigger, serpent Ka is bigger than even Anaconda's titular joke was, and Louie could take King Kong in a fight, while the climactic jungle fire setting the scene for Mowgli's showdown with Khan could probably, in this incarnation, be visible from space.So there you have it, a tale full of sound and fury, told by idiots etc, as the poet said. White noise. Meanwhile, it hardly registers as a blemish on a more recent poet, original author Rudyard Kipling, who would simply be appalled.",

            "content": "Rudyard Kipling's eponymous collective works gathered under the name of The Jungle Book is almost gospel. The stories are fables and use animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons. Jon Favreau knows the divine quality of the works and he gives us that and more and more and more.....I thought Disney's Zootopia has reached an epoch in CGI, but The Jungle Book is definitely the crowned jewel. I was awestruck by the level of visual details of each animal that occupies the screen. The facial expressions mirroring its running gamut of emotions, the physical movements of each animal, the pitch-perfect voicing - who wouldn't believe they possess a human soul? Films using a predominance of CGI go stale very fast if the story cannot keep up. The seams will start to show and the minutes will turn to hours. Looking at all the frames of The Jungle Book, other than Neel Sethi as Mowgli, everything is CGI-ed to the Ying Yang. But the sense of story is so compelling, I was totally immersed in the world. Yes, animals can talk! I am a believer! Favreau marries the narrative and the visuals so well, I couldn't see one without the other. It is the perfect marriage - each element serving the other in a symbiotic relationship. The sound design is also an aural extravaganza - just listen to the scene where the anaconda, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, engages and hypnotises Mowgli. The surround sound design is jaw-dropping oh la la. In fact, I think the entire movie is a demo disc for home theatres!This is one of the most satisfying movies I have seen this year. There is something here for everyone, from the kids to the adults. As much as I was totally captivated by the movie, I did make one snide remark (actually two, but I will keep the second one to myself). At a languid scene of Mowgli floating down the river with Baloo the bear, voiced by the incomparable Bill Murray, thick undergrowth starts to rustle and ominous music starts to reverberate. Mowgli and Baloo stare fearfully at the moving bushes, getting ready for impending danger as best as they can. I turned to the missus and whispered, \"I think Leonardo DiCaprio is going to pop out.\" She laughed.",

            "content": "To those who still hold any degree of skepticism for Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book\u2014Disney's live-action adaptation of the Rudyard Kiplingclassic\u2014I say just sing along to \"Forget about your worries and your strife\u0085\" That's a guaranteed earworm from this really good film. Complete with splendid sound design and flabbergasting CGI wizardry, director Favreau, with cinematographer Bill Pope, deftly crafts this spectacle not only to dazzle viewers but also to enhance its dramatic agenda.With an excellent voice cast, The Jungle Book presents a colorful array of memorable characters. Idris Elba as Shere Kahn is chillingly formidable with his guttural threats. Ben Kingsley brings nobility and wisdom in the sleek jungle cat Bagheera. In her short sequence as the python Kaa, Scarlett Johansson delivers the film's backstory with a magnetic voice. Giancarlo Eposito's Akela and Lupita Nyong'o's Raksha supply the fierce patriarch and protective maternal vibes needed by their characters. Christopher Walken as the mafia-king orangutan waiting for extinction is an oddly delightful sight, especially when he starts to sing. Bill Murray as the manipulative sloth bear Baloo is a crowd favorite as he blurs the line between being annoying and adorable. Even the lesser animals (porcupine, pygmy hog, squirrel, etc.) manage to steal the show as sources of comic relief.In his first feature appearance, Neel Sethi as young Mowgli is tasked with selling the wonder and portraying the humanity of this tale. Considering that he is basically working within the confines of his imagination and a green screen room for the entire film, he manages to make everything believable: the beauty and danger of the jungle, his kinetic and charismatic character, and his deep connection with the animals. Of course, this is owed in large part to Jon Favreau's direction's too. A magical scene in the film (and my favorite!): an infant Mowgli and Bagheera's innocently touches Bagheera's face. It's a sweet moment, a reminder that the there's a seed of humanity in each of us.Although the film comes a bit dark, fans are not robbed of iconic songs such as \"The Bare Necessities\", \"I Wanna Be Like You,\" and a jovial musical scoring for the film (thanks to John Debney). Old as it may, the story of The Jungle Book remains an affecting contemplation on the virtues of family, self-growth, and man's progress at the expense of nature. The Jungle Book successfully opens a new chapter in cinema's visual storytelling prowess. It deserves to be seen, and unequivocally needs to be experienced in 3D or better, an IMAX theater. It is immersive, it is enchanting, and it is wonderful.Full review here: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/the-jungle-book",

            "content": "In a word... \"Flat.\" Seeing this remake only left me wanting to see the old cartoon once again. I loved the old cartoon as a kid and can easily recall many details decades later. Conversely, I just saw the new one and it just blends in with a bunch of other fantasy-adventure /superhero / CGI remakes of late.In general, this remake just felt like it had no soul.In particular, they didn't develop the characters much. It was obvious the film-makers didn't care about the main characters much so why should we either? I guess the special effects or CGI were impressive, especially the talking animals, but that's been done so much its just not a big deal anymore. They can't base a whole movie on those effects anymore and just touch on a few songs. The singing and music in the old version was so much more developed, energetic and memorable.The guest voice-overs were good but too recognizable. I kept thinking of Bill Murray talking into a mic instead of watching the fake bear talk. To be fair, Ben Kingsley pulled off the character very smoothly. But why did they make that orangutang so huge? Was he King Kong's lost brother? And voiced by Christopher Walken it really didn't make sense. Jungle animals are already awesome, you don't need to enlarge them or make up new ones.A high point of the movie was when Mogli helped the elephant baby from the pit. More of this tenderness would have been welcome, which brings me to the next point...This story was always potentially very violent; we're talking about jungle law here- brutal life and death is always near. But while the old cartoon version separated that violence enough from reality to make it safe and enjoyable for a younger audience, the new one crossed the line. It was too real, in my opinion, for most kids under about 11 or so. True, many kids play violent computer games from earlier ages now, so some would argue they can \"handle it\", but is that the kind of trend for them you want to support? I would argue the more we desensitize the youth now, the less sensitive they will be later on when they may be taking care of us when we're seniors. Do we want such thoroughly insensitive people running society in the future? So, while yes- it was exciting, I think this production really narrowed their audience down to the preteens (for whom it may be too violent) and the teenagers (for whom it may be too kiddie- you know with the talking animals and all). So sorry Disney, I've so often loved your movies, but not this time.",

            "content": "I am so very sorry to say this but I wasted my money seeing this piece of crap! John Favreau may have made decent films including Elf and Iron Man but for me John Favreau has failed to make this film as great as the original animated version.The film sucks for three reasons. First the film is just a live action remake of the film. Familiar with Kaa wanting to eat Mowgli? Familiar with King Louie wanting to know about Man's Red Flower? Or the book which appears at the start of the cartoon version? Yes all those scenes return to the film. Though the plot is slightly different the film is just to similar to the cartoon version. Why would we want to see all those clips again? It is just how Star Wars fans reacted when they compared Force Awakens to the original Star Wars film A New Hope. So basically the film concerns about Mowgli who has to go to a Man Village after a tiger named Sher Khan will stop at nothing to kill him but you know the story if you seen the cartoon version. To me the film was just to faithful to the 1967 version but it does include tones from the book by Kipling. The film should be more based on the book rather than a remake. Secondly there are to many throwbacks not just to the 1967 version but other previous Disney films. Rakasha telling Mowgli he will always be her son is a throwback to Tarzan, the way Louie sang I want to be like you is similar to how Genie sang You never had a friend like Me from Aladdlin, the fire in the forest is a throwback to both Bambi and the Lion King II Simba's Pride, Sher Kahn falling to his death in the fire is similar to how Frollo died in Hunchback of Notre Dame and the stampede is a throwback to the Lion King. In my opinion this film was like it was made of different reminders of the previous Disney films. Thirdly the voice acting was just terrible especially Baloo and Bagheera. Other actors could have been in the film who would be better suited for the roles. For me John Goodman and Patrick Stewart would had been better choices for Baloo and Bagheera as John Goodman played bumbling characters like Fred Flintstone, the landlord from the Burrowers and Sulley of Monster's Inc. Plus he voiced Baloo in the Jungle Book 2. Patrick Stewart is best known for playing no nonsense characters and he would have nailed it as Bagheera. However the scariest character in the film was not Sher Kahn but King Louie. He was the only character I found disturbing due to his size and you know the moment he chases Mowgli hell breaks loose. However I liked the way he sang I want to be like you as it was much better than the cartoon version. That was the only thing I liked in the film. Other than that this film is just rubbish. As I said it is a remake of the 1967 version we all know and love. If you were wise just stick to the 1967 version. Save your money!",

            "content": "Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is a man-cub raised by the Indian wolf Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) and her pack led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) ever since he was brought to them as a baby by the black panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves but Mowgli faces certain challenges and lags behind his wolf siblings, and Bagheera berates him for using human tricks like tool building, instead of learning the ways of the pack. One day, during the dry season, all the animals in the jungle gather at the Peace Rock to drink the water that remains as part of the Water Truce, a timeout called during a drought that enables all animals to gather at a water hole without fear of being eaten by larger, more predatory animals. The peaceful gathering is disrupted when the fearsome Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) makes his presence felt. He detects Mowgli's scent amongst the crowd and threatens his life since man is not welcome in the jungle. He holds the scars on his face as proof of man's cruel and destructive nature and issues a warning that when the Water Truce ends and the Peace Rock disappears, he will come for the boy. Thus, a debate and argument arises amongst the members of the wolf pack as to whether or not they should keep Mowgli. But before a general consensus is reached, Mowgli voluntarily decides to leave the jungle for the sake and safety of his pack. Bagheera volunteers to guide him to the human civilization. However, en-route, Shere Khan ambushes them, injuring Bagheera while Mowgli manages to escape with the help of a herd of water buffaloes. Mowgli, now alone, stumbles upon a thick canopy where he meets Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), an enormous Indian python who lures him in with promises of safety and an assurance that she knows who and what Mowgli truly is. Kaa's hypnosis shows Mowgli a vision of his father being killed by Shere Khan and of himself as an abandoned infant being found by Bagheera and also warns of the destructive power of man's \"red flower\". Having successfully wrapped Mowgli in her coils, Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but he is rescued by a sloth bear named Baloo (Bill Murray). In exchange for saving Mowgli's life, Baloo tells Mowgli to fetch him honey which is atop a cliff, to which Mowgli unwillingly agrees. Together, they form a close bond and Mowgli decides to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Back in the jungle, Shere Khan visits the wolf pack looking for the \"man- cub.\" When Akela states that Mowgli has left the pack, Shere Khan kills Akela by throwing him off the cliff. He demands that the boy be handed over to him. Confident that Mowgli will return again, Shere Khan takes over the pack. When Bagheera returns to fetch Mowgli, he discovers that Mowgli has decided to live with Baloo. Although tension is raised between the three, they all agree to sleep on it until the following morning. At night, Mowgli hears a cry for help and discovers that a baby Indian elephant is trapped in a deep pit. Using his tricks, he fashions a rope to rescue the baby elephant. This forms a bond between Mowgli and the Indian elephants. Following Bagheera's instructions, Baloo unwillingly confronts Mowgli and lies to him that he never considered him a friend, hoping that Mowgli can change his mind about staying with him. But Mowgli is suddenly abducted by a group of monkeys who take him to an ancient ruined temple and present him to King Louie (Christopher Walken), a Bornean orangutan-resembling Gigantopithecus who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly \"red flower\". Baloo and Bagheera arrive just in time to distract the monkeys and manage to hold them off while Mowgli flees into hiding. King Louie chases Mowgli through the temple, causing it to crumble on top of him. Before Mowgli leaves, King Louie informs him of Akela's demise. Furious of the fact that Baloo and Bagheera kept him in the dark about Akela's death, Mowgli decides to return to the jungle and confront Shere Khan to avenge the death of his leader and end his tyranny. But first, Mowgli ventures into the village where the humans live and for the first time, he sees his own kind from afar and gazes at them in amazement. He steals one of the burning torches and heads back to the jungle but accidentally starts a fire. Baloo and Bagheera follow him in close pursuit. When the news breaks out that a man with the \"red flower\" is making his way into the jungle, all the animals gather at the Peace Rock. Mowgli confronts Shere Khan, but sees how all the animals of the jungle cower in fear at the sight of the fire he holds. He throws away his torch into the water, allowing Shere Khan to attack him. Bagheera, Baloo and the wolf pack manage to hold him off, thus buying Mowgli enough time to set a trap in the burning jungle. He lures Shere Khan into a dying tree with a fig branch and is able to coax him into stepping on it, causing it to break. Shere Khan falls to his death into the pit of fire below. The Indian elephants later help to extinguish the fire by diverting the river. Raksha then becomes the new Alpha and leads the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to do things his own way, having at last found a true home in the jungle with the animals, including his friends Baloo and Bagheera.",

They could have made the accent more neutral, made his walking more animal like , and made him less annoying. Again in the cartoon Baloo is so fun and lovable , he just isn't likable in the movie , I'm not drawn to him, and he doesn't have the connection with mowgli that he has in the cartoon, there's no emotion in the movie and no emotional connection between the characters, other than the cheesy wolf line \" you'll always be my son\"I was really expecting the movie to relive my childhood , to be quite magical but Instead it was just like a soulless cgi show with annoying characters and annoying voices , too americanised with blue coming out with things like \" my bad\". Kipling will be turning in his grave.The movie is totally soulless and to add to the total lack of emotion in the film it doesn't even end with mowgli going back to the village. It just ends with them all sat up a tree living happily ever after.The very worse thing about the movie is the music and the songs. I can't believe how bad and soulless they are , the bare necessity's sounds like some drunken old man on his death bed is singing it and the background music is poor , and the other song \" I want to be like you \" was totally ruined too. No rhythm , no melody , just dull. It was like the film makers were scared to have fun with the movie , they were scared to bring any emotion or sense of childhood into the movie and instead just concentrated on cgi.

It's true that the CG is nothing short of outstanding, especially considering a lot of it is done during the day instead of at night, and I'm impressed with how much they were able to accomplish, but a pretty movie and an exceptional movie are not at all the same thing; similarly, a better than average movie and an exceptional movie are not the same thing, and this movie is better than average.The writing wasn't great, but it was passable. This is a kid's movie after all, and while I don't in any way think that's an excuse for a movie to have a worse script than any other, it's important to understand that the film still needs to keep the children entertained with silly jokes and easy-to-understand dialogue. My main problem with the film was the child actor. I'm not expecting a 12-year-old kid to be able act like an A-Lister, but there was one particular shot were he screamed and I accidentally laughed in the near-silent theater because it seemed to out of place and awkward. He was also given outrageously simple and clich\u00e9 lines. It was always \"I'm doing this thing because of this other thing\" and felt like the majority of his talking was done explaining to other characters that he had to reach is his goal instead of developing his character. There were a few scenes where he was able to act like a normal kid, and those were definitely his best performances, but overall he wasn't able to give it his all because what he was supplied with wouldn't allow him to.The other characters were played well, and the animators did a good job with the choreography of all the fights. Bill Murray was a great choice for Baloo, and at this point I can't think of any other voice that could have given a bear that much character.The songs, however, felt out of place and forced, and that's all I'm going to say about those.I do not dislike this movie in any sense, and I recommend that people go and see it. At it's heart it is a very good story, and one that I very much enjoy. I'm sure that the nostalgia of revisiting your childhood will help you enjoy it more than I did, because the only scene I'd ever seen from the 1967 movie was the one with the singing monkeys, so there wasn't a lot in the film to connect to my past.",

            "content": "Having now see three versions of the Rudyard Kipling classic, I can honestly say that Jon Favreau's 2016 adaptation reins supreme. I know that may come as a far-fetched opinion for the faithful fans of the 1967 animated classic, but open your mind to the possibility that this version is above the rest. The darker, more realistic tone of this live-action adventure is a sharp contrast to the lighter tone of the 1967 musical comedy. That may be off-putting to some fans, but once you're swept up in the visual splendor of the movie, the story becomes ever more engaging. Speaking of which, don't be surprised if a few elements of the 1967 version's story aren't in this one or are rearranged. Jon Favreu gives the story the proper grandeur it deserves. He uses lush art direction and sweeping cinematography to make the story look bigger. Visual effects aside, the aesthetic of the film gets across the monumental stature a family adventure should have. Combine the visuals with the score of John Debney and you'll find beauty and thrills that bring back a child like wonder. One thing I really appreciate is the way the film treats the animals as characters, not denying them close-ups or treating them as spectacles. They are instead, portrayed as natural beings within the world of the screenplay. It enhances the brilliant voice acting of the cast. Speaking of which, I hope this film can rekindle the campaign to get voice acting a category with the major awards. Idris Elba is perfectly evil. Ben Kingsley and Bill Murray provide such natural and fitting voice work. And, Scarlett Johansson and Christopher Walken steal the show. Their scenes are the highlights of the movie and are easily the most memorable. This movie is an overall construction of perfect cinematic elements. Disney has hit a grand slam with The Jungle Book as it will be etched in the memories of audiences for decades. I say this film is one of the best films of this decade and maybe even the last ten years. With that said, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18. It can be seen at a local theater near you. Reviewed by Willie J., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 17",

            "content": "Yesterday I went to see the new Jungle Book movie in 3D having seen the original as I own it on DVD and I was excited to see what Disney's remake would be about. This version of the 1967 flick tells the story about a young boy called Mowgli who is raised by wolves in a jungle,who is in danger by a terrifying tiger called Sher Khan(voiced by Idris Elba)who wants Mowgii dead. So Mowgii and his friend Baghara(voiced by Ben Kingsley)escape the jungle only for Mowgii to be held captive by a snake called Kaa(voiced by Scarlett Johansson)who persuades Mowgii that she will protect him. Luckily Mowgii is saved by a bear called Baloo(voiced by Bill Murray)and together the unlikely duo team up together. But will Sher Khan catch up to Mowgii.Bottom line I really thought this version was brilliant. The cinematography was jaw dropping,I was litreally shocked that the jungle and the animals were all in CGI form. the actors were very good especially Idris Elba who was very good as the villain Sher Khan. Bill Murray was fantastic as Baloo,when he sung Bear Necessitates to Mowgii I had the biggest grin on my face. If I had a nitpick i would say that Scarlett Johansson was totally wasted in this film. Like Helena Bonham Carter in last years Cinderella,she was only in it for a few minutes and then you never hear from her again. In the cartoon one we did get to see more of Kaa,but in this one we didn't. The 3D is very good,and in my opinion this was the best live action remake from Disney since Cinderella. Kids may be spooked out though in a few scenes in The Jungle Book but overall this was a very good remake. .. even better than the original one.The boy playing Mowgii was very good in his movie debut and the music was brilliant it had this Hans Zimmer vibe to it. The director who directed Elf & Iron Man was very good. Jon Faverau you made me proud.10/10If you loved the original than you will love this movie.AOutstandingPs My Mom and my brother loved it as well,as they seen the film with me yesterday. They preferred it to Zootopia.",

How could I even forget a minor character like the vultures, and their jokes on Shere Khan? Their humor was great in contrast with the tiger's ego. I thought I would revive all those memories watching this movie. I was wrong.This movie is lacking of various things. First, a good plot. Second, good characters with relevant appearances. Third, humour (nonexistent if we ignore Balu) and a good atmosphere for songs (is this supposed to be a musical?). And fifth but not least, WHAT IS KING KONG DOING IN KING LOUI'S TEMPLE?? What they have done to that poor monkey is unbearable.MY SUMMARY(SPOILERS):King Loui doesn't dance. Shere Kahn doesn't bother to chase Mogli through the jungle. Why would him anyway? He already knows the plot. Kaa's appearance in the movie is what in Spanish we call \"postureo\". He appears once. He narrates Mowgli's origins to the spectator (how plot convenient...). He tries to eat the kid with no success and fades away to live happily ever after. The rest can be summarized in: f*ck logic. I have been walking for two days to get to the human village, and now I can just run away for 10 minutes with a torch in hand to get just where the movie started. Hi, my name is Mowgly and I like to burn down jungles in my free time (appaluse). AH AND THE VULTURES DON'T EVEN SPEAK IN THE WHOLE MOVIE, SAME AS THE ELEPHANTS which are considered gods among the other animals (wtf) and magically appear in the last scene to save the day.Please re watch the old movie instead of wasting your money in this thing.

From Director of such cool and enjoyable action films like Iron Man 1 and 2 and Chef, Jon Favreau really cements his great directing skills with this film.Beautifully shot, with really great cinematography work and amazing effort on making the CGI blend in so well in the film. Everything looks like it is real. you can not tell where the CGI ends and where the the actual world begins. I have been saying it for a while that Jon is becoming one of our generations most visually stimulating directors. Now do not get confused, he isn't making films like the Revenant or Hurt Locker, but his films always entertain and surprise the audience at being extremely enjoyable with no dull moments. Was said to see him leave the Iron Man team but to no surprise after his departure as Director and increased involvement of the studio the films rating drop 1 whole star from 8 to 7. Overall the film was brilliantly acted and voice acted too. The new child actor Neel Sethi does an absolute amazing job as the man cub called Mowgli. He plays him so well, you actually forget what the original cartoon looked like. Ben Kingsley does a great job as Bagheera, and you can hear similarities between him and the original voice. All of the cast is brilliant and do fantastic job, obviously Walken establishes a great King Louie, and with his unique voice i was laughing and enjoying the break into song scene. The only let down I felt was with Scarlett Johansson. She didn't feel like Kaa to me, nor did she feel like a snake either. Very strange a I really loved her in \"Her\"What else could be said, oh I remember. Bill Murray as Baloo was just AMAZING!! he really stole the spotlight as the lovable and mischief bear named Baloo. Loved the voice, the bear, the attitude, the dialogue, the song and the courage. Can honestly say that every scene with Baloo in it, made the film 3 feel even more special.Well thank you for reading another Sam Smith Review, Hope you guys liked it, if you did just check me out on other social media pages, same name just with review at the end of it.",

            "content": "There's a haunting remnant from the 1967 classic, The Jungle Book, that blooms into unspeakable greatness in the newest cinematic retelling of Rudyard Kipling's literary masterpiece. Undeniably colossal in its new form, the film stands in riveting perpetuity, both on the grounds of its incredible storytelling and its dazzling visual achievement.The Jon Favreau-helmed film thrives in the real and unimaginable, riding on the lingering reminiscent spirit of its source material and the jaw- dropping wonders of its technical splendor. Imagination propels its narrative forward, fueling its core with crippling sentiments that will surely render every heart moved. At the center of the story, the film is bolstered by its only human character, Mowgli (Neel Seethi), and his immersive adventure with his animal friends in the jungle. Populated by themes cathartically distuinguishable to us, like braveness, friendship, family, and survival, the film manages to navigate itself toward a satisfying finish even in the midst of its imposingly devouring visuals. In most cases, such enormity ruins the very essence of the narrative, but it works the other way around for this film, enforcing the already engaging tale, with much more affecting magnitude. The vocal cast is perhaps, one of the biggest ever assembled, with Ben Kingsley's Bagheera, Lupita Nyong'O's Raksha, and Idris Alba's Shere Khan leading the stellar assembly. This ensemble fuels the powerful emotional core of the film where themes as diverse as love, compassion, and greed, exist. Much of this core is relentlessly stirred with chaos, but there is charm in little, but sweet and serene instances. The comic effort provided is contagious, euphoric even in some scenes.The tone that the film carries might separate itself from the familiar set-ups of family films that primarily target the young audience. While it could barely boast a cerebral distinction, the salient matters driving the entire story bear some recognizable sophistication, giving itself a familiar depth that utterly deserves commendation.",

            "content": "One of the clearest memories I have, of a Disney film that was NOT a re-release, was the original version of \"The Jungle Book\" from 1967. It was the last one Walt Disney, himself, had some pre-production input on prior to his death in 1965.Well, this part live-action/part-CGI remake is not only faithful to the fun-filled spirit of its predecessor. It's even a little more faithful to the Rudyard Kipling books! By that, I mean that they actually mentioned Mowgli's lupine foster mother by her literary name; Raksha (as opposed to just calling her \"Mother Wolf\"). The WD studios also included the stampeding water buffaloes and the death of Akela.Yet, at the same time, they retained two of the most popular songs from the original film. By that, I mean that Bill Murray is no Phil Harris. But, he did a surprisingly good job--with young newcomer Neel Sethi--on \"Bear Necessities.\" And, while I knew that Christopher Walken was a pretty good tap dancer (as he so ably demonstrated in a certain music video, about ten years ago), his vocal rendition of \"I Wanna Be Like You\" had me laughing with astounded delight! I was also delighted by the realistic look to all the CGI animals. Particularly, the rhesus monkeys, langurs, gibbons, and lion-tailed macaques that composed the Bandar-log tribe of King Louie. The latter ingeniously depicted as a Gigantopithecus, by the way, since every modern school kid over the age of five now knows, via googling, that wild orang-utans aren't found anywhere on the Asian mainland. In short, this is a fun film for the whole family. A clich\u00e9 that might have been over-used, once upon a time. But, in this case, it's not hype. It's fact! Sure, it's rated PG for the depiction of fights between wild animals. But, once again, every modern school kid with google-worthy fingers has probably seen scarier fights between real wild animals on Youtube! So, don't be reluctant to take your own youngsters to see this.Trust in me! ;-)",

Otherwise, critics have been pointing, rightly, to truly superb computer graphics, and praising it for improving on the many earlier versions. Not having seen the others, I can't comment. I can comment to the extent of saying that this version is very good 'of its kind.' By that I mean the kind that takes a classic and subjects it to all of the latest gadgetry; replaces all of the original language with hipper, up-to- date dialogue; adds 'catchy' songs; and takes many liberties with the original. Yes, it does all that very well, and that's the problem. In short, there's hardly any Kipling here. Kipling is one of the greatest storytellers in the English language, and he appeals powerfully to the imagination. Hollywood's version just smacks you in the face with all its glitz and glitter, plus a couple of awful songs. It appears that the producers never quite made up their minds about whether this was to be a musical version or not. As a result, the crummy songs come jarringly out of nowhere.",

In \"The Jungle Book\" you will see the same level special effects in almost every scene - these animal are as stunningly real as it gets. This is by far the best looking film of 2016. If this one won't win Oscar for best special effects, where won't be justice. Jon Favreau's direction is superb - at running time 1 h 40 min. this movie never drags and is a joy for all its running time.

We have waited impatiently for this movie to release and jog us down the forgotten memory lane ever since the news broke loose. The sole reason: 1989 show Jungle Book Shonen Mowgli! The dubbed TV show used to be our all-time favourite. Its outspread wings covered more than 20 languages all across the globe, a commendable feat to score even during that span. The acclaim was such that its song would be on every child's lips. That explains our inane fandom behind it.Coming across the Rudyard Kipling excerpt was enthralling too as images from the anime would come running down to fill the voids. Every character had a face. Every word had a voice. My fanatic knew no bound when I heard it was going big screen.Now that we have finally arrived at a juncture where Jon Favreau has successfully helmed the gorgeous telling story to justify the awesome Kipling book, it is hard not to give him an ovation. With a superb CGI that walks hand in hand with realistic looking animals and endearing voiceovers, The Jungle Book era seems to have finally met a new high. The kind we, as die-hard fans, were looking for. Whilst little has been done to mould the plot, which is by the way just perfect, we are racing down to meet exceptional twists and turns in its impending installments. Way to go Favreau! Shere Khan is simply a badass. He carries a demonic mien that will give you the chills looking at him. Idris Elba takes him to fearsome heights. Baloo's entry is well thought of and perfected by Bill Murray. Ben Kingsley imparts a thoughtful grim demeanour to Bagheera. You cannot ignore Christopher Walken's perfect voice for King Louie. He puts life into that animal. Lupita as Raksha is magnificent. Adorable wolf-cubs in the movie will fill your heart up with delight.Screenplay is kind of average, sticking to origins at times, sometimes swaying, but not really that powerful.The parts that I didn't like much were these trivial insignificant things which I choose to ignore: Starting off with Neel Sethi, we could have done better. The lad, although great in resemblance, doesn't really fit the bill. He looks absent emotionally as he if knew he was surrounded by CGI and not the real deal. Favreau fails to milk his emotions enough. Sentient things seemed aloof. Sometimes the CGI would dwindle when showing movements of animals and things would awkwardly move into the animated horizon. But still it all held up pretty fine.Rest everything was just the way I had wanted. Great stuff!",

Sorry, Mr. Murray - turning a smartassed fat feline into a smartassed blimp of a bear doesn't redeem you in any way.The Disney cartoon has remained popular through the years because it doesn't pretend to be anything other than family entertainment with a good deal of humour and memorable songs, loosely based on the stories. This new effort cynically rips off the best-loved songs from the cartoon while masquerading pompously as the original - but it in fact twists the story of Mowgli yet again, taking it even further away from Kipling's uplifting tale of courage, family and friendship. Almost every element of this reworking differs from Kipling's stories, leaving you asking yourself why the heck the writers couldn't have just renamed the characters and the movie and pretended they'd made it all up themselves. Then again, they wouldn't have been able to capitalize on the Disney version.Your kids will love it because it's full of cute animals, but I'd advise you spend the day with them at the zoo instead of wasting your time and money on this hokum.",

            "content": "(RATING: \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u00bd out of 5) THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Superb CGI upstages reality in Disney's version that takes this simple tale of self- discovery and turns it into a lively action adventure for the whole family, although some scenes may be too intense for the younger crowd.GRADE: B+SYNOPSIS: A man/cub journeys to his own species, with many detours along the way.JIM'S REVIEW: Disney Studio's latest reboot, a live action film of its 1967 animated feature, The Jungle Book, did not skimp on its budget. No bare necessities here, unless you count its ill- fitting pop song inclusion into this modernized version. Just plenty of impressive state-of-the art CGI and eye-popping production values to behold. No animals were hurt in the making of this film because none were used, although the photo-realistic details can easily make any moviegoer lose their grip on reality. The CGI is stunning (as is the 3-D IMAX special effects). Reason enough to see this spectacle on the big screen, the bigger the better!The story, loosely based only on some chapters in Rudyard Kipling's classic tale, tells the story of Mowgli (Neel Sethi), an orphan who is adopted by wolves and learns the law of the jungle. This man/cub is perfectly happy with his existence until an evil tiger, Shere Khan (Idris Elba) wants to exact revenge and kill him. So to protect himself and his four-legged family members, it's off to live with his own kind, with the help of a black panther named Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) to serve as his guide. Along the way, Mowgli befriends a sly and laid-back bear, Baloo (Bill Murray), meets a dangerous python, Kaa (Scarlett Johansson, in an all-too-brief appearance) and an extremely large orangutan who goes by the name of King Louie (Christopher Walken), a character that never appeared in the Kipling's novels. As long as the story remains close to Kipling's book, the film radiates with undeniable tension and joy, with many action sequences brimming with excitement and suspense. But too often the film wants to soften the story with too many sweet Disney touches reminiscent of the earlier animated film. The tone shifts erratically and so does the impact of the film. (Adding a few recognizable songs gives the film a gentle but jarring effect, especially in the King Louie segment and the overt hints of The Godfather mobster genre makes the King look more like The Don, a misstep in an enchanting movie. (This may have worked better in a cartoon, but this parody harms the gravitas as a live action film.)Jon Favreau's direction is solid and he excels with the visual look of the film and its well-staged action. The screenplay by Justin Marks is best when little is spoken and more is seen. While The Jungle Book may have moments of second-rate storytelling, it is first class in the visual department. The film is a technical marvel with special mention going out to the production design by Christopher Glass and Abhijeet Mazumder, the fine editing by Mark Livolsi, and the luscious cinematography by Bill Pope. The aforementioned CGI creates real life characters by blending the animals' facial expressions with the physical look of each animal group, personalizing each creature with highly detailed textures of fur, scales, or rough skin tones that are astounding in their artistry and execution.\ufffcActing-wise, the animals also win hands-down (or paws-down). Young Mr. Sethi plays Mowgli and while he is not a natural born actor, he is physically perfect for the role. (However, some of his line delivery is less than memorable.) The voice-over work by everyone involved is first-rate, with Mr. Murray and Mr. Elba adding that necessarily right shade of humor and menace to their roles, respectively.The Jungle Book is wonderful family fare with a definite adult in mind. But be forewarned that some scenes are too graphic and violent for a very young child to experience. (8 years or older seems the ideal age for the targeted moviegoer.) Obviously there is expected death and peril during Mowgli's journey to self-discovery. After all, it's a jungle out there.NOTE: Be sure to stay for the end credits, a delightful mix of CGI and hand-drawn animation with songs which do not intrusively ruin the rhythm of the film. This is where they most effectively belonged.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",

The names of all the animals and places were pronounced ridiculously, some in such a rubbish way, I'm surprised they couldn't consult an actual Indian to at least learn how to pronounce the words. I'm not sure how this movie became so famous, because it's so boring and unexciting. The snake appears for a few seconds and that's all. The monkey also appears briefly. No one is developed, not even Mowgli, and the bear does nothing to seem like he really loves him or anything. He's just selfish. What a rubbishly made thing.*3/10*",

Apart from films set in space this has to be one of the most amazing uses of CGI I have seen to date. What a visual assault we were treated to. The jungle in all its glory, never sleeping, never quiet, and always with a surprise around the corner. This latest Disney offering, a live action (mostly CGI) remake of its 1967 story of Rudyard Kipling's jungle book was epic. It took the tale of Mowgli, the man cub and presented it to us in a whole new format. The animals were all very realistic, yet very true to the animated versions we know and love. There were many moments I recognised yet many new ones slotted in effortlessly to the story. A line up of huge talent provided the voices, from Scarlett Johansson as Kaa the snake, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera the panther, Idris Elba as Shere Khan the tiger and Baloo the bear was voiced wonderfully by Bill Murray. Although there were a few tense moments which made me jump this is a great film for all the family to enjoy.",

The snake (Scarlett Johansson) perhaps the most interesting if not sexy character was a walk on.The story line was rather dark and might scare younger children. The musical numbers which highlighted the original production sucked in this film with Christopher Walken being a lead singer. Neel Sethi can't carry a note, but sings anyway. It was as if Disney couldn't get all the musical rights from Disney. The graphics integrated with a live boy was incredibly good and has come a long way from Mary Poppins.The theme of the film is one of diversity and \"It Takes a Village\" (or a pack)... I think.",

Based on Rudyard Kipling's known classic novel , it regards a little boy named Mowgli . He's a lost boy and raised by a wolf pack led by Akela . Along the way , he encounters a variety of jungle animals , including a complete menagerie , such as : the ferocious black panther named Bagheera , the evil tiger named Shere Khan , the bear Baloo , the Serpent Boa called Kaa , elephant , monkeys and anything else . Mowgli stays among his animals friends while enjoying a lot of adventures and risks . He takes on a jungle journey and knows the location of a hidden palace , a lost city where lives the smooth-talking King Louie, that attempts to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive as well as deadly red flower : fire and then many adventures ensue . The legend will never be the same. Witness the darkest telling of the beloved masterpiece. He was an outcast... a survivor... a legend. Outcast. Survivor. Legend. The greatest journey is finding where you belongThis lavish version of the great classic displays adventures , fantasy , exotic atmosphere , and breathtaking scenarios . Concerning Mowgli who becomes accepted by the animals of the jungle as one of their own , except for one , the fearsome tiger Shere Khan , but there may be greater dangers lurking in the jungle , as Mowgli comes face to face with his true origins . Aside from very nice production values , there is a lot to admire about the film. John Favreau's film has flashes of beauty , resulting to be very fun and entertaining . The charming story is rather timeless and has some depth to it due to its examination of a human boy and his relation with jungle animals . The film is full of beautiful scenery and shimmering cinematography as well as an lush atmosphere . John Debney's score is suitably stirring with an authentic touch , while the tale is exciting and thrilling with a real adventurous streak about it and the pace not dragging too much . This is the first acting to the young boy named Neel Sethi , an American actor , a child newcomer who landed a break-out role as Mowgli in this John Favreau's 2016 live-action version , though he also starred in the short film 'Diwali' (2013). He was selected for the role of Mowgli among thousands who auditioned across the globe . Also, he is the only real human character in this Jungle Book (2016) , with everyone else providing voices for the beast characters . Including the known voices from popular and prestigious actors , such as : Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley , Idris Elba , Lupita Nyong'o , Scarlett Johansson ,Giancarlo Esposito , Christopher Walken , among others . Rudyard Kipling's two Jungle Book anthologies comprise fifteen stories , four of which were used is this film : \"Mowgli's Brothers,\" \"How Fear Came ,\" \"Tiger! Tiger!,\" and \"The King's Ankus\u00a8. Colorful and glimmer cinematography in glamorous color with attractive shots that make some landscapes look like they were added with magic markers . Moving and oriental style musical score by the great composer John Debney . Including impressive sets , luxurious cinematography by Bill Pope and magnificent production . This big budgeted movie was well made by John Favreau , directing brilliantly this familiar story . Subsequently , Favreau shot in similar technician and artistic style : The Lion King (2019) . A must see for children of all ages.Other adaptations about the vintage tale are the following ones : The classic Jungle Book (192) by Zoltan Korda with Sabu , Rosemary De Camp , Joseph Calleia, John Qualen , the Walt Disney animated classic version \u00a8Jungle Book\u00a8 by Wolfgang Reithman (1969) and its sequel (2005) , and in the 90s , a beautifully and enchanting filmed version , live-action by Stephen Sommers with Jason Scott Lee, Lena Headley and Sam Neill . And Mowgli (2018) by Andy Serkis with voices by Christian Bale , Benedict Cumberbatch , Naomie Harris , Peter Mullan , Jack Reynor , Eddie Marsan.",

            "content": "I knew the story and the characters, and was not disappointed with this current rendition of this classic Disney/Kipling.It was always beautiful to watch the almost perfectly realistic models of the animals.Mowgli looked the part and seemed to handle the physical side of his performance as the only live performer, but his acting at times made me think of 'Anakin from the Phantom Menace' which is not good for a comparison. It was also not a good feeling to see cuts, scrapes and scars on Mowgli as the movie progressed. This is realistic for the amount of action, but it made me uncomfortable seeing this in an almost naked kid getting abused and almost killed by half the jungle.The two times the movie broke out into song, also didn't really fit with this version either. If it had 5 or ten songs, you wouldn't notice, but those two moments really stood out and dumbed the movie down to me.All the voices were pretty good, except Christopher Walken who seem woefully miscast and as King Louie and Bill Murray as/and the too cartoony Baloo character I also didn't really care for either.It was also odd/unsettling that all the main characters were intelligent, but other animals seemed retarded (hedgehog?) or just normal animals? The monkeys and elephants in particular didn't talk, and these are two of the smartest most human-like in real life so this was really weird.On the other hand, Idris Elba was gold as Sheer Khan and Scarlett Johansson's Kaa is perfect, like her voice performance in 'Her' she was wonderful as the hypnotic snake villain.Had me in tears at times, all in all good, honest Disney fun in the spirit of the best of them like 'Lion King', Aladdin or Toy Story.",

Helping him get there is a panther named Bagheera and a bear named Baloo that must protect him until they reach they reach their final destination. First the pros. The special effects are amazing! I've never seen cgi animals look so realistic on screen before. Neel Sethi does a good job at playing Mowgli. Considering that this kid had to work with nothing, then he is does an excellent job. The characters are very likable. Whether they are good guys or villains. The story seems kinda simple, but when it is directed in a way that makes it entertaining, then your going to find yourself liking this film.

Guided by a no-nonsense panther and a free-spirited bear, the young boy meets an array of jungle animals, including a slithery python and a smooth-talking ape. Along the way, Mowgli learns valuable life lessons as his epic journey of self-discovery leads to fun and adventure.The performances are amazing. Neel Sethi can be referred as \"a small bomb, but a loud blast\". His performance as Mowgli was terrific. Bill Murray enacts the same lazy old bear we know, and exceeds in fulfilling expectations. Ben Kingsley satisfies on delivering Bagheera. Scarlett Johannson does not provide a performance as great as the others but is just.... \"good\".Last but not the least is the greatest performance provided from the whole cast, Idris Elba as Shere Khan!! He outperforms everyone with a cunning and terrifying voice, which is justified for the villain's characterTo be honest, I thought this movie was going to be another big bomb after Batman V Superman. But if you felt the same, prepared to be amazed from this epic journey. Hats off for The Jungle Book!!",

To sad they wasted the opportunity to have done something unique, Animation is another mistake of this production, they should follow the example of Life of Pi, since there was too much difference between the real person and everything else, there wasn't this neutrality the film need it, to immerse yourself in the plot.

For the visual effects this movie is worth a watch, maybe not an Oscar worth movie, but still it is enjoyable. Certainly with the whole family, because it's more a kid movie than anything else.

I also give the actor credit for playing what I suppose was mostly against green screens so he spent a good deal of the time talking to himself. The movie falls apart for me as a story. Yes, the tiger is beyond scary even knowing it's a cartoon tiger and the other animals are as you'd expect them to be - good or bad as their species dictates in our culture. The issue I had is with the relationship between the animals and the human. Time and time again the animals risk themselves to help the boy and for the life of me, I can't see why other than some sort of Kipling era species centric view of animals existing to serve the needs of humans. Worse, the human is unpleasant, petulant and loud. Were I any of the animals, I'd have dropped him on his head at his first whiny outbreak but they stick and due to that, I felt the story line was quite poor.

Shot entirely on greenscreen, the visuals are sumptuous and believable \u2013 you could easily forget the whole thing is computer generated.Neel Sethi is convincing as Mowgli and carries the film with ease which is a tribute for someone so young. The voice-overs are entertaining and in character with their owners. Idris Alba drips menace as Shere Khan, Ben Kingsley reassuring as Mowgli's protector Bagheera, Bill Murray entertaining as cheerful Baloo, and Chris Walken hysterical as (my favourite character) King Louie. I also loved Scarlett Johansson's rendition of Kaa the Python. Making the Python female did not diminish its presence or sense of threat.Appreciations: I liked Baloo's obsession with honey and his use of Mowgli to get it, I loved Chris Walken's delivery as Louie \u2013 Captain Koons lives again! Lol. Also there was a nod to Apocalypse Now when Mowgli is first presented to Louie which I liked. Idris Alba was superb as Shere Khan who was intimidating and formidable, and I loved the bond between Raksha and Mowgli.Disappointments: I was annoyed that the elephants had no speaking part. They were one of the triumphs of Disney's 1967 animation and it wouldn't have hurt to have them say something at least \u2013 anything. I was confused at the ending. Where was the girl that signified the end of Mowgli's childhood and his departure to join the world of humans? Does he stay in the forest? I guess so. Also I was annoyed only two of the eight songs from the 1967 film survived in this version. \"Trust in me\" at least was sung during the end credits \u2013 would it have hurt to have included this in the film also just for the sake of a couple of minutes? Johansson has a good voice and she sang the song very well.A superb film but could have been better with a few tweaks. 8/10.",

            "content": "Immediately I want to start by saying I was never a fan of Kipling's book or the animated adaptation. It's just a story I never grew up with and it never resonated with me. Having said that, I believe Favreau actually crafted a blockbuster that shares qualities from both ends of the spectrum. You all know the story, Mowgli being raised by a pack of wolves is hunted by the fiercest tiger of the jungle. He flees with the help of a panther and a bear and soon discovers his true identity and where he belongs in the world. A charming adventure that feels like a cutesy Disney feature but beneath the visually impressive surface lies a darker and more mature film. Containing various metaphors such as politics and laws, humanity's impact on the natural world and the lust for power and control. It's a difficult balance to get right. Some will want more of a musical quality so that they can gleefully sing to the songs that these animals randomly burst into. I'm personally not a fan of this, so I'm glad this was kept to a minimum although \"I Wanna Be Like You\" is horrendously performed by Christopher Walken. On the other side of the spectrum, literary aficionados and connoisseurs who crave deep and meaningful symbolism will want a narrative fuelled by dark metaphors. I would happily have had a super depressing adaptation, but we don't live in a world where we are graced with such gifts, however there are some complexities included for the more mature audiences. Visually, it's absolutely stunning. The blue screen, wildlife CGI and Neel Sethi (who really did hold this film together) accompanied each other beautifully. Couldn't fault it. Voice acting was spot on, particularly Bill Murray as Baloo who's natural wit suited the role. Well paced and directed, although Favreau got a tad bit excited in the finale where the camera became too frantic intertwined with quick cuts and dim lighting. Too safe? Perhaps. In the end, it's perfectly good family entertainment.",

I'm not even sure King Louie's voice was right, but on the other hand, Christopher Walken is awesome, so who cares. I am not sure this is a good movie for little kids as some parts are a bit intense.

The Akela death scene, scene with Mowgli carrying the torch, the cattle stamped scene, (all important story arks) etc are examples of attempts to remain close to the source material, but Disney choose to to distort these major scenes to fit better with their new take on it for this generation. Doing so killed the potential in this movie as it was soften and dulled and severally lacking entertainment other than visuals & the two beloved songs that made the cut.",

            "content": "For those of you who haven't seen Walt Disney's animated version of The Jungle Book--or haven't seen it in awhile, anyway--I'm sure you still know the famous songs, and perhaps even some classic scenes. But what you may not realize is that the version we're most familiar with does have some issues of its own.Not to say that Disney's 1967 adaptation is anything to scoff at. It will definitely slap a smile on your face. But with a runtime that could have used a few more minutes, there's always been some things missing.Definitely an improvement on the original, 2016's The Jungle Book fills out the classic story in a much more complete way.With this one, we get answers to a lot of characters' motives, as well as more realistic responses to drastic life changes.There's backstory provided for why Shere Khan wants to kill Mowgli, along with a more heartfelt goodbye as Mowgli leaves his wolf pack at the beginning of the film.Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, passes the cute test. Almost so cute and precocious that he fails to give us the realistic performance we desire. Instead, it's more of what you would see in a Disney Channel show. He's oozing with \"my parents made me audition for this.\" Granted, he does alright considering he's essentially acting with no other humans. And while director Jon Favreau gets the best performance out of him, he's just a little too much Disney and not enough realistic. Which isn't far off from original voice actor in 1967, who lacks the same kind of conviction. Compared to him, Sethi is an improvement.But the narrative is really what drives this movie the hardest. It's captivating even before the comic relief of Baloo (Bill Murray) shows up. And it has the added benefit of not being too long.The jungle world created by the filmmakers paints a dark and sinister universe, just as mysterious as the jungle itself. There's nothing peaceful here as long as Shere Khan is around.King Louie, voiced by Christopher Walken, is just as wicked. He hearkens back to a Marlon Brando Godfather, living in the shadows and attempting to exploit the quid pro quo. This is also where \"man's red flower\" becomes more of a prominent feature in this version.The visual effects are an accomplishment alone. Every hair, every movement, without using any live animals. I've never seen anything like it. Truly amazing.If you romanticize the 1967 original, then you may have a problem accepting this one for all its greatness. But this one is the actuality of what we've been romanticizing. And besides the acting, it's near perfect. It's darker and even more twisted, transcending Rudyard Kipling's original source material to the maximum. It replicates the tone--but better. It's everything good from the original--but better. And even brings back the beloved songs for good measure.Twizard Rating: 99",

            "content": "Rudyard Kipling's story is given another version in Disney's \"The Jungle Book.\" In the jungles of India, an orphaned, Indian boy (played by Neel Sethi) is found by a black panther (voiced by Ben Kingsley), and raised by a pack of wolves. Sethi is often reminded that he is not a wolf, but a \"man-cub.\" He isn't as fast as his pack, he doesn't have fangs nor claws to fight and defend himself with; but Sethi does have the human capability to create tools that will give him an edge in surviving in the jungle.All is fairly well with Sethi and his wolf pack\u0085until a tiger (brilliantly voiced by Idris Elba) takes notice of Sethi and demands the boy's death. Elba had a bad encounter with a human, you see, and half his face was burned by the human. So now he has a hatred for all humans\u0085oh, and of course, he's a tiger, so he probably has anger issues anyway, regardless of the half-burnt face thing.The wolf pack, afraid of Elba's threats to kill them if Sethi isn't turned over to Elba, discuss what is to be done with their man-cub member. This is where I lost respect for the wolf pack. There are about a dozen adult wolves, and they let one tiger threaten them? Listen, you take the biggest, strongest guy in the world\u0085you put him up against a dozen regular guys, that big guy is dead. Anyway\u0085 Sethi loves his wolf pack so much (especially his father and mother) that he decides to leave the jungle and live in the human world. With Kingsley at his side, Sethi goes off on his adventure that will bring encounters with a giant snake, a lovable bear, a giant Orangutan, and ultimately, Elba in a winner take all fight.My most memorable, movie moment of \"The Jungle Book\" is the scene when we see the character of King Louie, a giant Orangutan voiced by the always entertaining Christopher Walken. The first 20 seconds of his appearance is clearly a homage to Marlon Brando in \"Apocalypse Now.\" Kids and young adults will miss the inside joke, but the older generation will smile at this moment.Although this is a children's movie for the most part \u2014 there will be at least one scene that will have little kids screaming and crying (Elba's dispatching of Sethi's wolf father) \u2014 and some shenanigans are expected and tolerated, there is a limit. One shenanigan I didn't like is the way Sethi's wolf dad was stupid and let his guard down in front of Elba. Come on, he's a wolf! A predator! Sly, smart! So what the hell happened! He just went retard? Oy. And the second shenanigan with Sethi able to run back home in what seemed to be record time despite having travelled days from home. Double oy.Because I liked \"The Jungle Book\" so much, and it worked for me at so many levels (I laughed, I was shocked, I was angry, elated, sad, and yes, even a bit scared (that big ass snake was scary, I don't care if it was voiced by Scarlett Johansson) that I quickly dismissed those two shenanigans I mentioned above. Congratulations to director Jon Favreau and all the talent involved in this movie for creating a good piece of entertainment.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",

Btw, that awesome Bare Necessities music from the trailers isn't used in the movie until the very end for one small sequence. Major letdown. Also, the trailers showed every major frame in the movie. The theater was full of kids, though, and they laughed all the time, so they probably liked it a whole lot.\u00a0Verdict: It was underwhelming and disappointing. Lame story, shallow characters.

            "content": "Review: This movie certainly looked spectacular but it didn't have the same impact like the original film, which didn't have a large budget, or technology. It proves that it's impossible to duplicate Walt Disney's vision and amazing storytelling methods, which has touched people around the world of all ages. The mixture of true life and CGI worked extremely well in this film but it's not upbeat like the original, which is also known for it's brilliant music, and I found it hard to connect to the various characters. Neel Sethi (Mowgli), played his role extremely well, and I have to give him recognition because it must have been hard to interact with characters that aren't really there but the songs popped up in weird places and it lacked the fun aspect, that we all loved from the original. Its still a joy to watch, and I'm sure that the kids will love it but I've got a feeling that people will still be going back to the original film. I have to commend the director, for taking on such a massive task but I personally think that he should have worked more on the storyline than the visual experience. On the plus side, the actors who were chosen for the voices, we're spot on and Bill Murray (Baloo), added some, much needed, humour to the movie. I just think that it's time for some new story lines, and that people should stop trying to bring back the magic from the old time classics. Watchable!Round-Up: With such a big task, I'm not surprised that this movie cost so much to make, and judging by the box office takings, Walt Disney's original concepts, are still pulling in audiences around the world. Jon Favreau, 49, took on the huge task of portraying Mowgli's amazing journey in the wild, and with another Jungle Book movie in the pipeline, he certainly impressed the big wigs in Hollywood. With movies like Elf, Zathura, Iron Man 1 & 2, the awful Cowboys & Aliens and Chef under his belt, along with a successful acting career, his enthusiasm for film is what has pushed him to new heights, especially with the success of the Iron Man movies. He certainly achieved a new type of movie making with this movie but the original was much better, in my eyes.Budget: $175million Worldwide Gross: $964millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their family/adventure/dramas, starring Neel Sethi, and with the voices by, Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Christopher Walken, Scarlett Johansson, Lupita Nyong'o, Giancarlo Esposito, Garry Shandling and Jon Favreau. 6/10",

            "content": "If there's any more proof there aren't any new ideas in Hollywood, it's the fact that beloved animated classics are being remade as live-action films. Sometimes this works, but more often than not, the ploy to attract those nostalgic feelings from the audience fails, thus leaving the viewer with the sense that their childhood is ruined. I'm generally pretty hesitant of these types of films, mainly because part of me doesn't want to admit that the original films sometimes weren't that great. That being said, the latest in these adaptations, The Jungle Book (2016) certainly surprised me.Unlike some films like Maleficent (2014), which takes a different point of view from the main story of Sleeping Beauty (1959), and more like Cinderella (2015), which covers the same material as its predecessor, Cinderella (1950), The Jungle Book takes the main ideas from Rudyard Kipling's book, via the animated interpretation of The Jungle Book (1967) and brings the adaptation to near perfection. While The Jungle Book's classically animated predecessor certainly had its moments, a lot of its appeal fell to obvious popular culture references (like the Beatles as vultures), and a number of catchy and flashy song-and-dance routines. As a result, I can't honestly remember what the plot of the original film was trying to convey. This was why I was quite impressed with director Jon Favreau's adaptation: the plot was direct and made sense, while also highlighting man's ability to create useful (as well as deadly) tools. It was clear how Mowgli (Neel Sethi) needed to adapt to his strengths to survive in the jungle instead of just hanging around with his animal friends. Also, the clear distinction of the connection between him and Shere Khan (Idris Elba) created a much-needed tension to the story.Some will recall that The Jungle Book has already been made as a live-action film with The Jungle Book (1994). However, advances in computer-generated imagery over the years have made the ability to create talking animals a mind-numbingly realistic endeavor. The voice acting cast for this version was pretty spot on, and the pacing was fantastic. What's more, there still were snippets of songs and subtle pop culture references (my favorite being the cowbell in King Louie's (Christopher Walken) lair), but they didn't distract from the flow of the film.A superior film to its classically animated predecessor, I give The Jungle Book 5.0 stars out of 5.",

Not a single moment of \"oh I'm glad I'm watching this movie\". It was more like \"I just hope the next part will be good\" through out the whole movie. First the acting from main character was so bad he had a same type of face expression every scene. Even the voices from other animals were completely emotionless I could not relate to any of the character's feelings. Second there was nothing new or unseen in this new jungle book. I did not mind the slightly different story line from the original since I was expecting something more innovative from the start. However, It was the same old \"man stuck in a jungle\" type of story that anyone could come up with, I feel like the popularity it is able to gain right now is fully due to its graphics. Most of the movies that do not have a very good plot at least give me a few chuckles on their way. This movie even failed to do that, which is why I felt scammed by the current reviews out here and bothered to actually create an account, make an honest review.",

            "content": "Prepare your eyes for maximum bogglement, work out your abs so you don't bust a gut laughing, and most importantly, dust off that childlike sense of wonder before going to see Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, boldly and lovingly retold by Jon Favreau in what is the most flat out exciting, adventurous film of the year thus far. The director pulls off a balancing act between palpable tension, character interactions that come straight from the heart and land squarely in ours, and some of the most believable, jaw dropping CGI I have ever seen on screen. The animals look so impressive and lifelike that after seeing them I shelved away some of my inherent reservations about computer generated effects as a dominant force in a piece, and simply gave in. The atmosphere is lush, intoxicating and deeply detailed, with a naturalistic feel and tone. Young Neel Sethi is tasked with being the only fully human component, and is perfect. His interactions seem real and rehearsed, immersing the viewer further into the visuals. Mowgli is a young man cub, found on the edge of the jungle by the panther Bagheera (stately, compassionate Ben Kingsley) and given to a wolf pack to be raised by alpha Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o). Not all in the animal kingdom are receiving of this man cub, especially a terrifying Bengal tiger called Shere Khan, given the rumbling tones of Idris Elba, inspiring fear in animals and audience alike. He has a rocky relationship with man, and wants Mowgli dead. Bagheera takes him far into the jungle, where they are separated and Mowgli's adventure truly begins. He wanders into the path of Kaa (a slithery Scarlett Johansson) a monstrous, seductive python, and is taken under the wing of Baloo, an adult Winnie the poo voiced by Bill Murray. Murray is one of the film's great delights, and as soon as he shows up we forget about all the menace and threat which preceded his arrival, and are swept up into his affable, lounging lifestyle and brightly colored neck of the woods. Murray clearly ad libbed a lot of Baloo's dialogue, and anything he didn't he still gives that unmistakable, winking 'Murray' twinge that I so love. Mowgli's adventure continues, as he stays one step ahead of Shere Khan and is visited by the king of the monkeys, a twenty foot tall, lumbering orangutan named Louie, voiced with demented, pithy glee by Christopher Walken. As soon as he showed up the laughs erupted from within me, and reached a manic peak as he belts out the 'Oobie Doo' song in priceless Walken fashion, his monkey mannerisms uncannily starting to resemble Walken's own distinct visage. Many of the animals serve as differing parental figures to Mowgli, representing elemental factions of raising one's young. Bagheera is cautious, doubting and skeptical. Baloo is the fun loving, lenient one. Even Shere Khan has a curdled paternal feel to him, like the brutal stepfather who is damaging to his offspring. Raksha is the unconditional mother, and that devotion comes out wonderfully in Nyong'o's soulful performance. The vocal performances are aided by the stunning effects; the CGI of facial features allow the actors work to truly extend into the realm of what's visible, with real emotions displayed by the creatures, and not a single rendering that's anything short of lifelike. The film evokes true wonder and primal excitement, escapism that takes itself seriously yet knows when and how to play, a dazzling technical marvel, a timeless story well told, all in one cinematic package that is not to be missed. Oh, and stick around for the credits, instead of Walken out of the theatre and missing a final musical treat.",

Very close to the animation series which people who must have watched will feel very much drawn towards this classic retelling of ageless tale depicted in this modern take. CGI/Special Effects are very realistic and most importantly the pace and story itself is top notch. Almost all the characters which we loved/hated as: Baloo, Bagheera, Raksha, Kaa etc. are in the film just with slight modification of their characters. Most notable is depiction of the villain the Bengal tiger- Shere Khan. The one eyed ferocious tiger looked scary and malevolent. Starting from the entry of tiger, audience despise it, I think that is called the triumph for filmmaker as the evil character is hated and the hero is rooted right from their entry in the movie.Only real actor in the movie, the bright eyed child \"Neel Sethi\" acted really well. The voice overs are real deal and takes the film one step higher:- Idris Alba/Shere Khan, Ben Kingsley/Bagheera, Bill Murray/Baloo etc. made it more real through their voices.I watched it in English, but heard that Hindi version is really good(as usually the Hindi version of Hollywood films are not up to the mark) and may be we will feel much nostalgic with Hindi version.

            "content": "Finding the middle base between Disney's 1967 animated adaptation & Rudyard Kipling's original work, breaking new grounds with the available VFX technology by pushing it into unexplored realms and wholeheartedly embracing the third dimension to further enhance the big screen experience, there is no denying that The Jungle Book comes alive in vivid detail in its latest film adaptation but its story isn't as fascinating as its visuals.Set in the jungles of India, The Jungle Book tells the story of Mowgli, a man-cub raised by a pack of wolves who is forced to leave the jungle after their clan is threatened by Shere Khan, the Bengal tiger, for harbouring a human child. Accompanied by Bagheera, the black panther, Mowgli embarks on a journey of self-discovery and meets many different creatures, most of whom simply turn out to have agendas of their own.Directed by Jon Favreau (best known for Iron Man), The Jungle Book begins on an excellent note, for it sets up its plot relatively quick, introduces most of its relevant characters in a sensible manner, and effortlessly encapsulates the viewers into its enthralling world, thanks to the remarkable efforts of its VFX team. But as the plot progresses, the story meanders over moments that should've ended up on the editing room floor and it remains dull for the most part.Indian flora & fauna is extensively researched by its production design team and the forest is brought to life in lifelike detail. Cinematography employs 3D really well for the most part and does infuse some sequences with new energy with its kinetic camera-work but such moments are sparse & far in between. Editing isn't up to the mark either, for its 105 minutes of runtime is strongly felt on many occasions, although John Debney's score does manage to keep its adventurous vibe alive from start to finish.But what really makes The Jungle Book such a delightfully pleasant, slightly captivating & somewhat refreshing adventure to sit through is its stunning visuals. Each blade of grass & every fur was created on the computer screen and is the result of the countless hours of effort put in by its VFX team. The similarity between the real-life animals & their CGI creations is undeniably profound, for what was only tinkered with in Ang Lee's Life of Pi is explored to its full potential in this feature film.Coming to the acting department, The Jungle Book packs in a star-studded voice cast in Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Lupita Nyong'o, Scarlett Johansson, Giancarlo Esposito, Christopher Walken & also introduces Neel Sethi in the role of the only human in the picture. Most of these people are an absolute fit for their animal characters, with Murray, Kingsley & Elba greatly impressing as Baloo, Bagheera & Shere Khan. Johansson is hypnotic in her brief role of Kaa, but Sethi as Mowgli feels like a miscast and he is pretty much forgettable.On an overall scale, The Jungle Book is a sufficiently entertaining family extravaganza that's technically accomplished but from the storytelling perspective, it is deficient in both a compelling story & characters that are worthy of emotional investment. Shere Khan was the true highlight in my opinion, while the unnecessary inclusion of songs plus pointless wanderings in the middle nearly ruined the whole experience for me. It's a shame because The Jungle Book really had all the ingredients to make it to the next level. All it required was a bit more refinement in its story and that same level of intensity that was present in its climax. Nevertheless, majority of the filmgoing audience will be pleased with what Favreau has done here. Not a great standalone movie but definitely a crowd-pleaser.",

But of course I also love the original Disney version which is probably still my favourite classically animated film. Now we got an unbelievably realistically rendered CG version which kind of wants to be like the animated film - or at least exploit its most beloved moments - but also wants to be really impressive. It feels wrong the moment the \"real\" animals start to talk. (I should note that I saw the dubbed German version; I'm pretty sure the original voice cast is much better but that won't make the fundamental flaws disappear.) The animals look and move incredibly real but they talk like humans. The voices convey human emotions but because of the attempted realism we got no matching facial expressions. The animation doesn't want to anthropomorph but the voices (and the script) do. More: Despite being such a visual film the narrative is done mostly by dialogue. And the dialogue isn't written very well. It doesn't have the light, witty tone of the Disney classic (when attempted it fails because of the reasons mentioned above) and it doesn't live up to the deep (but earned) pathos of Kipling. It's just so-so - a typical Hollywood script that doesn't take any chances but throws in a Balu who talks like a \"cool dad\", because...? And what was this terrible, terrible version of King Louie? Too big, too scary but then... SINGING? This would have been an awesome film if they had let go of the Disney version as a blueprint and made a serious adventure film after the books with a lot less talking and a lot more showing. (And please finally the real Kaa, Mowgli's wise friend who is probably the most awesome character of the books...) But of course this is Disney.

There are no human faces or bodies here except for Mowgli (and a couple silhouettes in one scene in the human village.What fails here to me, is that not very much is made out of the freeing possibilities that a computer rendered jungle and animals give you, at least not in terms of camera movement. But two amazing things were made here:1. the old temple, occupied by King Louie is the most impressive set. The courtyard and the guts of the building are amazing as a space specifically conceived for a certain piece of story line. Check how the light penetrates the courtyard, and how its use advances the action. Bagheera and Baloo go through the dark hall, into light, and Louie stays opposite, in the shadow. Faces show in light whenever needed. Space tied to storytelling is one of the best things someone can give me in film, and this film would be worth it just for that sequence alone;2. Almost every animal character is rendered expressively. We can now live among animals and beasts without having to go to animation;The jungle is pretty enough, i guess, but just pretty. Mowgli's kidnapping scene by the monkeys was built in a blurry lazy fashion, and i wonder how could the same people who conceived the temple sequence allow for such a boring nothing. I would like to see this technology and this story told by someone more meditative and who acknowledges the power of the language. Not unlike Shakespeare, Kipling's images are hampered by language. He is mostly and foremost a poet, a man of visual imagination who produces his imagination with language. As one would expect from a Disney box- office oriented production, all risks were minimized, so the characters (and how they speak) were simplified. For politic correctness sake, they also watered down the racist and colonialist views of Kipling, without subverting them deliberately, kind of leaving it ambiguously halfway. Maybe if the USA elects Trump they remake this...They got storytelling and space in the temple sequence, but they didn't make the effort to try and tie the sense of place to the language that forms Kipling's vision. Instead they replaced language with nice sets, which are nevertheless not so sweet as to make me forget the original poetry. I guess that's a conundrum: when you are willing to take chances you usually don't have access to the kind of ambitious industrial machinery of such a company as Disney; yet when you do get behind the wheel of such a studio, the high budget means that you have to minimize risks...",

            "content": "\"The Jungle Book\" was one of my favorite TV series that aired in the Doordarshan in the early '90s. The story has been retold through several movies and this latest blockbuster also does the same. It tells the story of Mowgli, a young boy, grown by a pack of wolves in an Indian Jungle. Disney Pictures this time takes into the CGI over the conventional 2D animation and creates a stunningly superb visual feast. It's certainly something very different you've ever seen. The jungles, animals are all a part of a CGI animation and with the superb techniques you're taken to an hour long drive to the forests in which everything looks for real. Instead of the distant shots, the film uses close shots for which the film looks visually pleasing. No doubt, technically the film is somewhat a testimony of something you've ever encountered in movies.The acting of the boy as Mowgli and his screen presence looks astounding and the voices given to the animals get quite well. But the grave problem in the film is the lack of the wittiness and charm in its narrative. For one third of the film, there seems a bit of charm and laughter which soon disappears and falls into the computer glitches. Somewhere the innocence, wit, and surprises get lost for which the film though being technically superb starts to lose your attention by the second half.Rating: 1.5 stars out of 4",

            "content": "The Jungle Book (2016): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Neel Sethi / Voices: Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Christopher Walken: Visually festive remake of the classic 1967 Disney animation. Director Jon Favreau does an effective job at capturing the spirit on the animation while presenting a whole new visual approach. Neel Sethi plays Mowgli who was raised by wolves in the jungle when his father is killed by Shere Khan the murderous tiger that terrifies the other creatures. Bill Murray voices Baloo the bear who saves Mowgli from the coils of python Kaa who has him hypnotized to certain death. Baloo forms a bond with Mowgli yet still talks the skilled youngster into the dangerous task of fetching honey. Ben Kingsley voices Bagheera the panther who originally found Mowgli and acts as his adviser. Idris Elba voices the menacing Shere Khan whose presence strikes fear as he stalks Mowgli with promise to end his life. Christopher Walken does a great song and dance number voicing the oversized orangutan King Louie who hopes to form an alliance with Mowgli who refuses. His opening scene is a great reference to the shadowy entrance of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. Scarlett Johansson voices the spellbinding python Kaa who has Mowgli in her coils until Baloo makes the save. Favreau proves his love for the Disney animation with this accurate telling. While one may question the existence of bears and wolves in the jungle, this update is worthy yet perhaps too dark for young children. It presents the jungle in all its ominous glory while bringing life to the animation that inspired its vision. Score: 9 / 10",

            "content": "This is just a typicall example of how Hollywood doesn't have an inspiration when it comes to movie stories. This movie is just everything you ever saw in either an animation movie or in a movie in general. Yet critics were blown away in the case of this movie just like they were with \"the shape of water\". This movie is a fun adventure in the jungle nothing more. It's basically \"the lion king\" but with a kid instead of a lion. Everything this movie's storry had for me I've already seen it in either \"the lion king\" or in another movie. The story is without doubt interesting and somewhat mature but it doesn't have that suction of the viewer in it like the classic jungle-based movies had it. It is although very nice and entertaining to watch it but it's not as captivating as you would expect. Another problem is the lack of background for some characters and some events that influence the main conflict in this movie. Aside from that there was another thing that bothered me: the performance of the kid who played Mowgli (don't know his name). His performance was very underwhelming and at certain points cutted my elan and interest in the story. The villain was however very good. He started pretty typical but by the he end of the movie all the pieces come in place and you see its full character and motives. The voice acting was formidable especially from the guy who played the bear, Scarlet Johanson and Ben Kingsley I guess who played the panther. Another thing that made me enjoy this movie and liked it as much as I did was the visuals. I mean honestly how could human beings do this? How much work was there in the visuals for this movie? I mean it! It's like 90% of the movie is CGI and is seamless. There are moments where I couldn't know if the environment was real or just CGI. That was achieved maybe due to the great cinematography that made the transitions between the two almost unnoticeable. The score was good and it enhanced he movie quite a lot but at no point I was impressed or left wondering how thematic and musical it is. Anyway in conclusion this movie is just a typically entertaining Hollywod-jungle movie with fabulous visuals, great voice performances but with some originality issues and a underwhelming performance by the lead actor. 8/10",

            "content": "Coming off the recent trend of Disney trying to re-imagining their older cartoon films as new live-action films and competition of a similar film being produce from the source material, 2018's Jungle Book: Origins by Warner Bros; director Jon Favreau's film adaptation really does shine! This 2016's live-action version followed author Rudyard Kipling's novel of the same name, more closely than the 1967's Disney animation film or the 1994's live-action version, ever was. With its dramatic, dark, and sinister tone, it add some really need intense dramatic to a film franchise that was mostly seem, as a kid's movie. Now that, it has a better adult-driven more accuracy story, it has more range in entertaining, not only Disney fanatics, but general film lovers. It's no wonder, why this movie was getting some big praise. However, the dark & violent tone might be too much for young audiences, so parents choose wisely. The plot follows the story of Mowgli (Neel Sethi), a feral child raised in the Indian jungle by wolves, after being abandoned as a baby by his human parents. Only to find himself, needing to flee his newly found home, after a serious threat from the tiger, Shere Khan (Voiced by Idris Elba) is made, against him. Guided by his mentor, Bagheera the panther (Voiced by Ben Kingsley) and his friend, Baloo the Bear (Voiced by Bill Murray), Mowgli must embarks on a journey of self-discovery on his way, back to human civilization. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the CGI visuals are amazing! The way, they were able to make a realistic jungle settling with computer-generated VFX was breath-taking beautiful. Watching the film in 3D, it was easy to be immersed in its world. I also love, how all of the animal look like they were really there. It really shows, how far, computer animation and motion-capture has gone! Fortunately Justin Marks' screenplay brings real depth to the important creatures in Mowgli's life, turning them into fully-developed characters with their own motivations and desires. However, it's was a bit jarring to see these characters, being voiced by all new actors, rather than them, copying the original voice-actors voices in the 1960s version. It's hard for me, not to think of Baloo the Bear without hearing the voice of Phil Harris. He had the suave tone in his voice that made the character, so cool and laid back. Don't get me wrong, Bill Murray did alright with the role, but his style of acting laid back, remind me, too much of Garfield from the Garfield movies (2004-2006). It was odd. Another weird choice of voice-actors, was Christopher Walken as King Louie. Yes, I kinda like, how they make King Louie seem more like a scary mob-boss in this version, but if I had to pick one over the other. I have to pick Louis Prima's version in the 1967 film, over this. I just love, how fun & groovy, he was. Plus, did we really needed, more psychopath villains for Mowgli to deal with? Honestly, I don't get, why in this version, Mowgli would love to stay in the jungle? It makes sense, in the original Disney film, since everybody seem cool. In this film, everything is out to kill him. Not pleasing at all. Also, the idea of making the character, a gigantopithecus, an ancestor of the orangutan is really confusing for me. Yes, I get that, this change in species was made to make the film more fantastic, since orangutans are not native to India, while gigantopithecus is believed to have included parts of India at one time. Nevertheless, it made India look like Skull Island from 1933's King Kong. Nonetheless, not all the changes, were bad. Turning Kaa the Snake (Voiced by Scarlett Johansson) into a badass femme fatale character than a comical villain was great, despite the fact that Kaa was one of Mowgli's allies and mentors in the original book. Another is turning Shere Khan into a far more menacing and stoic villain than he was in the original stories and films. On the other hand, Shere Khan in the original stories is smarter, & in the original film, had a specifically for being sinister yet simultaneously suave and gentlemanly demeanor. Neel Sethi as Mowgli was also, great. He was able to show Mowgli's stubborn and whining side, without being too annoying. Given the range of Sethi's performance, it's impressive to realize that he often acted against nothing, as The Jungle Book was filmed largely on a green screen. Not only that, but his character was able to do more in this film than the original 1967 film, showing how he can be a formidable predator when he use his brain. Yet, I kinda like the 1967 bittersweet ending with Mowgli, over this film's end. Still, both of these films endings, beats the bad ending of the book, where Mowgli is kick out of the village, after being mistaken for a shape-shifting sorcerer. Another thing, I kinda glad, the movie didn't add from the book is the war between the wolves and the Dholes. I found that part, very time-wasting. Also, it's worth noting, that not all of the stories in Jungle Book concerned Mowgli; the most well-known exceptions being \"Rikki Tikki Tavi\", \"Toomai of the Elephants\", \"The Miracle of Purun Bhagat\", and \"The Undertakers\". So if you like those stories, this film wouldn't have it. One thing, I kinda miss from the original movie was the good music. Not having strong versions of 'The Bare Necessities\"! & \"I Wan'na Be Like You\" was a let-down. Still, I'm kinda glad, that Bill Murray and Christopher Walken didn't sing for too long. They can't sing at all, by the looks at it. Overall: While, the movie is epic in scope, in its core is a very well-paced human tale that resonates just as strongly no matter how spectacular its visuals are. It's a must-watch for sure.",

            "content": "One thing in advance: I am a big fan of the Disney movie of 1967, titled \"Jungle Book\", directed by Wolfgang Reitherman. But since I am also a big fan of Kipling's Jungle Books, I know that Reitherman's Cartoon is (at best) inspired by the books; basically, the movie uses only the setting and the names; the characters are completely different.So far, only Korda's \"Jungle Book\" of 1942 is a relatively faithful adaption of (some of) the Mowgli-Stories in the Jungle Books. Based on the trailers, I hoped Jon Favreau's new adaption would be at least a bit closer to the books than Reitherman's movie. Even more hope I drew from the first 10 minutes of the movie: The optics are wonderful, and there are elements in the new movie, which were taken from the books, not the Cartoon: Especially the scenes with the peace rock and the buffalo stampede. After that, though, the plot is (more or less) based on Reitherman's movie. The mood is darker, yes, but this change is not consistent: There is also some comic relief, delivered especially by Baloo.But this is \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 not the worst mistake of Favreau and his author Justin Marks. They have even included three of the songs from Reitherman's movie! Of course, these songs are great, and they worked wonderfully in the cartoon. In this movie, they are hopelessly out of place \u2013 they would still be out of place, if the performances would be good, but they are not! Bill Murray, Christopher Walken & Scarlett Johannson might be great actors; they are definitely no great singers.This brings me to the casting: Obviously, the filmmakers have preferred great names to great voices. Only Idris Elba did a good job; Ben Kingsley and Christopher Walken (apart from the singing!) were okay; Johansson's performance was poor. What a tiny voice for a 30-feet-Python! Bottom line: It seems to me that Favreau & Marks wanted to do a movie closer to the mood of the books, but also wanted to keep certain elements from Reitherman's movie. At least this would explain the inconsistencies of this movie. What a pity, especially since there is a good template for a \"Jungle Book\"-movie, based on Kipling: The so-called \"Jungle Play\".",

The main problem is, we all knows the story already, so we just keep ourselves ready to watch upcoming scene, and that kills all the Excitement and thrill. Film runtime is approx 105 mins so its all about story telling from the very first minute. But movie fails to entertain in comedy way and fails to connect audience emotionally. I am a 90's kid so its a very special story for me, its like revisiting my childhood days in theater. And i appreciate makers for huge production value. 3D effects were fab, if you really want to watch this movie then should not miss watching it in 3D. Screenplay was good, it keeps you hooked for 100 mins. Sound work is fantastic which helps in giving you jitters. I personally think, those Sher Khan scenes could have been more dangerous and especially his death scene could have been more interesting which is very ordinary actually. What to talk about Acting...? Its all about Visual effects. I don't want to write much about this movie because i'm from India, and this movie is yet to release in overseas markets so i don't want to spoil fun. Direction was also good. Its not at all Masterpiece or classic but it is certainly a 1 time watch for kids and youth. I expected it to be a classic but it fails slightly short so i am giving it 7/10 rating.

Some of the settings are enhanced by the technology.

Overall, the effects were obviously amazing and the personalities in each animal were pretty good for how lifelike they looked. For the most part, it related fairly well to the original, but also included some new occurrences as well (especially at the end of the battle between Mowgli and Shere Kahn). It was also well emphasized with the wolves from the beginning of the original as well as the overall \"government\" of the jungle itself. It's certainly a bit on the edge-of-your-seat, and yet not so much that kids would get too concerned. Glad the film ended up doing well.",

I was not sold when I first saw the trailer, but if you had your doubts... go buy your ticket already! The extra money for 3D is totally worth it.Let's start with the obvious: the visual effects are mind-blowing. Jon Favreau re-created the jungle in a perfect CGI environment. At multiple times during the film I was wondering if the animals and the environment were real or CGI. The fact that it's all CGI is very impressive. The muscular structure, the fur and the behavior of the animals were incredibly realistic. But what's great about the Jungle Book is that the movie doesn't rely on the special effects to entertain. The best parts of the film can be found in the little moments. For example, I really enjoyed the scene where Mowgli and Baloo are working together to stack some honey. The interaction between the different species were very entertaining to watch. Also, I raise my hat to Disney for the 'casting' of Mowgli and the voice-overs. It's not easy to cast a young actor that is going to play behind green screens, and actually pull it off. I'm really looking forward to watch the Blu-Ray featurette where they going to explain how they filmed some of the scenes.It was not a perfect movie but Disney were able to make me care about those animals and the story. I was a bit tired before I went to the late showing but I didn't see the time past while I was watching it. I hope this is going to get some Oscar recognition for the Visual Effects. Looking forward to 'The Jungle Book II'.8.5/10",

After the second rewatch at least two years later I have to say it's not as bad as I thought, but it's not very good either. Technically is great: direction, music, photography are all on point and the visual effects are stunning. The story is simple and linear with no plot holes but on the other hand I found myself really bored for a part of the first act and for most of the second one. The parts I preferred were the old (but revisited) songs and everything after the meeting of King Louis because it is when the movie finally picks it up a little bit.\nThis 'The Jungle Book' version is fortunately not a copy and paste in digital of the original one, but there's clearly the willingness to give another read on the story and another tone. Although this work is done properly I found myself preferred the animated version because it is more enjoyable than this one, which I felt is unable to entertain for too many time.",

            "content": "There is no doubt that the 1967 \"Jungle Book\" is one of the most iconic Disney films of all time. As such, it was going to be difficult for this 2016 version to live up to the billing. Whenever I'm watching a direct remake of an existing property, I like to ask myself \"is this adding anything new to the proceedings?\". While \"Jungle Book\" potentially fails that test (a darker, more serious tone would be the biggest change from the original), the visuals are so astounding and the voice-acting so incredible that it still manages to be an entertaining, engaging experience.For a basic plot summary, \"Jungle Book\" tells the story of Mowgli (Neel Sethi), a young boy abandoned in the forest and raised by the wolf pack, ostensibly led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o). One day, however, feared king of the jungle tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) confronts the wolves and lays down an ultimatum: \"man cub\" Mowgli must leave the jungle (or be killed) before he turns into a full-fledged man. Not wanting to cause trouble, Mowgli volunteers to leave, setting off with Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) the panther to begin the journey back to the man-village. Along the way, however, Mowgli meets such colorful characters as Baloo (Bill Murray) the bear, Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) the serpent, and King Louie (Christopher Walken) of the apes.When evaluated strictly in terms of plot, \"Jungle Book\" was a middling effort for me. While it sets an understandably darker tone than the original and tries to weave a few more human aspects into Mowgli's character, I can't say that I was ever impressed by any specific plots/messages/themes throughout. It isn't \"bad\" either, per se, but just not all the compelling plot-wise.There are two areas, however, where \"Jungle Book\" shines and turned into a fun viewing experience for me:1. The incredible visuals. I don't believe I've ever seen a film where the animals look so close to their real-life forms. Clearly, expert digital craftsmanship (and likely thousands of hours of painstaking time!) was put into every pixel. Short of watching a nature documentary on the Discovery Channel, this is the closest you'll ever get to feeling as if you are actually in the jungle. A fight between Shere Khan & Baloo/Bagheera towards the end of the film had the hair on the back of my neck standing up! 2. The voice-acting. Much like its predecessor, this film also casts the perfect voices for its plethora of jungle creatures. None are boring, all sound beautiful/unique, and each brings a special flair to their characters.So, though I am usually more plot-focused when it comes to saying I enjoyed watching any given film, \"Jungle Book\" was a bit of an exception to the rule in that it completely overwhelmed me with visuals/voice acting. Even if this '16 version never rests on the same pedestal as the original (and let's be honest here\u0085that isn't going to happen), it is a worthwhile achievement just for the technological advancement in digital animation alone.",

            "content": "\"The Jungle Book\" is one of my favorite Disney movies, being an incredible classic during my childhood. Now, as it gains its second live-action reincarnation (there's still the 1994 version), it sets up a standard for the 2016 version to achieve. And in prospect, this is one is very rewarding.For starters, this \"Jungle Book\" movie actually derives away slightly from the animated predecessor. Instead, it settles more on the Rudyard Kipling source material, complimented by its darker tone and deeper morals. But it still has the same storyline. As Mowgli (Neel Sethi) comes of age, he is being hunted by ferocious tiger Shere Khan (a menacingly excellent Idris Elba). So it is up to caring panther Bagheera (a supportive Ben Kingsley, also doing the narration), carefree Baloo (a comically game Bill Murray) and the hospitable wolves led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita N'yongo) to protect Mowgli, and for Mowgli to set his destiny, whether as a man or in the jungle.Initially, I was quite skeptical of how director Jon Favreau executed the story. But knowing that this is more loyal to the book series, its unorthodox execution fits. As a result, Favreau, together with cinematographer Bill Pope (\"The Matrix\") and visual effects houses Moving Picture Company and Weta Digital, was able to craft a visual splendor of stunning effects and beautiful animation.As for the performances, the ensemble vocal cast is at their A-game, with the addition of Christopher Walken as King Louie and Scarlett Johansson as Kaa. But the true MVP is Neel Sethi, who makes a compelling Mogwli, being an inventive and wholehearted boy. And it shows how Sethi is committed to blend his character to a blue screen and to interact with none-present beings.If there are flaws in here, it is that the main animal characters are not that much fleshed out. They are basically given too obvious traits. The versions of three of the Sherman Brothers songs are executed in an uncanny manner. And fans of the original will be indecisive of how much changes were made out of the original.In the end, \"The Jungle Book\" is another \"Life of Pi\" adventure. But it is complimented by Favreau's direction, the topnotch visual effects and the excellent vocal and live-action performances. And at least it is better than Disney's other live-action versions of their animated movies.",

            "content": "I watched this without any prior anticipation or much foreknowledge. But it turned out to be a great mixture of Life of Pi and the original; a good film, definitely.Surprisingly, it's a very intense, gripping film, different to the classic 1967 movie which was a light-hearted and jazzy musical. This new film adopts the visuals and drama of something like Life of Pi whilst keeping some of the classic Disney movie tropes, as the light-heartedness and comedy does remain. The thing The Jungle Book does best, however, is its visuals. From the wolves to the elephants and to Shere Khan himself, the CGI is top-class, and the scene of the jungle is brilliantly created as the detailed wildlife is a very nice touch \u2014 little animals doing amusing little things everywhere you look. Cinematography is also used to great effect, especially visible in the Kaa scene.Aside from its looks, The Jungle Book may not be a masterpiece, but for entertainment it is up there with the best in the last couple of years. Not Star Wars: the Force Awakens level, but not actually that far from it. It follows a simple yet effective story in which Mowgli is the victim of Shere Khan's lust for power and he has to run in different directions to escape his grip, inevitably of course bumping into classic characters like Baloo and King Louie along his merry way. Neel Sethi's Mowgli is a simple but charming character, and with him you as the viewer are taken through his journey, being forced to relate to and fear for him as he runs through the many dangers he encounters.Neel Sethi is in the centre of what is a fantastically picked cast of recognisable actors. Bill Murray in particular is perfect as the recreated Baloo, and good ol' Christopher Walken does a good King Louie (there was no bit o' wee for me though, unlike Milo). In fact, I can't really pick flaw with any of them, other than maybe Neel Sethi for being a bit bland sometimes \u2014 but he's a kid, he can get away with it.Everything that is recreated in the film is recreated in a good way. Baloo in particular adopts Bill Murray's sense of humour at the same time as being similar to the old Baloo that everyone grew to love, and through his character the film's light-hearted side is brought to life, though fairly subtly as otherwise it would overwhelm the rest of the film's intense adventure-like feel. In fact, the two different feels work in harmony, as action-driven sequences are split up by nice lil' funny Baloo sequences.King Louie embodies what is different between the original and this new film. Though he still sings the classic \"I wanna be like you\" song \u2013 well, I might add; he carries a sinister veil and a dark part of the story not quite represented in the animated original, where he talks of greed and the \"red flower\", siting the change in approach for this shadowy adaption. It's presented very well, too \u2014 a particularly good ten or so minutes.If there is one thing negative I can say about The Jungle Book is that everything really is very simple, and everything that happens at the end, though tense, definitely isn't unexpected. Maybe that's due to the source material, I don't know. But maybe some things more complex could have been added in for the older audience. Despite its simplicity, though, it is a highly entertaining film filled with great performances and impressive visuals, with a good blend between light-heartedness and things more sinister. And I wouldn't say it made me want to watch the original. It's not a deep masterpiece quite like Life of Pi, but this could be an unexpected addition to this year's best movies.",

He followed it up with Pinocchio and just kept going with classics like Dumbo, Bambi, Cinderella, Alice In Wonderland and Peter Pan. He broke the mold again in 1964 when he combined animated characters with live action in Mary Poppins. In 1967, Disney released their 19th animated feature film, The Jungle Book based on the novel by Rudyard Kipling. In 2010, Disney teamed up with director Tim Burton to bring their animated classic Alice in Wonderland to life with Johnny Depp as the classic Mad Hatter. In 2014, Maleficent was released as the live action version of Sleeping Beauty starring Angelina Jolie. In 2015, the live action version of Cinderella hit theatres. This year, we were blessed with two releases in this new tradition: Pete's Dragon and The Jungle Book. Next year, Beauty and the Beast will be released. Looking at Disney's page of future releases, this is just the beginning. The Jungle Book is the story of Mowgli, a boy raised by wolves in the jungle. He is forced to leave his home when threatened by the Tiger Shere Kahn. He embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the help of his protector the Panther Bagheera and his new friend the Bear Baloo. The preview looked breath-taking. The animation, the action and the scenery looked all unbelievably believable, and the movie delivered in a big way. Newcomer Neel Sethi plays Mowgli, but he's surrounded by an all-star cast. He's in the capable hands of Director Jon Favreau and has Bill Murray (Baloo), Ben Kingsley (Bagheera), Idris Elba (Shere Kahn), Scarlett Johansson (Kaa), and Christopher Walken (King Louie) to keep him company. Watching The Jungle Book, I started in awe wondering how much of the set and how many of the animals were real and how much of all of this incredible film was created digitally. Eventually, I stopped asking and just enjoyed the journey thoroughly. I watched the 30 minute Blu Ray extra documentary about the making of the film and was surprised to find that very little of the set was real, mostly performed on blue screens, and none of the animals were real. All of it was flawlessly created by a computer and the geniuses at Disney. Coming up, the live action version of Beauty and the Beast will star Emma Watson. Disney also plans to remake Pinocchio, Peter Pan, The Little Mermaid and Dumbo. Dumbo is always one that tore at my heart and made my eyes well up. This one is going to be directed by Tim Burton and I cannot wait to see what they can create.I predicted 4.5 stars for this live action re-imagination of the Disney classic and it did not disappoint in the slightest. The Jungle Book was nearly perfect and is destined to find a home in my personal collection.",

The film introduces Neel Sethi as Mowgli and also features the voices of Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Lupita Nyong'o, Scarlett Johansson, Giancarlo Esposito and Christopher Walken.The best part of this film for me was of course the animals.

John Favreau managed to take a beloved childhood classic and breathe new life into it.Something that I was a little weary at first about, and what essentially turned into one of the best parts of the movie, are the animals and the way they're animated. Before the movie came out I was trying to picture how the animals would look when speaking. I didn't want to see the constantly used, over the top, obnoxious looking animation that I sadly sort of expect. What was shown, however, was nowhere near obnoxious. Instead, the animation when the animals speak is very clean and smooth. The young actor, Neel Sethi, was simply amazing. It's hard to believe he's so young because his performance is 100 times better than even the more seasoned actors. He really embodied the roll of Mowgli, and I doubt anyone else could have pulled it off as well. All the actors were cast perfectly in their respective rolls. Even the ones I was a little weary about at first (Scarlett Johansen as Kaa, and Christopher Watkins as King Louie) did amazing. Watkins King Louie scene was easily one of my favorite parts of the entire movie. What he brought to the character is nothing short of pure awesome. The one very small criticism I have would be some of the consistency when it came to the animal's animation. For the most part the animation is so life-like it's insane. But some of the animals looked a little too \"cartoony\" to really flow with the rest. They were very few and between, and definitely not something that ruins the movie. The graphics are not just beautiful, they're stunning. Watching it in 3D enhanced the beauty, and also added more depth to the film, making you feel like you're right there in the jungle (3D doing what it's supposed to do). If you're a fan of the 67' version, I can guarantee you that you will come away from this movie very pleased. Also, stay through the credits.

You never feel like someone is just reading a script in a booth (like you do many times in Lion King) and that helps deliver the message of \"accepting others even though different\" very well. The story is not a complete copy of the original (unlike Lion King) which helps give it more freshness. I don't know how director Jon Farveau's (he directed both Jungle Book and Lion King) two movies could feel so apart from each other in quality. Perhaps Disney executives got involved in the casting of the most recent movie? The original Jungle Book is not a very popular animated film in my opinion, so maybe that's why Disney selected actors and not singers for this one.",

            "content": "Mowgli is a young boy raised by wolves in the jungle. He gets along with the other animals, but for one. Shere Khan, a tiger and king of the jungle, is angered at Mowgli's presence, as he knows Mowgli will one day grow up and adult humans are a threat. Mowgli leaves the pack and makes for the nearest human settlement, but this isn't enough for Shere Khan, who is determined to see him dead.Based on the Rudyard Kipling novel and with roughly the same central plot as the famous 1967 version, this is not in the same league as that version. While the 1967 one had a wonderfully innocent, feel- good vibrancy to it, aided by some great, stick-in-your-head songs, this version is much darker and far less energetic. While this is not necessarily a bad thing it just doesn't work as well for the story. The songs are what carried the 1967 version along and made it so memorable, and, but for two tunes, the 2016 version is music- less. Having decided to make a dark drama, director Jon Favreau then tries to introduce comedy/lightheartedness, in the form of Baloo, and this jars with the remainder of the movie, feels forced and largely falls flat. On the plus side, the CGI is great (though that is a given for a 2016 movie). Overall, mildly entertaining. Do yourself a favour: watch the 1967 version instead. (Never thought I'd find myself preferring a musical version of a movie to a largely-non-musical version, but there it is).",

            "content": "The imagery, as expected, was beautifully done. But that's to be anticipated these days when a studio has hundreds of millions to spend on a film.What I look at is story and acting, and this movie came close to being 'great', but stumbled in a few places where it really shouldn't have.The good: 1. Mowgli. He wasn't the stubborn little idiot of the 1967 film with whom, let's all admit it... we were rooting for Kaa. ;D In this picture he's much more sensible and pragmatic about his circumstances, while still exhibiting enough 'childlike' traits to be believable. His inventiveness is a little over-the-top, but not impossible if he'd been playing his 'tricks' for several years. A creative mind with the dangers and hardships of the jungle surrounding him might become very innovative indeed with simple tools after basic investigation.2. Bagheerah and Baloo, I was quite pleased with the new incarnations, with just a few little factual foibles that I doubt many save me, with my intense attention to detail, would have noticed.3. The wolves. Much more characterization with them and the difficulties of their decision were very believably put together.4. The ending. Thank god Mowgli didn't just turn into a drooling sap at the sight of a village girl. I always disliked that about the ending of the 1967 film. Not only was it not at all like the Kipling version, it also felt totally unbelievable. No one instantly abandons the friends and family they have known all their lives the first instant they see a hot chick. Especially not as a child, when familial bonds dominate. This Mowgli, having fought such a fierce battle and made such powerful connections, would be even LESS likely to leave. Having him stay was the right choice.The 'meh': 1. King Louie. I don't think they needed to make him into an extinct species of ape. Remember, this film is set around the 18th-19th centuries. People traveled and traded extensively around the world by that time. Is it so hard to think an orangutan might have been brought to India at a time, and escaped during a conflict (quite prevalent) after having seen the power of the Red Flower first-hand, then being accepted as King of the Bandar-log because of his greater size, intelligence (orangutans are very intelligent) and unique form, and the his story of escape from Man... all of which would mark him as something greater than the other monkeys so far as they knew? Also, the Mafioso New York accent and his sudden singing felt out of place in the rest of the film, and even in the scene itself didn't quite fit. 2. Shere Khan. He was a strong villain... clearly cruel and sadistic... but that's about it. He was a basic bully without even the charm or wit of the 67' Khan. There needed to be a bit more to him, something of a personality besides a blunt killing machine. The small scene with the wolf cubs began to give him just a touch of sinister cunning, but that was the only trace of what he could have evolved into. Mowgli and Khan were the primary protagonist and antagonist with very interconnected pasts! That Mowgli didn't even bring up the obvious contention that Khan was the one doing all the killing and forcing Mowgli to become like other Men to stop him was a bit less than I'd hoped. 3. The elephants. They were rather interesting in some respects, but I question why they couldn't speak, or didn't choose to, to the other animals and Mowgli. I completely get the idea that they were being treated as a force of creation by the other animals, but giving them a bit of individuality would have been nice in addition to the hint of mortality we and Bageerah saw when Mowgli aided them at the pit.The disappointing 1. Kaa. The most disappointing part of the film. The character seemed to be here solely due to obligation. 'Her' part existed as a one-shot, fairly one-sided conflict and minor exposition dump... despite leaving everyone in my group agreeing with my contention that, from the story we're given, there is NO WAY Kaa could have known so much about Mowgli's past. That is an open plot hole, and everyone in my viewing group noticed it. The segment wasn't even needed to introduce Baloo, as some have suggested. Mowgli was unconscious/asleep on the log before coming across Kaa's tree. He could have simply bumped into Baloo right off the bat and nothing would have changed. Baloo could have claimed he saved the boy from drowning instead of from the snake, and the life debt plot point would have remained intact. Bageerah could then have told him, later on, where he found Mowgli and that Shere Khan had killed his father, thus granting the flashback history moment. Kaa served no purpose to the story, and that's quite a shame, as Kaa has always been one of the most interesting characters in the story... in either Kipling's original or the Disney version. His strange dynamic with the other creatures in the jungle warranted a much greater exploration, and I can only hope they do so in the sequel.2. Shere Khan's death, acceptable but very clich\u00e9. Villains falling to their doom is really getting old in Disney films. We could watch Mowgli getting cut up by claws... was it too much to at least impale the total jerk of a tiger? So, overall an improvement on all the previous versions, but just a little bit more work on those few aspects of the story I noted would have truly put it over the top and made it unassailable as the BEST POSSIBLE take on the Disney version of the story.",

            "content": "\"They want to send you to the man-village? I say, you can be a man right here!\" Baloo (voice of Bill Murray)In the new version of The Jungle Book, Baloo is insightful, in a modern way, about men's development needing to be expressed in the environment most suited to their core selves. Director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Marks have scored a home run with this coming of age story, in which Mowgli (Neel Sethi) leaves home to find his true nature. Rarely will you ever see such a rich combination of animated realism, from forest to creatures, and witty conversation, animals and man-cub alike. When Baloo, Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) and Mowgli banter, you listen intently lest you miss one word of brilliant, human repartee:Bagheera: \"Come on, Mowgli. Let's be on our way.\" Mowgli: \"But I'm helping Baloo get ready for hibernation.\"Bagheera: \"Bears don't hibernate in the jungle.\" Baloo: \"Not full hibernation, but I nap a lot.\" The talk is spicy and witty throughout, from the hip King Louie (Christopher Walken):\"Kid, I got ears. My ears got ears.\" or the insidious serpent Kaa (Scarlett Johansson): \"Let go of your fear now... and trussst in meee....\"Mostly, however, the talk is about Mowgli's role as a member of the wolf pack or human society. The story weaves between his benign environment (yes, Shere Khan\u2014voice of Idris Elba\u2014is a bad tiger but an anomaly in this paradise) and the need to be protected from Khan by sending him to his native home among humans. So does the allegory work for any young adventurer caught between home and adventure abroad, where he will not always be welcome: \"Mowgli... they've given it a name! When was it we come to adopt man to this jungle?\" Shere Khan Only in a Disney fantasy world can the boy have it both ways. See for yourself, and bring your family\u2014it's that good.",

            "content": "When I first heard that Disney was remaking The Jungle Book and reviving it into live action I was actually thinking this had potential if they did the right way. And I must say, they did a marvelous job. First, the CGI is amazing, it's so well-done I completely forgot it was, and the surroundings were so real looking. But not only did the surroundings look impressive, the animal characters were even more so. I think they actually improved on the characters from the original animated film, especially the black panther Bagheera. Lets talk about him for a little bit. They transpired him so much that he isn't the same character as he was in the animated film. Sure he is still proper, mature, and all those traits that he has, but in here, they expose more of Mowgli and Bagheera's relationship. Bagheera, every time he's on screen my eyes are glued onto him, he took my breath away when he first appeared. Furthermore, when he wasn't on screen I was finding myself wondering where he is, which is a good thing, it means I really enjoy that character's presence. Ben Kingsley's voice perfectly matches Bagheera's personality, and is a well-rounded character inside and out. The other characters like Baloo and Shere Khan each offered something wonderful as well. Baloo who is the more comedic side compared to Bagheera, and is just a big teddy bear. Bill Murray is the perfect casting for Baloo, with that same Murray humor we all know and love. Shere Khan is about as menacing as any villain I have seen in a very long time. He mean business and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. To his credit, the reason he has to perform his deeds is actually very reasonable and agreeable. I actually find his motivations quite understandable. However, like the animation I don't really like the way they killed him. I think a villain as wonderfully scary as him deserves a better battle and conclusion. The overall battle is actually better then the animation. Instead of tying a flaming tree branch to his tail, they actually fight and every character is involved. Not just Mowgli and Baloo like the animation, but Bagheera as well. The wolves also get involved and is a very good battle, just would have liked the conclusion to be better. Kaa, the snake voiced by Scarlett Johansson is possibly the weakest character in that she didn't do much, however she wasn't entirely useless. She did give us a back-story into how Mowgli was found by Bagheera which is actually my favorite scene in the entire film, so Kaa isn't useless. Lastly, King Louie played by Christopher Walken was the only character that didn't change much between the animated film and this one. He's still the same glory hound he was, but in this he is much more intimidating. Bigger in size, and Walken's voice gave him a powerful presence. The story overall is wonderful, closely resembling the book by Rudyard Kipling. Like the book, Bagheera is more of a wise old but bad-ass cat, Baloo is silly, but not cartoony with a little more of a lazy, grumpy side to him. Shere Khan is more ferocious, Kaa's role is diminished, and Mowgli is still the same adventurous Mowgli he always was. This is a film worth the money, I personally enjoyed it very much. One more thing I have to say is kids under the age of 7 shouldn't watch, this is for teens and young adults, but if you think your kids can handle to dark and gritty film that is Jungle Book, then I say go for it, watch it and enjoy the epic and breathtaking film.

            "content": "This was such a beautiful film, not just artistically but also because it brought to life the story of Mowgli and they did a fantastic job of recapturing the magic that was in the animated feature while also giving this film its own sort of magic. However, some of that magic transcends the film and the story and creates this breathtaking performance between the actor and the voice actors.The most unbelievable aspect of this movie is the fact that Mowgli (Neel Sethi) was on the set alone aside from crew members and the director. That is just a testament to the talent of not only Sethi but also a testament to the directing power of Jon Favreau. Favreau was able to direct this child alone on set and make sure that this young actor was able to give the most believable performance possible. Of course, Sethi was able to create an unbelievable and incredible performance that was just breathtaking. Honestly the acting, voice acting and all, it was just remarkable because these voice actors, it's as if they parts were molded to them, They were the perfect cast for the film, the perfect cast to bring this film to life.This movie is very much both alike and different from the original animated version. It does stay closer to the actual text and gets very dark, but there is hope and light in this film that flourishes. The rest of this movie goes towards that sort of magic. The film flows perfectly, and it builds emotion and momentum continuously and draws the viewer in, once again, making it unbelievable that these are CGI animations versus actual animals talking. The movie is structured and filmed to beautifully that it tricks the audience into believing this is real, into believing everything is real, that the film itself is real. That is the magic here.Favreau and his entire crew were incredible; they were clever in how they structured the film and brilliant in how they decided to bring to life this iconic story. It tugs at the heartstrings, and it makes the viewer believe in magic and love, humanity and peace. It was beautiful at the end of the day and in writing, it was perfect. The writers were even able to capture some of the musical numbers from the original animated version, and they fit into this film perfectly. It recaptured the magic wonders from the original and created its own.Check out more reviews at https://cynsworkshop.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "The Jungle Book is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a stellar voice cast. I never thought I would ever say this about a remake, however, it genuinely improves on the original, establishing the adventure and feel for a jungle that the animated movie failed to do, developing the story much more and not making it as straight forward. The darker elements to the script made this a winner, there are scenes that are genuinely thrilling, keeping you at the edge of your seat. On the other hand, this movie does not establish Mowgli's relationships as well as the original, his bond with Baloo and Bagheera is glossed over, never coming across as sweet as it did in the 1967 version. I also found the \"cuteness\" unnecessary, showcasing talking puppies and mice just to make the younger audience happy, it spoils the films dark tone by throwing that in with it. The cast is terrific, Neal Sethi is very likable in the lead role, being the only live action actor, while the voice cast also shines, with stellar covers of \"Bare Neccessities\" and \"I Wanna Be Like You\" by Bill Murray and Christopher Walken, as well as a thrilling performance from the versatile Idris Elba as Shere Khan. Dark, adventurous and stunning to look at, The Jungle Book is a must see for Disney fans, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. Mowgli, a young boy living in the jungle, is forced to leave his family of wolves when he is under threat from a dangerous tiger, meeting new friends and foes along the way.",

I would recommend seeing this movie in 3D, which I don;t do very often, because most 3D movies are horrible in that format.The flow of the movie is really good, If I have one minor complaint is that 20 minutes into the movie, it seems to drag, but after that, it is forgotten , and you are glued to your seats.The action will keep you gripped to your seats, and there are a few scary and intense moment that might give children under the age of 10 nightmares.This movie, I have a feeling will be a very slow burn, as far as the money making potential.

            "content": "While it's never going to be regarded in the same fashion as its beloved animated namesake from 1967 or the very book it's based upon in the form of Rudyard Kipling's revered novel, Iron Man director Jon Favreau's well-meaning and entertaining Jungle Book update is a pure visual treat, that while missing the mark when it comes to heart and emotion, creates one of the most impressive CGI worlds we've been privy to in quite some time.Every inch of this almost exclusively computer generated world that our man cub Mowgli and his animal compatriots inhabit is intricately and wondrously designed. The wildlife looks so close to real you'll be doing double takes, close ups of tiger Shere Khan's face or monkey King Louie show the skills of the effects team in stunning fashion if one was to need proof of the workmanship on show here.The worry about these type of films is that the land we traverse with our characters feels fake or off putting but Favreau and his team should be commended for creating from scratch, a living, breathing environment that is a feast for the senses and will likely have children under the age of 10 under the illusion that this is indeed a real life magical jungle, which makes it that much more disappointing that The Jungle Book's failings come from its heart.With its film incarnations and adored books, The Jungle Book has engaged and enthralled viewers and readers for more than 100 years but seemingly in the midst of designing its intricate jungle and paying homage to the glories of the past whilst carving out its own path, Favreau's Jungle Book never truly lays hold on the emotion or soul that makes this story such a lovable journey.A large portion of the trouble to be found in connecting with this new age Jungle Book is in first time actor Neel Sethi as Mowgli, who struggles to find the balance between lovable jungle rugrat and annoying little kid and when the film requires him to do more than look like his having fun, he really buckles with the weight of requirement that's being passed onto his young shoulders. With Sethi the only real life presence in the film, Favreau finds some wins with his notable voice performers with particular mention needing to be made of Idris Elba's voice turn as Shere Khan who makes the fearsome tiger laden with menace and his a great addition to the film.Apart from Elba, Bill Murray as larrikin bear Baloo is entertaining while other voice performances from the likes of Lupita Nyong'o and Sir Ben Kingsley are fine without standing out, whilst Christopher Walken's appearance as King Louie becomes slightly off putting as you can't help escape the feeling it's just Walken being Walken with some added singing and extra fur.At the conclusion of this expedition to the jungle, it ends up being a mildly frustrating one as while Favreau has without question created a visual spectacle, his missed the mark by a fair margin when it comes to the heart and soul of a story that has in the past made its mark in the emotionally resonate stakes.The Jungle Book is a quick-fire and energetic experience and a likely winner when it comes to the children's market but with a little more concentration on the \"bear\" necessities that lay at the foundation of this touching tale and a better casting decision on who was to become Mowgli, this redoing of the beloved story could've been a genuine all round classic.3 pieces of honeycomb out of 5",

            "content": "I think I saw the original back in 1st grade and didn't care about it at all except for \"The Bare Necessities.\" So flash forward to present day when we have already had Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, and even Snow White redone. I had zero excitement about the update of The Jungle Book.Then I started to become curious. I read articles about how newcomer Neel Sethi did pretend basketball for his audition tape because of how much green screen and nothingness he would be working with. And I will start with Mowgli because he is fantastic. Think of Life of Pi as a reference point. But then think of a kid's imagination and why people might have fallen in love with the original in the first place. This kid brings the movie to life, and there wasn't a moment I wasn't impressed by him.Now for the jungle. It is beautiful. I have no idea how they were able to accomplish it, but it's so stunning. In an extended compliment, I tip my hat to Iron Man and Elf director Jon Favreau. Whether it's the placement of the animals or the way the camera moves with the jungle, the man knew exactly what he was looking for and he got it.Mowgli isn't quite on his own; you have an all-star cast lending their voices with Bill Murray, Idris Elba, and Christopher Walken being the highlights. Not only do they add with their voices, but the animals they represent are such a feat to behold. I loved how the camera would trail Mowgli talking to Bagheera the panther and the way the shoulder blades moved in stride with the walk. The look is there, the behavior is there, and the characters are there.The next thing is both a compliment and also one of the complaints I hold. The story arc follows Mowgli as he has all these different encounters with the creatures of the jungle-- whether for better or for worse. For the most part, the encounters are brief, for this movie had to be under 2 hours while still having scenes with all these different animals. And while segments with Kaa (Scarlet Johansson) or King Louie are welcomed, the main character isn't given much time to spend with Bagheera or Baloo; this is a problem becomes we're supposed to feel this bond grown that even though Mowgli is a man cub, he will instead choose the life with the animals he loves. And his interactions with Bagheera and Baloo are fantastic, but they don't provide the depth and framework that animated and kids movies often fall prey to. Furthermore, the two songs played are a great relief of pace, but they can't help that some scenes I described as brief still feel stretched. The pacing isn't quite there, and the development of the story suffers for it.There are moments that will probably scare some children, especially when the red flower is introduced, but the animals presented and the diverse characters they represent are fresh and needed. And there's no doubt that Bill Murray fits the bill as Baloo the bear. Top it off with the beautiful jungle and some borrowed elements of The Lion King, and well, you have one of the most exciting Disney films of recent years. You will enjoy it in the theaters, but perhaps not as much as you would hope to.\nYou can find this review and dozens of others at gillipediamoviereviews.blogspot.com",

He had a big job to do, reacting to stuff that's not there. The character of Mowgli takes a refreshing take as a metaphor of man's place in nature. Idris Elba provided the voice of Shere Khan. He was such a terrifying and amazing villain. Elba is amazing. Bill Murray brought life into Baloo, just being himself.

It's only his voice, but it's an excellent performance.But my very favorite part of the movie was listening to Christopher Walken as King Louie sing a version of my favorite song form the original movie ( I want to be like you)This is like some of the best work I've seen Jon Favreau do as a filmmaker.

Neel Sethi does an amazing job, what a charming Actor he already is. Christopher Walken does his \"Thing\" beautifully as always, one expects Fat Boy Slim to come up any moment. Bill Murray is the perfect Balou, if you ask me. Love the live Action and Music in the Film, some of it reminds of the \"English Patient\". I have been a fan of Jon Favreau since \"Swingers\" and Jon did a magical job with this piece. Favreau delivers more than than \"The Bare Necessities\". If you happen to be in Cannes this year, please check out the \"Lost Dutchman\". If you like breathtaking vistas.",

Sure they did the story good with Mowgli and Baloo's relationship,but what it also rushed through was the ending,and plus I didn't like it when Mowgli went to the man village. The fight with the tiger in the cartoon wasn't bad,but the movie just made it 10 times better. The 1967 one was classic,but the movie just made it into the best thrilling and emotional story that even I enjoyed. I mean yes I wouldn't really make reviews for kids movies,but the director was the man who made Iron man and I love marvel. So I checked out this movie,I watched it and I was like \"oh my god...this was amazing.\" So it was just in my opinion,better than the original. The original is in my second place.",

            "content": "My first exposure to this Rudyard Kipling story was from the video game back in the 90's. That game, albeit short, has been challenging and engrossing at the same time. The story was nice; there were lots of memorable characters, and overall, I thought that it was a good game. However, the game experience wasn't actually enough to bring me to the nearest theater. What I found really interesting was the visuals that I saw in the trailer, so the hope that it is going to be a good film overall comes along with it. With the big names in the film industry in it, at least in the voice actors' department, I was hoping that the production values will be high.I recently watched the animated film released back in the 1960's. Story- wise it is faithful to the main points that was told in the video game and in the animated film. So many films have failed to re-create or match the quality of the revered previously released films, but this one has become one of those few films who did justice to its prior counterpart. In fact, the live-action version was made sophisticated enough to appeal to the adult audience, and children might get really scared at this one.It contains one of the most impressive CGI in the recent years and it is comparable to the feat that Life of Pi has achieved, in fact more challenging given several animal facial expressions and interactions to take care of. An especially notable technical achievement was the temple scene with King Louie and lots of monkeys in it. The scene contains several CGI interactions, e.g. monkeys against Baloo and monkeys against the temple ruins. And I thought the compositing was topnotch even during the destruction of the temple with lots of debris around. The rendering of the animals were also topnotch, and one of the most memorable, technically, artistically and character-wise, was Baloo. I never thought that Baloo would be that interesting in the live-action version.The voice actors behind the CGI characters - with special mention of Bill Murray as Baloo, Scarlett Johannson as Kaa, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, Lupita Nyong'o as Raksha, Idris Elba as Shere Khan, Christopher Walken as King Louie - did not disappoint; and of course, Mowgli (Neel Sethi) did well too (look at that stamina and convincing CGI interaction). The dialogue was surprisingly fun, and it was also notable that the heavier scenes were toned down. There were lots of things to enjoy in this film, and credit should be given to its director for coordinating many things in this film to work, both technically and artistically.If there is a problem with this film, then it has something to do with the rendering of the more serious scenes and plot development. And also, the film left me asking for more on those chilly scenes, such as the one with Kaa, and the jungle chase scenes. Not bad though, but perhaps there were opportunities to turn this film into a gem, more than just being a solid family film. Anyway, I had a great time watching this film, and it is highly recommended especially for CGI enthusiasts.",

Bagheera the panther takes it upon himself to return Mowgli to the human villageThe plot is interesting, actually. I don't think we've seen a lot of stories like this. Unfortunately it is stretched far too thin. The characters reach the human village far too quickly, and after that nothing really happened. In fact, nothing really happened in the movie at all. For an 106 minute movie, it really doesn't accomplish a lot. The plot feels like it's over too quickly, and the rest just ends up being spent with the characters sitting around and not really doing anything. The characters are really decent. Nothing special about them. They aren't particularly well-developed or anything. There were a handful of scenes in this movie which I really liked, and scenes that I really didn't like. The scenes that I liked out- weighed what I didn't like, but it's hard to ignore some of those scenes, especially when some of them were actual plot holes. The movie had trouble with transitions in tone as well, going from panic to fun, or excitement to calm, it had trouble making it feel natural. The only reason I gave this movie I higher rating is because of the visuals, which were fantastic most of the time. Overall The Jungle Book is just decent. Without the visuals I would have rated it lower, but I feel obligated to give it higher. That's not to say that the movie was unpleasant to watch, I certainly enjoyed it. I just didn't enjoy it as much as everyone else seems to have. In the end, I would still recommend this movie.",

            "content": "This is not a movie for small children. I speak from experience. The theater where I saw it today was full of small children, and they were very audibly restless and unengaged. So, don't take small children.But, if you're an adult, go see it. The animation is picturesque, though it can't capture the beauty of most of the animals. That's obvious from the beginning. There are few things in nature more beautiful than a wolf. But the wolfs in the wolf pack here are not beautiful.Kipling's tales are the story of a young man's education, and this version remains true to that. It verges on the horror movie on occasion, though that didn't seem to scare the many young children in the audience.What it is not, unlike the Disney movie that will be 50 years old next year, is cute. As in so many Disney movies from the 1940s to the 1960s, the animals in the 1967 Disney movie, though not photo-realistic, were very engaging. That's not true this time. The bear, Baloo, doesn't look as fun as the Disney version; he looks like a wet teddy-bear. You are forced to see the difference when Baloo's song from the 1967 movie, \"The Bear Necessities,\" makes its appearance here. This Baloo just doesn't bounce to the music the way his predecessor did. The same is even more true of King Louie, who is grotesque in this movie, and not the musically fun character from 1967, voiced by another familiar radio personality, Louis Prima.In general, the characters in this movie are more somber than in the 1967 Disney version. That works well for Baghiera, who can't be taken seriously in the 1967 version; Ben Kingsley's voice gives him far more dignity than Sebastian Cabot's did back in 1967. It works less well for some of the other animals. It also makes some of the animal characters in this movie far more frightening than their predecessors. Sterling Halloway was far less frightening as Kaa back in 1967 than Scarlett Johansson is in the new movie.This may well be closer to Kipling's tales. But it is not a movie for small children. It just doesn't hold them.",

Where the animated version is a fun little hang-out movie with a loose structure, this is a full-throttle adventure flick. Screenwriter Justin Marks has put a nice structure around the story to tie up the looseness of the animated film (which is, of course, wonderful in its own way), and it's one of the most breathless pictures I've seen in a long while. Newcomer Neel Sethi is the film's only live-action element as Mowgli. He's a bit green but not too bad. The animals and jungle are all animated, and it looks fantastic. It's the first time in a long time where I looked at a bunch of CGI images and thought \"wow.\" The voice cast includes Bill Murray as Balloo, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, Scarlett Johansson as Kaa, Idris Elba as Shere Khan and Christopher Walken as King Louie. The film revives the animated version's two most famous songs (if you stay through the credits you get Johansson's version of \"Trust in Me\"), but it probably shouldn't have. The musical elements don't fit too well in the picture and the new versions are far less memorable than the old ones. Its small flaws hardly matter. It's a fantastic time at the movies and one of 2016's best so far.",

There's great chemistry between the different characters, and all of actors involved cement their reputation as some of the best in the business, treating each character with respect and giving them their best. The only \"real\" performer is a surprise because he worked with green screens and other technology to create this piece, so along with Favreau and his team, they have created a gem.Also, the 3D in this film is breathtaking and doesn't feel like a gimmick.You will most likely be dodging an animal that appears to be coming at you, but it's unexpected, and it feels natural. Some of the settings are enhanced by the technology. Overall, I couldn't be having a better time.One final note is the outstanding work by Johansson as the malevolent serpent, another incredible performance by this talented actress. Stick around to hear her beautiful singing, another one of the unexpected surprises in this film.***** out *****",

Inclusion of the original's song is an excellent little touch and exactly the sort of attention to detail previously discussed. This four-quadrant blockbuster should continue Walt Disney's impressive track record this year right throughout the summer and could very easily attack that $1 billion barrier come the end of its run. Deservingly so, The Jungle Book continues the successful venture of Disney by reviving some of their most classic films and tales into live-action releases and if they are half the success The Jungle Book is, we are in for some real treats with the likes of Dumbo, The Lion King and others.

            "content": "'THE JUNGLE BOOK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Walt Disney Pictures' live-action remake, of their 1967 animated classic (of the same name). Both films are based on Rudyard Kipling's collection of stories (published in magazines, from 1893 to 1894). This new movie was written by Justin Marks, and directed by Jon Favreau. It stars 12-year-old newcomer Neel Sethi, as Mowgli; the orphaned man- cub that was raised by wolves in the jungle, and then hunted by the vicious tiger Shere Khan. The film costars the voice talents of Bill Murray, Idris Elba, Ben Kingsley, Lupita Nyong'o, Giancarlo Esposito, Scarlett Johansson, Christopher Walken and the late Garry Shandling. It's been a huge hit at the Box Office, and has received nearly unanimous positive reviews (from critics). I really enjoyed it as well.Mowgli (Sethi) was orphaned, as a very young boy, when his father (Ritesh Rajan) was killed in the jungle. A black panther, named Bagheera (Kingsley), rescued him, and brought him to a pack of wolves; to be raised and protected. They were lead by Akela (Esposito) and Raksha (Nyong'o). All was fine, until the ferocious tiger Shere Khan (Elba), insists the boy must be killed; merely for being human. Mowgli then decides to leave the jungle, to protect his family, and he befriends a bear named Baloo (Murray). He comes of age, with the help of his new friend, and grows the courage to be the great man he was meant to be.The film is filled with glorious visuals; with a budget of $175 million, the effects are truly groundbreaking. Favreau is definitely a decent director, the script is well written, and you couldn't ask for a better cast. The story should be nostalgically pleasing, to all those that grew up on it, and animal lovers should love the film as well (it's truly amazing how lifelike all of the characters look). The film deserves all of it's critical praise, and beloved crowd pleasing status as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHm0V1TOCkg",

Just like 'The Legend of Tarzan', the film was shot entirely in studios. With film technology developing as fast and effective as it does, 'shot on location' might soon be a thing of the past. I predict the technology will become so good and so cheap that films will be made in a studio with everything else being added via computer in post production. Sad, but true.Neel Sethi is the only real actor in the film, portraying Mowgli. Being his first feature film, it must have been very difficult acting to...well, almost nothing. I must say, however, he did a very good job. Its interesting, though, that everything in the film looked so real, from Mowgli's interaction with the animals to him walking in the forest, and yet a scene of him just running through a field looked incredibly fake.'The Jungle Book' is a spectacular action adventure drama for young and old. I honestly did not expect this film to have so many jump scares, so be warned! Shere Khan was by far the most impressive creation in the film, and also very scary.

            "content": "In recent years Disney have been remaking some of their classic animated movies into live action, so far they've done Alice in Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty (Maleficent) and Cinderella, with mixed results, and this was the latest offering, a remake of the 1967 classic based on the books by Rudyard Kipling, directed by Jon Favreau (Elf, Zathura: A Space Adventure, Iron Man). Basically Mowgli (introducing Neel Sethi) is a \"man-cub\" raised by a pack of wolves ever since he was found as a baby by black panther Bagheera (Sir Ben Kingsley) in the jungle, his adoptive mother is Raksha (12 Years a Slave's Lupita Nyong'o) and pack leader is Akela (Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito). One day in dry season jungle animals gather to drink remaining water during a drought as part of a truce, Akela berates Mowgli for using human tricks, the truce however is disrupted when Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba), vengeful towards man for scarring him, he vows to kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. The wolf pack debate whether to keep Mowgli or not, he voluntarily decides to leave the jungle, Bagheera agrees and offers to guide him to the safety of the man village, en route however Shere Khan ambushes them, injures Bagheera, while Mowgli escapes through a stampede of wildebeests. In a darker part of the jungle Mowgli meets enormous Indian python Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), she hypnotises him, Mowgli sees a visions of his father being mauled while protecting him from Shere Khan, and the destructive power of the \"red flower\" (fire), Kaa then attempts to devour Mowgli, but is rescued by a creature unseen when he blacks out. Mowgli wakes and meets sloth bear Baloo (Bill Murray), he shows the man cub the man village and agrees to take him when the winter season arrives, if he still wishes to leave the jungle, however they form a close bond with their teamwork getting them things easily, including portions of honeycomb. Bagheera hears that Shere Khan has killed Akela and taken over the hills, he is hunting Mowgli, Baloo realises that he cannot the man cub's safety and agrees to push him away so he will head to the man village. However Mowgli is kidnapped by monkeys, who take him to their ruler King Louie (Christopher Walken), an Orangutan-resembling Gigantopithecus, who tries to coerce him into the secret of creating the red flower, but Baloo and Bagheera arrive and rescue him, and cause the temple to fall apart. During the chase Mowgli was informed by King Louie of Akela's death, furious that Baloo and Bagheera never told him he decides to return to confront Shere Khan, to do so he finds the man village and steals a lit torch to use as a weapon. Mowgli faces Shere Khan, who points out that he has made himself an enemy of the jungle by accidentally causing a wildfire, he throws the torch into the water and gives the tiger the advantage, but Baloo, Bagheera and the wolf pack stand together to hold him off, Mowgli is given enough time to lure Shere Khan into the burning jungle, and he causes him to fall from a broken tree branch to his death in the fire below. In the end the fire is extinguished when river water is released into the jungle, Raksha becomes the new alpha of the wolf pack, Mowgli has found his true home and calls the wolf pack, Baloo and Bagheera his family. Also starring Garry Shandling as Ikki the Indian porcupine, Brighton Rose as Gray, Jon Favreau as Pygmy Hog and Sam Raimi as Giant Squirrel. All stars are well chosen for their roles, newcomer Sethi is terrific as the orphaned boy raised by wolves, Murray is lovable as the sarcastic good- natured bear, Kingsley does well as the wise panther, Walken is a surprisingly good choice for the massive monkey leader, Johansson gets her time being an oddly seductive snake, and Elba is a fantastically ferocious villain. This live action version obviously sticks much closely to the source material than the original incarnation, but it leaves room for the adored and memorable songs \"The Bare Necessities\", \"I Wanna Be Like You\" and \"Trust in Me\", the special effects to bring the animals and jungle to lie are amazing, there is splendid action and well-timed laughs, and it brings an all together different feel and story that will enchant a new generation, a brilliantly entertaining fantasy adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!",

            "content": "Having read the appealing, well-known and remarkable Rudyard Kipling novel and watched the original animated version of \"The Jungle Book\", I went to the movie theater with high hopes, faithful that the movie would do justice to the preceding adaptation and the novel. With just a few minutes into the movie, I realized that my hopes were tremendously low, and the movie surpassed every level of expectation I had. From the very first scene itself with Mowgli running through tangled vines and trees, the movie substantiates itself to be one that's enchanting, captivating and fast-paced at the same time. The extent to which the movie can touch and move the viewers is just unbelievable; from visually stunning animations to surreal CGI, awe-inspiring voice-over to astonishing acting, breathtaking cinematography to state-of-the-art screenplay, dazzling vistas to eye-catching panoramas, splendid direction to paramount composing, and a myriad of other striking features, this movie will have you on the edge of your seats anticipating what will happen next. It has the spirit of the original, all the while being as new and novel as possible. Even though I had already read the book, watched the original, and scooped up all the buzz of this movie by watching every trailer, teaser, interviews, you name it; I got to admit there were many moments that caught me off-guard. One memorable moment comes to mind where Sher Khan soars onto Mowgli from behind, just as Bagheera is escorting him away from the jungle back to the 'safe man- village'.*Caution* Spoilers AheadRaised by a pack of wolves after his father was killed by the tiger Sher Khan, Mowgli, a 'man-cub', is considered as an outsider by a preponderance of the animals in the jungle. However, it is only when his life is threatened by the feared Sher Khan, that Bagheera helps escort Mowgli back to the 'man-village' \u2013the place the animals presume he belongs to and is the safest at. The escape doesn't go as planned when Sher Khan finds them halfway and Bagheera has to fight him to make sure Mowgli gets away safely. On his solo journey, Mowgli experiences a multitude of obstacles ranging from a deadly hypnotizing snake (Kaa) to a humongous, cunning ape (King Louie). He befriends a bear known as Baloo as well. Perhaps the only part of the film that deviates from the original version is the ending where instead of leaving the audience with the bittersweet feeling of Mowgli returning to the 'man-village', it gives off vibes of inclusion and acceptance; after having defeated Sher Khan, Mowgli is finally deemed by the animals as one of their own. The movie not only intrinsically balances the elements of sentiments via the mesmerizing visuals and soothing instrumental score, but also with the dynamic and varied personalities portrayed by all the characters. With his light-hearted jokes and laid-back take on life, Baloo single-handedly manages to soften the aura of seriousness in the movie. His unity one-line comebacks always achieve to steal every scene that he's in. Conveying the importance of family, friendship, alliances, inclusion, and self-confidence, 'The Jungle Book' generously and magnificently revives the spirit and essence of Disney classics. I definitely have a blank space for in my list of top movies of all time. All in all, it's a gripping, thrilling and marvelous motion picture that will leave you on cloud nine. But don't take my word for it. Go see it for yourself.",

            "content": "If anyone ever read the book by Rudyard Kipling then they would know the story told in the 1967 animated movie is very different. It is losely based on the original story. This movie is retelling the story of the film, not the stories form the book.The original movie is the first movie I ever saw in a movie theater. I was stunned and hooked for live. I have the music on vinyl and CD. I own it on video, DVD and Blueray. I showed the movie to my own children and they loved it. They watched it over and over again, and so did I. I must have seen it about 200 times and still love it.This version however didn't disappoint me at all. Right from the start, I got the same feeling as in the original 1967 movie. It has the same vibe. It pulled me right in, like not many movies do. The music is recognizable and well performed. It's a great tribute to the original! I love it! Of course, to me, the original will always come first with 10 out of 10, but for a Disney remake, this movie is worth an solid 8! Very entertaining! And hail to Bill Murray. What a great Baloo he is!",

From her point of view it was a pretty great film.However she's also a fan of the original animated version of the film, as am I and I am sad to say the new version although great with live action is sort of a disappointment.It's like they try to make it a little truer to the original story at the expense of the light-heartedness of the original. It doesn't quite work as well as it should. They took King Louie and made him into an intimidating monster which is a shame because his character in the cartoon was one of the best.Hats off to Jon Faverau for giving it a shot and not completely messing it up which would have been easy to do; maybe the Disney committee got in the way and skewed it the wrong way slightly.",

I watch it again and again with my little girl. We sing along with Baloo, Col. Hathi and King Louie. That movie is all fun.Now in 2016 they have made a marvelous piece of visual experience. And they have taken out all the fun and innocent childishness out of the movie. The movie is OK for a grown up, or even a teen. But for god's sake, the makers have made sure that a kid won't enjoy it.It's sad. Really sad.The Jungle book is one of those stories which will mesmerize kids when you put them to sleep. It gives them a world so vibrant and indulging, that the visuals take place in their mind while they listen. The visuals this movie present to the kids will twist their imagined world of Mowgli into something beyond recognition.Go, see the movie. It's not bad. But prepare the kids for something they might not enjoy, if they know the story of Mowgli beforehand.",

I'm not saying its a bad film but if you watched the 1967 version you'd agree that this is vastly inferior to it. Perhaps this kind of an approach would have worked for a 'Lion King' live action film. P.S The reason why this movie fails is because the 1967 version was so well done, nothing on this topic could be ever made better. Mr. Walt Disney was a freaking genius.",

            "content": "Disney's animated version of Rudyard Kipling's collection of works The Jungle Book was released just one year after Walt Disney's death, and kick-started a period of mediocrity for the company that produced some of the most beloved films of all time (until its reemergence as a powerhouse once again in 1989 with The Little Mermaid). They now dominate the marketplace, and it would be easy to despise the multi-billion dollar corporation if much of their recent output just wasn't so good. While they are certainly progressive and forward-thinking (Zootopia was a fascinating social study of our times), they continue to hark back to their Golden Age with live- action versions of Sleeping Beauty (2014's Maleficent) and Cinderella (2015), and now one of their most adored works, The Jungle Book.Jon Favreau's re-imagining of Wolfgang Reitherman's classic follows much of the original's narrative. Mowgli the \"man-cub\" (Neel Sethi) is a young boy living in the jungle, raised in a wolf back and watched over by the wise and respected panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). The arrival of Shere Khan (Idris Elba), a terrifying Bengal tiger with a hatred of man, alerts Bagheera, who whisks Mowgli off into the deep jungle, where the youngster befriends lazy and care-free sloth bear Baloo (Bill Murray). Encountering many dangers along the way, including the hypnotic anaconda Kaa (Scarlett Johnansson) and giant orangutan King Louie (Christopher Walken), Mowgli must decide whether or not his place remains with the friends who raised him, or with his own kind.While it's hardly Christopher Nolan territory, Favreau's version of the story is certainly darker. Rather than trying to replicate the upbeat tone of the original, it cuts out the majority of the songs and keeps things more grounded, or at least as much as a film featuring talking animals can be. It achieves this with some simply astonishing effects - so good that it's easy to forget or even tell you're watching CGI - and pitch-perfect voice acting. Elba will no doubt terrify any young viewers, and understandably so, but the film belongs to Murray and Walken. They get the two songs in the film (The Bare Necessities and I Wanna Be Like You) and are easily the most memorable characters. Phil Harris and Louise Prima would have surely approved.Yet the question hovering above the head of Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book, as it does with many remakes, is the reason for its existence. The 1967 version charmed youngsters for decades so is this a pointless attempt to bring the story to a new generation of children? Have children become so spoiled with computer generated effects that they would be unable to see the charm and wonder in something so painstakingly and thoughtfully hand-drawn? It's a depressing thought, and one that bothered me for a while after seeing the film. With any hope, this will inspire kids to seek out the original and love it for all that it is, for Favreau's film is exciting and often astonishing to look at, and certainly the best of Disney's recent live action re- dos.",

I had to watch the original all over again to wash Murray's off-key, lousily timed groans out of my ears.\nScarlett Johansson is great at speaking in a dull monotone voice without any soul or expression. For her to be cast as a seductive enchantress is utterly ridiculous. There are dozens of actresses who could have knocked this out of the park. Terrible casting.\nChristopher Walken did an okay job with the speaking parts but this man, like Murray, has absolutely no sense of musical time, Again, a major casting mistake.\nAs for Gary Shandling, he is a lousy voice actor. Dozens of actors could have done a far, far better job. If Disney had hired a casting director with any talent whatsoever, this could have been one of the best films of the decade. Again, there are a ton of great casting directors out there. Disney has no excuse. The producers have no excuse. I was very disappointed.",

My criticisms comes with the run time of the film as at around 1h50 it is quite long for a children's film and i did feel that it was dragging at times by the end. I also feel like more could be made of Akela's death as the act itself is very blink and you miss it and i feel an opportunity for a strong, emotional scene was lost. I have heard some complaints of Christopher Walken being distracting and taking people out of the atmosphere but i feel like he was a great choice for King Louis and so i cannot agree with any criticism there.Overall it is a strong film that excels in its performances and the atmosphere created, mainly through the gorgeous visuals but it is let down by some weaker scenes and a run time that just seems unnecessary.7.8/10JH",

A boy, perhaps ten or eleven years old sitting to my right in the theater jumped four times during the picture, that was twice more than me. I think there's something to be said about the intensity of the movie for youngsters, so I guess each parent would have to make up their own mind after seeing it for themselves.With that, I thought it was a pretty amazing film in terms of blending CGI with the live character of Mowgli (Neel Sethi), especially with any scene featuring the animals. Shere Khan was depicted as frighteningly real, and it was the little things I thought, like the scarring of his face and the scrapes and bruises on Mowgli throughout the story that added to the realism of the characters. Baloo of course was a sketch, Bill Murray did a fine job with his interpretation as did most of the voice actors. The python Kaa might be one of those scary moments for the youngsters I'd warn about, and highlights one of those scenes that go for the jump factor.There aren't a lot of films I'd go out of my way for to catch a second time in the theater but this would be one of them.

Sadly, it's a massive misfire of a film, in which almost every element disappoints. Neel Sethi is a first-time performer and it shows, because it has no acting ability whatsoever and a single expression on his face (sullen, mildly puzzled) no matter what situation he finds himself in. The CGI animation for the creatures ranges from the decent (the adult wolves and panther look pretty good) to the poor, but the main problem with this is the incessant CGI action and limited storytelling ability. It reminded me a little of the STAR WARS prequels with the necessity of having CGI in EVERY single shot, but there's no weight behind it and no gravitas to the story. The tale's thrust seems to have been stolen from THE LION KING, of all things. As for the voice talent, it's occasionally decent (Bill Murray works), but Idris Elba is miscast as the bad guy and Scarlet Johansson sticks out like a sore thumb.",

            "content": "I realize that this particular argument is going to fall on deaf ears, especially given the excellent quality of the latest installment of Rudyard Kipling's \"The Jungle Book.\" Yes it's epic, yes it has cutting edge special-effects, yes the young Neel Sethi does a great job and the voice acting is superb. Yet with the sequel to the brooding live- action Snow White adaptation limping to the barn on the same weekend and with word that Pinocchio (1940), Sword in the Stone (1963) and Mulan (1998) are all getting their own gritty live-action reboots, I can't help but think of the big picture.Unless you've lived under a rock for the last fifty years, you probably already know the plot of The Jungle Book. Mowgli (Sethi) is a young human (hereto known as a man-cub) raised by wolves in the thick jungles of India. After a run-in with malevolent tiger Shere Khan (Elba), the creatures of the jungle decide it'd be best if Mowgli finds shelter among his own kind. While Shere Khan is out for blood, the young man-cub is protected by Bagheera the panther (Kingsley), Baloo the bear (Murray), and Raksha (Nyong'o) and Akela the wolves (Esposito). Rounding out the cast are Kaa the snake (Johansson), the late Garry Shandling playing a porcupine and Christopher Walken who is pitch perfect as Louie king of the apes.One could easily see the appeal of this story, not only from a narrative point of view but also from a bottom-line, surefire studio box office draw point of view. The film aptly plays upon the nostalgia of adults who grew up with The Jungle Book (1967) on VHS, while introducing kids to the litany of interesting characters that color the pages of Kipling's original tome. Not only are all your favorite characters on the screen but so are the only two songs you remember from the animated version. Sure the segues into the songs are a bit tortured, and no child under fifteen is going to walk out the theater humming them, but at least adults can carry the ditties in their heads, vaguely remembering the voices of Phil Harris and Louis Prima.Disney Studios really does have a blockbuster on their hands but to hedge their bets they probably used an army of twitchy, caffeinated, sun deprived special-effects gurus to ensure that not a single shot was done anywhere near a jungle. Instead the entire film was beautifully recreated on a sound stage. No matter, as the environments are so well contextualized and director Jon Favreau's eye is so keen that you really can't tell. Furthermore the animal characters were so well done that at times the voice-acting couldn't quite jell, not because it was sloppily done but because the faces of the animals were so well mapped out, that it seemed impossible for Bagheera for example to roll his R's.The Jungle Book continues a trend started by Cinderella (2015) as a faithful, gorgeous and oh so twee adaptation of Disney's long line of animated movies, themselves based on older stories, novellas and legends. Disney has had a lot of false starts with the goofy 101 Dalmatians (1996), the befuddled Maleficent (2014) and the abhorrently cynical Alice in Wonderland (2010). And of course there's the inspired but long forgotten 1994 Jungle Book which not only captured the essence of it's source material but added on some anti-colonialist subtext. It's hardily recommended you check that adaptation out before concluding the most recent adaptation to be the end-all-be-all.As I said, I can't help but look at the big picture. That picture is cluttered; filling to the brim with further adaptations and reboots and sequels and prequels that prey upon your nostalgia to sell tickets and overpriced popcorn. They're not even subtle about it anymore. Jon Favreau, who has been known to take bold directorial risks every now and again, seems to be playing it safe for the foreseeable future; which is a real shame. Even on autopilot, Favreau makes something like this, which is a topnotch piece of mass-media entertainment. Imagine what he could do if he finally went off the chain.",

The visuals were stunning.Best of all, I saw it at an IMAX theater. Can't beat that.Adults and kids will love it.I was almost tempted to head across town, and see it again later today at another theater.I seriously doubt there'll be a better movie this year.In fact, if it were humanly possibly, I'd give it two toes up, as well as two thumbs.Great film all the way.So I recommend it highly.",

            "content": "Saw a 2D edition in Madrid of this amazingly-calibrated Disney live-action upgrade of its animation repertoire, directed by Jon Favreau, a firm hand behind Marvel's IRON MAN (2008) and its lesser sequel. Shot exclusively in a studio setting with its astonishingly lifelike motion capture VFX to imitate the anthropomorphic faunas and its richly generated jungle trappings, THE JUNGLE BOOK lands up at a new crowning point of virtual reality in digital era, on a plus side, definitely, there will be no necessity of exploiting living animals to pamper our visual pleasure, regardless of how cinema purists will demur.In an unnamed Indian tropical forest, a man-cub Mowgli (newcomer Sethi, takes up the gauntlet to perform against the green screen with spirited if slightly contrived zing), is raised by the wolf pack, led by Akela (Esposito) and his wife Raksha (Nyong'o). When the bestial tiger Shere Khan (Elba) notices his presence, he swears to hunt him down not just because the presence of a man breaches the law of the jungle, but also for some personal reasons. So Mowgli is escorted by his protector and mentor, the ethically correct panther Bagheera (Kingsley), heads to a man village, en route, he separates from Bagheera due to Shere Khan's ambush, then being enchanted by the beguiling boa constrictor Kaa (Johansson, who is falsely advertised for her rather brief presence), and saved by the amiable and honey-seeking bear Baloo (Murray), a (initially unbalanced) friendship has formed in the film's most boisterous chapter. But an impending danger lurks, after a temple-razing kerfuffle with the Gigantopithecus King Louie (Walken, the MVP among a superlative voice-and-motion-capture cast, whose anachronistic singsong of I WANNA BE LIKE YOU from the original animation is so out-of-the-place but vastly amusing) and his primate minions, Mowgli has to face his ultimate nemesis and settles the old score once for all, in a man's way.Man's \"Red Flower\", as a symbol of something both dangerous and unknown, marks the difference between man and other living things, it scars Shere Khan, haunts King Louie, blazes the forest, all because of man's far more advanced intelligence, a gift can bring downfall to those inferior species, that's what we can ruminate from Kipling's story, be humble and sensible, lest one day we will be pigeonholed as the inferior one, when Armageddon arrives, there will be no revered elephants to extinguish the conflagration. All in all, Favreau's well-crafted project is a thoroughly commendable family crowd-pleaser, and its rosy box-office triumph boosts a heartening hail to the upcoming Disney live-action adaptations.",

It is very well animated and produced, but the plot it presents is mediocre, boring and predictable, lacking any trace of fun or entertainment.

Now I did like the original animated \"The Jungle Book\" movie although it isn't one of my favorites. This movie sort of made me feel like a kid again and the more developed build up with the characters and interactions between Mowgli and the animals is integrated into this movie very well. It actually makes more sense when it comes to the bond with the human boy Mowgli and the animals that are trying to protect him. One of the big star in this movie is the CGI, it really does bring this movie to life. The animals just looked so darn realistic with it's movements and emotions. The kid actor that played Mowgli did a fine job in making him believable and yet likable at the same time. Which is actually important for a movie such as this. Where the audience has to sympathize with the kid without being just annoyed by him. Sure, some of the nostalgia factor played a part when it came to bringing out a bit of the emotional side in me. But overall, everything was just executed just right while bringing in some new elements into the mix. This is a movie that will bring about your inner childhood. Highly worth watching it with the whole family.8.8/10",

Guided by Bagheera the panther and the bear Baloo, Mowgli embarks on a journey of self- discovery, though he also meets creatures who don't have his best interests at heart.In addition to the creative resurrection of Star Wars, the seemingly unstoppable commercial might of the Marvel films, and the by-now taken-for-granted genius of Pixar, the Mouse House has less noisily been updating some of its animated classics to live-action makeovers. Last year director Kenneth Branagh tried with Cinderella (with a huge assist from Cate Blanchett's venomous wicked stepmother). Aside from investing in top-drawer digital craftsmanship, perhaps the canniest move Disney made on this film was hiring Jon Favreau to helm it. After all, he already has one four-star family pic to his credit (Elf). Jon Favreau brings a welcome lightness of touch to this visually immersive adventure story. This film is a faithful and more mature reboot, it definitely rivals the looseness of Disney's 1967 animated classic, while succeeding on its own so well that such comparison are barely necessary. The movie is tender and manages to touch on some grown-up themes about man's destructive power and loss of youthful innocence without loosing sight of its first and foremost kids adventure. In fact Favreau never loses the sight that it is an adventure story for children. Tackling his first-feature role not only as the lead, but also as the only flesh and blood character, little Neel Sethi gets away with it pretty well; especially under what must have been challenging circumstances. This kid is killing it, keeping in mind that this little man is looking at nothing and acting. Green-screens have defeated actors with far more experience. From all the familiar plot beats from Disney's first Jungle Book, Favreau clearly understood that the Mowgli-Baloo relationship is the real key to the story. He slowed the film pace enough long to build up an effective core to their relationship. Now, Baloo voiced by Bill Murray... Could they have made a better choice? Murray as the world's most charmingly lazy bear is a brilliant idea. Plus, when the film gets it right: it sings. Can you picture Christopher Walken singing a song as a giant monkey? I was in heaven. Can you really get better than that?! Voice work is excellent all around, from Nyong'o, to Elba, Johansson and Kingsley. They're all perfect - not just in their voices, but also in the way that what is coming out of their mouths syncs up perfectly with the way their mouths move. It's the first talking-animal movie I've seen where CGI seamlessly bridges the uncanny gap between fantasy and reality and also one of the few 3-D movies that actually benefits from being in 3-D. This film is a masterpiece of CGI work. Those animals were real to me. Moreover, the animal effects are overwhelmingly successful. As I said before, it isn't just that the animal movement scan as real but they figured out just how much to anthropomorphize the animal mouth movements to make the speaking seem natural. Creators build this jungle into the type pf dangerous, sometimes pitiless setting that an average 10-year-old would nonetheless never want to leave. Favreau imposes a little bit more of a strict hero's-journey framework onto the source materials but never hint to that seriousness that tends to sour so many aggressively modernised fairy stories. Finally, if I were my 6/7-year-old self. I would grow up telling everyone around that this film is a classic, it would have been my definitive Jungle Book movie for the rest of my life. But I'm a grown up woman now, and I also think this film would be my definitive version of the Jungle Book for now on. I can't see another adaptation of this story being THIS good. Overall, The Jungle Book is one of the most visually sumptuous blockbusters this side of Avatar. Favreau's movie is more straight adventure than musical, but when Murray starts letting rip with a familiar tune, the film finally finds its groove.",

In the original book, Shere Khan hates mowgli because he thinks he will grow up into a man and kill them, in the far superior cartoon version its for the thrill of the hunt. He loves to kill and the feeling of hunting. He's basically the predator. But in the movie he wants to kill him for the same reasons as the book, fine. But once mowgli leaves the jungle, he still wants him. It makes no sense why he is still after him.2. Lack of kaa. Even though the character was pointless, he was fun and unforgettable. He got 2 scenes, but everyone remembers him as one of the main parts of the story. So, what do they do with the character here? One scene. No jokes, no song. Some stupid back story for mowgli that makes mowgli hate Shere Khan, but still doesn't explain why Shere Khan hates mowgli. They totally understood why we love the character in the first place.3. The ending. The one thing that you have to get right. The one thing that the story guarantees throughout the film. They messed it up. The entire moral of the story. Gone.

            "content": "Amazing cinematic dramatization of Kipling's \"Jungle Book\" that dwarfs all previous versions - at least dramatically. The high tempo with thrilling intensity is set from the beginning as Mowgli races Bagheera all over the jungle on the ground as well as way up in the trees, but Bagheera, as also nature in this film, always wins. As many have pointed out, the leading character of the drama though is the villain Shere Khan the Tiger, impressively impersonated by Idris Elba, while you can't suspect Ben Kingsley as Bagheera and Bill Murray as Baloo. At the same time, this splendid Jungle Book fantasy makes up for the dreadful Disney animation of 1966, which never was supervised by Disney himself, as he passed away that year. That Mowgli was like any vexing pest of that age with almost nothing human about him and hardly even alive as more than a cartoon clich\u00e9, while this Mowgli is the more sympathetic as a real child and very much alive - he even speaks intelligibly. Also the animals are regular successes with a very impressing Bandarlog king - the spectacular sequences from the ghost town of ruins with an overwhelming mob of baboons is maybe the film's most impressive part, while the final settlement with Shere Khan mainly consists of cinematic effects, although exciting enough as a proper climax. Important above all is the message, which Walt Disney himself made clear already as early as in \"Bambi\" in 1941, that the real villain is man, and Shere Khan is the only one to carry through that message with a convincing vengeance - there is no doubt about it.What you miss in the film is the magic and poetry of Kipling. The wolf scenes do represent it to some degree, but in comparison with the 1942 movie shot on location in southwest India, which was poetry all the way, this is more in the category of effectively dramatic entertainment, the poetry and soul getting lost in the technical virtuosity. Still, it's a marvel of a film, and its high gear through the whole run leaves you already exhausted after half an hour, almost like an Indiana Jones thriller. What would Kipling have thought about it? He would most certainly have liked it, laughed at it and thoroughly enjoyed it, but still preferred the even more creative paraphrase on his book of the 1942 version.",

            "content": "There is something to be said for a film that could be considered one of the most technologically advanced films of all time while also enhancing an already classic story. The Jungle Book did just that. Jon Favreau wonderfully encapsulates the spirit of the 1967 classic amidst updating aspects to create one of the more refreshing movie going experiences of 2016.When they first announced they were doing a live-action version of The Jungle Book I was hesitant to have faith in the project. Why even attempt it? But after I saw Disney crush it last year with Cinderella, suddenly my mind opened up to the possibility. Plus, the voice talent involved in this film seemed to perfectly fit the personalities of each animal. And I have to say, the voice characterization in this film may be the most impressive thing about this film, even more so than the CGI. Scarlett Johansson is mystifying as Kaa. Bill Murray is perfect as Baloo because, well, he's Bill Murray. Ben Kingsley is always welcome to do voice work with any project. But the real stars here are Lupita Nyong'o as Raksha and Idris Elba as Shere Khan.If it wasn't already clear before, Elba is one of the finest actors working today. His work here as Khan is some of his best. Khan was a great villain before Elba got his hands on him, but now, he may be near the top of my list. Khan's motivations for going after the young man cub, Mowgli are more clear and interesting than they were in the original, and he also gets more screen time. Of course, the film covers all of the original beloved characters from the film, but none are more impressive than Elba's Khan.It should be noted just how unbelievable of a job Neel Sethi does here as Mowgli. The entire film is CGI/green screen, except for himself. For a boy around 10 during filming, it's astounding to think he did all of his acting up against a screen or a puppet. It also speaks to everyone involved behind the camera for making this adaptation something so groundbreaking in its artistic style.The film deviates a bit from the 1967 film and apparently draws closer to the original books, and I think the adjustments improved the final cut. The heavier inclusion of the wolves with Nyongo's Raksha at the center gave the film the heart it needed. The ending is also far superior to the original and could even set up future installments, which I would openly welcome. Overall, the only real complaint I would have is that the songs don't feel as fluid or natural as they do in the old film. In fact, I think the film is better off without them. Other than that, The Jungle Book is one of the best films to be released in 2016, and an absolute awe to see on the big screen.+Characterizations are spot on+CGI is astonishing+Elba as Khan+Heavier inclusion of the wolves+Changes to the original improve the film-Songs don't fit in as well8.8/10",

Some small flaws: Neel Sethi does a great job and my daughter was surprised because she said that he really looks like the 1967 Mowgli, but I thought that his New Yorker accent was a bit out of place in the Indian jungle. I would have preferred a boy with Indian accent. But then you have Bill Murray, Christopher Walken and Scarlet Johansson with American accents too and they do not bother actually. Ben Kingsley (Bagheera) and especially Idris Elba (Shere Kahn) are superb. The special effects are AMAZING, and the animals move so beautifully that for moments it looks like you are watching a (really fun) documentary from National Geographic.

Justin Marks's Screenplay adapts the legendary story & creates an adventurous world, with characters that you care for. The Bear & The Panther are particular stand outs. Jon Favreau's Direction is excellent & the visual splendor on display, is top-class. 'The Jungle Book' is so visually powerful, that for its visuals itself, you'd like to spend your money. Cinematography & Editing are superb. John Debney's Score is fabulous.Performance-Wise: Neel Sethi as Mowgli, is cute, although a bit animated. Of the Vocal Performers, Bill Murray as Baloo, is absolutely marvelous. He's lovable & also the film's best part. Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, adds tremendous credibility to the part. Idris Elba as Shere Khan, is villainous & leaves a great mark. Lupita Nyong'o as Raksha & Giancarlo Esposito as Akela, are perfect. Scarlett Johansson as Kaa, is fine. Christopher Walken as King Louie, is pure vintage Walken. The Late/Great Garry Shandling as Ikki, is wonderful. On the whole, 'The Jungle Book' is good fun! Go for it!",

I have not read the original story but I can tell you the film stays very true to the old Disney cartoon from back in the days. There is great action, a well told story, the special effects and CGI are spot on. The young actor playing Mowgli is the only non-CGI actor in the movie and he does an okay job. You have to remember he is a kid so the minor lapses in his performance can be forgiven. But none of that matters because the animals steal the show. This film is great for children and adults, it is a perfect family film, nothing too scary. Christopher Walken's King Louie is simply brilliant. I can not believe how creepy and sinister he was.. and then he sang the song, damn I'm still tripping out on that. Anyway, the only thing I didn't like about the movie is how it didn't end the story right. I'm guessing because those ba$tards running Disney are probably planning a sequel. Greedy pigs. Anyway, I love this movie and if anyone working for Disney happens to be reading this review, listen up: I have no plans on watching a sequel to this film. You should have just ended the story right. Other than that, I loved it.",

            "content": "Time and time again Hollywood takes out some of the old classic movies and recycles them using the latest and best technology. The Jungle Book is no exception. The movie basically targets adults and children alike. For adults it is a nostalgic ride into the classic tale that they grew up reading or watching and for children it is a story told like never before. As an adult one would want to compare the old animated movie with the new big budget CGI one and also slightly refresh their memory of The Jungle Book. I watched this movie pretty much for the same reason and I wasn't disappointed.The context of the story, an orphan (Mowgli) growing up in the care of wild animals to be one of them may seem a bit odd now. But this is a classic story and we are given no choice but to accept it (at least that's what most critics think so). As children we grew up listening to tales of men fighting the 'wild animals', back then that was bravery. I am not quite sure if the same concept applies for today when preserving the wildlife being one of the primary concern. When looked at this way, one can see no wrong in the movie's antagonist tiger (how ironic) Sher Khan's argument of a human living among (invading) the wildlife. But the movie still stays true to the plot by making sure Sher Khan lives up to the negative image by ruthless and selfish killing. Filmmakers risk nothing to ensure the classic stays as classic.Needless to say the animation/CGI effects are well crafted along with one living character Mowgli. Big names such as Ben Kingsley, John Goodman, Bill Murray, Chirstopher Walken do no wrong in voicing the animal characters. Jon Favreau has made sure to include some humour in the characterization of the bear Baloo which is slightly different compared to the book. The mandatory jungle book songs are made sure to be very subtle and not dragging. Watch the Jungle Book if you want to see how your childhood tale has come to life after 2 decades and if you have kids, to show them what you grew upto.",

            "content": "Disney is in the zone with their live action remakes. With Maleficent and Cinderella being box office hits, the animation studio finally bridged out of the princesses and went to another kingdom. This time around we dive into a wilder world filled with danger, death, and of course\u0085 talking animals. That's right, today's review is on the Jungle Book and once more I'm here to give some insight on the latest films to grace the theater. So enough chatting, let's get started. The GOOD: \u0095 Incredible Graphics \u0095 Voice Acting \u0095 Emotional/Suspenseful Story \u0095 Very fun and cute at momentsIf you have seen the trailers, then it should come as no surprise that Jungle Books strongest quality is the animation. Disney continues to push the boundaries of real life animation. The denizens of this jungle are incredibly detailed, with rippling fur, incredibly detailed muscle movements, and a glorious shine that screams high definition gold. There are some moments where the realism is lost and the sheen shows the CGI, however these moments are overshadowed by the story and not much of a weakness. And the jungle itself is even more breathtaking as the flora pops to life in both color and contrast. Where props end and CGI begins is hard to tell, but trust me the world was brought to life much better than I ever imagined. Where the technology brought the animals to life it was the voice acting that brought the characters. Ben Kingsley as the regal Bagheera was a perfect choice. Kingsley brought all the qualities of the mentor with his stern voice, but adding that emotional sentimental edge that showed he cared. Idris Elba as Shere Kahn was another rocking pick, his deep, bellowing voice spiced with the sinister edge that was perfect for the villain role. Yet the best voice casting goes to Bill Murray who we all know has a long track record of playing the care free, high on life character. Baloo is essentially the animal version of Murray, and if they had added a cigar to the mix, would have been a furrier version of his St. Vincent character. Our other cast was spot on as well and Jungle Books voice cast fit every role necessary. In terms of the story, Jungle Book gets points for this as well. The emotion in the story is surprisingly lacking at parts, maybe due to the delivery or perhaps the fast pace. But the emotion really hits at the right moments to get your skin tingling with goose bumps. Now I can't lie that much of the movie lacked suspense for me, a predictable tale that I had memorized from my cartoon watching days. Yet I would also be lying if I didn't say Shere Kahn's scenes had me on the edge of my seat at times, wondering what decisions his devious mind would make. Baloo and Mowgli's relationship though goes the lighter sides of things and fills the cute and cuddly role to the T, while also bringing some of the audience to tears. This relationship was an essential component to the fun of this film and one of the best real life to digital character relations I've seen in a while. The BAD: \u0095 Short sighted scenes \u0095 A few over-exaggerated moments \u0095 SingingWhat do I mean by short sighted scenes? I mean that some of the scenes could have been epic, but were delivered in a manner that left me feeling cheated. The Kaa scene is one of these moments. The Indian python was the leading voice for the trailers, but in this film the snake was more of a cameo than anything else. Sure she played a role in shedding light on Mowgli's origins, but shortly after that she is cut from the film (quite the opposite from the cartoon version.) There were other moments that were very similar, but lacked the finesse I was expecting and instead turned into a convenient scene meant to fill in a plot hole. Many of these moments, due to their rushed nature, felt very over acted and lost the emotional appeal it was going for. Mowgli (Neel Sethi) did well overall, but the little guy occasionally trekked into a whiny, unimpressive delivery that was a little annoying. The biggest weakness for me though was the singing. I give them props for effort and award them points for taking a risk, but the singing paled so much to the original soundtrack. Bill Murray doing the Baloo song had some pizazz and again was a cute dynamic to their relationship. Christopher Walken singing King Louie's song though is a different story. It's more comical then fun, and is lacking in a lot of things that not even Auto tune can fix. Pretty much, it's just another method to extend the movie and merchandising for this film. Fortunately the symphony scores makes up for these songs, but unfortunately they can't give you back the time the singing takes away. Final thoughts:This rendition of the Jungle Book impressed me. The adventure is fun and fast paced while also bringing a little emotion to the picture. An incredible cast makes for fun characters that your little ones and you will latch on to. But it is the incredible artificial world that brings you into the movie and makes you feel as if you stepped into a Disney theme park ride. I strongly encourage everyone to hit the theaters for this film and can say this film merits a screening in 3-D if you have the chance. Word of warning, there may be moments a bit too intense for little kids, especially if they jump at loud noises. My scores are: Adventure/Drama/Family: 8.5-9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",

            "review_title": "the problem of 'Origin-Weight'",
            "content": "This might sound like some back-handed compliment, but bear with me as I go with what I did and didn't like about Disney's latest adaptation of the Jungle Book (their third in 50 years): it has, when you look at the blueprint of the story, the plot and the motivations of Mowgli for the most part, it's really solid. This may actually have a slightly more convincing story than the original Jungle Book when you look at how characters in this story, involving Mowgli, the jungle, its inhabitants (including the wolves who raised him), and the nemesis Shere Khan, all operate and it seems mostly logical and it makes for some compelling moments.But here's the rub: if you see it without seeing the 1967 animated movie certain things - like King Louie and his impromptu dip into \"I Wanna Be Like You\" - will seem especially random, and if you have seen it then moments like that will still make you go WTF. The online critic The Nerdwriter did a video a while back about prequel movies and how they have to deal with what's called \"Pre-Weight\", this idea that movies that take place before the original can't help but acknowledge certain things (maybe a lot of things) from the first films - The Hobbit was his example for that. With the latest Jungle Book there's something else at work, which is not new I'm sure for those who have gone to reboots recently, that I'll call 'Origin-weight', meaning that no matter how much Favreau and his extraordinarily skilled VFX team do to make this different from that movie, it has to at the least pay lip service and at most becomes remaking lines and scenes.Now this isn't as bad as certain other movies out there, and perhaps, of all things, The Lion King can be credited (or criticized) as a choice to bring in certain fresh elements (re: a boy in a perilous set piece involving a stampede of water buffalo through a ravine, and then the whole conflict of 'I got to go back and face the creature that's taken over my former land' and so on). Nevertheless this is not the original, and that wouldn't be a problem if that movie (Walt Disney's last as head-honcho by the way) didn't loom so large in the mind. Favreau's movie does work as a basic Boy's Action-Adventure Tale, of using skills that have come from years of, uh, being raised by wolves, and how he has to use them in staying alive in time to get to the Man Village (if that happens).I can't help but compare the two films, so here's the short of it: this new movie has a lot of exciting action and peril, and there's no doubt the voice actors assembled are kind of iconic (Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Christopher Walken, yep, I'll get to him in a moment), but, with a few scenes as exceptions, it's not as *entertaining* as I was hoping for. That may sound like a strange complaint, since you would think with a compelling lead that would carry it (Mowgli is a proactive protagonist, doing things like cleverly saving a baby elephant from a ditch and getting Balloo the bear his honey in a creative way that involves a surprising amount of process).But that 67 movie... it's just so much FUN, as a pure, unadalterated comedy first, adventure movie second, with the lessons learned not quite as important as seeing Louie Prima as King Louie doing one of the major musical numbers in movie history (I mean ever), and there it reigns supreme. Here, when Favreau and company have to do the King Louie scene, a) it's just kind of odd and hysterical to hear Walken doing the voice (he, along with Murray and Johansson and a couple others took me out of the movie the way no one in the Disney animated did since they weren't 'known' entities), and b) when it comes time to break out into the song it doesn't make sense (at least with \"Bare Necessities\", which comes up here as well, it feels a little more woven into Mowgli and Balloo becoming closer).In brief, this is a gorgeous movie to look at as far as the work put into it, the climax amps things up (maybe, just almost, too much to the point where real small children may be frightened, but whatever), and the core story certainly works and has a strong hero and villain with some changes that do make it, in fact, more compelling as a straight story of adventure. But because everything is in the \"real\" world, unlike an animated movie, you have to take it on the terms of its updated, hyper-real placement. And as Kubrick once said: real is good, interesting is better. The 2016 is real, the 1967 is interesting (and a helluva comedy).",

            "content": "I was initially skeptical at the idea of this Disney classic being remade. However I was wonderfully surprised at how the good the film turned out. It is most definitely a visual masterpiece with realistic CGI animation of the jungles of India and the animal inhabitants; not at all hokey. You are immediately thrust into Mowgli's world from the minute the credits open and the musical score strikes its first note.The story of \"The Jungle Book\" is virtually similar to the 1967 original, but this time the darker elements of Kipling's tale are present. Shere Khan, the fierce and vengeful tiger, is far more sinister in this movie than his more subdued 1967 counterpart. A bigger surprise in character change was the originally comic King Louie is made a more sinister character. This adaptation does stick more closely to the narrative of the original book, but it does not take away the story's humor. The beloved character of Baloo is still the lovable jungle bum we know and loved from the 1967 film, but with a new look and new voice actor.The film's most stand-out performance certainly goes to newcomer Neeli Sethi as young Mowgli. The twelve year old actor breathes new life into the man cub raised by wolves in the jungle as a smart, but naive boy who is courageous when faced with adversity from his surroundings. Given he interacts with all CGI creations, the spot-on solo work Neeli performs is even steps better than 1987's \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\". Director Jon Favreau also wisely chose his voice cast well for each character. Bill Murray inserts his trademark dry, sarcastic wit to the amiable Baloo even attempting (admittedly a bit poorly) to sing a segment of the original film's most famous song, \"The Bare Necessities\" with young Neeli Sethi. Bringing wisdom to the man cub's life is the protective Bagheera, voiced eloquently by the great Sir Ben Kingsley. As the film's secondary antagonist is a more sinister take on King Louie as voiced by the quirky and often ominous Christopher Walken (which creeped my mom out after a campy Louie Prima in the original film) who does manage to imprint his own mark on the newer angle for the character and does contribute the other iconic song, \"I Wanna Be Like You\". But the film's greatest voice performance is the terrifying Idris Elba as the evil Shere Khan; bringing out the most haunting moments of the film from his first appearance on screen to his horrifying demise.The film's weakest link was the unwise decision to cast actress Scarlett Johanssen as the voice of Kaa. The character has less than ten minutes of screen-time and is not utilized properly. Kaa is male like most of the story's characters and Johanssen misses the mark of Kaa's hypnotic charm; trying too hard to ooze a sensual tone that leaves the viewer more mystified than drawn in. The film's best female performance is by far the lovely Lupita N'yongo's contribution as Mowgli's wolf mother, Raksha; a fiercely independent female who is unafraid to stand up to Shere Khan to protect her children including the adopted man cub.Don't skip this visual treat. You really won't be disappointed.",

I won't go into detail about the story as it's already so ingrained in our collective consciousness but I have to pay respects to the production design, art and music - and every element that makes a great picture.First, the music is so right (SPOILER ALERT!!) When Baloo and Bagheera stand at the edge of the jungle and watch Mowgli save a baby elephant to the tune of The Bare Necessities, the familiar song floats on a sweet and somber note. They know he's becoming a man - and the tender version of the tune compliments what we're seeing on screen; We see the bittersweet realization (and the pride) in the faces of the animals. This is sublime perfection; a perfect marriage of music and the artists' emotional brushstrokes.That scene alone is worthy of a five-hanky movie status - but the creators of this version of The Jungle Book treat every scene with great affection and respect. Each shot is beautifully framed. Any given frame is a glorious masterpiece in color and composition. In the book world we would give a Caldecott Award to such artistic achievement. I only hope the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences will recognize this beautiful piece of work when it's time to nominate the Oscar films.Finally, the direction skillfully weaves the beauty and wonder of the jungle world and the humor of growing up - while also sending us on a heart-pounding tale of revenge.Director/Producer Jon Favreau and his team got it right.

The story is not good for children 5 - 10, given the violence, nor for adults given the lack of plausibility.

            "content": "The Jungle Book (2016): It has been almost 50 years since the first Jungle Book movie released which itself is an adaptation of 1894 classic novel The Jungle Book.Indians may not get familiar with its title but they have huge affection for their characters Mowgli,Baloo,Bhageera,Akela etc..Now its reboot into live action/CGI has released this April and a huge success world wide.So how is this reboot??Plot: Living among the wolves in the jungle, young man cub Mowgli (Neel Sethi) quickly learns to live life among his wolf pack under the supervision of Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) and all the animals that inhabit the jungle. But when the villainous tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) threatens Mowgli's life, black Panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) offers to take Mowgli to a nearby man village where he will be safe from the tiger's wrath. But along the way, Mowgli gets tangled up in a series of encounters with a sly snake named Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), a swimmingly ruthless gigant opithecus named King Louie (Christopher Walken) and a lazy bear named Baloo (Bill Murray) who quickly becomes his guide to the 'bear necessities' of life. So how did Mowgli deal with his life facing threat from Shere Khan??Plus Points:1)CGI: I am damn sure that The Jungle Book is the one which is going to win the Best Visual Effects award at 89th Academy Awards.This one is a technical masterpiece which will have a specific place in history.The scale and the detailing is astonishing to behold especially Shere Khan and Baloo are looking awesome.The technicians gave huge effort in giving such extraordinarily hair-perfect detail, and moves with such persuasive physicality and weight, they might as well be the real..2)Voice Cast and Neel Sethi: All of the artists have done exceptionally well with their brilliant efforts.The voice-casting of all the animal companions is shrewd to the point of unnerving.Bill Murray is superbly affecting and emotive as Baloo the bear,reminding us why Baloo the Bear is one of the most lovable characters of all time.Idris Elba as Shere Khan is terrifying.Ben Kingsley as Bhageera is excellent.Christopher Walken as Louie is scary and intense.Neel Sethi's acting almost entirely in green-screen,is an incredible effort.He is so adorable.3)Screenplay and Direction: Though its not the thing we hadn't seen but still its magic remains at its core.The Jungle book always a classic with its heart warming adventure with memorable characters and foot tapping music.This adaptation is nothing less of original one though this one lacks something important (May be I need few extra scenes with Baloo).John Favreau deserves a bow for bringing this classic with at most perfection.4)Music: The last but not least is the classic songs of The Jungle Book.Bare Necessities doesn't need any introduction.The moment when this song came in the movie,I got tears in my eyes as it brought me back my childhood memories.Bare Necessities,The Simple Bare necessities Forget about your worries and your strife......I love this song..So,The Jungle book is a brilliant adaptation of the classic with award winning technical excellence,perfect voice cast and Bare Necessities....My rating 7.5/10",

Akela had too little screen time. Baloo was also not cast well - where in the book he was mischievous he was also likable. There was none of the likability here. Bill Murray dropped the ball. Kaa had too little screen time. Ben Kingsley as Bagheera and Idris Elba were fantastic and were only ones who held their weight. Walken did great too but he had far too little screen time. Despite these three good performances I can't help but feel terribly letdown by the glaring weakness of Mowgli's character acting as well as that of Baloo, who is arguably the movie's second lead. Lupita Nyong'o did well as Raksha, but she had a rather small and subdued role so neither did her performance contribute much to the overall movie. The visuals and soundtrack were very good. Message of the movie was good and plot was executed well. I cannot believe how badly they dropped the ball here, this movie had such promise.",

The special effects are wonderful and the animals look fantastic.There are positives and negatives to the movie though: it will scare children - there is no doubt about that. It is more frightening to watch someone that looks life-like in a battle over watching cartoon characters. The story is a bit boring at times and makes the movie feel longer than it actually is.Ben Kingsley is wonderful as Bagheera and he actually breathes more life into the character than the original cartoon. Idris Elba is menacing as Shere Khan and I felt that he made Khan more of a villain than the cartoon had done. Christopher Walken just steals the show - his King Louie has that same impact that was in the original movie. Walken was marvelous as Louie and his character was the best part of the entire movie.Neel Sethi was a bit wooden as Mowgli, but he is acceptable in the role and does not bring the movie down - he also is not interesting enough to make you care about his character as you should to have the full impact. Bill Murray is alright as Baloo, but he misses the charm and fun that Phil Harris brought to the character. I felt that the movie did not flesh Baloo out enough and allow his playfulness that made his so likable and unforgettable in the cartoon. Scarlet Johansson is wasted in the role of Kaa. Kaa (Sterling Holloway) had such a presence in the cartoon that this version missed. There was so much more that they could have done with Kaa, but it felt like that part of the film was either edited or rushed.Overall it was a good film and entertaining to fans of the Jungle Book.",

            "content": "So, generally it's an entertaining movie with cool looking animals and scenarios. Watching Baloo sing \"Bare necessities\" again was pretty cool.Now, I'm giving it a 6 because of the animals. Some animals look quite realistic, but some other don't. Why would they do that? Baloo doesn't look like a realistic bear at all, not saying that's bad, he looks pretty cool actually and has good acting. On the other side we have Bagheera and Shere Khan, now those two look realistic and without any sort of personality, the only good thing about them are the voices. But they look terrible next to Baloo. Then we have some other characters like Raksha and Gray that look good-ish, not as good as Baloo, not as bad as Bagheera. And other secondary characters that look well. Then we have King Louie, they changed this character completely from the original one, that's not necessarily a bad thing. But he looks like a really huge though and angry animal that somehow starts to sing a happy song for a very short period of time, it's simply weird. The way he acts doesn't make a lot of sense.And the elephants... they are simply elephants. Not a single thing is interesting about them.Now, the problem with this is that some animals look very realistic, others don't, the ones that don't look that realistic look way better and are great to watch. It's a pretty terrible contrast in my opinion.",

He really feels alive and breathing the role.In conclusion, this is a wonderful movie if you are not really connected to the good old jungle book, but, Disney is Disney, and I am biased in this regard :) So I gave the movie 6.5 / 10.",

            "content": "Richard Kipling's The Jungle Book was been one of the most widely popular children's books for the past century, and its popularity has spawned many cinematic adaptions including the 1967 Disney animated classic and few live-action treatments. From the director Jon Favreau, the man behind 'Iron Man' and its sequels comes a long-anticipated remake of the popular story brought to life by stunning visual effects and outstanding performances from a star-studded cast. This film follows Mowgli (played by Neel Sethi), a young Indian boy raised in the jungle by wolves who train him as one of their own. The wolf pack is lead by alpha male Akela (voiced by Giancarlo Esposito) and mother Raksha (voiced by Lupita Nyong'o). This doesn't suit well with the evil tiger named Shere Khan (voiced by Idris Alba), ruler of the land who wants Mowgli dead. In fear of his family being harmed, Mowgli decides he is no longer safe and must leave the jungle and find a new home in the man-village. Accompanied by black panther Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley) and a wild bear named Baloo (voiced by Bill Murray), Mowgli sprawls across the wilderness heading towards the village while avoiding the fierce creatures that stand in their way. This new testament to Rudy Kipling's classic book shines bright with the most groundbreaking CGI ever put to film since James Cameron's revolutionary sci-fi hit 'Avatar' in 2009. The film is set in the jungle which is brought to life by stunning visual effects that give it photo-realistic look that is impossible to resist, along with the beautifully animated animals done by motion capture technology. It is just amazing see how far we've come with technology nowadays and the achievements filmmakers are learned to pull off with visual effects work. Despite the story set in a jungle in India, many would be surprised to learn that this film was shot on a studio in Los Angeles with a mix of constructed set pieces and blue screen effects. Normally, this makes for a risky feet in fantasy and science-fiction nowadays. Surprisingly, the filmmakers manage to make it work here. It is quite safe to say that the visual effects work will make a great competitor as next year's Oscars. From the fur on the animals, to the trees of the jungle; this film is one of the most, if not the most visually stunning film you'll see this year.The performances are nothing short of pleasant and delightful, especially Neel Sethi who plays Mowgli. Just watching this child and his performance just amazing that you can't help to care for his character as he faces the perils of the jungle and the fierce creatures that stand his way. The character is quite impressive with his interaction with the animals considering the fact Sethi is forced to react to characters are nonexistent and computer generated. Many surprises also come from the star studded cast including the enticing performance by Idris Alba as the vicious tiger Shere Khan, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, the charming Bill Murray as Baloo. A few other I forgot to mention include Scarlet Johansson who voices the poisonous snake Kaa who is sadly not given a whole lot of screen time, and Christopher Walken as the giant gorilla King Louie who brings the musical number 'Wanna Be Like You'. These actors show strong conviction in their roles and deserves nothing short of applause. The storytelling comes as another gem, fulfilling a story with engaging emotions and family friendly thrills. Though there are some intense action sequences during the second half and computer generated characters that have the potential of scaring the little ones, the film blesses viewers with a pleasing story that many will come to enjoy. The Jungle Book is a delightful re-adaption of Rudy Kipling's Classic book and arguably the best adaption of the classic tale that manages to improve upon the previous adaptions. This film is a thrilling adventure that will likely please many children and adults alike. If you are a parent looking for a good family movie in theaters, you will not find any betters picks than this one. This movie is a strong recommendation.",

The direction and screenplay is perfect. There's never a dull moment, which is something I was worrying about before seeing it. The pacing is non-stop with an incredible amount of vibrancy in characters and the jungle itself. Acting all around is fantastic! From Christopher Walken as King Louie, to Bill Murray as Baloo. And Neel Sethi as Mowgli to Idris Elba as Shere Khan. This is genius casting by Sarah Finn.The music by John Debney is beautiful. It finds itself as a love-letter to the original songs (especially The Bare Necessities) and Debney plays on that with his own touch of heart. My verdict; The Jungle Book is an incredible feat in computer generated filmmaking and combines that with live-action characters and environments with an outstanding visual design. This is definitely to be experienced on the big screen.The Jungle Book, 9/10.",

I was a bit anxious as to how what I had always thought of as an animated classic might translate into a live action flick, but I was very satisfied with the outcome.The film features amazing CGI effects in which jungle animals come to life and speak English to little Mowgli, the film's young protagonist. The story is superb, enthralling, and very worthy of its \"classic\" status.

Director Jon Favreau balances the comedy and drama really well in this film and it never feels like he's alienating younger audiences.

            "content": "Making a live-action version of a beloved Disney classic must be a daunting task for a director. Thankfully it's a task that director Jon Favreau flourishes in with his take on The Jungle Book. We've seen other Disney classics such as Cinderella get live-action remakes however, The Jungle Book is by far and away the best of them.You all know the story however, this is more of a reimagining rather than a straight up remake that finds man-cub Mowgli (Neel Sethi), raised by a pack of wolves after being found as a baby by Bagheera (Ben Kingsley), fleeing the jungle after a threat from the tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba).On his journey through the jungle, Mowgli comes across an array of characters including the bear Baloo (Bill Murray), the snake Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) and orangutan King Louie (Christopher Walken), not all of them having his best interests at heart.With the majority of characters being talking animals and the humans being kept down to a bare minimum, I always thought The Jungle Book as one of the hardest Disney animations to convert to live-action. I was skeptical about how the talking animals would look but thankfully my mind was put at ease within the film's opening scene. The Jungle Book throws the audience straight into an immersive jungle setting that is rather staggeringly all created with CGI. Aside from a few props and Mowgli himself, everything else you see is brought to life through the use of the latest technologies in special effects. It makes for a truly stunning cinematic experience with the photorealistic animals and jungle setting transporting the audience right into the heart of the story.The story itself is simple enough and while Favreau clearly wanted to pay homage to it, he also wanted to put his own stamp on it. He's certainly retained the fun side of things while making it that little bit darker with more of an emphasis on the peril facing Mowgli, mainly from Shere Khan. From the very off, The Jungle Book is a rip-roaring adventure film that doesn't let up until the very end. Keep an ear out for one or two familiar songs throughout as well.Neel Sethi gives an admirable performance as Mowgli, capturing his cockiness and naivety incredibly well but the real highlights come in the voice performances. Bill Murray is just about the perfect casting for Baloo and he nails the essence of Baloo's laid back lifestyle perfectly. Ben Kingsley and Lupita Nyong'o do well with the authoritative Bagheera and Raksha, the latter bringing real emotion to the adoptive mother of Mowgli.On the villainous side of things, Idris Elba excels as the fearsome Shere Khan, relentless in his pursuit of Mowgli. The voice is so important for a character such as Shere Khan and Elba really can produce a sinister voice when he wants to. Christopher Walken is good as King Louie and I was left a bit disappointed at how little Scarlett Johansson's Kaa was in the film. She did well with what she was in so maybe we will hear her more in the already announced sequel.The Jungle Book really is a great adventure that provides plenty of entertainment for people of all ages. If further live-action Disney remakes are anything like this then we could be in for some right treats.",

            "review_title": "Ironically unnatural and inorganic.",
            "content": "Director Jon Favreau brings his take on Disney's 1967 classic animated film The Jungle Book in a new, live-action remake by the same name. The tale, originally based on a collection of stories by author Rudyard Kipling, is all too familiar. Mowgli is a mancub, raised in the jungle and befriended by animals, that must return to the man village when the jungle becomes too dangerous for him. This new variation, however, contorts all the pure wildness of the adventure and its characters into a stagnant yet laborious bore.It's interesting that this film is considered live-action, although all of its background settings and all but one of the characters are completely computer generated and animated imagery. It's been an increasing trend in big budget Hollywood movies, though. There is something about the combination of falsely created animals and backdrops along with a real boy actor that just doesn't sit well, visually. The jungle atmosphere is more than believably authentic and the animals all look great, realistic even, with beautifully furry textures. They are so impressively real looking that you want to reach out and touch them in spectacular 3D. Yet, there is something completely unnatural about them. Usually the uncanny valley appears when looking at a created human character that is simultaneously too real but not quite real. This is the first time I've had the same sensation from non-humans, an animal uncanny valley. There is just something slightly off about them and the way they move, or often don't move, that takes me out of the movie altogether. To be wild animals in an adventure movie, they sure do a lot of sitting around and talking.There seem to be more talking animal head shots in this film than anything else, but the mouths of these characters barely move, a kin to watching one of Disney's direct to home video dog Buddies movies, creating quite a disconnect. While the film boasts a surely perfect cast of great actors for the wildlife, all of the voice acting is pretty stilted. The lines are delivered, but never really feel felt. The film also gives a nod to the original by including a couple of its memorable songs, but here they are sort of kind of oddly talked through, not sang, in the middle of scenes, becoming irrelevant and bizarre. Our only true connection as an audience into this experience is our lone live actor, newcomer Neel Sethi as Mowgli, who, although completely adorable, isn't quite the best actor.The updated story here is a twisted hodgepodge of contrived scenes that actually do add up to lead Mowgli specifically to the climax of the film, but don't flow in any organic way in doing so. There is also some very heavy borrowing of specific scenes and bit characters from other Disney movies set in nature like The Lion King, Bambi and Tarzan that really don't serve its needed purpose. Instances in the film were created with partial documentary style camera shots to enhance the real and natural the else trying to be presented, but within a dramatic story, it actually works against it. So while the technicality of the film is applaudable, it still just doesn't measure up. Nothing about the film feels just right, making The Jungle Book the most unnatural movie about being in nature I've ever seen.",

            "content": "I haven't seen the 1967 animated story of the Jungle book since I was a child so I am basing this review on the 2016 adaptation alone. I have never read the novel so comparisons to that will be left well alone also. As a standalone movie, The Jungle Book was very entertaining but not without its flaws.Visually, this movie is absolutely the stunning. Filmed using 100% CGI (Apart from Neel Sethi who plays Mowgli), the world which is created is one of colour, intricate detail and breath-taking landscapes. The details of the environment are stunning, from the sky to the lakes and to the fields and trees, everything is created perfectly. The animals are brought to life with stunning realism; Shere Khan is especially impressive to look with Bagheera, Baloo and King Louie all imposing in their own regard. The only non-CGI character is Mowgli, whilst the actor was far from perfect the effect of having a real life actor in a completely CGI world was handled impressively and I can only recall one or two instances where he looked out of place.I was very impressed with the casting, the voice overs were all pretty much spot on. Idris Elba was great at Shere Khan bringing great intimidation, power and aggression to his character. Baloo was voiced brilliantly by Bill Murray, witty and charming with his own personal take on the 'bare necessities' classic. Another notable mention was Ben Kingsley as Bagheera and Scarlett Johansson with her small part as Kaa. One voice over which I thought felt slightly out of place was Christopher Walken as King Louie the ape, the head of all the other smaller monkeys, they tried to portray some sort of mafia/Godfather type character which felt a little strange.I felt that the lack of character and relationship development left The Jungle Book feeling quite hollow and when the climax to the movie arrived I felt it was missing a real, much needed emotional element. Some real character development would benefit the story massively and it was a big negative in my opinion. I was expecting some great on screen chemistry between Mowgli and Baloo, I wanted to see a special friendship form with some special friendship dialogue and emotional scenes. Instead we had none of this, it felt more like they bumped into each other, spent some time together and then we are force fed the message that they have a strong friendship and bond, why not show us some of this then when the opportunity was there? I bought into the friendship between Mowgli and Bagheera much more though, which was nice. There were a few plot holes along the way, nothing too glaringly offensive but certainly some conveniences which were a little irritating. The pacing was spot on however with a refreshing run- time of around 105 minutes, it is a polite reminder that not all Hollywood Blockbusters require dragged out film lengths with boring, unnecessary filler scenes.Overall I enjoyed the movie experience of The Jungle Book and it was visually beautiful. The run-time helped keep my attention throughout but I was left feeling a little disappointed with the lack of character development. I would recommend checking this movie out and viewing it as a stand alone film, it's not a bad movie but it is far from perfect also.7/10",

And may be due to this, I was never attracted to the story of the man cub in the jungle. Also, the only story of Kipling I read in school was Kim which I felt was touching.Technically, Jungle Book is a brilliant film. Amazing visuals and its hard to believe that all the animals are CGI generated. And I won't be surprised if the movies wins a few Oscars for the technical aspects.However, when I did go to see the movie in 3D and I saw lots of kids around, I was surprised that Favreau had made a film targeting a more mature audience. Seriously, Shere Khan and Kaa are pretty scary to see on screen, menacing and dangerous and the climax is not for the faint hearted. There is a lot of blood and gore in this film.Also, Favreau's interpretation of the story is a bit strange. He projects the movie as sort of revenge drama between Shere Khan and Mowgli. I never realised Jungle Book was a revenge story. Puzzling.Watch it for the CGI and visuals.",

Shere Khan, who's voiced by Idris Elba, is a wholly computer- animated creation. But he's realised in such extraordinarily hair- perfect detail, and moves with such persuasive physicality and weight, he might as well be the real, red-in-tooth-and-claw deal. The spell even holds when he starts to speak, to the extent that you might find yourself wondering if a few years ago, the director, Jon Favreau, sat a real tiger down with a dialogue coach and a Luther box set, and it just worked out surprisingly well. This film's existence implicitly poses a question: why, almost 50 years on from the release of Wolfgang Reitherman's unimpeachable animated version, would Disney want to go back to The Jungle Book? Shere Khan, along with the rest of its photorealistic supporting cast, is the answer. All previous live-action adaptations of Rudyard Kipling's stories (and there have been a few) have felt like studio- bound fantasies, all circus animals, rubber ferns, and vets with tranquilliser darts just out of shot. But this one \u2013 ironically, the most synthetic of the lot \u2013 has the warm-blooded, weather-beaten ring of truth.",

            "content": "There's no question about it. Well almost. The new Jungle Book film is one of Disney's most ambitious production in years. Fluid with lush detail, the entire film is a concoction of sights and sounds just waiting to take the audience on an epic journey. There's action and excitement, awe and serenity and altogether very engaging. But there's also a caveat, owing to which a vast majority of the audience might overlook a fundamental question - Is this really a live-action film?It's almost 50 years since Rudyard Kipling's book of the same name was adapted into an instant Disney classic. That's a huge generation gap to fill considering children who watched the original now have children of their own. In order to satisfy both generations and still remain on par with sister concern and industry leading Pixar, I expect Disney has pushed its creative expertise to the limits. As a result over 90 percent of the film is CGI rendered. If that's what viewers want, then the experience is bound to be aesthetically astounding. But that also means that very little of what we see is actually 'live' footage.This wouldn't be the first time though and precisely why the visual effects and production design are not really groundbreaking. Life of Pie in the jungle? You bet. While that film was made in a swimming pool, The Jungle Book is entirely 'filmed' in a studio, much like Zack Snyder's 300. The only thing real is Mowgli, a feral child adorably played by newcomer Neel Sethi. Now here's where it gets really interesting and it doesn't matter whether viewers have seen the animated original. Director Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Marks have paired the story with fleshed-out characters, each played to perfection with exceptional voice acting. These are Mowgli's friends Baloo the bear and Bagheera the panther, opposite gangster-like orangutan King Loui, Kaa the hypnotic python and Shere Khan the vicious tiger. And because it was such a pleasure matching these animals to the actors lending their voices, I leave the audience to discover who plays who. That being said, the biggest triumph in this film IS the casting from the legendary three - Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walken and Bill Murray, to equally outstanding voice overs from Scarlett Johansson, Lupita Nyong'o and Idris Elba. Add to fact that at least four of them are Oscar nominated actors and it becomes an understatement to their delivery in this film.So to answer the question, The Jungle Book remake is technically still an animated film given the production is almost entirely 'added-in' using computer generated motion capture technology. Like it or not, this is the future of cinema but none of this really matters as most viewers wouldn't know the difference. That's because the end result is seamless when viewed on a large screen and absolutely breathtaking. Visual quality aside, the film is a heart-warming story that remains faithful to the 1967 original and Kipling's coming-of-age tale of a child raised by wolves in the heart of an Indian jungle. It's an adventure for the whole family, and although some moments are startling and dark, this remake is still a fun reincarnation for the new generation. Forget about your worries, the new Jungle Book is packed with Mother Nature's recipes, and that's the bare necessities to enjoying this film.",

            "content": "Rudyard Kipling's classic tale of a young boy brought up in the jungle by various animals is brought to life once again on the big screen in a fittingly wonderful way. Mowgli leads a peaceful and happy life with a wolf pack led by Akela (Esposito) and Raksha (Nyong'o) until the tiger Shere Khan (Elba) enters the scene, bearing an old grudge and an insatiable desire for revenge.If you go to the cinema to watch a movie that will draw you into a fantasy world of wonder, Favreau's retelling of this story - which so many of us remember from childhood - manages to weave that magic. We all know how the story plays out. With the panther Bagheera's (Kingsley) help, Mowgli (Sethi) tries to stay away from Shere Khan. He also encounters the devious python Kaa (Johansson), a super-sized orangutan with a soul-singer's baritone named King Louie (Walken) desperate to obtain the 'red flower'( which is fire) and of course, Baloo the grizzly bear (Murray). These are the key characters, but you'll also be delighted to discover a few new entrants along the way as well. It all builds on the charm of the 1967 film, which by itself is a must watch for any childWhile Sethi is of course, the only real person in here, all the animals have a fantastic degree of photorealism. And Sethi's interaction with the animals throughout the duration of the movie, given that they are CGI, is completely convincing. He combines innocence and warmth with the survival skills and resourcefulness of someone far older.\nWhile Favreau is faithful to the old elements, (old songs like Bare Necessities included, of course) he also brings in a few new subtle touches as well in order to keep things interesting. While the King Louie scene is one of the many high points, Kaa's screen time could have been lengthened a bit, though. Nonetheless, the performance of the voice cast is spot-on. But more than anything, the intricate landscaping, masterful camerawork and environment (actually filmed in Downtown Los Angeles) create a delightfully immersive experience. Heartwarming and enjoyable.",

The Jungle Book, however, was a major disappointment. Yes, it was indeed visually amazing. CGI has come a long way, and the facial expressions of the animals (especially King Kong Christopher Walken) were outstanding. The voice acting by the all-star cast was top notch as well. That is where the good parts end.This movie would be ideal for children ages 12 and under, or a parents taking their kids to see the movie. For anybody older than that, this movie has little to offer (other than what is mentioned above). I understand the child playing Mogli is young, I get it, but his acting at times is painful. I mean 90s Goosebump episodes painful. The writing, equally so (i.e. goofy recitation about the law of the jungle repeated multiple times throughout the movie). Tedious action/chase scenes with serious thematic music sprinkled throughout, followed by equally tedious conversations with the ever annoying Mogli. It's like they couldn't find the balance between goofy kids movie and remastered epic. So what they end up with is simply a goofy mess. And it's okay if it's a goofy movie, I freakin loved The Mummy and am entertained every Halloween by the ever silly cheesefest, Van Helsing.

            "content": "As a moviegoer, I've long grown tired of Hollywood's remake/reboot/regurgitate method of business. The newest live-action Disney film continues this frustrating trend of repurposing established entities for new audiences. However, the good news is, Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book is a solid adventure, free from the obvious corporate/studio interference that plague similar re-told tales.Favreau's Jungle Book is a Disney movie through and through, sticking to the same beats as the original Disney animated feature. There are few risks taken in regard to storytelling. The story of The Jungle Book is straightforward, following young Mowgli, played competently by Neel Sethi, who is thrust into the jungle after Shere Khan, the man-hating tiger, voiced by Idris Elba, threatens to hunt him down. The film's plot is thin, with Mowgli simply traveling from place to place, visiting a variety of locations and meeting a collection of colorful animals. It may not be heavy in terms of plot, but The Jungle Book's story succeeds because of its simplicity. Favreau and writer Justin Marks distill Rudyard Kipling's characters and story into their base elements. The result is a near perfect blend of the spirit of Kipling's original books and the personality of the Disney animated classic.The voice cast similarly strikes the right note. Ben Kingsley as the fatherly panther Bagheera, Bill Murray as the fun-loving bear Baloo, even Christopher Walken's strange turn as a giant orangutan named King Louie give off the right kind personality and energy. The base elements of The Jungle Book are decidedly family friendly, with a simple adventure story, a child protagonist, and even a few songs. While the film would work well with only these basics, The Jungle Book is elevated considerably by its visual spectacle and world-class special effects from Weta Digital. The world of The Jungle Book is lush, colorful, and imaginative. The locations range from dense jungles to muddy valleys to a beautiful ruined temple and these places perfectly blend the realistic with the fantastical. That blend is seen in the CGI animals as well. Every animal in the jungle, including tigers, wolves, snakes, and elephants, is a digital creation, allowing for more idealized creature designs. This enhanced reality extends to all facets of the film. The Jungle Book is an example of special effects done perfectly. There is not one moment when you feel as if what you are watching is an effect. It all feels real, even when we know it's not. Watching the film, I had no idea where the real world ended and the effects began. This is the best compliment I can give to a special effects film. That is not to say that the effects aren't flashy and impressive. Quite the opposite. Favreau consistently shows off what the Weta team can do, giving us a number of rip roaring action sequences. My favorite of which pits Mowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera against King Louie and his army of monkey henchmen among a ruined temple. The fiery climax is also a sight to behold. Favreau keeps the action clear and intense, improving from the shaky, chaotic action from his earlier action endeavors.Disney's The Jungle Book will be remembered as part of Disney's animated remake collection, but it deserves to be looked at on its own merit. It is a solid adventure story that kids will certainly enjoy, but it also showcases special effects and action so good that one could enjoy this film simply as a visual tour of an astounding jungle landscape. It doesn't reinvent any genres or pave new trails for storytelling, but The Jungle Book is a well crafted adventure for the whole family to enjoy.77/100",

            "content": "One thing about me is the fact that I never, ever watch trailers, I believe in going in every movie totally blind and that was the same case here. Given that, I must admit I might have been one of the few people that was totally indifferent about the new Jungle Book, not even Jon Favreau's involvement managed to get me really excited about this film, and I am a huge fan of his. I simply could not care less for one reason or another, now after having seen it I must admit I was pleasantly warmed up by the film which won me over in less than a minute, yet I still contend a little indifference about this story and I might have figured out why.Before delving into that let me praise the film for its many merits. I am going to address it, even if there probably isn't a living film fan who hasn't already heard about it, but indeed, these special effects are something to behold. I won't call them as revolutionary as something like Star Wars, nor will I say this is the next step for filmaking, since it clearly is a particular case given the type of film it is, and truthfully it is a case in which the special effects serve and enhance story, still, this is the first time I have ever felt a CGI being so believable and palpable. It did take a couple of minutes to get adjusted to, but once you do you are immersed in a world where you will hardly notice any CGI. The integration of the actor, the jungle and the animals is seamless, it carries weight and not even for one second becomes distracting.Talking about actors, Neel Sethi is unbelievable. He feels absolutely genuine and comfortable on screen, rarely ever missing a beat and carrying the whole movie on his own. I have no idea what Favreau must have done to direct him this perfectly and it someway it reminds you of the joy of cinema, where you will be genuinely asking yourself: \"how the hell did they do that?!\". Favreau also demonstrates his great talent behind the camera by not loosing himself in an extravaganza of effects, he keeps it simple, concentrating on the story which has always a flow and never stops to make the audience emptily look at an effect just for the sake of shock. He also has to thank John Debney's score which was a key part of the success of this film. Multiple times I really felt the music coming in, without ever being distracting, and giving many scenes its most important beats. I hand't heard of this composer before, but he really made himself noticeable with this brilliant score, which gives the film a real emotional flow which culminates in a really thrilling climax that by far was the most engrossing part of the film.Despite all of these goods, I still found a slight emotional distance with the whole film. I have to point out firstly that it does spoon feed the audience a little too much at moments and does not take advantage of some great visual storytelling opportunities. There is some of that don't get me wrong, but I definitely felt it could have strengthened its gravitas and intensity multiple times, by slightly holding back on dialogue or exposition and show a little more action and movement on screen.The other reason I feel, like I said in my introduction, a little indifferent is probably because the story simply isn't that resonant to me for different reasons. I never found it to be as interestingly allegorical as something like Zootopia or Finding Nemo. To me it never fully manages to transcend its setting and I find it to remain a fantastical story with a good sense of wonder and adventure, some good metaphors, but never being an engrossing mythological tale. I simply don't find a close connection with the characters which for me don't elevate their personas to an archetypal status an remain slightly limited to their role in the story. Confront this with anything from, as I said, Zootopia and Finding Nemo to Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, I don't find that frame of reference in the Jungle Book, I don't look at it as a universal tale as I do with many others.Still it remains quite a story and one that definitely has had huge success with many audiences through the years and whilst I may have some personal reservations about it, I still believe it deserves this kind of re-telling which gave me a pleasant experience in the theater and is sure to do so and more with any kind of viewer.",

That too was very frustrating.Had those problems not existed...I would have probably given the full star status for this movie.

            "content": "\"The Jungle Book\" 2016 is a delight. Go see it. Neel Sethi is utterly adorable. He's so good you want to dispatch a protective bubble or a team of social workers to his home to rescue him from the sad fate of other excellent child stars, like Judy Garland and Patty Duke. Sethi plays Mowgli, a little Indian boy who cavorts around the forest with his animal friends: a pack of wolves, Baloo the bear (Bill Murray), and Bagheera, a black panther (Ben Kingsley). Shere Khan the Tiger (Idris Elba), Kaa the Python (Scarlett Johansson), and King Louie the Orangutan (Christopher Walken) provide menace. The ratio of mindless fun to genuinely scary and suspenseful scenes is perfect. The CGI is excellent. I'm a birdwatcher and it was fun seeing realistic looking hoopoes, bee-eaters, peacocks and hornbills. I loved \"The Jungle Book\" 1967 and I love this movie, too. I wish this film had as many songs as the old version. One song is cut because of a change in the plot, and one song is cut because a change in the approach. In the older version the elephants were comical; in this version they are the gods who created the forest. Baghera teaches Mowgli to worship them. That idea of elephants-as-gods probably won't go over well with many religious viewers. Kaa, the python, does sing \"Trust in Me,\" but over the closing credits, not during the film. That's a shame. Scarlet Johansson's smoky-jazzy Chet-Baker style version knocks it out of the park. The track is on youtube and fans are insisting that Johansson sing the next James Bond movie theme song. \"The Jungle Book\" 2016 is all about boys and men and all for boys and men. The only significant female character is Kaa, and she tries to kill and eat Mowgli. Most of the voice actors are much more low key than they were in the original version. I wish they had had more fun, been more flamboyant and campy. Bill Murray and Christopher Walken are really the only ones who juice up their voices for their parts, recognizing that voice acting is different than being on camera. Idris Elba is much too low- key as Shere Khan. George Sanders was, of course, superb in the original. With that voice and that attitude, who could he not be? Go see this movie for no other reason than to hear Christopher Walken voice King Louie the Orangutan who wants to be human. Walken is Just. So. Good. I mean, he's Christopher Walken. How could he not be? \"The Jungle Book\" 2016 has a significantly different ending than \"The Jungle Book\" 1967. If you don't want to know how the film ends, stop reading now, as this review will reveal the ending. The plot of \"The Jungle Book,\" both 1967 and 2016, is that a young orphan boy has been raised by wolves. His mentors, Bagheera and Baloo, must escort him to the man village, where he belongs. In the 1967 version, Mowgli does go to live in the man village. He is lured by a cute girl, singing the significantly titled song \"My Own Home.\" In the 2016 version, Mowgli stays in the jungle. What is the movie saying, then, about humanity's \"own home\"? Mowgli, in fighting off Shere Khan, grabs a burning torch from the man village. He accidentally sets the forest on fire. He uses his engineering skill and the elephants' \"divine\" strength to create a dam and flood the burning forest, thus extinguishing the fire and saving his animal friends' lives. In the 2016 version, the ideal human is not one who leaves the forest to live in the man village. The ideal human is an environmentalist. He is in the forest, of the forest, and he manages the forest and protects it from mankind's depredations.",

            "content": "Jon Favreau takes the tale of Disney classic, the Jungle Book, and manages to improve it with spectacular visual effects and effective storytelling. Thereby, he creates an enjoyable cinematic experience for both children and grownups alike.It seems important to note that every frame of this movie was actually shot on a modest set in LA and not on location in a faraway jungle. Except for its main character, all the characters and the environment they're in are all created digitally on a computer. Favreau set out to recreate one his childhood favorite movies, which was released in 1967 under the same name, for the next generation to enjoy. He kept the original Jungle Book feel in his movie by exploiting on the key factors what made it so memorable: an adventure story where different characters, and even species, can coexist and befriend one another capped off with some incredibly catchy songs. The abandoned Mowgli is found in the jungle, raised by a pack of wolves where he tries hard to fit in and eventually attempts to escape the jungle in fear of a malicious tiger.For the main character of Mowgli, Favreau gets an earnest and impressive performance out of newcomer Neel Sethi, considering he's acting opposite a blue screen in an empty room. Sethi has great screen presence for his young age and convincingly plays an innocent and creatively resourceful Mowgli, making him extremely likable for the audience in his adventure through the jungle. The rest of the original Jungle Book characters also make a pleasant return accompanied by excellent voice acting by an All Star cast. Legends sir Ben Kingsley and Bill Murray do a superb job in voicing Mowgli's travel companions, the protective Bagheera and free-spirited Baloo respectively. Lupita Nyong'o as Raksha, Scarlett Johansson as the deceptive Kaa, and Giancarlo Esposito as Akela all do a fine job in their respective roles. Even Christopher Walken, who's casting remained doubtful to me coming into the movie, gave a different but still wonderful performance as King Louie. The most impressive voice performance and my favorite casting choice came from Idris Elba as the intimidating Shere Khan. As he already looks physically terrifying, Idris' line delivery with his deep voice only enhances the effect. Favreau incorporates these supporting characters very competently into the story. He could have easily used the stunning looking animals and celebrity voices to show off and take the focus off the main character. However, each of the supporting characters does what it supposed to: support the main character in developing its character arc and to further the story. Credit the screenplay from Justin Marks, which leaves no plot hole open, gives each character a clear personality and motive leading to entertaining dialogue with nice chemistry between Mowgli and the supporting characters.Finally, what steals the show in this newest rendition of the Jungle Book are the visually effects on display. Under Shaun Friedberg and his entire crew responsible for animation and special effects, they created the most impressive digitalized looking film I've seen since Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity. From the well-used 3D effects to give the jungle chases depth, to the realistic-looking animals, branches, dirt, water, and fire. No expenses were withheld to create a world the audience can seamlessly transport into. Cinematographer Bill Pope takes advantage of the freedom fully digitalized film provides, creating sweeping shots from angles impossible to film under normal conditions. It all looks spectacular and you need to pinch yourself sometimes to realize that it's all Hollywood magic. All in all, Jon Favreau and his whole technical team have told a feel good story packaged in a film that is a feast to the eyes. In doing so, they also opened the door to a world of possibilities in filmmaking, telling stories that were previously impossible to film by using fully digitalized images. Using this technology, more untold stories can now be told and hopefully in the same quality as this one.",

Like a particular song, although for a long time I only knew the German lyrics to that song. And don't worry, this is not a musical (or do worry if that is your thing), it just happens to have a couple of songs in in it (very good and amusing ones at that).The story is kind of timeless, the CGI is very up to date of course. And it seems like a new trend has been kick-started with this. Other \"classic\" stories will follow it's steps (Legend of Tarzan is supposedly one of them, though I haven't watched it and cannot confirm it, just by hearsay). Comedy works quite nicely and the drama is there too. Really enjoyable",

            "content": "Mowgli is a child, referred to as a 'man-cub', who has been raised by a wolf pack in the jungle. He tries to live like a wolf but clearly he isn't. Things go well for him until the tiger Shere Khan learns of his presence in the jungle; he was injured after an encounter with a man and cautions that Mowgli will grow up to become a man and thus a threat. He demands that the wolves hand him over to be killed but they refuse. Mowgli sees that he is a danger to his animal friends so leaves with the panther Bagheera who intends to take Mowgli to the man village. They are separated and Mowgli encounters various other jungle animals; some that are friendly others that present a danger. Eventually he must inevitably face Shere Khan.This appears to be a live action film but apart from Mowgli just about everything is computer generated\u0085 it is just so good it looks real. The story is simple enough so viewers of all ages should be able to follow it however some scenes may be a little too intense for younger viewers. The scenes where animals fight look surprisingly real. The voice cast, which includes plenty of top actors, including Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walken, Scarlett Johansson and Idris Elba, does an impressive job bringing their animal characters to life and young Neel Sethi does a fine job as Mowgli. People familiar with Disney's '60s animated version may expect plenty of songs; this version just includes a couple; these are rather fun and don't detract from the more serious tone of most of the film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this splendid film to everybody apart from younger children.",

In recent years I have been growing tired of animated movies so I went in without much expectation.The movie is done with a combination of reality, in shooting real countryside, plus the actor who plays Mowgli. Then shooting on green screen allowed them to put in the animation. It works really seamlessly and well.Neel Sethi is Mowgli who was raised by wolves after his parents were killed by a dangerous Tiger, Shere Kahn. As he grows it becomes time for him to seek a human community, he no longer fits in with the animals. But Kahn doesn't view his job as done until he also kills Mowgli.Great actors are voicing the animations. Bill Murray is Baloo, a bear that befriends Mowgli and helps lead him to safety. Ben Kingsley is Bagheera, the leopard that also helps protect Mowgli. The evil Tiger is Idris Elba as Shere Khan. And Scarlett Johansson is the very large jungle snake Kaa. And finally Christopher Walken is just super as the giant Orangutan living in ancient ruins, King Louie.While this is not a musical per se, the characters voiced by Murray, Johansson, and Walken each have a song, and each actor sings their own songs. I especially enjoyed Walken's vocal performance, both the acting and the singing.Very enjoyable, somewhat better than I expected.",

This latest one from his studio follows many of the sequences from that version including the use of songs like \"The Bare Necessities\" and \"I Wanna Be Like You\". Well, actually the ending is a bit different which I won't reveal here. Anyway, this was a quite enjoyable version of Rudyard Kipling's tale of a man-cub raised in the jungle being befriend by the various animals with the exception of a tiger named Shere Khan. I especially liked Bill Murray voicing Baloo the Bear, previously done by Phil Harris in the animated version. So on that note, that's a recommendation of this version of The Jungle Book.",

            "content": "1st this is certainly not the first remake of the 1942 movie which was a bit of a different story and plot. While the 1942 movie was the original, it's usually the 1967 animated version from Disney that is best known. The 1967 one's plot has been done over and over especially in the 90s where several little kids TV versions and a badly chided movie were common. The first one was a great movie in it's 1940s time. Most people then thought it was great to be able to see all the animals. But now most people, jaded by better TV and movie productions no longer have interest in the really poor use of fake, stuffed animals used in the 1942 one.This 2016 version was closest in plot to the 1967 animated musical which is the most popular version. This one is not nearly as musically inclined like the 1967 one was. The animal songs in the 1967 one were exceptionally great. Frankly, I hope to never have to hear Bill Murray sing again as he did in this version. It was absolutely the most awful singing of \"Bare Necessities\". It was just absolutely out of tune and no sense timing. Murray sang it like he was drunk or stoned. Of course he thought he was being cute and funny. But frankly he ruined his song. The well produced bluesy, jazzy numbers of the 1967 songs were mostly mutilated in this movie. The one pleasant exception was Christopher Walken's version of the \"I wanna be like you song\". He added ape sounds to just the right places in the song so you knew it was the ape's song. But still pales next to the 1967 singing.The place the movie did excel was in the CGI creatures. The talking CGI animals were a great way to make the imagination grasp the crazy theme that is Jungle Book. That was a good deal better than the 1967 animations of the boy and animals jumping, hopping and climbing in very unrealistic animated ways. The plot was mostly the same as the 1967 one with only a few differences, mostly in it's ending.There's not a lot of sense in fully discussing the plot of a title that has been done over and over again. Not much to give away here. Almost everyone has seen some similar version of the Jungle Book. Just read the movie descriptions and you'll get what you need to know. One thing about this version is some of the big name actors that signed on to do voices. Just look at IMDBs cast list and you're bound to see some very famous actors and comedians.The problem with this movie isn't that it's a bad movie. It's not. But frankly I found myself wanting to go back and watch the much better 1967 animated musical version and did. If you are going to do a remake, you need to improve on the original as it will be compared with the other versions. And other than the CGI, this movie failed to be as good as the 1967 version it was modeled after.",

Though the special effects of THE JUNGLE BOOK are pretty stunning, its message seems more appropriate to the Last Ice Age, when a few thoughtless bozos wiped out the Wooly Mammoths and dodo birds.

This version is clearly based on the Disney animated original rather than Kipling's books \u2013 Neel Sethi's Mowgli looks exactly like his animated precursor, and two of the songs show up, both in entirely fitting ways \u2013 but the differences all fit perfectly. There are changes to the plot which (among other things) clarify motivations, the elephants are there but used rather differently (and, I think, better), and the action is excellent. The voice talent is also first rate, with Scarlet Johansen, Christopher Walken, and Bill Murray being quite different to, but as effective as, Sterling Holloway, Louis Prima, and Phil Harris. Only Idris Elba disappoints: his voice has an appropriate timbre, but his accent fails to capture Shere Khan's regal demeanour or oily menace in the way that George Sanders did.The set pieces are wonderfully executed, and the climactic showdown with Shere Khan is utterly thrilling, edge of your seat stuff, and succeeds on every level. The 3D has its moments, but is far from essential \u2013 it may be worth a first viewing in 3D. Overall, this is a film which, I suspect, will be every bit as much a classic as its hand-drawn forefather.",

            "content": "Jon Favreau take a bow. This is one of the most enjoyable films I've had the pleasure of watching in the last few years. It's funny, it's dramatic, it's spectacular, it's vivid and it is the most complete update of a previous Disney production you will see. Were the great Walt Disney around today he would stand and applaud having seen one of his cartoons truly brought to life.The Jungle Book for me was pure escapism. For an hour and 45 minutes I was thrust into the darkest jungle with young Mowgli traveling to the Man-village for his safety and encountering those well known characters Baloo the Bear (Bill Murray), Bagheera the Black Panther (Ben Kinglsey), Shere Khan the Tiger (Idris Elba) and King Louie (Christopher Walken) lord of the monkey clans. The CGI rendering is supreme yet these characterisations are driven primarily by their voices and not their movement. It is quite an achievement to be taken to a place where we accept animals talking as normal and without question. The actors providing these voices were perfectly chosen.The only real element in the picture is Neel Sethi as Mowgli who found himself in front of the camera for what must have been 95% of the production. He's a charming young fellow with an easy smile and a determined nature to match his difficult task as the central figure of a multi-million dollar Disney feature at the tender age of 12. In years past his character would have devolved at some point into an obnoxious child but not here. Sethi portrays the youngster in all of us who wanted to maintain our fantasies and not join the adult world of serious responsibilities.Is there anything to complain about from The Jungle Book? No. You would have to be a hard marker or a pedant of the highest order to look for or find a flaws in this brilliant film. Had the film been released before the last awards season it would certainly have won every category relating to effects specifically because they are so dominant yet so subtle and believable. I could also make an argument Bill Murray deserves at least a nomination as Baloo the Bear one of the funniest and most charming characters you will enjoy this year. The same could be said for Kinglsey as the protective panther or Elba as the cruel and brutal tiger but in the case of Murray the Bear, an award for his role would be a necessity.",

With humans recently moving closer to the jungle with their burning \"Red Flower.\" Sniffing him out, Shere Khan (whose got a scar on his face from humans) gives the order that Mowgli must leave the jungle,or he will kill him. Hiding as Mowgli and Bagheera leave the jungle, the tiger, tiger, burning bright,In the forests of the night,waits to make his move.View on the film:Opening with an ultra-stylised tracking shot going from the Disney castle to the midst of the jungle,director Jon Favreau & cinematographer Bill \"The Matrix\" Pope give their jungle adventure a gloriously lush shine. Shot entirely on green screen,Pope's use of green (a major theme in his work) gives the title a crumbly,earthy vibe,where each tree and vine shows a clear attention to detail. Making Mowgli the only living person/thing in the whole movie, Favreau avoids the \"uncanny valley\" by treading a fine line of the facial movements being a nature fit for the animals,whilst making sure that the animated personalities light up the eyes.Toning down the buddy Comedy delights of the original (no Beatles tribute!) the screenplay by Justin Marks takes a closer inspiration from Rudyard Kipling's books by going for a more soulful atmosphere,with Marks brilliantly layering Mowgli's connection to nature and the rituals he is trying to embrace. Along with the soulfulness,Marks unleashes a cracking adventure packed with a rather mature take on revenge and self-discovery,which are joined by hilarious one liners tying the buddy team of Mowgli/Baloo and Bagheera.Inhabiting a character who took 5 hours to render in every frame, Bill Murray gives a wonderful performance as Baloo,as Murray strikes his snappy dialogue with a Phil Harris Jazzy punch. Rolling in with more cowbell, Christopher Walken eats up the screen as King Louie,whilst Idris Elba simmers as Shere Khan.Singing Trust In Me over the credits, Scarlett Johansson gives the title an unexpected seduced quality as Kaa. Joined by Garry Shandling's final performance, Ben Kingsley takes inspiration from British Army officers to give Bagheera a by the book, military roar. Being the only human in the whole film, Neel Sethi gives an incredible performance as Mowgli,thanks to Sethi capturing the deep bond of friendship with Baloo,and a gripping intensity over stopping Shere Khan from closing the jungle's book.",

            "content": "Time and again, every story needs to be retold. Every legend, reborn and every nostalgic memory, rekindled. Rudyard Kipling's monumental story about a human infant raised among wolves was so inspirational that it took the form of multiple comic book editions, TV cartoon series and of course a Hollywood blockbuster made by none other than the weaver of magical dreams, Disney. Jon Favreau ('Elf', 'Ironman', 'Chef') revisits this timeless classic with rich characters supported vocally by an astounding cast and the most optimum use of contemporary digital effects since 'Avatar'. Astonishingly created in studios of Los Angeles, 'The Jungle Book' is no longer a kid's adventure but a young adult's entertainer. The harsh Indian summer leads to the establishment of the water truce in the jungle when all animals must share the scarce water resources and predators cannot threaten their prey. The wolf pack maintains the order around the pond, only to be disrupted by the menacing entry of Sher Khan. The intimidating, scar-faced tiger picks up an unusual scent and suspects it to be that of a creature whose type caused his injuries many years ago. The wolves protect Mowgli this time but may not be able to do so in the future. Discovered by Bagheera, the black panther, raised by the wolf pack and foster mother Raksha, the man-cub had to forsake his ties for the safety of the pack itself and find his own people outside the vast jungle's boundaries. After encountering various threats including Sher Khan himself, Kaa the conniving python and King Louie in the ancient ruins, Mowgli finds new companionship in Baloo the lazy but friendly bear. After helping him hoard for his tropical winter with all the honey he can collect with his human tricks, Mowgli must continue on to his discovery of the man village and find sanctuary with his kind. But Sher Khan's atrocities won't cease and someone needs to stop him before more creatures get killed by him. The man cub has come of age along with the visual effects technology that created the entire jungle around him with the very life-like creatures. Favreau's Mowgli (Neel Sethi) isn't the innocent man-cub that is discovering every aspect of life. He is more like today's adolescent who is confident about his abilities (at times, overly so) and doesn't consider himself inferior in any way. Neel's performance embodies that aspect and his polite yet snarky behavior makes him relatable to today's generation. His performance is especially commendable because he was the only living being among the acting cast. Ben Kingsley's voice for Bagheera personifies him being the mentor, guide and principal protector of Mowgli. Bill Murray distinctly adds the right amount of humor and innocent mischief behind Baloo who also sings along to 'the bare necessities'. Lupita Nyong'o voices the concerned, caring and protective wolf-mother Raksha in the most credible manner while Scarlett Johansson's cunning Kaa creepily hisses Mowgli into her clutches. We do wish there was more of her. Christopher Walken has a brooding presence as King Louie, the Gigantopithecus. He is funny, commanding and yet daunting, even after he sings 'I wanna be like you'. But the most captivating voice behind a lead character is that of Idris Alba lending his deep, menacing evil to Sher Khan. Apart from the sudden and violent encounters involving the bruised tiger, it's Idris' voice that sends chills down one's spine. This ensemble cast just brings CGI characters to life with their interpretations and of course, the exemplary work of the visual effects. Jon Favreau moves through his episodic storytelling quite swiftly. He creates thrills with some shocking violence which is at times, deserving the PG certification. Other times, he seems to draw inspiration from the Hobbit series with King Louie moving around the temple's halls like Smaug the dragon does in Erebor around Bilbo. The climactic scene within the inflamed forest also reminds one of the stand-off between the Hobbits and Orcs at the end of The Hobbit. However, the editing remains crisp, with the right amount of violence, humor, songs and fun in the jungle. Nostalgia certainly kicks in with the familiarity of the popular story and its retelling on a much richer canvas deserves a viewing. Galvanized critics might be overwhelmed but for the rest of us, The Jungle Book is a fun watch and an exciting start to something new. -8.331 on a scale of 1-10.",

Jon Farverau did a great job on it, but what do you expect from the director who brought Iron Man from obscurity to the lime light.This movie has subtle underlining theme songs from the original cartoon, that isn't in your face JUNGLE BOOK. Also the two musical numbers that are in the movie are not corny or in your face. It feels like it fits nicely in a more realistic setting. It is amazing that this entire movie was filmed on a stage in Los Angeles! As a viewer I felt that I was right there in the story and the plot. The movie also realistically depicts the wounds that Mowgli gets during his adventure, which is something a lot of Disney type films always plays down. The movie is mostly CG, however it is not distracting and is very realistic!! I found myself amazed in the real life qualities of the animals movements and personalities!I saw this movie with my son, however it was so good, that it would have been one I would have seen on my own as well!",

            "content": "Disney's remake of their take of the Rudyard Kipling books (which they did for the first time in the 1960s) was a big hit at the box office. To a degree I can see why - the locations are colorful and attractive to the eye, the special effects are first rate, and there are a few good action sequences. Yet despite stuff like this to be found in the movie, I thought the overall package was unsatisfying. To be truthful, it was hard for me to pin down what went wrong here, in part because the movie isn't really awful. I think it's a bunch of little things. One mistake the filmmakers made that's evident in the original movie is that for the longest time in the middle of the movie, you don't really feel much of a threat to the young protagonist - the movie almost forgets the threat. Another problem I found was the sometimes juvenile tone. While the original movie had that, it was a hand drawn animated movie, so you could accept the goofiness. This live action remake, though containing computer generated animation, looks \"real\", so it's hard to accept the goofiness at times. A third problem is that the movie lazily takes chunks of the original movie (like the songs) and doesn't do enough to put their own spin on the material. As I said, the movie is not awful, and I admit that kids will almost certainly enjoy it a lot. But adults with pleasant memories of the original movie may find the same problems that I did.",

The jungle book win $103.6M for the weekend Disney Picture is the best company in making top and number 1 family movies.Everything is excellent about this movie. The Jungle movie is a film that will really captivate you in every magical Disney way from the beginning till the end. \"The Jungle Book\" 2016 has a different, but an amazing ending than \"The Jungle Book\" 1967.Mowgli is a \"man cub\" raised by the Indian wolf Raksha and her pack, led by Akela(the wolf). the black panther Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves, but the boy faces certain challenges and falls behind his wolf pack. One day, during the dry season, the jungle animals gather to drink the water that remains as part of a truce during a drought that enables the jungle's wildlife to drink without fear of being eaten by their predators. However, a scarred Bengal tiger, Shere Khan, arrives, detecting Mowgli's scent in the crowd. Resentful against man for scarring him, he issues a warning that he will kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. After the jungle finish the drought season, the wolf pack debates whether they should keep Mowgli or not, Mowgli voluntarily decides to leave the jungle for the safety of his pack. Bagheera (the panther) agrees with the decision and volunteers to guide him to the nearby man village. During the way back to man village, Shere Khan(the tiger) ambushes them and injures Bagheera(the panther), but Mowgli manages to escape. Later, Mowgli meets Kaa (giant snare), an enormous python, who hypnotizes him. While under Kaa's hypnosis, Mowgli sees a vision of his father being mauled while protecting him from Shere Khan. Kaa is about to eat Mowgli; however he is rescued by a sloth bear named Baloo. Mowgli agrees to stay with Baloo (the bear) until the winter season arrives. Shere Khan(the tiger) meanwhile, upon learning that Mowgli has left the jungle, kills Akela and threatens the pack to lure Mowgli out. Later, the black panther Bagheera united Mowgli and he persuaded Mowgli to come to man village, but he did not obey. Mowgli is kidnapped by the Bandar-log (monkeys) who present him to their leader, a giant ape named King Louie. Assuming that all humans can make fire, King Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere Khan(the tiger) in exchange for it; However, Mowgli did not agree and Baloo(the bear) , Bagheera(the panther) helped Mowgli to escape from a giant ape. Later, Mowgli knew about Akela death because of Bengal tiger. Mowgli is furious and Mowgli steals a lit torch at the village to use as a weapon to revenge Akela death and heads back to the jungle, accidentally starting a wildfire in the process. At the end of movie, Mowgli convince whole animal in the jungle to fight evil Bengal tiger and Mowgli and whole animal jungle use their strength and their brain to trick the evil Bengal tiger to fall into fire. After the the evil Bengal tiger was death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river and put out the fire. In the aftermath, Raksha(Mowgli wolf mother) becomes the new leader of the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to utilize his equipment and tricks for his own use, having found his true home and calling with his wolf family, Baloo, and Bagheera.",

            "content": "Walt Disney Pictures have produced two live-action remakes of their famous 1967 animated version of \"The Jungle Book\", the first from 1994 and this one from 2016. The story (unlike that of the 1994 version) is essentially that of the cartoon. Mowgli, an orphaned human boy or \"Man-cub\", has been raised by a pack of wolves in the jungle after being found abandoned as a baby. The wolves decide that Mowgli should return to the \"Man-village\" because he is being threatened by the savage man-eating tiger Shere Khan who has a particular hatred of humans. The task of returning Mowgli is undertaken by the black panther Bagheera, but along the way he falls in with the laid-back, carefree bear Baloo, who tries to persuade him to stay in the jungle.This \"Jungle Book\" does, however, differ from its illustrious predecessor in a number of ways. It is, for example, considerably longer; the 1967 version was only just over an hour in length. The wolves play a much more important role than they did in the carton, where they fade out after about the first ten minutes. The treacherous snake Kaa, a male character in the original, here becomes female with a notably sexy voice, not surprising given that she is voiced by Scarlett Johansson. The elephants no longer march along in military formation. There are several minor characters not found in the cartoon, including a porcupine, a rhinoceros and a squirrel, but those singing vultures are dropped.Disney took some flak for making the original King Louie an orang-utan on the grounds that orangs are not actually found in India. This was, apparently, the reason why he here becomes a gigantopithecus, a member of a prehistoric species of giant ape. As, however, this species died out around 100,000 years ago it cannot be said that this marks a move towards greater zoological accuracy. As in the original, the most memorable character is undoubtedly Baloo, voiced there by Phil Harris and here by Bill Murray. Murray's characterisation, in fact, is fairly similar to Harris's, and Baloo remains a loveable, happy-go-lucky layabout.The greatest difference, however, is that this film is much more serious and darker in tone than the light-hearted, family-friendly original. It raises serious questions about the need to protect the environment and the need to work together, often backed up by some apposite quotations from Kipling's \"The Law of the Jungle\"). (\"For the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack \"). There are fewer songs, although \"The Bare Necessities\" and \"I Wanna Be Like You\" both reappear. King Louie becomes a much more threatening figure than his comically blustering equivalent in the cartoon. The same is true of Shere Khan; the cartoon character voiced by George Sanders with a plummy, upper-class English accent was about as threatening as a pantomime villain. Idris Elba's character here, more streetwise thug than suave gentleman, is far more frightening, although (or possibly because) an explanation is given for his hatred of humans. No character is killed in the original, not even Shere Khan who is merely driven off. Here there are several deaths.In one respect I think that the film is better than its predecessor, and that is the ending. Having Mowgli return to the Man-village because he has fallen in love with a girl always struck me as a cop-out, partly because both he and the girl are young children, and young children do not generally fall in love with one another, and partly because the jungle is the only home, and the animals the only friends, he has ever known. This film gets the ending which the original should have had; the threat from Shere Khan having been removed, Mowgli gets to stay in the jungle with his friends.I didn't like the 1994 film, which is more Bungle Book than Jungle Book, but the 2016 version represents a big improvement on that mediocre offering. It will never supplant the original in my affections, but then that was a treasured part of my childhood and I still regard it as one of the greatest children's films ever made. The new version, however, has its virtues, including excellent characterisation, both on the part of the writers and on that of the voice actors, an exciting story, a winning young hero and some first-class computer-generated imagery to create the animals and scenery. My one caveat is that its darker tone might make it unsuitable for young children. 8/10Some goofs. As in the cartoon, Mowgli's name is consistently mispronounced. (Kipling indicated that the first syllable should rhyme with \"cow\", not with \"slow\"). Baloo is referred to by Bagheera as a sloth bear, a species found in India, but he looks nothing like one. He looks far more like a grizzly, a variety found only in North America.",

I was sure that the reviews to an uneeded disney reboot were biased and the very handsomely paid cast was just a showing to reel in fan bases of all the diverse actors. However, this movie exceeded my expectations. The graphics in this movie are absolutely incredible, near breathtaking, and similar to the visual sensations in Life of Pi. There are times in the film where it seems Jon Favreau (spelling? idk) can not decide whether he is catering the film to children or an older generation. The beginning of the film seems incredibly innocent but then progresses into an incredibly violent series of animal planet like encounters. I found myself thinking quite often that children really would be probably very frightened of some of the animals, particularly Shere Kahn. Aside from all this though, I find the film entertaining, and frankly quite funny. I think it perfectly uses human emotion and relationships to allow the audience to feel genuine loss when the hero fails and genuine happiness when he triumphs in the end. Beautifully shot and endlessly entertaining, I believe The Jungle Book deserves a high review.",

Over a century has passed and yet another adaptation of a story as old as time is about to sweep the box office world wide. \"The strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack\"The law for the wolves is lengthy. You possibly wont recall the entire law for the wolves but, if there is one thing you will carry away from Jon Favreaus' THE JUNGLE BOOK it will be this one line. Its been 22 years (THE JUNGLE BOOK- 1994) since the story of mowgli has been last told. With emphatic CGI and a breakout performance by Neel Sethi, THE JUNGLE BOOK directed by Jon Favreau tops the list thus far for 2016 for imagery and tips the scales in favor for cinematography with veteran Bill Pope handling the lens.Mowgli (Neel Sethi) \u2013 A man cub, found within the jungles of India by Bhageera (Ben Kingsley) a staid black panther, is handed over to the wolf pack led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and is Raised by Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) as her own cub. Running across the jungle, swinging from branch to branch, foraging for fruit, rolling in the mud and up to his mischievous tricks is all that mowgli knows. Until his existence along with that of his wolf pack is threatened by the merciless Shere Khan (Idris Elba). Shere Khan who has a scar across his face caused by the red flower (fire) loathes humans and wants Mowgli dead. Leaving the pack behind Mowgli and Bhageera takes to the most wondrous visual Jungle that you will possibly witness for a long time in the world of CGI. Second thus far only to Cameroons AVATAR I had my jaws dropped as the magic unfold. Jon Favreau tantalizes the mind. If there is one thing about this movie that I could not find a flaw, is in its art of extraction. Every ounce of what THE JUNGLE BOOK meant to me as a child when I read the book literally comes to life. What works best in the Favreau adaptation is possibly the fact that Mowgli is the only human interaction the audience has with during the entirety of the picture. Extracting the true essence of the story in its grandeur. THE JUNGLE BOOK makes it to the finish line but comes in second. A tad more effort to the screenplay and this will be a near perfect production. The resounding visuals are fast dragged down and the heart warming performance by Neel Sethi is nippily obscured in the struggle to stay afloat in terms of ingenuity. All hope for redemption failed when Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) the python and King Louie the orangutan (Christopher Walken) are not as well used as Baloo (Bill Murray) the bear. There possibly would have been no complaints if they were given more screen time with an extended runtime for a classic remake of this caliber. A visual marvel, a passionate effort. I have my money on Andy Serkis and his adaptation of THE JUNGLE BOOK (2018).

It is an action-packed and fun-filled adventure, featuring the boy Mowgli, who was raised in the jungle by a pack of wolves. While he loves his life living with the wolves and befriending a host of other animals, his life is threatened by the man-hating tiger, Shere Khan, who vows to kill him. This results in an exciting and fast-paced adventure of escape and endurance for Mowgli. While the animated version is whimsical and full of comedy, this film has a more serious tone. It gives you a closer look at each animal character and Mowgli's interaction with them, particular the relationship of Mowgli and his wolf mother and more confrontation between him and Shere Khan. Also, King Louie the Orangutan is a more menacing and reckoned figure in this movie. I love the added suspense and action in the story, from Bagherra the Panther battling it out with Shere Khan to Mowgli showing off his tricks and survival skills in the jungle. Of course, it's a treat to also see the carefree and adventurous Baloo the Bear and the cunning and sly python Kaa.It is one exciting journey to the next as Mowgli meets these host of characters one by one, each one having his/her unique brand of humor, mission and personality that is a treat for the entire audience to watch.

            "review_title": "When the earlier \"live action\" remakes brought something new and original...",
            "content": "This is a film I would have dismissed if I wanted to stay consistent with my instinctive dislike of that new wave of \"live-action\" remakes.But after watching \"The Lion King\", I realize that \"The Jungle Book\" has at least one merit: it didn't try to recycle the same material with that trendy photorealism. In fact, it reinvented it, bringing either new characters or new depths to known characters or tracing new storylines, anyway it did its job as a remake and what's more by being faithful to Rudyard Kipling's book... and having been marked by the 'Water Truce' episode from the anime series, I was pleasantly surprised by its inclusion in the new Disney version, way to go, Disney screenwriters!First of all, I must say \"The Jungle Book\" is my favorite Disney animated feature for sentimental reasons, but even my sentimentalism doesn't prevent me from recognizing the many loose ends in the film. Shere Khan is presented like an indomitable monster and as soon as his name is mentioned, the earth literally shakes... but that's only information we've got to take at face value. And then Mowgli is taken away in his sleep without having paid goodbye to the family he spent ten years with.In this version, like in the anime or the book, the relationship with the herd is codified and solidified and shown with characters like Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) whose sense of diplomacy with the tiger, confines to the Munich syndrome while the mother Rakhsa (Lupita Nyong'o) is more willing to to protect her son. There's a cute addition with Gray (Brighton Rose Favreau), the little runt of the family and Mowgli's brother.Another improvement from the book is the character of Shere Khan, from whom we get some backstory about his phobia of fire and defiance to men in general and Mowgli in particular, it's all the more fitting that it is told in a hallucinatory moment from Kaa, the secondary antagonist, voiced by Scarlett Johannsen. In the 1967 version, as suave and charismatic as he was, Shere Khan's last-minute appearance was almost accidental and didn't make for a long awaited climax. Now I'm glad the same studio extended it to a level where Shere Khan does have a personal record to settle with Mowgli and seem to have reasons to judge Mowgli.I liked that approach even more since Shere Khan voiced by idris Elba and Baghera by Ben Kingsley and both make for a great good vs. Evil feline duo, unlike James Earl Jones who tried to duplicate his Mufasa with the understandably tired voice of his nineties... these new actors brought their personal touch. I won't compare the two films more, because \"Jungle Book\" was still made in the early years of the 'trend' where they were looking for a purpose, a reason to be. Watching these two films back-to-back made me think; if Scar had half the charisma of Shere Khan in the film, it would have been better. The animals weren't less expressive but there was something deeply intimidating in that Shere Khan, something in his voice, his growl, his manners that meant business and contributed to some scary and heart-pounding moments. Bagheera also makes for a bad-ass companion and mentor-figure.Naturally, the film didn't spare us from the 'comedic' figures and through Baloo (Bill Murray) and King Louie (Christopher Walken) they reinvented the characters without depriving them from their comical style. Baloo doesn't develop an instant liking on Mowgli but the bond is formed after a certain manipulation into getting honey from atop a cliff, and perhaps by not caring so much for his safety, Baloo learned to care about him ... it's not immediate on-the-nose father-and-son love. King Louie is more of a scary figure wishing to know the figure of fire but it's the voice of Walken that adds to the creepy value. I don't know how they got the voices but I applaud the boldness of these choices and the fact that they used their trademark songs with slight updates.A last word about Mowgli, the actor Neel Sethi his best with what he has and working with invisible and green screen isn't easy... but allow me to be partial to Rohan Chend from Netflix' \"Mowgli\". I did appreciate that the film showed that his being a man cub gave him a little edge over the animals, he learned to be handy with his hands, which reveals itself a true Chekov's Gun.... Naturally, I expected the voice of Shanti to come out and interrupt the celebration of the victory, but then that ending also made sense... and proved that remaking isn't always about duplication.If not flawless, \"The Jungle Book\" is at least a proper remake intelligently made and that knew where to take departure and where to keep resemblances to please the fans of the original but not just be a remake for the sake of remaking. In fact it's precisely because I'm consistent with my cirticms of \"The Lion King\" that I feel this deserves a higher rating.",

            "content": "Over the course of 6 years, Jon Favreau has went downhill in Quality. After the critical bomb we know as Iron Man 2, Favreau made Cowboys and Aliens, an awful Cowboys and Indians science fiction film that bombed. Now when The Jungle Book Came out, I was hoping this movie wouldn't be another bad film by him. Having not seen Chef, I went in hoping it wasn't bad.Oh my god! It was actually great! Favreau has made his first successful blockbuster in over 8 years! I'm not a fan of the original Jungle Book animated film, not to say it wasn't bad, it was good. But I felt it lacked a lot of plot like a lot of Disney Animated films did in that period. Unlike other remakes of movies (Footloose) the movie actually made a bunch of changes that would work and make the movie better. This is a loose remake of the original book, mostly basing it's plot around the 1967 animated film. So if you've seen the animated film, you already know the plot. But there are a few changes which I have to spoil.Mowgli of course, lives with the wolves and has to get out before Shere Khan can kill him. The wolves have more depth to them then they ever did in the animated film and even one of them is killed off by Khan which is a huge surprise.Kaa is a female in this version (Scarlet Johansson) and is a big part of the exposition in the movie where we find out that Shere Khan killed Mowgli's father when he was an infant. Although we never see her again in the movie after this, she is unsettling to watch.The climax is even awesome. The battle between Mowgli and Shere Khan is spectacular and has lots of flare (literally) and beauty to it. King Louie (Christopher Walken) is played as more of a bad guy in this movie then he really was in the 1967 Animated film. I never really thought of him like that, but it's very interesting to see how everything turns out.But enough about how good the movie's changes are. The voice actors (Bill Murray, Idris Elba, Ben Kingsley, Lupita N'Yongo) and Neel Sethi are sometimes off on their acting, but most of the time they absolutely nail these performances especially Kingsley as Bagheera. The movie is scary, exciting, intense, funny, fun, rewarding and a huge success for Disney. After Seeing Cinderella, I didn't know if they could do as good or better than that, but Disney has made something on par with the it. If anything, I would love for Disney to do more of their classic remakes in the future. The Jungle Book is a success, plain and simple.91/100 A-",

Additionally, Scarlett Johansson's seductive take on \"Trust in Me\" in the role of Kaa can be heard over the end credits. Her voice is something else. I love it!Visually this movie is an absolute milestone for cinema. It's mind-blowing what kind of photorealistic computer animations are possible these days. After watching this movie, I recommend checking out some of the making-of videos. It's really fascinating how Jon Favreau's 'Jungle Book' was created.",

            "content": "\"The Jungle Book\" is one of those stories that has appeared in so many forms over such a long period of time that most people are at least familiar with it. However, \"most\" doesn't mean \"all\" and familiarity can take many forms. So, before specifically discussing the 2016 live-action family adventure-drama \"The Jungle Book\" (PG, 1:45), as adapted by Justin Marks and directed by Jon Favreau, here is the basic story, along with some information that may be new to even the most devoted fans of the classic tale: \"The Jungle Book\" is a collection of stories written by Englishman Rudyard Kipling who was born in what was then the British colony of India, where he lived for six years before returning to England with his family, only to work in India for a few years as a young man. The stories that were compiled in 1894's \"The Jungle Book\" originally appeared in magazines in 1893 and 1894. The stories use anthropomorphic animals in allegories to teach moral lessons, but some scholars also view them as social commentary.The most popular of those stories center around a feral child named Mowgli who was orphaned as an infant and raised in the jungle by a pack of wolves. Mowgli grows up as a wolf, but the jungle's residents call him \"man cub\". He embraces their lifestyle, but as a human, he's a curiosity to most of the animals \u2013 and hated by some, even though all Mowgli wants is to fit in and live in peace with his adopted family.Kipling made up the name of Mowgli, which he says \"in the language of the jungle\" means frog, due to Mowgli having no fur and an inability to sit still. In later stories, Mowgli is adopted by a human family, grows up, gets married and starts a family of his own. The character of Mowgli was a strong influence on Edgar Rice Burroughs, creator of the character Tarzan. Also, the Cub Scouts' organizational structure and terminology comes from \"The Jungle Book\".\"The Jungle Book\" has been adapted in comic books, a British radio series, a Japanese television series, a Russian series of animated short films, three of Chuck Jones' TV cartoon series (which also include Kipling's heroic mongoose Rikki-Tikki-Tavi), live-action films in 1942 and 1994 and, most famously, the classic 1967 Disney animated feature. \"The Jungle Book\" was the last film produced by Walt Disney (who died in late 1966) and diverges from Kipling's work by making the story less dark, more family-friendly and making it into a musical which includes original songs such as the classic \"The Bare Necessities\".The 2016 Disney live-action feature \"The Jungle Book\" follows basically the same story as in the 1967 animated version, but adheres a little more closely to the darker tone of Kipling's original tales, with the addition of a few plot points that make the story even more dramatic. But it still includes a number of uplifting and even fun moments including a few songs from the original 1967 animated Disney classic. Mowgli (played by newcomer Neel Sethi, the only live actor who appears throughout the film) is a 10-year-old boy who's enjoying life in the jungle as part of a family of wolves. He plays with them and competes against them, racing through the jungle, while being schooled by a black panther named Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley). Bagheera is the one who brought the orphaned Mowgli to new wolf parents Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) to raise him as their own, but Bagheera continues to watch out for Mowgli and takes a very personal interest in making sure the boy stays safe. When his life is threatened by the human-hating Bengal tiger, Shere Khan (Idris Elba), Mowgli decides to leave the jungle rather than endanger his family and the other animals who harbor him. Bagheera volunteers to escort Mowgli to \"the human village\", where he will be safe living among his own kind. When Bagheera and Mowgli get separated, the boy has to fend for himself, trying to avoid the jungle's dangers and escaping disaster with the help of some water buffalo and his own jungle survival skills.During his jungle odyssey, afraid and nearly naked, Mowgli encounters several different animals, some who deceive him, some who mean him harm and some who want to use him, while all of them want Mowgli to stay and live with them. This anthropomorphic rogue's gallery includes a huge boa constrictor named Kaa (Scarlett Johannson), a large brown bear named Baloo (Bill Murray), a gigantic orangutan called King Louis (Christopher Walken), a small herd of very big elephants and a lot of monkeys. Shere Khan is also still out there, obsessed with killing Mowgli and threatening those who won't help him.\"The Jungle Book\" is family-friendly fare at its finest. It's likely to entertain kids and adults equally with its engrossing story, terrific performances and spectacular visuals. The scenery, the cinematography and the combination of CGI and motion-capture technologies which brings the animals to life are all expertly rendered. Favreau does for this story what he did for Iron Man. Favreau's gutsy creativity and confident, sensitive and balanced direction achieve amazing results in spite of the high expectations inherent in bringing such a beloved and time-honored story into the 21st century.The voice actors are all wonderfully cast and execute their roles with emotional depth, coupled with a clear sense of fun. But what of the boy? In a live-action version of \"The Jungle Book\", having the right Mowgli is absolutely critical. Sethi is remarkably engaging and just the right combination of innocent, intense, sympathetic and fun. An international casting search involving thousands of boys has proved to be worth every bit of effort expended. A star IS born. All things considered, this is the closest thing to a perfect film you're likely to see this year. \"A+\"",

            "review_title": "Jungle comes alive",
            "content": "To begin, thanks to Rudyard Kipling, the writer of the Jungle 'Book', for creating the characters in the great Indian jungle, which inspired the animated series of 90's and now the big budget live action / motion capture movie from Disney. Mr. Kipling had written the book (a collection of short stories) in 1894. The story about Mowgli, the man-cub has thus spawned over a century + 20 years continuing to capture the imaginations of at least 3 generations and may carry on further.I chanced upon Google store and downloaded certain free e-books 1-2 years back. The Jungle book was one amongst them. Reading the same as an adult brought in fresher perspectives about the writer's messages within the fine lines. Setting the story in the Jungle where nature's laws are sacred, kept up in pride and lived upon, the writer had created a parallel world, acting as a reflection of human's world. The law breakers as Mowgli and Sherkhan at opposite ends, one fighting for his place, another for his pride & vengeance, the Wolfpack, Baloo, Bagheera and other animals who are caught in between, forced to choose a side eventually are very much relevant in our times, especially in our political world.As for the movie, a great work at graphics. As wiki says, Favreau (the director) was encouraged by Walt Disney Studios to take advantage of the film's setting and story as an opportunity to use the latest advancements in photorealistic rendering, computer- generated imagery and motion capture technologies. So they created the whole Jungle on the green screen right down to the moss and weeds. And believe me, it's even better than in 'Avatar'. The story stays almost true to the book, altering slightly to accommodate the running time as well as budget. As the lead, we get enough insights into Mowgli when he's defending his failure in a race to Bagheera, when he's proud of using his man tricks, when he tries to negotiate his right of choosing his own 'people', when he is afraid of SherKhan, when he iterates the law of the Jungle and finally when he faces his fears. As the other major roles, both Bagheera and Baloo get ample screen time and their chemistry with Mowgli and with each other livens up the screen. Kaa impresses with her length while being short on screen time, while King Louie is both funny and scary. SherKhan (on screen reminds of you of the tiger in the 'Life of Pi', except for the scar) is perfect in his cunning and ferocious role, but seems a little less menacing (or it's the adult in me), though I did collectively gasp along with the audience when Mowgli barely escapes a swing from his tenacious claw. The movie flows with a good pace, slowing down only with Baloo, which can be perfectly understood. Those parts add the much needed humour and light heartedness, to remind you that it's still a children's movie. The Wolfpack looks the part, I loved the cubs and Grey's howl. Somehow only Akela (pronounced strangely as Ak-ee-la) seemed understated and unlike a leader, except during an interaction with the tiger. In brief, hardly any complaints. And then the actors / voices. The first one you'll note is that of Sir Ben Kingsley. Even through the amber eyes of the panther, you can easily imagine the bald face of Ben staring at you. Neel Sethi (Mowgli) in just his second movie, impresses with the ability to act in front of the green screen and appear natural and comfortable in his red chaddi, all with a mesmerizing smile (potential awards waiting). The next voice you'll note and recall is that of Scarlett Johansson (Kaa), seductive and addictive, her voice-over of Mowgli's origins keep the audience along with Mowgli ensnared until Baloo trots along. Bill Murray as Baloo is the best voice cast, the huge lazy sloth bear with the dry humour in every way relates to Bill Murray whom I hope to hear in more voice-over roles. Christopher Walken is also splendid as King Louie (the Gigantopithecus, instead of a regular Orangutan) ruling the Bandar log swatting on a shadowy throne and sing saying his dialogues. Irdis Elba (Heimdall from Thor movies) surprises with his low tone for Sherkhan but takes it up a touch during climax. For some reason, I had expected Clint Eastwood to voice for the Bengal Tiger. I hope that Hindi version is as well voiced as this one. All my hope is pinned on Irrfan Khan who will voice Baloo.To conclude, do watch the film (in any language you choose). Be the kids if you don't have them yet. Take the kids (they will pester you to) and explain to them the laws of the jungle and how it applies to us too. Take your mom with you to remind her of those times when you used to stare open mouthed at the TV on Sunday mornings when your mom fed you breakfast. Dad will enjoy the Jungle as he'd have seen in his childhood. Enjoy the ride, chaddi pahanke.",

            "content": "Oh oobee doo Disney have made (seemingly one of many) a live action Jungle Book remake. Jon Favreau's CGI milestone is amongst many live action remakes of classic Disney animations, and not even the last one for the Jungle Book.As aforementioned, the CGI is what this film is all about. At first it sounds idiotic not to use a real life jungle when making a LIVE ACTON remake of a film with the word \"JUNGLE\" in the title, but the astonishing CGI used in this film makes the choice of filming location incredibly impressive rather than being a wasted opportunity. You simply forget that everything you can see on screen (expect Mowgli of course) is all computer generated. It's a really pretty movie.The voice acting work was interesting. Bill Murray made a great Baloo and Ben Kingsley was good as Bagherra also. Some appearances in the film were unfortunately rather short lived, such as Scarlet Johansson as Kaa who is on screen about as long as Mowgli's magically vanishing bee stings. But as a whole the acting was good, Christopher Walken singing \"I wanna be like you\"... What more do you need?Well we all know the story of the Jungle book, but this script attempts to differentiate itself from the 1967 original film, adapting the book in a different way yet still telling the story we all know and love. This is great as it tries very much to be more than just a visually stunning, CGI heavy remake, as it is also a film that contains themes and narratives that are relevant in todays society as well as when it was first written by Rudyard Kipling in 1894.My only real issue with the film was the lack of songs. \"The Bare necessities\" and \"I wanna be like you\" are sung in the film, if only for about a minute, which leaves you wanting more as the singing feels more of a warm up than an actual performance. Although this adaptation is more story driven than the original musical it still would have been nice to have at least one song sung all the way through (excluding the credits) if just for the sake of nostalgia (Bill Murray I'm looking at you).Overall Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book is a well voiced, CGI masterpiece. It is clear to have been made by people who love the original, but also want to make their own mark on it and bring something new to the table. This version brings CGI to a whole new level thus succeeding in it's attempt. The bar has been raised rather high for Andy Serkis, it will be interesting to see how well he fairs in 2 years time with The Jungle Book: Origins.",

            "content": "I am proud to review the first movie I have seen in theaters! Anyway, this was a remake of the classic \"Jungle Book\" animated movie. Well actually it's more of a movie based on a book that was already adapted into an animated movie. Turns out, there was actually ANOTHER live-action version made in 1994 also by Disney, I believe! What I love about this version is how good the special effects are. I am normally not a fan of CGI, but I'm even less of a fan of 3D. Turns out, this movie managed to use both of those perfectly! The animals all looked extremely real and they spoke with perfect lip movement! I am so glad they didn't try to change the story to make it modern or anything. That's probably the worst thing they could do. As with the awesome Peanuts movie last year, these films have shown us that we don't need to update classic characters to make them timeless. Shere Khan is probably at his best here. I personally wasn't that big a fan of the original version, but this is now one of my favorite live-action Disney movies. The voices are just amazing. Bill Murray and Christopher Walken are both wonderful. It might be a good thing that I couldn't recognize Scarlett Johannson. Okay, it was obviously a woman's voice in that role. Every single character gets a specific scene and even though it isn't much, he still shines there.Spoiler: They actually change the ending of the original movie in that Mowgli actually decides to stay with his animal friends. This was probably all for the better. It's wonderful how many intense moments there are in this. Every time Shere Khan makes a sudden move, I felt chilled in my seat! The atmosphere is just wonderful. It's weird to have a movie that takes so long to show off its main characters, but this was done perfectly due to its length. It still wasn't quite as good as \"Zootopia\". Thank you Disney, for being even more awesome than usual!",

The character that plays Mowglie did an outstanding job considering he is the only physical person on the set having to act around imaginative characters and scenery. Acting, directing, cinematography and writing were all superb. If I were to have one criticism, it was the one song that was played in the movie. I won't say what it was but it just kind of out of place and felt a little off putting when I watched the movie. But that's a very small negative point that is overshadowed by an overall well done film. I will piggy back off my first sentence of this review, the CGI looks real.",

            "content": "This film is the modern version of the film of the same name released in 1967, that has delighted thousands of children over, at least, two or three generations. I was one of those kids. The plot is the same: Mogli, an orphan boy, found in the Indian jungle by a panther and raised by wolves, has to flee from the threats of Shere Khan, a Bengal tiger who hates humans and vowed to kill him. The great difference of this film, however, is the use of a lot of CGI features, first quality, that give it an enormous realism and visual beauty. Its a visual spectacle, with excellent cinematography, beautiful and vibrant colors, good contrast, pleasant light and depth. We could even believe that those animals could exist. Some are beautiful (the wolf mother, the panther), others are funny (the bear, the porcupine), others are cute (wolf cubs), the snake mixes well seduction and fear, the king of Monkeys impress us by his size and the tiger is truly terrifying. Much of the film reproduces famous scenes of its worthy predecessor, in what we consider to be a worthy homage. The most iconic songs have also been kept here (\"Bare Necessities\" or \"I Want to Be Like You\"). Voice actors are well known to the public (Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley and Scarlett Johansson, just to name three of them) and do an unblemished job. So, I believe I can say that this film is one of the most interesting creations that this studio created during this decade. Truly worthy of the Walt Disney legacy.",

After watching this reboot by iron man genius Jon Favreau i was surprised as he and Disney have pulled it of, it sticks more or less to the original story with a few new tweaks here and there but overall its a good film. With one of the best casting choices you will find that are perfect for there roles from Bill Murray as Baloo who made the character evan more enjoyable as the 1967 version to the evil villain of Shere Khan (Idris Elba) that was portrayed as a real force and had you doubting if the hero Mowgli would succeed. Neil Sethi done something that a lot of experienced actors can not do and that is to show a true sense of chemistry between himself and the non existing roles (CGI) creatures and going by his role as Mowgli and also that's its his first acting role its a safe bet to say he has a big future ahead of him.

            "content": "I've watched the original 1967 cartoon quite a bit when I was young and the idea of a remake based on that animated film really did intrigue me. The trailers and marketing for this film sold me from the start and thankfully it wasn't a letdown.If you're familiar with the story, it's almost faithful to the animated film, with a couple minor adjustments that fit for the live action storytelling. It's sharp, clear, and doesn't get distracted from anything else. The story is told in focus and it's very straight forward, nothing confusing at all. There are subtle themes of friendship, family, and bravery and it doesn't get too preachy about it. I love films that do this subtly and Favreau does this so eloquently. Give credit to writer Justin Marks as well.What makes it so immersive is the fact that this film, like Cameron's Avatar, sort of sets the bar for CGI. It's glorious and gorgeous to look at. The level of detail is stunning. I can imagine just how hard the VFX artists worked on this film. Probably a lot of sleepless nights occurred so bravo Weta and MPC for rendering a full jungle with various animals. A nomination from the Academy is a given, and I expect this film to potentially win the Oscar for VFX as well. Favreau's touch is back. After his due with Iron Man, he just sorta fizzled out with Iron Man 2, Cowboys & Aliens, and to be honest I wasn't the biggest fan of Chef. He handles the serious moments quiet well, even if the film is mainly targeted for a younger audience. It gets pretty deep as death is involved in the film, but it never brings the entire movie down. Favreau balances those moments with some light-heartedness very well. The film is stacked with steal vocal performances. Sir Ben Kingsley provides a fatherly/mentor dynamic with Mowgli as Bagheera, a black panther. He brings a lot of gravitas to the movie, as does Lupita Nyong'o's Raksha, a female wolf who adopted Mowgli. They have a tender scene with one another and as an audience member you buy it, due to her delivery of lines, and the excellent CGI giving off expressions. Bill Murray as Baloo brings some levity to the film and provides some fun and humorous moments. Idris Elba as the tiger Shere Khan is quite frightening. Not for adults, but for children. He is quite threatening and Elba delivers an effect performance. Scarlett Johansson, Giancarlo Esposito, and Christopher Walken had smaller roles, but they have good moments in the scenes they're in as Kaa the enormous python, Akela the alpha wolf, and King Louie a huge orangutan. I only had two problems with this movie. One of which are the musical numbers. There is some singing involved and that is where I felt extremely out of place. It sort of struggles on wanting to be a musical or not. The film just felt very grounded in a sense, and for it start singing all of a sudden, I felt as though the film dropped the singing out of nowhere, and failed to lead into the singing. Secondly, I did not buy into Neel Sethi's performance as Mowgli. I want to be clear I'm not attacking him as person, but this is my opinion of his performance. Aside from some decent moments, including the scene I mentioned earlier with Mowgli and his wolf mother, I felt as though he delivered his lines as if he were just reading the script out loud. Not to say he didn't try his best, but almost all the time I just cringed at his performance. He's still young and I'm positive he will get better the more work he finds, but other than the musical numbers, his performance also took me out the film. It's really his interactions with the animals that salvages most of the scenes. In the end, the film is worth the price of admission. Try to see it in larger formants or in 3D. It's worth your money. 7.5/10",

The Disney done it again bring all the classics to a new life, but it is a great team work, especially the post-production was terrific.It is one of those stories never gets boring for repeat reading/listening/viewing. Of course, there were plenty of changes to the original source, but I would say it was upgraded so well. Jon Favreau did an awesome job as the director, definitely it is his one of the best films and will be remembered for very long. All the above he got the best screenplay with supportive production and crew.Neel Sethi was obviously a perfect choice for the man-cub, he had given his best and no one could doubt it was his first film. The entire film was shot in the studio settings and the whole time he had to act alone, because the remaining characters in the film are CGI. So in that viewpoint he actually did a breathtaking job being a very young.The CGI characters were really excellent, but the non-fur animals like elephant looked a bit fake. I mean anatomically and character performances were perfect, only visually the 3D models were out of the blend in the screen with others. These are very small things to notice, but for the todays technology, it was not bad, especially thinking the film is primarily targeted children.The story was simple, like half of the film was an introduction and almost all the important characters from the book were launched at a high profile. It was actually the story with a backdrop of red flower. So the narration moves different part of the jungle, lot like the levels in a game. Various adventures take place and well composed stunt sequences.I mentioned stunts right, but there were no violences, I mean nothing seriously to concern about as expected for a Disney film. Yet because of those actions, the film is very much suitable for adult viewing. So apart from the children and families, it can be watched by anyone. One of the top Disney films to do best at the box office worldwide by grabbing almost $1b.So aggressive, furious Shere Khan ever to portray. I think the little children may get scared for his unpleasant face look and the strong roar. By the way all the songs were amazing and the end credit was very interesting. Finally, I saw it after a long wait and anticipation, most importantly, I'm very happy how beautifully it was made.The film was not shot in India, but the locations were so resembling and gives the perfect Indian feel. Climbing a cliff by Baloo and fighting the monkeys, like that there were numerous jokes. Surely one of the grandly made children's film at the recent time. I've heard the sequel is already on the progress, so bring it on, at least a trilogy before Neel turn to a big boy.8/10",

Fast-forward a dozen years and Mowgli is growing up. He's at an awkward age where he realizes, despite his best efforts; he's not really a wolf. Shere Khan (Elba), the villainous tiger, points out that although Mowgli is just a Man-Cub but will grow up to be a Man. Man is a threat, thus, Shere Khan vows to kill the boy. For his safety, Bagheera and the wolf-pack, decide that Mowgli must return to the Man Village to be with his own kind.The graphics are really quite good. The voice acting is solid all around. Mowgli, and I am not a fan of child actors, does a perfectly good job.One of the things that most stuck out to me was how they handled the giant ape, King Louie (Walken). The character is relatively the same; he's an ape that wants the power of man's red flower (fire). In the original, he's an orangutan voiced by the incredible and bombastic Louie Prima. In this iteration, Christopher Walken does a fine job of voicing the character but it has a distinctly darker feel. The juxtaposition of the fun song (sung slower) with the realistic animation makes it downright scary.I grew up watching Disney's The Jungle Book from the 60's so when I saw the trailer for this, I cringed. I expected it to just be a whole bunch of fancy graphics and cheap references to the original. Fortunately, The Jungle Book wasn't nearly as bad as I feared. In fact, it was solidly alright. How's that for a ringing endorsement? My wife and I watched this on a long flight from Belgium. We were tired and a captive audience so maybe that helped our experience.Would I recommend The Jungle Book? There are certainly worse movies to see and it's good enough if you're in the mood for some pretty graphics.

            "content": "THE JUNGLE BOOK - Before starting my review i am very happy to say that this movie is released a week before in India and Australia as compared to its usual release in whole world . That means i am reviewing this movie before 90% of the American reviewers. The character of Mowgli is so much close to us that i was not even sure what to expect from it. Because i don't think there exist anything much about him we don't know from the beloved DOORDARSHAN TV serial.. Unless they try to do something unique , which is not a forte of Disney.. Disney has a problem of keep recycling their characters (jungle book , snow white , Cinderella etc) without reinventing them.. And let me tell you i was reading so many reviews this whole afternoon because all the critics mostly Indianliked it whole heartedly.. I mean ratings are as high as 4.5/5..That's like highest rating any movie gets from Bollywood reviewers (as they never gives full marks) . And this was making me crazy coz as per me its not that good.. The problem is as i said the plot line , there is nothing new to say.. The treatment is same too.. I means yes Disney tried to burn the jungle , a character is killed (for whom actually you never felt as he was barely their before dieing) , but these are very small improvements.. I know Disney's main target audience is the children below 13 years and their parents who will bring their children to watch it , but their is barely anything for adults.. The basic plot is exactly the same as Disney's animated version from 1967 , that Mowgli lives with Wolfs , Sher Khan is back , who wants to kill him and Bagheera and Baloo both are trying to convince Mowgli to leave the jungle to go and live with Human Beings. Apart from taking the whole plot line , it also took two songs from that 1967 version and fit them exactly at the same place. Which are actually good , cant deny that but also not innovative. And yes if you are watching the Hindi version then you will get the Chaddi song in it. So about the visuals , yes they were great , which is a BIG OBVIOUS , the Jungle looked real , the 3d was decent but the movie was dark and i don't know whether the 3d was bad or the theater in which i was watching it. Hope it would be the later one..CGI characters were great , i means i don't even think that these are the thing to mention. Of coarse the technology is great , after all its 2016 but the question is that will you watch the same story which you know by heart just because it has been made with a better technology. Like i said there is very less for the Adults who know about the Mowgli but also the fact is the younger audience who born after the DOORDARSHAN has stopped broadcasting Mowgli can get their first chance to watch it , and they will be delighted to witness it.. I also felt the movie was too short , just 1 hr and 26 mins , and in that small running time Mowgli just keep on tackling one characters from another..Some care for him , some wants to take advantage of his human brain and yes one wanted to kill him..Nothing apart from that. Along with the visual effect team credit must be given to the Voice cast , and in that note the first prize goes to Bill Murry. He is one of the best experienced comic actor in Hollywood.. He is like Paresh rawal of Hollywood. And as Baloo he gets the best line and best part of the movie. I enjoyed every single line came out of his mouth. And the 2nd half was just better because of him. Then comes Sher Khan and Idris Alba , knocks it out of the park..We can feel the anger in him , how much he wanted to kill Mowgli , how much the other animals fear his voice. A little more screen time would have made the movie better.. I mean in cartoons we have seen Sher Khan with his own team or alone also , but in the movie we only get to see him when he came to good animals to threatens them.. As KAA , Scarlet Johnson got one of the best character of Mowgli. Her voice totally suited the character. But guess what she only gets a single scene in the whole movie , CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT. It would be such a waste of talent if they didn't give her a bigger role in sequel if there will be any. I don't understand why everything was in hurry so much in the movie. As Bagheera Ben Kingsley did the most average work among the cast. Lupita Nyong'o as Raksha and Christopher Walken as King Louie also did good job but get very less screen time.. Lastly Neel Sethi , he was cute , and did everything he could do as Mowgli , nothing bad about him nor anything exceptional..The movie was such a short one it felt like nothing much happened. Like it was just a single episode of very long TV series and not at all satisfactory by itself . It felt like i would like to know what happens next. May be my expectation were too high or may be the character was so close to my childhood that in such a small running time i didn't get enough of it. I would like to add that I think this would be a big hit in America , as they were not familiar with Mowgli as much as Indians are. So it would be something new for them. 6.5/10..By ANuP APu KuMaR.",

            "content": "Based on the Rudyard Kipling novel, The Jungle Book, a Disney production, finds its inspiration in the earlier 1967 Disney offering, an animated production of the same name. With its computer-generated effects, the new Jungle Book is far superior to the old one in many ways. But is that saying much? The 1967 effort resembles a bad episode from Yogi Bear or The Flintstones, hopelessly dated, juvenile and nothing to look at.For those unfamiliar with the plot, our protagonist is the pre-pubescent Mowgli, the \"man-cub\" raised by wolves in the jungle, led by Mowgli's mother figure, Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o), with the pack leader Akela (voiced by Giancarlo Esposito). Mowgli is played by newcomer Neel Sethi (the only human actor in the film). Sethi fails to prove absorbing not only because he's wholly too bland for the part but way too young to be pitted against the malevolent and ferocious antagonist, the brutal tiger Shere Khan (effectively voiced by Idris Elba). It's a little hard to believe that such a young kid can have success doing in a tiger who is bent on causing his immediate demise. Of course it's not all Sethi's fault since Mr. Kipling insisted on such a young protagonist, instead of a teenager, which might have been a tad bit more believable.I found it a bit odd that all of Mowgli's allies were predators. Bagheera (Ben Kingsley), a leopard that rescues the boy, is kind enough to deliver Mowgli to the wolf pack, who also have nurturing instincts. And what of Baloo the bear (voiced by the always amusing Bill Murray)? He too bonds with Mowglil for a while. Only Shere Khan and perhaps Kaa the Python (Scarlett Johansson) live up to their reputations as dangerous predators.Why also don't all the animals talk? If Mowgli's allies and opponents all have voices, why don't the noble elephants talk as well? Despite their nobility, they're all still relegated to the world of beasts\u2014 forcing one to wonder why they too don't have anthropomorphic abilities.The Jungle Book's strong suit is the aforementioned computer-generated effects. The movements of each species are wonderfully realized especially in the scenes involving life and death confrontations (Shere Khan is particularly scary even when he's not going in right away for the kill). Some of the highlights of visual wonder include Mowgli's retrieval of the honey for Baloo, King Louie's tantrum inside the ancient Temple and Shere Khan's final pursuit of Mowgli, who emerges triumphant.One true moment of awkwardness comes when King Louie, the giant ape, sings what appears to be an homage to Louis Armstrong. The decision to cast a Caucasian actor (Christopher Walken) in the role of the \"Gigantopithecus,\" was designed to stave off any claims of racism, as the tune is clearly designed for an African- American singer (Walken's rendition is still too reminiscent of Armstrong, with the link between a black man and an ape, obviously still a source of uneasiness).One final lost opportunity is Mowgli's possible reunion with humans at film's end. We never get to see what happens with the kid returning to his progenitors along with the prospect of some new interesting conflicts. Instead, man's triumph over the animal kingdom is emphasized, pointing to the harnessing of fire, as the critical factor in homo sapiens' ascendance.See The Jungle Book only for the visuals. And if you have young kids, make sure not to bring them along\u2014some of predatory activity is a little too realistic for such young eyes.",

            "content": "Jon Favreau did an amazing job. I'll be honest I thought this movie was going to hell, telling myself, this movie was going to be boring. Thankfully I was wrong on almost all accounts. First of all, its animation is top notch; you practically forget that not just the animals, but the entire environment itself was computer-generated. That is a milestone to be applauded itself.Action sequences were intense and and there are many fun moments that will induce laughter. The background music added a lot to the experience of Mowgli's adventure.Neel Seethi (the only live action character), did a great job, showing his innocence, curiosity and energy that is expected of Mowgli, although at times it seems rather stiff. Its his first movie after all. Kudos to the kid.As for the voice actors, all were splendid. Idris Elba made Shere Khan very menacing and real and will probably scare a couple of kids (parents beware). Nyong'o Lupita did a great job with Raksha. Ben Kingsley and Bill Murray were awesome together, their characters complementing each other perfectly. I hoped for Kaa (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) and Akela (voiced by Giancarlo Esposito) to have more screen time though. You'll feel like you really connect with all the characters. One issue I had with the movie was the remake of the songs. Only the 2 best were used, which was understandable, but in my humble opinion, the movie could have done without it. The songs were somewhat out of place and did not feel as right as it did in the animated classic of 1967. Perhaps it is due to the loss of the levity to make way for a slightly more action packed flick. All in all, it was a great movie and I'd encourage anyone to watch it. Thank you Jon Favreau and his team for this (almost fully) animated masterpiece. 9/10",

This film is breathtaking to see on screen. It is also very dark when you give look at it. This film is very different from the animated picture and that is not a bad thing. The film is spectacular and a load of fun to see on the big screen. With its immerse effects it is truly a film that you should see. The kid who plays Mowgli does a great job portraying this little kid in the jungle who was raised by animals and you really believe this kid. Idris Elba also is amazing in this film along with Scarlett Johansson. And just the way the narrative plays out is so different and interesting as well. But with good there must also come bad and this film has issues. I feel like the singing took away from the tone they were going for. Sometimes it tended to take me out of the movie. I don't mind the moments when it becomes a little more light hearted but the singing pushes it into cheesiness, and it goes from dark and complex to a silly film like the cartoon was.

            "content": "This is a great live action version of the 50 year old animated classic. Bill Murray is fantastic as Baloo and Christopher Walken is pretty good as King Louie and King Louie is huge in this movie. Of course I did hear that he's really gigantic in the book as he is in this movie then he is in the animated classic. It's also great that the most popular songs of the animated classic are in this. The Bare Necessities and I wanna be like you. We also get a more ferocious and evil look of Shere Khan in this. He kills Mowgli's father after he gets burnt on his face leaving him scared like Scar from the Lion King and he kills Akela too. Mowgli doesn't even realize about his fathers death until Kaa voiced by Scarlett Johanson shows him an image of the past before she tries to eat him and Baloo rescues Mowgli from her. At the near end of this movie Mowgli engages a battle with Shere Khan around a fiery part of the jungle which was started when he grabbed a torch from the man village from sparks. When Shere Khan has Mowgli cornered in a tree above the flames Mowgli tells Shere Khan that he is no longer afraid of him. Then Shere Khan charges towards Mowgli but Mowgli manages to dodge him and the branch Shere Khan was standing on breaks and Shere Khan falls to horrible fiery death. What's also great about this is the ending cause unlike the ending of the original animated classic Mowgli actually stays in the jungle with his friends Bagheera and Baloo and the wolves and elephants. That's how it should've been in the original animated classic cause it's sad seeing Mowgli go back to the man village. Mowgli deserves to be in the jungle with his friends. 10 out of 10 for this.",

I'm not going to deliver any spoilers. There are some brilliant characterisations, the production is magnificent and the casting inspired. But when I watched an early evening screening, there were a couple of times when the auditorium was full of the sound of whimpering children and adults trying to calm them. It's dark and violent, just like the jungle.There is humour in there but it's unusually muted for a Disney film. And if there's some right-on trendy message...I missed it.It's far from the best film I've seen, and it's not as captivating or entertaining as the cartoon.

            "review_title": "A bold, engaging new vision for a classic Disney film that definitely needed it",
            "content": "Disney's 1967 animated film \"The Jungle Book\" doesn't often rank high among people's favorite Disney animated classics, but if the Mouse House was going to continue its spree of flipping old titles into live action adventures anyway, they might as well pick titles that make sense, and \"Jungle Book\" is a surprisingly good fit. Amusingly, almost nothing in the new \"Jungle Book\" is live action except for its star, newcomer Neel Sethi as Mowgli. That's a testament to just how far along Weta Digital has come making computer-generated images appear lifelike. The entire film was made in a studio and yet the backgrounds are visually compelling and the animals are almost National Geographic real, even when they move their mouths to talk. If nothing else, \"Jungle Book\" serves as a benchmark of just how far digital animation has come in being able to tell stories beyond what we once imagined.The film has tremendous life and realism to it, and much of that comes from the vision of Jon Favreau (\"Iron Man\"), who returns to the helm of a big budget studio film for the first time since the disaster that was 2011's \"Cowboys & Aliens.\" Maybe the extra time away from the machine was well spent, or maybe \"C&A\" was just an outlier, but either way he infuses much more excitement and age-appropriate danger into this film than you'd expect. Although \"The Jungle Book\" certainly made sense to bring back to the big screen from a visual perspective, the story has always been one of Disney's more underwhelming. When a relatively new screenwriter gets the sole writing credit on a big studio film, that's a clue that he's done something right, and Justin Marks picks all the right places to expound upon or alter the 1967 story to give it more life. This version add more natural forces of antagonism like mudslides and stampedes and really builds out Mowgli's relationship with the wolves that raised him. Also, Mowgli's more memorable encounters in the 1967 story such as the run-ins with Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) and King Louie (Christopher Walken) don't disappoint.The voice acting also adds some much-needed gravitas. Ben Kingsley makes Bagheera the panther infinitely more likable and what could be more enjoyable than Bill Murray as Baloo the bear? But it's Idris Elba as the tiger Shere Khan that steals the show, putting Jeremy Irons' performance as Scar in \"The Lion King\" to shame. (The characters \u2014 and both these movies, honestly \u2014 actually share a lot of similarities.) These characters have all been perfectly okay in other adaptations, but in tandem with the brilliant visual effects, they become much more distinctive and interesting.Every time the tiger appears or is about to appear in the frame, the suspense ratchets up and Favreau toys with the audience with the same frightening poise that Elba lends to the character. A scene between Shere Khan and the alpha wolf Akela (Giancarlo Stanton) has a particularly high suspense factor between the plot set-up and the way Favreau shoots the scene as a confrontation between two animals behaving like real animals, not Disney animals.For all its impressive technique blending realism and imagination, the \"Jungle Book\" still feels a little limited by how lackluster the original story is, but it's family entertainment after all; the adults can enjoy the heightened danger and realism. Disney does wedge in two of the more memorable songs from the original animated film, which doesn't work well with the overall tone of the movie at all, but the ones they choose feel integral to the story and leaving them out would've been a disappointment to anyone who enjoyed the original.Not all Disney classics will work in this format, but it's no surprise that after the success of \"Jungle Book\" that Favreau is attached to \"The Lion King.\" With more songs and zero human characters, it will be interesting to see if Disney animation's most successful movie of all time can work, especially as a film that would be entirely digital yet need to look completely live action. In the meantime, we can enjoy the fact that Disney was able to breathe new life and interest in an old classic using modern filmmaking innovations, resulting in a better \"Jungle Book\" for whole new generations.~Steven CThanks for reading!

            "content": "Jungle Book is a marvelous technical wonder, that deserves to be praised for the excellent acting of its young leading actor. It can't have been easy to act in front of so many green screens to animals that aren't really there, and to make it seem like he is actually looking at them. But that aside, the movie fails to sell you on the illusion completely. You are constantly aware that you are looking at CGI animals, and it is distracting from start to finish. Don't get me wrong, occasionally the animals look almost lifelike. And the way actors and animals are integrated into the environments is really well done... but it's not enough. The main antagonist, does not look like a real tiger, and you see a lot of him. Many other main characters also look fake, and as an audience it is almost impossible not to spot where the illusion breaks. You're just constantly looking for the flaws, whether you want to or not. Second, the movie fails to surpass or equal the animated movie. There are constant nods to the original, which just makes you wish you were watching that movie instead. They do some things different, but if you've seen the original animated Disney movie that this is based on, then you are constantly wondering \"will they do this\", and \"will they do that\". It's great to see Baloo sing Bear Necessities, but it's only done partially, and leaves you wanting for the full song. And then there are other songs that you really look forward to (Like Ka's song), but are left out, or only played during the end credits. The recent Beauty and the Beast live action movie was a literal copy of the animated movie, but at least it knew what it wanted to be. Jungle Book doesn't seem to know if it wants to be an homage to the animated film, or BE the animated film. And so it fails at both. The ending also feels a bit sudden. It seems as if the movie should have ended with Mowgli returning to the village, but it just ends abruptly. It doesn't feel entirely satisfying. It also feels like a lot of scenes may have perished on the cutting room floor for this film. This is not a terrible film, but ultimately it's a bit forgettable. It just makes you want to watch the original.",

But it is not just princess films getting this treatment, The Jungle Book has also had a live-action adaptation and has become the highest received film so far in this sub-section of Disney films.The basic story is the same as the animated version, Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is an orphan who is raised by wolves in the jungles of India but is threaten by tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba). To save his pack Mowgli leaves with the panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) planning to take him to the 'man-village'. But Shere Khan is determined to get the boy and holds the whole pack hostage to force Mowgli out of hiding.First and foremost the special effects are spectacular, the money is clearly on screen. The film was shot in studios in California but it does not look like it. The jungles were bright and looked fantastically realistic. The same goes for the animals who were given a photo-realistic look, the animated deserve all the praise they get, there are fantastic little on the animals, like dirt, knots, sunlight bouncing off Bagheera's fur and the shadows from the characters. It is an amazing lived in world that is on-par with the environments in Avatar and the apes in the rebooted Planet of the Apes and Life of Pi, they are that good.It's not just the special effects that makes The Jungle Book visually stunning, director Jon Faverau and cinematographer Bill Pope (the man who worked on The Matrix and Spider-man trilogies) do create some wonderful images - there are silhouettes as the sun is setting and characters are walking, using time-lapse photography to show the impact of a draught and many of the shots look like paintings. Even the worst of these Disney live-action films look great and The Jungle Book is one of the best.Faverau is an accomplished blockbuster director, working on the first Iron Man films and be brings the goods for The Jungle Book. The film is light on action, the big sequences coming near the end, yet there are still moments of awe such as when the elephants appear on screen. With his Iron Man composer John Debney Faverau was able to capture a Disneysque sound, like what Kenneth Branagh and Patrick Doyle did with Cinderella. One of the grand moments in the film involved giving backing music for The Bare Necessities an orchestra re-imaging. Though live-action The Jungle Book is not an musical there are a couple of musical numbers and there are references to some of the other songs in the animated film.Weirdly The Jungle Book reminded me of The Lion King. The scene where the animal conjugate at a waterhole is like the beginning of the 1994 film, a sequence were Mowgli gets stuck in a stampede is like what happened to Simba and Mowgli has to runaway, goes into a very bright green jungle taken under the wing of another creature and gives the child unconventional lessons. Even the end of The Jungle Book is similar to The Lion King.The film also has a terrific voice cast, having the likes of Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Bill Murray, Lupita Nyong'o and even has Christopher Walken and Scarlett Johansson in small roles. Kingsley and Elba were the stand outs, Kingsley being a regal, elegant figure and acts as a father figure to Mowgli, even if he has to deal with the man-cub's questioning. His voice gave Bagheera pretty of wisdom. Elba oozed menace as Shere Khan - he was more than big and powerful, he had a very sinister delivery such as speaks to the wolf cubs. Shere Khan was a great villain, he had the charisma, he was feared but his view point can be understood.Bill Murray injected a bit of lightness as Baloo, the bear who tricks Mowgli into helping him obtain food and the pair form a friendship. it's his moments of humour that feel the most nature, better then a porcupine early in the film. Murray has some fun interactions with small animals. But Murray does have moments of sincerity and grows to love Mowgli.Despite the voice acting being top-notch, Sethi's performance as Mowgli was a little stiff. But to be fair to him working on sets with green-screen is challenging for any actor. Thanks to writer Justin Marks he gives Mowgli a strong arch as the man cub is allowed to act as a human for the first time, showing he can be trust to himself while also honouring his family and upbringing.The Jungle Book is the best adaptation of a Disney animated film so far, a delightful family film that still has a level of threat and honours its source material (the animated film, not the book). It has the right mix of being serious and fun and the special effects will make The Jungle Book a benchmark film like Terminator 2, Avatar and Gravity. If Disney does a live-action version of The Lion King it needs to be on the same level as this film.",

            "content": "Disney's live action adaptation of their animated classic, The Jungle Book, is a brilliant remake that gives a different take on the well known story. Watching The Jungle Book, it's clear that Disney was trying to go for a more mature tone, while still honoring their animated film. The Jungle Book is visually stunning, features brilliant voice acting, and updates the Disney classic with a modern twist. It should be noted how impressive this film is when considering that the entire film was shot in a studio in Los Angeles.When you think of films that are groundbreaking in terms of special effects, you may think of Avatar or Star Wars, but possibly this movie may be one of the most groundbreaking. Considering that everything in this film, except the actor portraying Mowgli, is computer generated, and that the effects are seamless is extremely impressive. The Jungle Book may open a door for other films that originally seemed impossible may become possible. Most impressive is that the film looks gorgeous, regardless of the back story, the film's look is never dull, and always impressive.The casting department deserves a ton of credit for this film as well, because the voice cast was perfect. Perhaps the best casting was Bill Murray as Baloo, who could literally have played this character in his sleep. However, that's not to take away from the other voice cast members. Idris Elba was perfect as Shere Khan, Ben Kingsley nailed the stern Bagheera, Scarlett Johansson's voice lent itself perfectly to Kaa the snake, and even Christopher Walken as King Louie fit perfectly. It's not everyday that a cast comes together so well, but every voice cast member fit their role perfectly.One major thing to note is that while the film honors the original film (which was quite silly) very well, the tone and look is quite different in the updated version. They still break into song occasionally, but the overall tone of the live action remake is darker overall, and more mature. That's not to say that the film isn't family friendly, it is, but the film isn't as harmless as the original was, but the film isn't afraid to scare the audience, and pulls no punches. This is simply because of the timing, in the 60's animated films weren't as dark as live action films today seem to have to be.Overall The Jungle Book is an exciting, gorgeous, solidly crafted, and more mature entry to the growing list of Disney classic remakes. The film juggles the new audience's expectations with the classic elements of the original beautifully, and what it creates is truly amazing. The film isn't perfect, but is a great entry to the Disney live action canon. Above those who love Disney, and Disney classics, this is just in general a great retelling of this story, and should be seen in theaters, where the visual effects are showcased at their best.",

            "content": "Out of all the animated movies Disney has chosen to remake, updating The Jungle Book from 1964 was probably the smartest bet. The original film is barely a movie and more a loose collection of vignettes that involve the same characters. Most of the songs are completely forgettable, and there's no real narrative drive propelling the thing from one scene to the next. Well, Jon Favreau did his best to address that issue from the original, but the film ends with such a confused series of actions that all seem to contradict each other that the goodwill established from making an actual movie out of the loose adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's stories can't quite overcome the final failings.Mowgli is a man-cub living with wolves in the jungles of India. In a particularly dry season, all the animals come together at a neutral watering hole where the rest of the denizens of the jungle see him for the first time, including Shere Khan, a Bengal tiger. Scarred by a man years before, Khan holds a grudge against all mankind and threatens the wolves because of Mowgli's presence. Bagheera, the panther who originally found Mowgli, leads Mowgli out of the jungle and towards the man-village where he really belongs.I do wish there was a bit more establishing Mowgli's life before this change comes over the wolf pack, but the motive is clear. Mowgli needs to leave to save both the wolves and himself. Mowgli, though, never really seems to buy into it. Whenever he's with Bagheera, he talks about how he doesn't want to go to the man-village, expressing a desire to live with the crocodiles instead. He doesn't know men, but he does know the jungle. He doesn't belong with men, he belongs in the jungle. Later, after Mowgli has been separated from Bagheera, he talks about how he needs to go on to the man-village but he obviously doesn't want to go. Meeting Baloo, the bear with a simply philosophy of coasting through life, Mowgli easily falls in with him. Up to this point, the movie's been pretty well constructed, but it's the introduction of King Louie that feels a bit out of place.We have our antagonist in Shere Khan, and he's been the only antagonist through almost two-thirds of the movie, and then we get an army of monkeys and their king, Louie, a gigantopithecus. He's wonderfully realized visually and I love how Christopher Walken plays him, but Louie comes out of nowhere late in the film to provide a visually imposing but quickly dispatched antagonist. He provides one piece of critical information to Mowgli that turns the film's narrative direction (that Shere Khan had killed the wolf pack's leader), but Louie feels like he's in the movie because he was in the original where he had one of the only two good songs instead of being a natural fit for the story.Mowgli, filled with rage, cut off from Bagheera and Baloo, and looking to get Shere Khan, embraces his nature as man and takes a torch of fire from the nearby man-village which he runs with through the jungle to the wolf den where Shere Khan lords. Lighting the jungle accidentally as he runs, Mowgli arrives for his showdown, and this is where the thematic thrust of the movie loses me.Up to this point, the idea has been the Mowgli is a man who doesn't have a natural place in the jungle. He's not a wolf (or a turtle, crocodile, or bear), and he should embrace who he actually is, a man. So, Mowgli grabbing the fire is him instinctively embracing that manhood, but then, facing Shere Khan, he throws the fire away, rejecting his manhood. It's not the choice I would have given Mowgli, but it makes sense up to this point. He's choosing the jungle over humanity. Seconds later, Bagheera pulls him aside (well, pins him) and tells him that he can't fight Shere Khan like a wolf would, he needs to fight Khan like a man would. Mowgli gets a big smile across his face. A moment before, he had thrown aside the main sign of humanity in the film (fire, the red flower), and then he's smiling at the idea of taking up other forms of humanity (using tools)? It's...inconsistent. It also indicates to me that he's embracing humanity.After a fight that leads to Shere Khan's death, I would expect Mowgli to say a sad goodbye to his friends in the jungle. He doesn't belong there. He used fire to burn large portions of the jungle. He used tools to kill a tiger. He obviously belongs in the man-village, but instead we get a vision of some kind of multiculturalism where Mowgli is caught somewhere between man and jungle. It feels very wrong for what came before like the writer (Justin Marks) and director (Favreau) wanted their cake and to eat it too.That frustration makes me sad because for the first half of the film I was quite on board with what was going on. The movie had real structure. It looks great (and may be the best looking of these live action remakes from Disney). The cast is top-notch (with special notes for Idris Elba as Shere Khan and Ben Kingsley as Bagheera). And yet, the structure falls apart in its final act to fit in King Louie and the thematic material gets confused.",

            "content": "Let's face it, the name Disney on nearly any movie means quality and something that children will flock to. And when you take a well-known Disney film and remake it the odds are in your favor that it will be a hit. You would have to seriously mess things up for it to fail. Thankfully director Jon Favreau didn't do that and has turned in a well done reworking of the classic animated Disney film THE JUNGLE BOOK.Based in the novel by Rudyard Kipling both versions have strayed a bit from the original source. If you've ever tried to read Kipling you'll understand why and give them a pass on this. While the story structure and deep rooted tale remain, just how it is told changes. And while the original Disney film was standard cell animation, this time around we are blessed with the most amazing computer animation there is to offer.The story itself revolves around a young boy, a human, named Mowgli (Neel Sethi) who was found in the forest of India, taken to a pack of wolves to be raised by his now guardian a black panther named Bagheera (the voice of Ben Kingsley) and who now faces a new danger. With a dry spell in the area a water truce is called among the animals with none allowed to kill another during this draught.But as they all gather around the nearest watering hole they are surprised by the appearance of Shere Khan (the voice of Idris Elba), a man killing tiger scarred by his last encounter with a human, a human who happened to be Mowgli's father. Shere Khan follows the pact for the water truce but warns the animals that when the waters rise once again he will return for the boy.As the weather changes and the waters rise the wolf pack discusses what they should do about Mowgli. It is Mowgli himself who decides he must leave. Bagheera agrees and so begins the trek of these two to take Mowgli back to the land of men. Adventures follow the pair beginning with an attack by Shere Khan resulting in a slim escape by Mowgli.Separated from Bagheera Mowgli soon makes friends with a conniving bear named Baloo (the voice of Bill Murray) who enlists his help in bringing down a number of honey combs. When Bagheera shows he scolds the pair and starts the journey with Mowgli again only to have him taken away by a group of monkeys led by King Louie (the voice of Christopher Walken) who wants Mowgli to show him the secret of \"man's red flower\" aka fire.The story carries on and eventually a resolution to the conflict of Shere Khan and Mowgli will bring about the end of the film. That Mowgli's friends all become involved is a given. But will they be willing to lay down their lives for this man-cub? Will they consider him the boy they've loved all these years or will they see him as a growing young man who will present danger to their world? The movie is a fantastic combination of story and technology that work hand in hand to present the tale in the best way possible. Rather than shoot in an actual jungle the entire production was shot on sound stages equipped with blue screens meaning that while the entire movie takes place in a jungle they were never once in an actual jungle. Not only are the characters computer animated characters but the entire setting is done this way. To combine all of these together is a near impossible task, especially when it comes to the use of shadows. And yet they did it and did it well.Not only are we presented with this grand vision we also find ourselves wrapped up in this coming of age story about Mowgli. So many things could have gone wrong. The actor playing Mowgli could have been terrible. The animation could have been off. The voice actors could have been the worst choices possible. Instead the right combination of elements comes together here for a jewel of a movie to be added to the Disney crown.It should also be noted that this film is less of a musical effort than the original. But never fear because at least two songs do appear, the main two that could have spelled disaster had they not been included. Yes \"The Bear Necessities\" and \"I Wanna Be Like You\" are both hear. Plan on hearing your children singing the songs around the house for the next few weeks.This is one of those films that anyone with children need to add to their collection. Disney fans need to do the same. And if you enjoy a well-made and entertaining film then you'll want a copy as well. It satisfies on all levels.",

            "content": "http://reelpopcorn.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-jungle-book.htmlJon Favreau has had one of the more interesting, circuitous careers in Hollywood (Outside of Tinseltown as well): From his near completion of undergraduate studies at Queens College, to a short stint working for Bear Stearns on Wall Street, the son of a Russian Jew and a Catholic of Italian & French-Canadian ancestry hasn't been one timid of \"getting their feet wet\" in a particular discipline. So, it should come as little surprise that his entertainment career has been rather varied, in terms of genres, types of roles he's acted in, and his involvement in projects (Essentially whether he was just an actor, an actor-producer, an actor- director, or solely a producer or director).He's acted in everything from Friends (As Monica's boyfriend during Season 3), to the Avengers, Rudy, Cowboys & Aliens, The Break-Up, and many others. He's written films like Swingers, Couples Retreat, and Chef. He's directed films like Elf, Made, Iron Man, and most recently the Jungle Book. He's truly an artist that knows improvisation and the value of not \"pigeon-holing\" oneself in a competitive industry like Hollywood.This time around Favreau parked his keester in the director's chair and left the writing duties to Justin Marks and Rudyard Kipling, with the latter providing the skeleton of the story that Marks adapted quite well. It's a story that most American children are familiar with with, but it has certainly been freshened up with the addition of cutting-edge CGI and sound mixing that definitely wasn't available during the 1960s. It's a keenly-paced movie as well, with it's producers wise to the fact that audiences would be rather varied in age range. The running time is 104 minutes, but it truly doesn't feel \"too long\" and I don't feel that audiences will feel as though they were \"jipped\" because of the under 2- hour running time.The casting for Mowgli was very well done, with thirteen-year old Neel Sethi performing the role with an authenticity that made up for the fact that all of the other roles were voiced and done by by CGI. That's not to say that there was a problem with the CGI, or any of the voice actors, but I felt like it would've been a little bit better to see some real backdrops and actual monkeys. It seems like all the large budget movies these days are so dominated by CGI and it would be nice to see a movie not so dependent on it. But, to each his own, I guess. The Jungle Book is definitely worth a trip to the theater though, especially as the summer box office starts to heat up with movies like Captain America: Civil War just premiering at theaters this weekend.",

            "content": "The Jungle Book is directed by Jon Favreau and is a live action retelling of the 1967 animated Disney film of the same name. The story follows a boy named Mowgli, who was found as a baby in the jungle, and raised by a pack of wolves. After a dangerous tiger named Shere Khan finds out that Mowgli has been living with the wolves, he decides he wants to kill him, due to his past experiences with mankind. From there, Mowgli, along with some friends, must try and escape the jungle, before being killed in the evil claws of the despicable tiger.This film was brilliant. I went into The Jungle Book expecting a CG manifested piece of garbage, but I was proved so very wrong. The Jungle Book is easily one of the best movies of 2016, so far, and contains some of the best special effects I've laid eyes on. To get it out of the way, the CG is fantastic. When filming this movie, the only real actor was Neel Sethi, a little child actor that was in a green room the entire time, reciting his lines to tennis balls on sticks, and there isn't a single shot where it doesn't pay off. Every single frame looks absolutely perfect, and brings the animals to life like never expected.The direction by Jon Favreau was also great. For the best intentions, this man should direct one of the upcoming Star Wars films, whether it be a spin off or an actual episode of the franchise. Favreau can work the camera in ways that many directors can barely dream of, and his work with CG is wonderful. He does such a great job with The Jungle Book, and really lets the audience know that he poured his heart and soul into his work with this film.The voice acting was magnificent. Bill Murray as Baloo was a perfect casting choice, and he played the character flawlessly. Ben Kingsley as Bagheera was another amazing casting choice, and he exceeded all expectations I had for his character. Idris Elba as Shere Khan was great, and he brought a tone of intimidation to the character that not many actors couldn't have done. Although Scarlett Johansson wasn't in the film for long, her voicing the giant snake Kaa was pretty good. Christopher Walken as King Louie was an excellent choice, and he played the character with a darkness to him, which I really enjoyed. All of the voice acting was great, and not a single actor dragged the film down at all.Neel Sethi. Now, this kid could've been a silly and ridiculous edition to the film, and could've done really bad, especially when delivering his performance in a green room. He could've easily been the Jar Jar Binks of The Jungle Book. Was he? To keep it short, Neel Sethi delivered one of the best child performances ever given in a film, ever. Especially taking into consideration that every character he interacted with in the movie wasn't really there, he did amazing. Sethi brought a light to this film like I never would've expected from a kid in his first movie..The script was also very well written. There were more than a few suspenseful scenes, and they were all written with a lot of tension building them up. The banter between the characters, particularly involving Baloo's conversations, was fantastic. All of the actors' lines were written and delivered excellently. The dark tone to the movie was a great addition, bringing the film slightly away from the original tone of the 1967 animated version, which was a great contrast to see on the big screen.There was a problem with The Jungle Book, but, luckily, it lied with only one scene. With any good movie, the script and characters feed the audience exposition in a slower manner, and it works nicely that way. The viewer slowly gathers information, and has to piece it together by themselves. This method has proved flawless countless times, and, well, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Although The Jungle Book jumps right into the action, which I loved, there was a particular scene, the one involving Kaa hypnotizing Mowgli, that was one of the most exposition heavy scenes in the past couple of years. Rather than slowly giving the audience exposition, the script shoves it down your throat in that single scene. However, it was just in that one scene, which was a very lucky save.Overall, The Jungle Book was amazing. Anybody should see it, because both adults and children will enjoy it. It's one of, if not the, best live action adaptations of an older Disney movie ever made, with Favreau carving a path to help future directors get it right.",

            "review_title": "A Worthy, Successful Live Action Depiction of \"The Jungle Book\"",
            "content": "Disney is obviously on a roll with their live actions remakes. The reason why they're in with this current boom is debatable. But it's not as their live action remakes of their animated classics are something new. In the 90's we saw live action adaptations of \"101 Dalmatians\" and \"The Jungle Book\" (by Stephen Sommmers). And semi-remakes as \"Alice in Wonderland\" (which was hampered of being a Tim Burton film within Disney) and the fan-fiction \"Malificent\". It's certainly a task to depict a live action adaptation and make it solid on it's own terms, instead of risking the comparisons to their animated counterparts. Last year, Kenneth Branagh's \"Cinderella\" was a critical (and commercial) surprise. Though it didn't came across as an exact replica of Walt's animated classic, it was a film that was made with a certain amount of heart and affection towards the fairy tale genre. And was a product with certain amount of class and quality.Now this year, the live action adaptations are on their prime with \"The Jungle Book\", which has become a critical and commercial success. However, it's a relief to say that \"The Jungle Book\" is completely worth the buzz. This Jon Favreau version is simply the best live action remake of an animated classic and quite superior to the 1994 version. It is a movie that it's worthy of it's success. Due to being scepcitcal about another remake of this film and not finding the movie appealing by it's trailers, it's a relief to cite that skepticism about it was wrong.It would be tempting to be biased towards Walt's animated classic, hence it was one of the first Disney films which I truly got fond of. However, pondering about it from an adult perspective, it's easier to spot it's faults (it's skimpy plot line). But Walt's hand drawn classic remains a delightful and enjoyable classic nonetheless. Jon Favreau's version is a movie that pays surprisingly homage to it's animated counterpart, but doesn't necessarily comes across an exact replica of it. It's an amalgam of the 1967 version and the original book (which pretty much had enough plot and intrigue for a movie anyway).This new version manages to stand of it's own, without being overshadowed by the 1967's versions legacy. It's a movie with a quite amount of cuteness and charm. And thrills and excitement. The script is tight, intriguing, compelling and fills certain gaps which the animated movie had. The CGI animation is brilliant, the animals looks believable. And the same goes for the rest of the visuals of the film. While the 3D comes across as blurry at some parts, it does excel at others.Young Neel Sethi appears as obviously younger than the animated Mowgli was. Nonetheless, while he does not steal the show, he manages to portray Mowgli decently. The other cast does a fine job, without overshadowing or distracting their CGI appearances. In the previews I had my hesitations about Scarlett Johanson's depiction of Kaa, but fortunately she's tolerable in the movie. Bill Murray is a charming Baloo, despite not being a complete replacement of Phil Harris' portrayal, he's good enough. Ben Kingsley makes a decent and rigid Bagheera. Certainly the scene stealer is Idris Elba's Shere Khan, which is a villain that steals the show just as his animated counterpart did. The only true weak spots are the song segments. Both \"Bare Necessities\" and \"Wanna Be Like You\" are incorporated in the movie. Unfortunately they come across as completely jarring, silly and out of place with the naturalistic tone of the movie. Perhaps the end credits gags comes across a bit silly as well. However, those flaws are minor and really doesn't upstage the strengths of the rest of the movie.So Jon Favreau's \"The Jungle Book\" is a worthy counterpart to Walt's animated classic and so far one of the finest films of 2016. If Disney could make their remakes which such amount of care and respect, then we could truly look forward to every of their live action adaptations.",

But as an adult, I also stared at this beautiful film dumbfounded.There's absolutely nothing wrong with this restyled Disney version and I can't think of a single thing to criticize. Everything looks lifelike. The jungle and overall scenery made out of millions of pixels, is phenomenal. The inhabitants of this jungle look stunning. At times I doubted whether they were digital creations or the real thing. Even their character traits are conforming. And in between all these animal activities, one single human creature moves around. Looking at it afterwards you can easily say this was a superhuman performance of this little guy. Because successfully navigating in between these digitally created fellow players wasn't easy I reckon. In terms of empathy, this young lad thrills. It's not only the design department who'll walk away with the honors. It's also the character study and the perfect mix of action and philosophical, emotional moments that make it appealing to all ages. The boundary of creepiness wasn't exceeded (my daughter thought it was terribly exciting though) and it isn't really childish at the same time. I honestly have to admit that during the wonderful scene with Mowgli and Baloo singing \"The Bare Necessities\", I had to wipe away an upcoming tear. Pure nostalgia.The movie hardly deviates from the original, well-known story so to speak. According to me the only part that differs was the denouement. In my youth book, lightning struck a tree and Mowgli drove out the terrible and dangerous Shere Khan with a burning branch. Also some new features are introduced. The daily life of the pack of wolves is illustrated in detail. Certain laws were incorporated into the story such as \"The Water Truce\" that takes effect the moment a terrible drought occurs. And here and there are some amusing additions like the favor Mowgli does for Baloo during which he uses his human ingenuity to solve the problem. The comments of the agitated, little animals on the whole operation was extremely hilarious. And there are some masterful scenes in this film. I was most impressed about the chapter in the beautifully rendered temple where a colossal King Lowie reigns.Not only a lot of energy was put into the visual aspect, but also in the voice cast. It felt like all voices of the elected actors fit perfectly with their characters. To bring this to a successful conclusion, they chose renowned actors: Ben Kingsley (Bagheera), Bill Murray (Baloo), Idris Elba (Shere Khan), Lupita Nyong'o (Raksha), Scarlett Johansson (Kaa) en Christopher Walken (King Louie). I was most impressed by Christopher Walken who apparently also has a very firm singing voice. The most amusing was that of Bill Murray. Not because of his timbre of course, but because of the textual content. So, nothing but praises for this embellished Disney Classic. Perhaps the movie isn't as enchanting as the original and the end result is a more exciting and darker version. I'd be glad when Disney would dig out the other classics, dust them off and transform them into such a visual spectacle as this wonderful film.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",

            "content": "With Hollywood updating, rebooting and remaking past movies all the more frequently now, one would think to take note of how Disney has done it thus far. At least from what has been presented, it seems that the producers of Disney have figured out a way to revamp their old properties into live-action territory and maintain the hype about them. Disney's The Jungle Book (1967) has remained one of the most popular family children films around, most notably for its comedy, simple story, memorable characters and catchy music. So who would have the credentials in order to jumpstart the movie and do the original justice. Enter Jon Favreau, a director but mainly actor who earned his stars by igniting what people now know as the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Iron Man (2008). Favreau also directed Elf (2003), a holiday film that also has a strong fan base. To have Favreau again starting another series feels appropriate. The real question is though, does he do it right? Mostly yes.The screenplay was written by Justin Marks, who surprisingly only wrote for one other theatrical production. That film was Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li (2009), so it is very surprising how well this story was crafted compared to Mr. Marks last effort. For the most part, the story setup is the same. Abandoned man cub Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is found by the panther named Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) and has him raised by the wolf pack led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o). But one day, Shere Khan (Idris Elba) the tiger notices Mowlgi's presence and demands he is rid of. From there, it's up to Bagheera and another friend named Baloo (Bill Murray) the bear to get him back to the man village. Aside from plot, there are some added layers to the characters and their motivations. Shere Khan, Akela and Raksha receive much more development in their relationship to Mowlgi. Meanwhile, Bagheera and Baloo remain likable and well developed in their main roles.The only character who doesn't have a significant presence is Kaa played by Scarlett Johansson. Kaa in this film is more a plot device than any other use, but the knowledge that she also has comes into question. How did she know where Khan got his scars from? Was she there when it happened? Another weird thing is that only some animals in the jungle can communicate with Mowlgi. Why can't the elephants, vultures or monkeys? Then again, the reason why this is called the \"jungle book\" and why a bear is in a jungle never made sense either even for the original. Christopher Walken plays King Louie and at certain times rips off The Godfather (1972) and himself. Just for fun, Favreau, Russell Peters and even Sam Raimi have small voice roles. When it comes to voice work (and acting) though, everyone performs well. Neel Sethi as Mowlgi is a great child actor and looks seriously engaged in his role. For some voice actors though, there could have been better choices.As stated before all voice actors do very well though. The best actor who fit his role was Ben Kingsley as Bagheera. Kingsley is no Sebastian Cabot but he gets very close. Scarlett Johansson as Kaa in replace of Sterling Holloway was a unique choice too. Johansson's voice makes Kaa sound even more seductive than before with her hypnotic eyes. Both Giancarlo Esposito and Lupita Nyong'o make their characters likable too with their calm performances. The only two characters who probably could have been cast better were surprisingly Baloo and Khan. Since this movie supposed to be grounded in tone, having Elba as Khan is understandable. Unfortunately, Elba misses some of the class George Sanders gave in his performance as Khan. For Murray, it's obvious that he wanted to lighten the mood but that shouldn't include his voice. Phil Harris fit Baloo very well, and even though it's not as popular, John Goodman from The Jungle Book 2 (2003) would've been a better choice.In spite of this though, the visuals were on point in this film. The special effects were groundbreaking with the amount of detail that went into each animal. Even for a 2D viewing, the animals look as though one were at a petting zoo. That's how authentic the pelts of these animals look. The layering from the furs to the jungle surroundings is just breathtaking. The director of photography was Bill Pope, the same man behind Darkman (1990), Spider-Man 2 (2004), Men in Black 3 (2012), The Matrix (1999) and its sequels. Every shot, whether it's a clear or rainy day, every scene has the right lighting. Composing the film score was John Debney. Having worked with Favreau before, this is a natural pairing. Debney easily morphs the 1967 original themes into a much bigger sound and bravado. The only two songs to actually be sung by characters are \"Bear Necessities\" and \"I Want to Be Like You\", but this is only for a brief time. Definitely not as lengthy as the original.One would think that rebooting beloved classics is a risky choice. However, Jon Favreau showed many were wrong. The writing is just as equally flawed in some places like its original but it still has an enjoyable story. More thought could have been put into casting the voices for certain characters but it's not a huge issue. The robust film score, acting, special effects and camera-work really shine in this live-action reboot.",

There's the challenge that they can't really change the main story lines, which are already well known. These makes the movie predictable in many ways.

Sethi did OK playing Mowgli, as dealing with a green screen is hard for a first movie, but he seriously lacked something when compared to other child actors. He definitely needed more emotion to his voice and acting lessons. While the graphics were great and the story line basic it seemed to be missing the Disney magic. Disney 1994 Live action of the Jungle Book was 20 times better. I was left disgruntled and in shock of how badly Disney failed on this one. I'm crying in side knowing that they are planning on make a sequel. I hope the Warner Bros. version that comes out in Oct. 2018 with Andy Serkis as the director leaves me a lot more satisfied.",

            "content": "This live-action remake of the 1967 Disney musical classic is the latest in a line of updated Disney flicks which includes Cinderella (2015) and Maleficent. And it is easily the best out of all of them. Jon Favreau, director of Chef, helms an all-star voice cast which includes the likes of Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, and Christopher Walken. The plot is much the same as the original, with a young wolf-raised jungle orphan Mowgli (a commendable Neel Sethi) attempting to evade the ferocious grudge of the man-eating tiger Shere Khan, voiced with menace and deep gravitas by Elba in a performance which rivals the malevolent and iconic tones of George Sanders in the animated original. Along the way he meets a veritable menagerie of creatures, such as the teacher-like panther Bagheera (the reliable Kingsley), the lovable big furry bear Baloo - Murray's finest performance in years - and additional appearances (well, cameos) from Scarlett Johansson as the seductive Kaa and Walken as King Louie, rather different in this adaptation as an imposing Gigantopithecus.It seems apparent that the best thing about this film is the visual aspect. This is, simply put, one of the best- looking films I've ever seen. The computer-generated visual effects and motion capture for the animals is flawless, and the creatures look even better than in the Andy Serkis-starring Rise and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, which was basically perfect to begin with. Sethi does as well as any actor can against what is essentially nothing but green screen, but it's the animals and their jungle environment who really give the film its life. The gorgeous jungle scenery is breathtakingly realistic, and the entire visual effects team deserves credit (and probably an Oscar) for their astounding work, which really makes the audience feel like they're part of the jungle. Whilst this isn't a musical, some classics are worked in, with arguably the stand-out sequence coming when Mowgli teams up with Baloo and they joyfully sing about the Bare Necessities of life. Other classic songs, such as Kaa's 'Trust in Me' are worked meticulously into the score by John Debney. My favourite song from the original, 'I Wanna be Like You', does not work so well, nor does the entire King Louie sequence, but more on that later. The voice acting is on point throughout, with Kingsley's stern wisdom, Murray's dry wit, and Elba's deep menace perfect for the characters. Johansson lends husky seductiveness to Kaa and Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad's Gus Fring) perfect as wolf leader Akela, with his cold, clipped aura of authority. The introduction to the jungle is well-judged and the conclusion wonderful to behold, with a rather inspirational team-up against Shere Khan.The afore-mentioned King Louie sequence is decent but unfortunately the tone is all wrong. I get that they wanted to include his iconic and catchy song, but with the gigantic, scary Louie of this film, the song just does not fit. It even played during the credits, in all its jazzy glory, and that seemed a much better fit for it - it should not have been sung in the monkey scene if they had King Louie being so imposing and threatening. I do love Walken, but he's not a great singer. There's also a little too much action - for the most part it's exciting but a few sequences drag on too long and it sometimes feels as if the entire film is just lurching from one set piece to the next. Occasionally there's an awkward imbalance between being a kids' film and being more mature, but for the most part this is handled well. Overall, The Jungle Book will entertain you throughout. It's great for kids, adults, and nostalgic fans of the animated original. It's a wonderfully-realised vision that is everything a remake should be: new enough that it doesn't seem pointless, yet also placating nay-sayers with nostalgia and callbacks. It will be interesting to see how Andy Serkis' forthcoming Jungle Book film, with Christian Bale and Benedict Cumberbatch, will add more to the classic story. All in all, a gorgeous-looking 72/100.",

            "content": "Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.I'll honestly go as far as to recommend this over the original 1967 version.I don't think is quite as charming as the original, and it has a very different animation style, both with great quality of detail in it. From the individual strains of fur, to the types of animals included (I've done so much research on Indian wildlife today), you can really see the details of the cg effects. Just watch the end credit sequence alone, and it'll prove it.There are 3 huge improvements to this versus others: Sher Khan's face, King Louie, and the intensity of the animal fight scenes. The movie isn't free of problems: I imagine someone will have issues with talking animals vs non-talking animals, that he'd have to learn the language (so how would he ever understand Sher Khan or Baloo?).If anything, I think the writing took a hit. Where the original had a subtle but strong fables sequencing to it (sort of modular moral stories with shifting focus on characters), this is structured much closer to how many video game stories are structured, serialized chapters with some level of power creep and shifting focus of environment and goals but all focused on Mowgli. And I don't think the writing is bad, but this Jungle kid (never actually reveals his backstory, somewhat of a relief honestly) is performing clean engineering using vines and pulleys and armor (that wouldn't work) with calculated positioning. I understand that some people just have talent for some things, but I had to question whether or not I could do the same thing. I could, but I'd have to do it different ways.And in all fairness some of the stupid /inconsistent things he gets up too, even though he's a \"take charge\" Mowgli in this version really got to me: I was literally cheering for Sher Khan at certain points.Ultimately I had a good time with it, and I think most people and possibly their pets will too (my cats were interested for a while).",

            "content": "The Jungle Book is a good film and for quite a while a great one, able to raise intensity, conflict and display beautiful visuals. It beef's up it's characters for a good 45-minutes of the film. But after a while the film seems to lose it's sense of conflict and urgency and the pay- off to what was set-up feels very safe and timid and not as ballsy as it could have been. The ultimate character conflict of Sheer Khan and Mowgli just doesn't feel strong at all after long stretches of time the film-makers don't even touch upon it. The other character relationships are touched upon and are realised just not as fleshed out as to make you feel emotional as certain key scenes play out. Though the films positives certainly outweigh it's flaws. The young actor, Neel Sethi, while having some on-and-off line delivery truly convinces you that he is in that world. The voice acting, all of it, is phenomenal and every animal is beautifully and realistically animated.The first 45 minutes of the film are fantastic showcasing the best-looking CGI since Avatar, building up the atmosphere, the world of the Jungle and the tone of the film. The scenes that follow are very entertaining, introducing humour and songs into the mix but it just felt so tonally jumbled and the dramatic sequences following had hardly any weight. I just didn't feel the goosebumps ever again after about 45 minutes and the film became more popcorn entertainment then a riveting film. Though there is greatness throughout the film it just doesn't keep a consistency. And that's really my major flaw with the Jungle Book: it goes from playing it safe to capturing the magic, the fear, the beauty of old-animated films and modernising it nearly perfectly. Even though I stick by my opinion of the film I can't figure out a way to write in a way that does justice to the film. I would recommend you go see this film as it is a wonderful theatre experience and if you come out loving it and thinking it as a 10/10 film then I wouldn't blame you because with my flaws it is a pretty impressive kids film and at times a really impressive film on it's own which is why I'm giving it my \"GOOD\" rating: 6/10",

So: familiar but different.It's odd that Disney is remaking a select few of its classics into live-action. And so far, the results seem to be working (with the exception of Maleficent, for me at least) quite well. They take a movie that is familiar to the general modern audience and change it up with some small but significant aesthetic differences. It's a bit hard to describe.This whole live remake thing does bother me in one regard though. How the hell will Disney carry-out its announced projects of Winnie the Pooh, Dumbo and The Lion King?

The cgi is able to depict such emotion and the acting is just phenomenal. I cannot believe the kid playing Mowgli spent his scenes in a studio filled with green screen and not actually alongside a panther and bear in the jungle. Not to mention that the visual effects are just stunning! The emphasis on the red flowers importance helps up the anti while centring the main conflict and, strengthened the characters motives. By doing this the narrative was elevated. Probably my favourite change is that they don't spend time in the man village. I love that change because it focuses the story on Mowgli and his connection to the jungle and his \"family\" there. No unnecessary human characters are included, which is great because I felt in the original they took away from the real point.\nOverall I really recommend this film and believe it is Disney's best live-action remake.",

The first ten minutes or so of this film that set the scene before the story begins, are breathtakingly beautiful, and visually beautiful moments occur throughout. It's been a long time since I read the book, but the film is more based on the animated film anyway. Neel Sethi is excellent as Mowgli, projecting childlike innocence without being cloying or sappy. His wolf cub siblings are about the cutest things on four paws. After the villainous tiger Shere Khan kills wolf leader Akela and threatens the pack, Mowgli leaves, escorted by the noble panther Bagheera. But Mowgli rebels against Bagheera's plan to take him to the human village and instead ends up with the scheming bear Baloo, who finds his courage when Mowgli is kidnapped by the monkeys and taken to their king, Louie, who wants the secret of fire (\"the red flower\"). The lost temple that serves as the monkey lair is majestic. Disney just can't resist sticking unnecessary musical numbers into films. A reprise of the classic \"Bear Necessities\" is practically mandatory, but Louie's Godfather style and song are simply grating (why I gave a 9 instead of a ten). After the climactic battle with Shere Khan, Mowgli is shown staying with the wolves, rather than eventually returning to human society as in the book, but that's more the end of a chapter rather than the whole story.",

It is grittier, more dramatic and has much, much more action.I was surprised at how the director had picked up the material and sprinted off wit it and created a very capable adventure movie.The only problem I have with this film is self inflicted. The ghost of the animated version still lurks in the background. With Jungle Book on the cover I was expecting to hear \"King of the Swingers\" etc. So some of the old songs have been begrudgingly squeezed in. These songs- that I grew up loving - jarred with the rest of the film and ruined the scenes they are injected in to.A very good film, stands on its own.

I was even willing to accept that Disney has a history of playing fast and loose with the facts in animal movies (like convincing millions of people that lemmings will willingly leap to their deaths), but I wasn't ready for the rampant and senseless disregard for nature and common sense.The plot was, at times, completely absurd. (The last 30 minutes or so, for example) And was it really necessary for half of the animals to be 3-10 times their normal size? (Ignoring Louie, which, well, words fail me...) The quality of the computer animation was also inconsistent, ranging from brilliant to awkward.The performances are what really killed it for me. When you have the level of talent that they assembled for this film, you expect great things. What you got instead was flat, uninspired performance from VERY talented people and a few non-so-talented performances (most notably Mowgli)Before the film, Favreau gives a little speech to tell everyone about all the imagination and hard work that went into making this film. Sadly, it needed a great deal more. If you are looking for a really good children's movie, go see \"Zootopia\" instead.",

Mowgli (Neel Sethi), is a boy that was raised by wolves in the jungle. When Shere Khan threatens to kill him he must leave the wolf pack and go to the 'man village'. Along the way he meets an array of animals from a massive snake to a Gigantopithecus. The effects were spectacular. The animals in The Jungle Book are some of the best I have ever seen. The voice acting was also really good. Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley and Idris Elba were all great choices. Do I recommend The Jungle Book? Yes.

            "content": "The latest Mouse House property to be given the live-action treatment (after Maleficent and Cinderella), this epic adventure from director Jon Favreau retells the vintage tale with renewed zest and vitality, whilst remaining respectful to the source material. The story itself is already brilliant from both a literal and metaphorical perspective, so the filmmakers tinker very little with it and instead concentrate on tweaking the tone and pace to amp up the thrills and emotion to maximum effect. Hurtling from one superbly executed set piece to the next, aided by glorious CGI and Bill Pope's expert cinematography, it would be easy for Favreau to push the story aside but he carefully and precisely injects moments of intellect and introspection to ensure it remains at the forefront. Ironically though, given the film's shift away from the hand drawn animation of the original, the indisputable highlight of this update is the collection of photo-realistic, computer-generated creatures on display, all seamlessly interacting with the environment and Neel Sethi's human boy, Mowgli. Shere Khan especially is a delightfully terrifying beast that looks every bit as good as Ang Lee's revolutionary digital tiger in Life of Pi, except here the untamed predator has the added benefit of being voiced with chilling ferociousness by Idris Elba. Khan's spine-tingling entrance appears hard to trump, yet each time he's on screen the tension and fear cranks up another notch; both he and Kaa, voiced with nerve-shredding sinisterness by Scarlett Johansson, will surely give younger audience members sleepless nights. On the flipside, Ben Kingsley's midnight-black panther Bagheera is as majestic as he is wise as Mowgli's mentor, whilst Bill Murray's Baloo is quite possibly the most endearing and huggable grizzly bear you'll ever meet, and also downright hilarious. Gigantic orang-utan King Louie (Christopher Walken) and Mowgli's wolf-mother Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) aren't as memorable \u2013 with the former's musical number falling very flat \u2013 but with the movie excelling on so many other fronts these are relatively minor quibbles. Fun, funny and constantly exhilarating, balanced with the perfect amount of warmth, maturity and sincerity, The Jungle Book proves that there can be value in remaking classics.",

This makes it a good experience for adults as well, who see their favorite childhood characters in a new light.Some objects can be seen as unrealistic and exaggerated. But I think it simply compliments the storytelling. Overall this movie is not only about a boy but also out of the eyes of a boy. This really shows that they delved into the matter.Hand up, the best thing is the soundtrack which consists out of the mash up of the original tunes and some seriously well-played orchestra under the guidance of John Debney. I will definitely look further into his work.One warning! In Germany this movie can be seen at the age of 6. I would disagree. Though there is no direct nudity or extreme violence.

            "content": "If the movie industry is a jungle, Disney is its Shere Khan, stalking around and bullying other contenders away from the box office watering hole, before devouring and subsuming them completely. Their increasing industry monopoly would be disconcerting were the House of Mouse not so painstakingly, peerlessly good at giving audiences exactly what they want. The Jungle Book, their most ambitious live action remount yet, is a perfect example. It's got a lot on its plate: imparting gleeful, nostalgic adventure, nodding to Kipling's darkness while sidestepping cringeworthy colonialism, and somehow fusing an episodic, emotional roller-coaster of a story into something both fresh and familiar. And you know what? Iron Man vet director Jon Favreau is up for all of it and more, delivering Disney's finest live action film of the modern era. Favreau doesn't waste any time. He hits the ground running (literally), and keeps the rollicking pace afloat by unabashedly committing to populism interlaced with his trademark snappy humour. Kipling's inherently spasmodic story could have proved challenging, each animal encounter or challenge playing like a succession of video game 'boss battles'. However, Justin Marks' nimble screenplay weaves it all together by tying all adventures back to the root emotional core - Mowgli's dichotomy between craving community, and need to play to his strengths and be himself, in spite of the regimented social cues of his adopted wolf family. It's all classic Disney stuff: Aladdin's \"Beeeeeeeee yourself!\" crossed with Hercules finding his hero's welcome. But newcomer Neel Sethi sells it so effortlessly that he's an utterly irresistible lead. He's pluckiness incarnate without a shred of damning whininess or smarminess, and is (almost) perfectly emotive amidst a sea of green screen. In short, he's the perfect Mowgli, right down to his adorable, shambling walk. Ah yes - the green screen. Normally, an overabundance of CGI would be a distasteful distraction, but Favreau's unbelievable commitment to detail serves up a breathtakingly dense visual feast. This Jungle Book may be one of the most gorgeously immersive digital worlds ever created. Every drop of moisture, rustle of fur, and crackling dry leaf is so stunningly realized that, for once, the 3D suspension of disbelief actually takes hold: we feel like we can reach out and run our hands through this astonishingly believable jungle. It's telling that even when our anthropomorphic animals talk, or even sing, the credibility isn't ruptured, but actually enhanced, thanks to the stupendous voice cast (with only the occasional flat line reading and Favreau's needless, somewhat awkward tentativeness in incorporating the musical numbers jolting the rapture). Here, Disney draws out the magic in 'magic realism' like never before. It helps that Favreau directs a hell of a set piece. Tasked with a schizophrenically emotive story, Favreau commits to the raw, kinetic sentiment of each moment so fiercely that The Jungle Book is liable to consistently have audiences on the edge of their seats. Be forewarned: although the film tonally skews as a children's movie, there are bits so scary that, to quote Jurassic World, they will \"give the parents nightmares.\" Mowgli's encounter with Kaa the snake is a micro horror movie in itself. Between the foreboding mounds of shed skin, slithering coils so thick they're indiscernible from the tree trunks, vertigo-inducing hallucinatory eyes, and Scarlett Johansson's exquisite, seductive hiss, Kaa's interlude is sheer terror, and a work of cinematic poetry. Idris Elba's Shere Khan is a deliciously malevolent arch-foe. He nails the snarling bravado, but is even more chilling when seditiously charming the cubs of Mowgli's wolf pack after throwing their alpha off a cliff. Similarly, Christopher Walken's appearance as the outrageously large mafioso ape King Louie lends the film a turn towards sublime surreality. Literally introduced by a cowbell (Favreau does cheeky fan service like none other), King Louie encapsulates the best of Walken's incomparable pleasures: he's playful, kooky (let's see you come up with that many rhymes for \"gigantopithecus\"), and genuinely terrifying, and the sight of him crashing around his monkey temple, letting rip with a full-blown, jazzy cover of \"I Wanna Be Like You\" yields more euphoric joy than can properly be expressed by language. Still, Favreau, quite astutely, recognizes that, at its heart, The Jungle Book is a buddy comedy, with two contrasting patriarchs butting heads over who gets to be 'cool dad'. And, amidst all its multifaceted triumphs, it's the film's 'Hakuna Matata' segment, the introduction of Baloo, where it transcends excellence into the realm of masterpiece. Bill Murray has never been more laconic, roguish and utterly lovable (which is saying a lot) than he is here as a sloth bear, and the dripping, preening, sarcasm in the drawl of Ben Kingsley's Bagheera is so dryly heartwarming and hilarious that he threatens to match Murray (which is really saying a lot). As they lob contemptuous barbs and sheepish pep talks at each other and the other jungle animals Favreau sprinkles in just for fun, evidencing his Elf-calibre impish humour, as Mowgli risks his life climbing cliffs for honey and rescuing fallen baby elephants, the film hits its breezy, adventurous stride. Henceforth, the viewer is inextricably transfigured into a child, wide-eyed, and lapping up every irresistible second. Phenomenally fun, visually flawless, and winningly heartfelt, The Jungle Book is that rare beast - a remake that outperforms its already excellent source text. It's perfectly paced, imbued with robust, emotional storytelling, and it's impossible to imagine a better cast to bring the jungle to life. And yet, Favreau makes it all seem so effortless and unassuming, as if fine-tuning and updating Disney classics is all in a day's work. Is it worth spending the money to see The Jungle Book in 3D, AVX, IMAX, or whatever other sensorial gimmicks are available? Consider it nothing less than a bare necessity of life.

            "content": "I admit, I was hesitant when I heard that they were making a live action version of the original Jungle Book animated movie. I didn't think that it would translate well into live action and I kind of wanted something more along the lines of the actual book than the Disney original. That being said, I have to admit that I was wrong and this is actually a really fun and enjoyable film. The cgi is some of the most impressive I've ever seen and the characters are even more lovable than they used to be. Jon Favreau really knocked it out of the park on this one. I wouldn't call it a perfect movie but it was a ton of fun to revisit this classic story.Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is a young boy who lives in the jungle and was raised by a pack of wolves and a panther named Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). His father was killed when he was very young and he was left in the jungle but has gained the ability to speak the same language as many of the other animals. Things are going well until Shere Khan (Idris Elba) finds out about Mowgli and decides that he wants to kill him (and possibly eat him but he's not as specific on that point). Mowgli leaves his wolf family to travel to a human village and ends up having one heck of an adventure where he meets some familiar characters.I'm impressed by the amount of talent they were able to get for this film. Sethi is the only newcomer here and I thought he did a pretty darn good job. Basically the whole thing is just this kid interacting with cgi characters but it never looks out of place and Sethi really sells the whole thing. We also get plenty of excellent voice work from the likes of Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Bill Murray, Christopher Walken, and Scarlett Johansson. Everyone gives some fantastic portrayals but I especially liked Kingsley's Bagheera. I didn't even know it was him until the credits started rolling but I loved the stoic personality of this character.Like I said before, The whole film is just downright beautiful to look at. The animals look absolutely fantastic and the jungle gives us a variety of unique locations to see during Mowgli's adventure. There are even scenes where you can see the water clinging to the hairs of the animals when it's raining. I have to admit that I was impressed. It's just a really nice film to look at.This movie is incredibly fun and I really enjoyed it but there were a couple of scenes that kind of took me out of the experience. These were the musical numbers. There are only two of them in the entire film but I'm not really sure why they didn't just take them out completely. To be fair, Walken's awkward singing voice did bring a smile to my face but it just came out of nowhere. I'm guessing the songs were put there more for the benefit of nostalgia but they just didn't work for me. Fortunately, they really don't dwell on these scenes for very long.This is a really good film that I think most people will get a kick out of. Mowgli's adventure is surprisingly very similar to how it was depicted in the animated classic but they turned it up a notch with the live action version. Everything looks absolutely fantastic and the characters have never been more interesting. Some of the songs made me cringe a little bit but I definitely recommend this movie to just about everyone. I know the kids will especially get a kick out of it. There was one kid behind me in the theater that would start howling with the wolves in the film. Basically it's just a really fun flick.

I think the whole thing was CGId from start to finish except the live action performance of Neel Sethi who plays the main role of Mowgli. I'm guessing this is a scarier version of previous versions but in this movie everything fits absolutely perfectly. I can't think of one bum note in this movie. The scene with Christopher Walken playing King Louie was the best scene - surreal, hilarious, scary, bizarre, atmospheric. All the characters seemed to perfectly compliment each other. The humour is both genuinely funny, perfectly timed and not forced - for example the scene where Baloo persuades Mowgli to climb up to the bee hives to collect the honey.The CGI jungle was impeccable. I remember watching Avatar and thinking how fake and contrived it all looked. This is on another level. I thought the CGI wolves, Buffaloes, bears and elks in The Revenant were incredible. But the Jungle Book soars way above that. Even though the animals in the Jungle Book talk, which initially takes some adjusting to, you are nevertheless fully emotionally engaged and you very quickly buy into the narrative of the various conflicts between the animals. In the hands of a lesser director this film could have seemed goofy and dumb - yet nothing here seems ridiculous, it seems compelling and engrossing from start to finish. There is a decaying monkey temple where King Louie (Christopher Walken) rules. This is a truly stunning sequence. The level of detail to the jungle and the various epic backdrops are so beautifully rendered, the jungle is depicted with such heart-felt effort. Every shot is perfectly crafted - every shot is 100% perfectly executed. The standout performances are Christopher Walken playing King Louie and of course Idris Elba voicing Shere Khan - both are brilliant. Some of the scenes with Shere Khan are beautifully dark and deadly. Ben Kingsley voicing Bagheera is very powerful. Scarlett Johansen voicing Kaa the snake is very mesmerising and creepy. The Jungle Book has got the same sense of mysticism and awe as Raiders of the lost Ark or Temple of Doom. It's far, far better than The Force Awakens as an immersive fantasy adventure.The Director Jon Favreau who made the Iron Man movies which I didn't like, is an exceptionally talented director. I wasn't expecting this from him. Aside from the mindblowing production values the pitch and tone hit just the right notes throughout the film. Nothing feels wasted, nothing feels superfluous, all the characters fulfill a necessary role.I was lucky enough to watch this with my wife in IMAX in Waterloo and it was an incredible experience.The Jungle Book is pure movie magic. It's really worth seeing in the cinema - in IMAX if possible. Of all the films I've watched recently - Fury Road, The Revenant, Spectre, The Force Awakens - only The Jungle Book and Mad Max truly stand out as being truly great films.",

            "content": "From the moment I discovered that this film was going to be 100% shot without any natural landscapes or in an actual jungle, I was also 100% sure that it'd suck. I mean, a 1h30 movie with only one real character in the middle of a CGI environment? It has to be terrible ... Or maybe not. Not at all ... It blew me away! This movie is surprisingly astonishing, near perfection I would say!The CGI is fantastic! I got to a point where I looked at something and asked myself, \"Is that CGI or is it actually real?\". All the locations and characters are marvelous to look at and I watched this movie in 2D so I cannot imagine how amazing it looks in 3D. It' a delight for critics who are always so focused on every inch of technical details because there isn't a single flaw, there isn't one scene where someone could say, \"Oh, those eyes are not OK\" ... Clap, clap, clap, to the special effects team, they really pulled off a masterpiece!For the technical part of the movie, I'm done, there's nothing else to say besides that it's just perfect. Nevertheless, the pros don't end here: the cast is brilliant, each character has a very suitable voice, especially Bagheera (Ben Kingsley), Shere-Khan (Idris Elba) and Baloo (Bill Murray). Both Ben Kingsley and Idris Elba bring their A-game, their voices are so powerful and deep that every scene with them is so captivating, and with Shere-Khan even more since the whole screen would focus on him when he appeared. The tiger is such a huge presence, he's scary, menacing and haunting which is great for a villain. Bill Murray played a lighter character: Baloo is the funny, lazy bear that sings the traditional songs with Mowgli and helps him be who he really his (using his \"tricks\"). Bill Murray's voice is perfect for Baloo and he's the one that got some laughs from me.I don't really have a major issue with this film, the plot is well handled, it's fast-paced and the characters are all captivating and they seem so real that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Still, if there's someone that could have been better it's Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli. He's pretty good, but there are some scenes where he can be a little irritating and doesn't know where to look at (however, this last one I understand, it can't be easy to act the whole time with a green screen in front of you, especially for a young actor). I definitely didn't like Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), a snake that straight up exposes Mowgli's past through her hypnotic tricks. She only appears in that scene in the whole movie, so I'm sure they could've revealed his past in a much better way, other than pure exposition.This is the best adaptation of the Jungle Book so far, without a doubt! It's the movie which kids from this generation will grow up with and I'm more than happy for them. It surprised me in the most unbelievable and gorgeous way, it's an amazing CGI work! Absolutely recommend it!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",

            "content": "I was dubious going into this having a great fondness for the original Disney animation and the Rudyard Kipling book, but I was pleasantly surprised. The film is beautifully crafted and mixes together some excellent CGI and some fantastic live action. The story should be very familiar to you by now and for the most part this modern adaption doesn't deviate too much; it's a litter darker in some places, some of the musical numbers in the original have been omitted and some changed slightly, and more of the story from the book are explored (which I liked). The film weaves a beautiful world and really is a spectacular picturesque vision to behold. Even if you have seen the animated 1967 version I'd recommend going to see this as it will still leave you delighted. The voice actors chosen are all sublimely brilliant and convincing, each chosen voice is both powerful and unique in their own ways. Bill Murray makes a superb Baloo and Ben Kingsley is a smooth Bagheera, Christopher Walken as King Louie (FTR Louie is not an orangutan in this, he's a gigantopithecus) is excellent and slightly oddball and scary and Idris Elba as Shere Khan delivers chills and thrills. Scarlett Johansson changes Kaa the snake's gender but you know what, it actually works really well. Even the Favreau voices scattered amongst the cast make professional additions and should be applauded. Special mention to Neel Sethi who makes a brilliant Mowgli, not only does he fulfil the Mowgli role excellently but he also looks like the cartoon Mowgli from the original cartoon feature.Despite all the plaudits I didn't enjoy the finale as much as the rest of the film, the fight scene was done in the dark with a constantly moving camera and it made it difficult to see what was going on. As a result it was hard to see who was attacking who or who was supposed to be speaking. In hindsight, I don't think this was avoidable, the story called for darkness so that fire would stand out and to make it more scary. Another minor downside for me was some of the Anthropomorphism (only some of it though), some of the creatures weren't as convincingly real as others - for example there were times when Bagheera or Shere Khan looked slow and too bulky, maybe even too robotic when they should have been fluid. In complete contrast other creatures like Baloo and King Louie looked authentic and moved like I'd expect them too. These are only personal minor points to what is undoubtedly a fantastic and visually stunning film.This is definitely a family film rather than one aimed at children, there were darker themes present which could scare (but educate) children. The theme of death was featured which, by contrast to the animated version, was absent. It wasn't explored in depth by any means but the inclusion of death means that I wouldn't want my nephews or nieces going to watch this without adult supervision. This is obviously a sign of times and how cinema has changed and grown up. Well done John Favreau on directing this beauty, the film certainly didn't disappoint and I'd happily watch this again. 7 out 10",

            "content": "In the last seven years, Disney has tried to remake many of the older animated films into live action. Sometimes, they are okay. Sometimes, they are terrible. And once in a while, there is an excellent example like Jon Favreau's version of The Jungle Book. This really is the cream of the crop for animation to live action remakes from the Disney studio.The A-list actors who provided voices for their on-screen counterparts was amazing. They got Bill Murray, Idris Elba, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walken and Scarlett Johansson. Bill Murray as the voice of Baloo had a special family connection for him, as his older brother Brian Doyle-Murray had also voiced Baloo in Disney's earlier film, The Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story (1998).King Louie was always a favorite character of mine from the original jungle Book in 1967, and it was great that Favreau kept the character and even better, he was voiced by Chris Walken. Richard Sherman, who wrote songs for the 1967 film, returned to add lyrics for the King Louie character in this film.",

            "content": "I'd recently rediscovered an old picture of myself at Disneyland. It portrays my brother and I when we were little kids, probably around six or seven, giving the character Baloo a hug. This made realize that I used to really enjoy the Disney animated movie, The Jungle Book. I hadn't seen it in years, but before seeing the new version, I decided to give the classic another viewing. What I saw were two things that I liked as child; a dream-like jungle where a boy could have an adventure and a set of animal characters that were fun to follow. The jazz-like musical score adds to the uniqueness of the story, often getting an occasional hum whenever \"Bear Necessities\" pops into my head. While it wasn't one of Disney's best-animated features, it's still very charming.I know that it doesn't follow the Rudyard Kipling novel (I'm not even sure that it CAN be adapted into a movie), so I simply see it as a separate entity doing it's own thing. That's something that I'd like people to understand before going into this remake. The Jungle Book is not an adaptation of the novel, but a new way of telling the story of the Disney classic.In what I can describe as a fantasy version of the Indian jungle, Mowgli is a man cub who has been raised by a wolf pack under the guidance of his wolf father Akela (played by Giancarlo Esposito), wolf mother Raksha (played by Lupita Nyong'o), and black panther teacher Bagheera (played by Ben Kingsley). Things are going fine until ferocious tiger Shere Khan (played by Idris Elba) returns to the jungle. He senses Mowgli (played by Neel Sethi) and vows to kill him as soon as the rains return. When they do, Bagheera agrees to take Mowgli back to the man village.On the way back to civilization, Shere Kahn tries to attack, but is fought back by Bagheera who tells the boy to run. Mowgli escapes and heads deeper into the jungle where comes across a variety of animals from a heard of elephants, a deadly python Kaa (played by Scarlett Johansson), a giant orangutan King Louie (played by Christopher Walken), and of course, the relaxed bear Baloo (played by Bill Murray). Mowgli learns about his origin and the deadly \"red flower\" that's the biggest threat to the jungle. Will Mowgli return to the man village?The Jungle Book sticks pretty close to the animated story; sometimes with some new improvements and sometimes with some issues. Let's start off with the two best things about the movie. The casting is absolutely perfect. They could have not picked better people as Bill Murray's relaxed voice suits Baloo and Idris Elba is chilling as Shere Kahn. I was very surprised with how Scarlet Johansson's voice can go from southing to creepy\u0085in a good way. The visuals were unbelievable. It's clear that the animals got the most attention as many of them are so lifelike (even the giant ape) that I forgot that they were animated. The environments brought me back to just how magical and threatening the jungle can be.The story does put Mowgli in focus on his growth as a boy learning about his place in nature. While it's done alright, parts of it do feel rushed, especially during the climax when he learns his lesson pretty fast for the convenience of the plot. Other parts like when Baloo and Mowgli have their falling out and the entire scene with Kaa can feel pretty forced and makes you question whether material was cut in order the make The Jungle Book shorter. This is one movie I'd like to see an extended cut of.I'll give this eight bananas out of ten. If you didn't like the animated movie, then you'll probably not like this, as both movies are very similar. But for those that grew up with the classic, they'll definitely enjoy it along with the kids that will definitely eat this up. I'll also note that the 3D is astounding and I recommend catching it in that format if you can. Take a trip on the wild side and have fun with this bear necessity.",

On the one hand the effects were cool and it was interesting to see the different direction but at the same time it would be interesting to see a more faithful adaptation of the book.With that being said it's an awesome movie though I wished they had focused more on the book in terms of some of the characters such as Kaa. In the book the snake is a friend of Mowgli unlike the adaptation's. this would've been a good opportunity to change that and they didn't.With all that aside I enjoyed it. The movie's about an orphan named mowgli who is raised in the jungle by wolves after being brought to them by Bagheera when he was a baby. His happy life changes when the brutal, misanthropic tiger Shere Khan sets out to kill him forcing him to go on the run. Along the way he meets a bear named baloo who teaches him the \"bare necessities of life\".You've seen this story before but what makes it interesting are the effects used to tell the story. The effects are amazing and breathe new life to the characters and the world they live in. The actors have great chemistry with each other. If you like the original then you'll like this one but if you' looking for a faithful adaptation of the book you won't find it here. Take it for what it's worth.",

Wish I could watch this in Hindi as I still remember the dialogues and songs in Hindi.The movie's visuals were spectacular and it was so real that it looked like a human was living in the midst of Animal Planet. Sher Khan is waiting to get hold of Mougli, kills Akela(wolf father) and how Mougli gets back his revenge is all the movie is about. Well we all know the story but it was real fun watching it in the big screen of these favourite characters.Though Mougli seems to be younger than television version, he's really enjoyable and fun. The missing element is the heroic Akela in the television series while he is brought to death in the movie without a fight as well as the love for Mougli by his wolf father. I also wonder what happened to the Boomerang which Mougli possessed in the televisions series. It retained the original essence otherwise. The movie has successfully brought the chemistry between Mougli, the ever guiding Bageera, friendly Baloo and most importantly the ferocious Sher Khan. Amazing scenes includes Sher Khan chasing Mougli and King Louie chasing Mougli etc.90 minutes of movie was not enough for me and I would suggest go for it for reliving the memories as well as the stunning visuals of human and animals together.",

            "content": "Rating: 8.5, Great Movie*In 1967, Rudyard Kipling's novel was brought to life in Walt Disney's final movie, The Jungle Book (7.5). In 2016 Director Jon Favreau has captured the joys and wonder of the original movie while transforming its meanings of family and friendship through a strange tale in the Indian jungles. This was even better than the original movie and boy would Walt Disney himself be proud of Favreau's cast and crew of producing a movie that 'WILL' win an Oscar.*Characters - Mowgli: The bright and talented Neel Sethi had the privilege of being the movie's only non CGI character, that being said he plays a gullible but lovable protagonist throughout his journey in the jungle.Baloo: If Bill Murray was born an animal, he be a bear for sure. His humour and character puts a smile on every audience and character except Bagheera, speaking of which...Bagheera: An old, strict but wise jungle feline was the perfect role for the talented Ben Kingsley to tackle and triumph.Shere Khan: The greatest character in the movie was Idris Elba's Shere Khan. His terrifying voice equally matched his character's power and ferocity. He made an exceptional villain who brought reality and reason in the tale, I my self believed he was doing the right thing. I do believe he should have died in the sequel, regardless well done Elba!Kaa: Scarlett Johansson is both the sexiest woman alive and the sexiest voice on the planet. She nailed the role of Kaa, as she was both a soothing and seductive narrator. Her song in the credits was also a delight, I love you Scarlett!King Louie: This old legend gave the movie a darker but talented approach. Simply put Christopher Walken can do it all, talk, walk, sing and of course dance.The Wolves: Im glad they chose to explore the wolf family. Raksha and Akela were the perfect mother and father of the story and little Grey was a clumsy but cute little brother.*Plot & Design: I can assume we all know the plot, but never the less Favreau expanded well on it. Providing a darker origin story and some spectacular animal rivalry, while matching the animals characters with modern day individuals. WARNING however, little children may find the animals rather violent and scary in numerous situations, regardless still film for the family to see. The biggest triumph this movie WILL deliver to the Oscars, was the design of both the animals and environment. Honestly i doubt Warner Brothers, Jungle Book Origins can do better than this, even with motion capture and Christian Bale. Even the music was fantastic.*With all that being said, \"forget about your worries and your strifes\", Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book has no flaws however certain scenes do feel rather awkward and could have used some improvements. I can say for sure that Disney Studios have truly captured the imagination of children and have brought my childhood to life!Please check out my lists and ratings at riyork2! I hope this review was a valuable source for the jungle lovers!",

            "content": "Disney has been on a hot-streak adapting their old animated movies into live action, and like last year's Cinderella, The Jungle Book is yet another home run. While The Jungle Book is not a full live action remake of the 1967 animation, it does borrow many of that movies' better elements (such as \"The Bare Necessities\") while being it's own thing as well. The Jungle Book is a rip-roaring adventure, suitable for the whole family, that also has a lot of heart while commenting on man's relationship to nature and what it means to come of age. Newcomer Neel Sethi is the real backbone of the movie as Mowgli, having the tall order of selling all of the special effects to the audience so that we believe this is all actually happening in the jungles of India. For ninety-nine percent of the movie, Sethi was the only real thing onset, with the entire movie having been filmed on Los Angeles sound stages! This is what is most impressive about this movie, is that this movie never used any real animals, nor did it ever film a single frame in India itself. The sound stages that the movie filmed on were filled with green screens and puppets for Sethi to interact with, which both were later replaced by computer generated jungles and animals. When watching this movie, you realize you are literally watching the future of movies, where anything the imagination can dream up can be done through this kind of photorealistic special effects work. However, none of these computer generated animals would have worked had it not been for the litany of Hollywood stars that lent their voices to these iconic characters. Bill Murray steals the show as Baloo, while Ben Kingsley is just perfect as Bagheera, then there's Scarlett Johansson creeping things up as Kaa, Christopher Walken adding some new dimension to King Louie, and Lupita Nyong'o being absolutely lovable and heartbreaking as Mowgli's wolf mother, Raksha. Of course, my personal favorite performance was Idris Elba's frightening work as Shere Khan. All in all though, this is just one of those movies where everything comes together to make a very satisfying whole, all thanks to director Jon Favreau. Favreau has long been one of the more underrated directors in Hollywood, having done movies like Elf and Iron Man, and while the success of some of his movies could be attributed to the actors leading them, The Jungle Book is Favreau's movie through and through. Honestly, I don't know if there are many directors who could pull off a movie like this that required so much imagination, and personally, I think that's a feat worthy of Oscar recognition.I give The Jungle Book a 10 out of 10!",

            "content": "As a kid of a certain generation, you had a favorite VHS clamshell that took ridiculous punishment, inside and out. You knew every warped frame of the movie that was exacerbated over time from overviewing and fast-forwarding to favorite parts. It made its rounds to every room of the house regardless of whether or not there was a TV, because you could play the movie back in your head simply by looking at the cover. Mine was The Jungle Book (1967). Movies that build that level of adoration make you lament adulthood and wish you could see it again, unjaded, for the first time. This was something like the experience of seeing The Jungle Book (2016). This is a movie for kids and once-a-kids; those that are being introduced and re-introduced to the beloved characters. Mowgli the man-cub is a character that predates Tarzan. Animation made for a fantastic Disney adaptation full of slapstick comedy and a Mowgli that kids wanted to trade places with. This darker live- action feature has a Mowgli that the kids want to be. Neel Sethi plays this role as a true hero. He is 12-years-old but looks 10. He lives in a beautiful world with wonders and dangers that were once only adaptable exclusively through animation. Now that technology has allowed for a mix of heavy CGI and real environments, we get a vulnerable character that we root for with greater intensity than we would in its cartoon counterpart. Director John Favreau has helmed other films with this level of live to CGI ratio (I.E. Iron Man, Cowboys vs Aliens); but this time it was used to its highest potential. A real life Mowgli can talk with extremely realistic animals and the result is (along with Pan's Labyrinth) one of the most engaging fantasies in recent memory.There is a balance of expectations with such renowned source material. If it is too faithful, it seems redundant. If too many liberties are taken, you've spoiled a cherished story. This film hits all the obligatory beats and the liberties are taken with the character's personalities, not their nature. Something that gets lost in animal animation through personification is the animal. They become humans in animal bodies and modern stories are overflowing with \"nowadays\" references that turn animal characters into critiques of humans. The Jungle Book is loaded with a great voice cast that never breaks character as animals. Bill Murray as the lovably lazy Baloo; Ben Kingsley as the moral compass Bagheera; Idris Elba as the dark and sinister Shere Kahn; Lupita Nyong'o as the strong mother Raksha. These characters are portrayed without a wink to the audience that there is a human inside. I had misgivings about Christopher Walken as King Louie, I needn't have. This is a much more villainous character, warped by his passion to wield the power of man. Walken can have a silly voice and cadences, but he can also pull off a terrifying mob boss, he is much more the latter here. These animals have their own opinions of what humans represent in their world. To make them too human would diminish their perspective.The medium this adventure is told in doesn't warrant spunky song and dance numbers. However, the beloved songs from the original are worked in without turning the production into a musical (the credits sequence is worth sticking around for). The ending is the greatest plot departure for the original. But the story arc meets a logical conclusion. We have been bombarded over the years with parables about man's poisonous presence in nature. Mowgli is not representing all of mankind here. He is a living being that is trying to find his place in the animal kingdom. There are questions raised about how welcome any human should be in the jungle. Mowgli being a human may come with incompatibilities to his surroundings, but why should that mean the man-cub can't have his tricks and slap a tune on Baloo's belly while floating down a stream?",

Based on the 1967 original (which was based on the Rudyard Kipling novel), 2016's 'Jungle' really ups the ante on the number of animated animals and brings all elements of the jungle to life.With a screenplay from Justin Marks and directed by Jon Favreau, 'Jungle' brings its A-game on all fronts, including a who's who in voice actors, from Bill Murray as the lovable Baloo to Sir Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, as well as appearances from the voices of Idris Elba, Scarlett Johansson, Lupita Nyong'o and Idris Elba. Each of the animals portrayed by these actors actually feel like they are living, breathing things, and newcomer Feel Sethi as Mowgli does an excellent job interacting with them, especially considering they are all CGI.Aside from the obvious, what 'Jungle' does really well is it captures themes of family, identity and acceptance. There are a few key scenes that are touching enough to pull at the heartstrings of anyone, and a few lessons that are learned along the way, as well. In this sense, 'Jungle' is a feel- good film that has few (if any) flaws, which explains why it has been embraced by so many.'The Jungle Book' is an example of how Disney continues to innovate and breathe new life into the stories that have made the studio empire what it is, and it's likely we will continue to see similar efforts in the coming years.",

            "content": "Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.6/5 starsFrom the opening sequence of \"The Jungle Book\" itself you know that you're in for one of those on screen adventures that transports you to a different land. It shows our little, lost jungle boy Mowgli running along with his pack of wolves, and the entire scene offers a terrific advertisement of the excitement in store. The audience is transported to a world full of adventure and wide-eyed wonder from the word go. The luscious landscapes, stunning visual effects, breathtakingly realistic animation (every animal looks alive), and excellent use of lighting all combine to immerse you in a jungle environment that you feel you're a part of. Not since 2009's Avatar has a make-belief world looked so engrossing and imaginative on screen.So our boy Mowgli is enjoying the wild life with his wolf pack and mentor Bagheera (the panther), when the jungle witnesses a drought, which forces him to go to a place called the 'peace rock' \u2013 where all animals can gather for a drink of water, comfortable in the knowledge that no creature can attack another. Unfortunately, our baddie Shere Khan (the tiger) has no respect for the law of man or beast, and after catching the boy's scent vows to devour him for a tasty snack. The rest of the film demonstrates Mowgli's journey to the other side of the jungle, where he strikes a friendship with the rolly-jolly Baloo (the bear), and his efforts along with the help of his furry friends to thwart the dinner plans of the evil Shere Khan.Mowgli's interactions with Baloo, Bagheera, and his adoptive mother Raksha (the wolf) are filled with many touching moments, which evoke a well of emotions within you. Director Jon Favreau and his writer Justin Marks also show a great amount of respect to the animal kingdom and refer to them as people instead. Balancing out the emotional undercurrent are the thrilling action scenes, which are put together so smoothly and are shot with such detailed planning that you are able to almost experience every pounce, leap, and narrow escape. Of course, the brilliant 3D conversion also plays a huge part over here.Where the film falters more often than can be overlooked is in stringing together a cohesive plot to tie the wonderful set pieces and wondrous sequences together. More often than not you get the feeling that the makers have paid a great deal of attention to each scene at the cost of forgetting to link them together. In addition, some of the narrative arcs feel rushed, especially the all-too hurried climax, with more than a few plot contrivances. Thankfully, it gets saved by another striking set piece and an electrifying nail-biting action scene in the denouement.\"The Jungle Book\" is no doubt a rip-roaring adventure that more than does justice to its jungle roots. It also offer yet another reason to feel optimistic about Walt Disney's decision to turn its own animated masterpieces into live-action features. It's just that for all its exhilarating sequences and visual grandeur, the 2016 live- version is not a 'bare necessities' adventure like the 1967 animated-classic.",

A few encounters are muddled up and changed (for example, the encounter with the elephants is completely different and much more serious, and takes place later in the movie), and there's a few extra things entirely (like the dry season uncovering the peace rock at the beginning), but every change and new addition works with the slightly new angle they take with the story.One of the best things about the adapting process was that it didn't want to distance itself from the classic. It embraced it. The three most iconic songs of the classic are here in one form or another. The Bare Necessities acts as the movie's musical theme, with a big epic rendition, and a slower, more subdued version, and of course the classic lyrical version along the river (albeit with some altered lyrics). I Wanna Be Like You is lyrically present, but musically lacking, as Christopher Walken's rendition plays out more as poetic spoken word than a song, and doesn't really work either. It feels forced in as a reference, and Walken does not sound natural with it either. Thankfully there's a more faithful version during the credits, and Walken redeems himself there. Trust In Me is also present in the credits, but makes no appearance in the actual movie itself beyond a hissed \"Trust in me\" from Kaa.The voice acting is fantastic across the board. As soon as I found out who was cast as who, even though some were a bit bizarre, I knew each and every one would actually work. Ben Kingsley is one of the go-to guys when it comes to wise voices, so his turn as Bagheera was not only perfect casting, but it must've been a bit of an effortless job for him. As always he did what he does best. While I'm not the biggest Bill Murray fan in the world, his mumbling, rambling Baloo was another perfect fit. Murray just seems like such a naturally laid back guy and his fit as the lazy Sloth Bear couldn't have been better. Scarlett Johansson's Kaa was probably the casting that I raised my eyebrow at most, and yet her slight huskiness made for the perfect replacement for Sterling Holloway's hiss. While Christopher Walken is probably the weakest link in the voice acting, particularly when it came to the spoken song, his voice for the gigantopithecus (rather than Orang-utan) gave him a bit of a Godfather quality. Luipta N'yongo and Giancarlo Esposito also lend their voice to members of the wolf pack. Then there's Idris Elba. When I saw Zootopia a couple of weeks ago, I said he was not a good fit for voice acting. He didn't sound natural at all as he over-pronounced everything to make sure it was clear and precise. However his turn as Shere Khan is like day and night. He oozes into the villain with growls and menacing purs, turning the tiger into a dangerous and genuinely terrifying force to be reckoned with. Finally Neel Sethi is remarkable as Mowgli, especially considering the green screen environment he had to work with, which continues to prove a challenge for even the most seasoned acting veterans.I mentioned that one of the best things about this version of Jungle Book was how it embraced the classic animated feature, taking songs, story beats and imagery from it and making them it's own. The other best thing about this movie is it's visual wizardry. The vast majority of what you see is CGI, and yet you wouldn't guess so. The jungle is ripe and alive with detail that immerses you in the environment, and every tree, plant, and cliff face looks so realistic that it's hard to believe it's not actually there. Similarly, the animation on the various denizens of the jungle is pitch-perfect. Bar the necessary animation and humanised facial expressions, each and every animal is created to a photo-realistic level. Whether it's the wolf-cubs, Bagheera, or a small little frog wiping the rain off his face, I wanted to snuggle my face into them all. The various furs and hairs look like you could reach out and touch them. The movements and mannerisms of all the animals are spot on as well, giving them all distinct identities and making the illusion all the harder to disbelieve. If nothing else, The Jungle Book is a triumph of photo-realistic filmmaking.The Jungle Book is unquestionably the best of Disney's live action remakes. While it puts a lot of effort into referencing and recreating its original animated counterpart, it also does a lot to forge its own identity. It holds it's own distinctive soul that sets it apart not only from the slew of other live action properties, but also it's own source material. It looks breathtaking, the casting is perfect, and the music is tastefully used. My only criticism is that the changed ending isn't necessarily changed for the better. A lot of the movie's changes are fantastic, adding depth and a degree of darkness present only in the books, but the ending squanders the solid parable of the original in favour of something muddled and child-friendly, in order to cynically keep the door open for a sequel. I give Jungle Book an enjoyable 7/10.",

To me these are quite different movies and should not really be compared. I have not read the book but I have a feeling that this movie follows the book more closely. It is a wee bit darker, more serious and incredibly beautiful to watch.I quite liked the original jungle book movie. It was one of my favorites when I was a kid. I am therefore quite happy that this was not just a \"dumb\" remake with modern CGI and that I quite liked this take of the classic story. This movie is, as I wrote, much more serious and a wee bit darker. It is less of a children's movie than the original.The wolves are getting much more time in this movie which is good. Mowgli's opponents are also much less comical and much more sinister. Kaa is a beastly snake with no remorse, King Louie is a huge, scheming, and tyrannical ape King and finally Shere Khan is a ruthless, human hating,\u00a0tiger that kills anyone or anything that stands in his way.The CGI is top notch as far as I am concerned. The jungle scenery is absolutely stunning and it is really worth watching the movie just for the scenery. Combined with a classic adventure story that is not half bad makes\u00a0for a\u00a0really a good movie. I was definitely positively surprised by this movie. For me it is a big success.",

            "content": "This is so far shaping up to be a dominant year for the company. First, we got the best animated film ever since Toy Story 3, if not the greatest animated film of all time (I'm talking about Zootopia). Then, in the month of April, (which is a quiet month for the move industry) they release a remake of the Jungle Book. But keep in mind that I have actually never watched any other adaptations of the original book. Not the 1967 cartoon, not the 1994 live action version, or any other than this.Storywise, there hasn't been much changes to the story when you compare it to the 1967 cartoon. It stays faithful to that film, but it isn't a bad thing. It is also very compelling. Having not seen the original 1967 cartoon, (But I however did hear that the story was almost the same after watching this film) I found it mostly unpredictable, and it, without a doubt, wasn't nap time for me unlike others that find it \"Boring\". There isn't a lot of humor, but the humor that was in it was simply hilarious, especially the dialogue. With this compelling story with great action scenes, and funny humor, it sure isn't time to hibernate.The characters in the movie aren't as strong as the story. The characters I like in the movie the most are Baloo, (Who is funny and caring) Bagheera, (who is strict, but caring, and shows it) and Mowgli (who is very brave). As for the rest, the wolves play as the caring guardians of Mowgli, but for King Louie, I have thoughts to share. He's compelling and all, but compared to Shere Khan, he doesn't serve a really big purpose, which is disappointing. Shere Khan is insanely compelling, intimidating, and fierce, which makes him a great villain. But then there's Kaa, who serves a little purpose of telling Mowgli of his orgin, but feels just wasted, since she (yeah she, they got Scarlet Johansson to do the voice) appears just briefly only to do that and try to kill Mowgli. It was just a missed opportunity. But one concern is that the relationship between Mowgli and some of the other characters isn't strong. Like for between Mowgli and Baloo, they don't interact a lot, therefore not building up a big one.The special effects are instantly known to be CGI, but they believable. Like the fur on Baloo is realistic, and the action scenes are intense, but a load of fun to watch. Also, all the actors (like Bill Murray) are well cast and perform well, except for Scarlet Johansson voicing Kaa. We should've gotten a talented voice actor do a unique voice like in the original cartoon, not a very bland black widow voice. Plus (not to be sexist) I find that the change of gender doesn't make any sense, I just don't.So overall, this film is solid. It isn't as good as Zootopia, but I recommend it to Jungle Book fans and even those who haven't watched any adaptation made before this. By the way, there's \"The Bare Neccesities\" in it to, so it can even get nostalgic.",

There are a few scenes. like the herd of elephants, the big phython where you know its special effects, and those scenes are comparable t Avatar standard, the rest... my oh my, breathtaking.The story is of course what the great Rudyard Kipling wrote, but the book focuses on lessons of life, which misses here. This story is according to the book, not much depth in terms of context and I would have given it a 6 as the Jungle Book IS about Life Lessons, but the CGI is so overwhelming, I had to give it a 9The kids will enjoy and the adults will be stunned.

But director jon favreau remade it in a matured way so that adults could also enjoy. First brilliant thing about the 2016 jb is its jaw dropping cgi. Not just the animals even forest is cgi. Another brilliance is neel sethi's performance who is the only human character in the film. He performed wonderfully alone. For the animal characters, legends like ben Kingsley, bill murray, idris elba etc have been cast who perfectly suit their roles. Most of the film have some thrilling adventure.I loved 1967 jungle book too as well as the 2016 one. Both stand on their own as great films.",

It's obvious that the film makers has reflected on how they can renew the story without changing its core too much, and with this they have succeeded. There are plenty of funny moments, exciting moments, sad moments, and so on. And the acting is all around superb, enhanced by some great visual storytelling and advanced computer animation. The animals look like they are speaking and feeling, while still being true to their natural selves.My main objection to this movie is the way the story progresses. It all feels very episodic, where Mowgli is taken to situation to situation, meeting one character, then the next. Facing one problem at the time. Some of these sequences lasts for a very short time, only a couple of minutes, while other lasts for quite a bit longer. I'm sure this was to some extent a problem with previous takes on the story - but somehow I think they masked the seams better in those attempts.An episodic structure doesn't have to be a problem, but to me, it hurt the immersion. It felt like I was going through a checklist of moments from the story (the snake, the bear, the ape) and checking them of as the movie went on, rather than it being a fluid story, where you jump in at the beginning and jump off in the end.",

This time it's live-action - well, it's not a cartoon, but has such great CGI animals you spend most of the time trying to figure out if they might be real! Pretty sure everyone knows the plot - a boy, Mowgli (Sethi) is abandoned in the jungle and raised by wolves/a panther, until a tiger comes to kill him. It's a little longer and darker than the cartoon version, but it does do away with the nasty vultures.It's still a family/kids film at heart, but there's definitely a few scares and proper tiger v bear/panther/wolves fights! Not sure I'd recommend anyone take a child under 8. The film does a great job of bringing the wolves - Raksha (Nyong'o) and Akela (Esposito) as Mowgli's 'mum' & 'dad' - into the story more, as they're his true family. Kingsley as Bagheera the panther is stately and perfectly cast - a great mentor for Mowgli. Like the cartoon, the main gripe I have is: where is this jungle? Africa? We see rhinos, armadillos and buffalo. India? Tigers and monkeys. South America? Panthers and pythons.And then the bear - Baloo (Murray). Either way, Murray has some great lines, but seems a little underutilised... the one big letdown for me was the songs - the 'Bare Necessities' is sung nowhere near as well by Murray, and while Christopher Walken is suited to King Louie, he does a horrible version of 'I Wanna Be Like You'. Regardless, the score is great, the scenery/CGI fantastic, Shere Khan (Elba) us very menacing and Favreau (coming off 'Iron Man 2' and 'Chef') keeps the pace up, while allowing some sentimental moments.",

Young Neel Sethi is amazing, when you think about the fact that he never worked with the \"actual\" characters.And even though you know the story and know what's coming, it was so well done, you looked forward to seeing how it plays out. I loved how they had a couple of shots that duplicated famous shots in the animated version, e.g. when Mowgli and Bagheera are sitting in the tree, and walking in front of the waterfalls.Neel was cute - loved his expressions of surprise, humor etc. Loved the spunkiness and cleverness of the character. (Baby Mowgli Kendrick Reyes was just adorable!) Scarlett Johansson's voice was mesmerizing as Kaa. I liked changing King Louie up with Christopher Walken.

            "content": "It's not quite what you might be hoping for if like me you grew up watching films like the original. I saw the animated film many times as a kid and also seen the 90s film most of you might not have seen or heard of (I barely remember it) but this while somewhat not a musical has more in common with the version they probably knew that most people would have in mind going in. As I will point out later fans of the 1967 film might lose their minds about at a guess 60-70 minutes in (while major spoiler free might want to read that part with caution). So yeah like I said I grew up on Disney films, not seen that many of the live action remakes that seems to keep coming up. I remember watching both 101 Dalmations films, recently got around to seeing Malificient and I guess you could count having seen Tim Burton's take on Alice in Wonderland (although I'm not sure how much those last two count anyway). And now we have The Jungle Book a new and interesting take on the classic story we have come to love since a young age. As someone who watched the 1967 Disney classic so many times growing up I got to admit when the first trailers started popping up online I was concerned about what I was seeing, if anything at times I was fearing the worst. It looked great but at the same time there was something I could not put my finger on that also had me worried about it (with a few notes whistled from the Bare Necessities providing some hope).From the start it hooks you into the world of the jungle the characters live in. The jungle is stunning, beautiful and looks amazing, taking full advantage of the 3D format. The creatures are amazing, and many of your favourite characters are brought to live like never before and truly capture what made them great to begin with. Many of the animals are without a doubt CGI or at least involved it in some ways and it is done so well you don't think too much about it (or at least I didn't). Idris Alba makes for quire the intimidating Sheer Kahan and while when I first saw clips of this version I was on the fence over what I saw Bill Murray nail Baloo. Giving quite the comic relief and entertaining charm that you would hope for in the character, although apparently the Baloo in the original book from what I've heard was very different in terms of mannerisms and behaviour. Christopher Walken while not too bad as King Louie I wasn't really all that keen on to be honest, maybe he had always been that way in the book but he felt misplaced.It sets out to be its own take of the story with some elements added I've not seen done before but there is still moments that definitely proved which sources besides the book inspired this film (part I warned about in the next paragraph).It is not a definitive musical whatsoever but that's not to say there aren't nods to the songs Disney fans know and love. There are lines taken from songs although they are usually spoken, or felt more William Shantered than sung enough to count (although some cast members covered them for the soundtrack). But there was one unexpected highlight which at first led to a nostalgic chuckle. That is until the score turns into a epic sounding rendition of it and you start thinking, are they going to do it? And they do actually do start singing a new rendition and wow actually was one of my favourite parts of the film (nostalgia goggles I guess).It is still very much a family film but in the case of much younger children there may still be scenes early on and towards the end that could be too much for them. They are bound to love some minor characters and it would be hard to imagine that they wouldn't respond to characters like Baloo in a positive way. There was a kind of magic there in 1967 that is still here 49 years later in this version.As much as I want to avoid the term remake in this case since it was based on a book and with the 1967 version only really inspiring parts of there is no denying that it is one of the best remakes I have seen. It has a love for the story and the characters that much is clear and yet it still very much makes it its own. Almost everything that made the 1967 Jungle Book so great is here and it is still what you could hope for from it. But still there is quite the new spin here as well, it stays fairly true to the classic many of us have come to love but they still made it their own. In some ways it wouldn't have felt right to make this version a musical, it was a nice touch to feature nods to songs in the 1967 The Jungle Book film but somehow I didn't give it much thought for the part.So in all this was an enjoyable experience of a film, there was much to enjoy throughout and should win over fans of The Jungle Book and newcomers like. It doesn't change too much unlike some other so called Disney remakes but tells the story like never before and it still works in being the film you could hope for.",

            "content": "As the queue of summer movies line-up, with superhero movie after superhero movie, it's nice to settle in on a traditional story. In this case, a newly animated version of the Disney classic. This is not a live-action version, about 10% of what you see on screen is live action (the boy). With that in mind, I could look past some of the obvious CGI animals and concentrate on the story. Of course, the Rudyard Kipling books are a classic source, so it would take major incompetence to wreck this. Jon Favreau has a spotty record. Cowboys and Aliens was a flawed concept, and Favreau might have been able to see that before making it. On the other hand, Favreau single-handedly launched the modern Marvel Cinematic Universe with remarkable confidence with the original Ironman. But this movie displays something that convinces me that Favreau is more than another Ron Howard. It was the opening sequence that was the first example. Instead of finding moments for CGI, the sequence is hand-held, with a more naturalistic feel with the style and pacing. Also scoring points is the traditional score by John Debney. If people want to complain that this movie is too \"Disney-fied\", well you have to accept the subject matter for what it is. Disney of course has a mixed track record with 'live' action versions of hit classic animated films. I normally don't care, since I elect to preserve my memories of the original movie and not try to be convinced that the remake 'replaces' the classic. 101 Dalmations is one example. Despite the success of that remake, I refused to see something that could not possibly erase my fond childhood memories of the original.This time I was convinced by the superlative reviews that Favreau \"got it right\". Partly what he got right was to not tinker too much with the original material, and allow the Disney manipulation to create the familiar beats. More success by having intelligent dialogue (not talking down to audience), and keep that pacing clicking along. It was very refreshing to not be bludgeoned with too many subplots and too many extended action setpieces. At 105 minutes running time, the audience is let out of the movie early for good behaviour. Solid storytelling goes a long way, and certainly the execution could have been botched, but the original is a classic for good reason. The animal world has it's own reality, and the amount of time spent showing different animals being able to live alongside each other, shows how we humans need to be reminded of that possibility too. I suppose this level of CGI animal creation should be lauded. Some aspects of believable animal fur certainly look better than other past attempts. The mouths of the animals speaking English will probably never look right. Nevertheless, bravo for the large scale attempt at creating a jungle stuffed with all different kinds of animals. With the kinetic photography providing a POV-style glimpse at how such animals race through the branches. The only misstep for me as an adult are the moments where the animals break into song. At that point, the kids are being served directly. Of course, there is a nod for adults when Christopher Walken breaks into song, and thankfully the musical moments don't go over the top either.I think that is the primary lesson to the Hollywood Movie Industry, that blockbusters are not obligated to toss-in massive CGI spectacle setpieces to be popular movies. Solid storytelling is also key, although in this case the source material was already bulletproof.",

The Jungle Book is I think the best I have yet seen in allowing this to happen. It's not so much a matter of thinking \"This is what the world is like\" as it is thinking \"Wouldn't it be nice if the world I live in was more like the one I'm experiencing right now?\". We've seen many 3D movies in the past several years and I think the director here has taken a fresh - and highly effective - approach to using 3D. Until now, most use of 3D has been a continuation of the 50s colored lens fad that threw things at the audience to try to bring the movie out of the screen and into the world of the viewer. The Jungle Book, however, uses the screen as a huge picture window (graphically yet subtly evidenced at times by water or mud splashing onto the \"window\") in order to draw the viewer into the movie rather than force the movie out to the viewer. It worked extremely well and we were truly drawn into this wonderful, beautiful and sometimes dangerous world. And before I go any further I should say a word about the dangerous part. I can sadly not recommend this movie for children under about ten years old because when it goes to the dark side it goes very dark and could easily be the stuff of nightmares for young kids. But I think those about ten or older should be able to handle it.That said, I don't think there's anything I'd change about the movie. The CGI characters were beyond superb, the voice characterizations were perfectly suited to the characters, there was an entertaining mix of humor, adventure and suspense, the scenery was breathtaking, and I cannot imagine a more well done portrayal of Mowgli. My wife spent a good part of the movie misty-eyed because he was nearly a dead ringer for our youngest son at that age.There are many special notes I could make about the film, but a few stand-outs were: *Christopher Walken voicing Louie and singing \"I Want to Be Like You\" nearly stole the entire show. During the end credits Dr. John does a version of \"The Bare Necessities\" and it occurred to me he may have made even a better Louie than Walken, but (sadly) he wouldn't be as big of a draw. *Although we've never been big fans of Bill Murray, he did an excellent job of weaving his unique persona into the Baloo character. *It was wonderful that they didn't clean Mowgli up - throughout the movie he was dirty, crusty, scratched up, bruised, scarred...pretty much how a ten year old would actually be trying to survive in the jungle. *A total and very refreshing absence of bathroom humor - how did they resist the temptation? I don't know - but thank you. *It was interesting to see the elephants completely re-purposed in this version. It added another little dimension to the movie and we though it was a great idea. *It was also interesting to have Kaa reworked from primarily comic relief in the 1967 film to pure silky malevolence in this version. But I guess that's what you get when you take a character voiced by Sterling Holloway and entrust it to the vocal talents of Scarlett Johannson.When the first trailers came out both my wife and I were highly skeptical of the project; there were so many ways they could have completely destroyed a cherished story from our childhood. We were delighted to discover that the film does beautiful justice to the story - and we both suspect that we were actually the target audience for this movie - baby boomers who are now grandparents who can recommend this film to their children and (older) grandchildren. Whether that's the case or not, we're doing exactly that - and also recommending you see it in IMAX 3D...and stay through the credits!P.S. It would be nice if someone at IMDb would remove the early \"review\" of the movie that someone posted merely to launch an anti-Semitic rant.",

She does not allow the existence of human tricks, which will destroy the rules of the forest itself and destroy her balance. Just like our human society, if we want to maintain a society, a country, or a family well, we must avoid the influence of external factors as much as possible, and not let foreign objects destroy the balance here.\nThere are different animal characters in the film, including evil tigers, greedy macaques, kind wolf packs, stable black panthers, and lazy but brainless bears. The shaping of these characters has a certain concept of breaking the convention, but it also shows the personality of various people in this era.\nNot only that, the description of the red flower in the film is also unique, but it also warns the world to protect the environment. The red flower can bring warmth and hope to people, and it can also bring silence and despair to the world.\nSimilarly, the existence of each race has its indispensable family rules and beliefs. Just like the wolves, they always keep in mind their own family rules and beliefs. In the film, there are many scenes of chanting family rules. This also illustrates the lack and pursuit of faith in contemporary society. It is also a warning to the world in the film.\nThis movie is very good, whether it is from the development of the plot or the creation of characters, it is reasonable and prudent, the logic is rigorous, and it has a vigilant value. It is still an excellent fairy tale and an excellent film work.",

The fact that he met with the bear, he was kidnapped by monkeys. It made the impression that the subject of 2-3 films was processed in a film.\nI would have expected Mowgli to get more injuries in these adventures visible swelling at least in a few places, especially when bees sting.The film was a beautiful quality that can be watched repeatedly I would like to see the second movie.",

Think of original stuff. Movies like \"Zootopia\" and \"Wreck-it Ralph\" prove you can if you just try hard enough.) However, it was the cast list that sold me on the movie. Everyone is perfectly cast. Bill Murray sounds just like Baloo when he speaks. (But not so much when he sings. When he sang it sounded too much like Louis Armstrong. It was way too throaty, and felt forced and out of place.) Idris Elba as Shere Khan was an absolutely perfect choice! Every time he spoke it was terrifying and sent shivers down my spine. The CGI blends with the live-action perfectly! Not once did it look fake. I forgot it was CGI. It's the most realistic CGI I've ever seen! I'm glad this wasn't just a retelling of the animated version. It's actually original. The only times I was reminded it was a remake of the Disney version was during the songs, and even then, the remakes of the songs were fantastic! It is a bit darker than the Disney version, so I would advise not to take a little kid to this. It really earns the PG rating. My one complaint plot-wise was the idea that \"man is bad.\" I'm so sick of Hollywood pushing this agenda with films like \"Avatar,\" \"The Lorax\", and \"Rio 2.\" It's absolutely stupid and was certainly not needed here. I agree with the message that it's important to respect nature, but stop beating us over the head with it.Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",

Idris Elba does a splendid job playing the villain shere khan the Bengal tiger who wants revenge against the protagonist mogwli for his disfigurement.

Very few things don't work here.Essentially, the culmination / the showdown with Shere-Khan doesn't work well. The idea is clear, but somehow it's not on par with the rest of the movie. Other stuff that doesn't work also doesn't have nearly as much impact.So, sing along the classic \"Bare (or is it Bear) Necessities\" with Bill Murray - he doesn't do it very well, but that's kind of the idea, you can do just as bad a job, but you can enjoy doing it.",

In short Jungle Book was just pure fun. The film was a visual spectacle, with some breath taking visuals of a jungle that never looked so beautiful ( waterfalls,landscape etc), the animals though done mostly through VFX/CGI looked extremely real, there attention to detail was amazing. The films tempo was perfect, and even though a predictable tale of a child/man not welcome in the jungle anymore because of a fear from a tiger was being told, one was never bored, this is because the adventures never end in the film. There is always action, adventure, and laughter in abundance. Its a film that not only the kids, but adults will lap also. The main character Mowgali was portrayed but the child actor Neel Seethi, who was fabulous, the time he put into the role can be seen on the screen beautifully, all the tree climbing etc was done like a pro. Hats off kid. All the voice dubbing was great but, Bill Murray as Baloo, and Ben Kingsley as Bagheera were at a another level of perfection. The only problem I had with the film was the predictability and clich\u00e9d manner of the plot but its a Disney film so that real isn't a issue. Though I really enjoyed the whole monkey temple, and wild flower aspect in the film, it was a novel good idea.Overall The Jungle Book is great fun for everyone in the family, its a film worth watching because it lets the inner child of all unleash regardless of any age.3.75/5* Grade: 78% B+",

            "content": "Had the pleasure of watching the film on the opening night. The Jungle Book action live adaptation was shot brilliantly. I can honestly say that this film was beautifully shot. Jon Favreau is becoming one of my favorite directors real quick. From the opening shot of Mowgli running through the jungle, to Baloo tricking and sitting and being Lazy. One of the best thing in the original cartoon made in 1967 and in this film 2016. nearly 40 years in the making and this is one of the best Adaptation you will ever see in your life time.Story of this film, is very much like the original 1967 film. A child is found in the jungle by Bagheera (black panther) and is given to a pack of wolves to be raised as man cub. While he grows up, Shere Khan comes back to the jungle and reminds all the animals that men is responsible for the burning flower. He promises that he will kill Mowgli and will not spare any one who gets in his way. The coolest tribute and majestic aspect of the film, is how they portrayed the Elephants. They were the proud and the holy animals of jungle, whose presence bought joy and meaning to life, as well as the understanding of the jungle law. As mentioned in my first paragraph Baloo was one of the best and most enjoyable features of the film, from the way he was introduced into the film, to his tricks and his deception of Mowgli, to the amazing and courage's battle against Shere Khan, and lets not forget every one's favorite song \"Bear necessitates\". Paid so much tribute to the original film with all of the same montage scenes, makes one remember and re-live the moments of the classical film. The ending was very true it's source material and for me lacked a little bit of emotion, don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the ending, but was hoping for a more of real approach to it. A bear, panther and pack of wolves couldn't beat one tiger. Apart from that I can really honestly say that i enjoyed every minute.Acting, the actor who played Mowgli, Neel Sethi was amazing. Neel showed a range of emotions and incredible focus considering all of his co-stars were CGI. his ability to speak with wolves and then interacting with Baloo was really on high professional level. Bill Murray did an absolutely great job as the super lazy bear, Baloo. Oh, and before I forget what a pleasure it was to hear Christopher Walken sing in the jungle book as King Louie, was also one of my favorite moments. I can not say, that there was any actors that I didn't like or found that they bought the film down, my only issue would be that Scarlett Johansson didn't really feel like Kaa, maybe cause I was still expecting to hear Winnie the Pooh voice.Overall this was a brilliant film, exceptionally well directed, really great performance from a child actor, and brilliant job by all of the voice actors. The story was and will always be a true classic.Hope you guys get to enjoy it too.",

            "content": "I didn't think a big-budget, CGI-heavy adaptation of The Jungle Book would work. I'm a huge fan of the 1967 animated classic, and it seemed blasphemous to me to try and remake that in big Hollywood fashion.But I was wrong.While it's not quite better than the 1967 Jungle Book, this 2016 edition is still fantastic. It's a lot of fun to watch, it departs from the previous films by telling the same story in a new way, it has a very strong tone, the performances are very good, the directing is great and the visual effects are absolutely mind- blowing.The visuals will be the one thing that you really take away from this movie, because they might just be the best we've ever seen in cinema history. Avatar, Gravity, Interstellar are all astonishing, but The Jungle Book goes one step higher by being so realistic and so visually perfect.The fact that this film was entirely shot in a studio is staggering. The scenery is one hundred percent photo-realistic, and it makes for a massively impressive watch, but the CGI of the animals is the real leap forward that makes this such a visual masterpiece. Every single animal we see in this movie is completely CGI, but they all look totally real, and if they weren't talking, you'd be hard pressed to find anything that takes away from the reality of the jungle wildlife.That's the most impressive thing about this film by far, and it was continuously stunning me from beginning to end, and so that's some huge praise that Disney deserve for making a CGI version of this story look so beautiful.Often, these sorts of visual extravaganzas can let you down when it comes to the actual substance of the movie, but The Jungle Book excels in that area too.What's most impressive in that respect is the way that it uses its darker, more serious tone to its advantage. It's not a dreary, dark Disney remake like Maleficent, but instead a film that feels like a proper drama, and uses the serious tone to make a genuinely exciting, and often genuinely terrifying film, and it was fantastic to see that pulled off so well.I also liked the fact that this movie did the real job of a remake properly. It's not a copy-paste production, but instead uses elements from the previous films, but tells the same story in a completely different way. The majority of this movie strays very far from the 1967 adaptation, but it works so well, because it feels like a completely new and worthy film. It's not a pointless and vacant cash-grab, Disney actually tried to do something bold and different with The Jungle Book, and it worked out brilliantly.The other great thing about this movie is the performances. Neel Sethi, in his first film, is great, considering that he's the only real thing in the entire film, and is constantly working with CGI. Meanwhile, Bill Murray is perfect as Baloo, Ben Kingsley is great as Bagheera, and Idris Elba is brilliantly menacing as Shere Khan, making the tiger so much more threatening and properly scary than we've ever felt before.However, there is one issue with this movie that I couldn't ignore. Sometimes, the tone doesn't quite hold up in some of the callbacks to the original Disney movie. Baloo and Mowgli sing The Bear Necessities, and that's okay, but King Louie's rendition of I Wanna Be Like You, as well as Kaa's brief appearance, are unnecessary and jarring, and that was disappointing to see.Overall, however, I really liked this movie, and it flew by in a flash. With absolutely astonishing visual effects, great acting, a new take on the classic story and an effective darker tone, this is a fantastic watch.",

It is a story lot of us grew up on (I might be an exception) and there is a conceptuality and a vivid idea of all the characters already in the audience minds. For a director who is used to slick futuristic graphics and explosions (apart from the tasteful 'Chef' (pun unintended)), to do a re-telling of this simple yet fascinating story requires revisiting his aesthetics and skill-set - and Favreau does a fantastic job in both. While the motion capture is of top grade and the voice is lent by the best that Hollywood can offer, the one character that binds them all that can make or break the audience connect is Mowgli - take a bow Neel Sethi, a show-stopping performance!! Instantly likable, easily grows on you and makes you empathize with each of his emotions.Mowgli (Neel Sethi) as a toddler gets stranded in the forest and found by Bagheera a panther (voice by Ben Kingsley) who takes him to Raksha a female wolf (voice by Lupita Nyong'o) to take care of the boy as her own. While Mowgli tries to adapt and learn the ways of the wolves, he brings more to the equation using his unique human capabilities. While battling a dry season, a water truce is called during which Shere Khan a tiger (voice by Idris Elba) warns the wolf pack to deliver Mowgli to him as he has an unsettled score with humans. For the safety of the wolves, Mowgli decides to leave the jungle and Bagheera accompanies him on his journey. Rest of the story is his adventures along the way as he meets different characters - Kaa a python (voice by Scarlett Johansson), Baloo a sloth bear (voice by Bill Murray) and King Louie a Gigantopithecus (voice by Christopher Walken), each of them having varying interests towards him.Presentation: The visual effects were so good that it is very difficult to differentiate between real and motion capture and that gives a sense of realistic effect to this fantasy. Performances: While Neel Sethi steals the show as the adorable Mowgli, the voice performances cannot be under-looked - especially the captivating Kaa, the funny bones Baloo or the terrorizing Shere Khan. Screenplay & Editing: The brisk pace sets the ball rolling from the very first frame - quickly introducing the characters, presenting the conflict points etc. But the pace considerably slows down in the pre-climax at the end of King Louie episode before it picks up for a showdown.Familiar story & characters doesn't come in the way of this beautiful re-telling and packs a few surprises too",

The level of detail & lifelike motions of its lush forests & characters are achievements on their own, as exceptional, authentic & often times intimidating beauty are rendered.

There is then no dull moment, as there is excitement to be found in every interaction, with nostalgic musical numbers to boot.Overall, this gem that is the Jungle Book brings to life the wonder Disney's stories are known for.

However, in this case, there is absolutely no other human being other than Mowgli, and this makes his performance all the more exceptional. Adding to that, this is his first movie, and for such a young and (mostly) inexperienced child actor, he does an amazing job. His innocence shines through, and though a little awkward at times, he delivers his lines well. The other voice actors did a great job with their characters too. I especially liked Murray, Kingsley, and Elba's performance. They really embodied and contributed convincingly in portraying their characters. Basically, everyone did a great job.The main props goes to the visual effects department for being able to create such real, and detailed images of the jungle and the animals in it. The colour on screen is so vivid and make landscapes great to look at. However, there are some instances during action scenes where the point of view shot moves too much. Though I guess it could actually be a camera that films Mowgli, the constant switching and shaking of the camera is too much. While the story was interesting (though not sure if it followed the older version), the names and obvious accents of some characters make me question what the film is trying to suggest to audiences. Also, only Sethi is of Indian descent, and the rest of the cast is not, which isn't uncommon for Hollywood, but the film is (I'm guessing) based in an Indian jungle. Therefore, should have a majority of an Indian cast, if not, change the name of the animals. Overall, this was an engaging and visually stunning film depicting the moral of being true to oneself.",

It was very believable that the voices came out of the animal's mouth to top that off the casting for the voices was stellar too. Personally the highlight performances of the voice acting was from Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray, Idris Elba and Christopher Walken. Now that's quite a long list because all the performances were quite amazing and on-point. Idris Elba's Shere Khan had such a great menacing voice that absolutely sold his character of a villain but the character of Shere Khan also had a very reasonable backstory, it was clear why he resented Mowgli as a human and his fear and hatred towards humans. Ben Kingsley and Bill Murray as Bagheera and Baloo had great voices too, Bagheera as the voice of reasoning and Baloo more like the \"fun\" uncle. The relationship between Mowgli and Bagheera had and gave well developed backstory and painted a clear picture of the setting . While Baloo and Mowgli's interactions were plain fun and made it possible for us to hear Bill Murray sing \"Bear necessities.\" Now, Christopher Walken's King Louie was very interesting. That whole scene with the apes running around and Louie on his throne was not only as close to the jungle as possible with all sorts of shrieks. But was also a thought provoking one, what Louie said about power and such was quite a strong and powerful message.The whole film was shot entirely in a warehouse, which is really an accomplishment if you think about it, considering the fact that nothing really at all of the movie shows any trace of civilization, quite interesting. It transcends a classic Disney tale into a film of such grand spectacle. As Disney has been succeeding most recently this one not only succeeds but is probably the best one yet.",

            "review_title": "\"Disney Gives a Film of Good Taste, Style and Joy, But the Idea Lacks Own Originality\"",
            "content": "Favreau is the director of the umpteenth installment of the classic, this time with CGI special effects and an unusual vocal group.Once more, the adventures of Mowgli in Indian jungles written by the young Rudyard Kipling are adapted by Disney under leadership of Favreau with a significantly attractive result. Together with visual quality, the vocal team is exceptional, these qualities can overshadow the theme background and development of the plot without purpose that accompanies the film during its progress. Summarizing the results of previous deliveries of the \"The Jungle Book\" around the world, it can be affirmed the support of audience with animals of the jungle, and it seems that this will not be the exception, because its previous evidence.It's important to remember that this will not be a of the last times we listen to Kipling animals in the cinematography, since the production company Warner Bros will finance \"Jungle Book: Origins\" under the direction of Serkis and will be full of stars like Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Benedict Cumberbatch and Serkis himself as Baloo the bear ( itself delayed lately by the producer until 2018, apparently due to lack of time for proper development by the \"ambition\" of the project).From the unforgettable opening scene of the old style of the castle of Disney where then the camera opens road between branches of fruitful trees of the jungle, start something that seems to be a chase human against animal, from that moment ,the realism (excellently illustrated 3D) pervades to perfection in an image that appears in pure manner. It is characteristic of Disney products resume in the form of remake or remastering classics already enshrined in the minds of adults. This strategy, beyond of reborn a memorable story, its second intention is to generate more money, due to which stimulate both the minds of adults and infants who are anxious to be dazzled with the film itself.I think if the film was dumb would be spectacular, but the eccentric accompanied by Ben Kingsley or Scarlett Johansson is converted in which could be a more masterpiece for its financier. Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is an Indian boy who grew up in the jungle pleasures along with a pack of wolves. After an unexpected enemy re-appeared in animal life, the boy must embark on a sea of adventures and dangers, where he will find a spiteful tiger (I.Elba), a betray snake (Scarlett Johansson) or an unconditional \"lazy\" bear (Bill Murray) to discover his true family (he ultimately finds it).Justin Marks' script tends to stumble and ago decline the continuous progress that the film presents. The dialogs are well executed, what it feels like to loose and inconsistent is the intent of the story, (spoiler) the guy is fired from the herd to go to where he truly belongs, but suddenly he's fighting with a tiger face to face for save the animals of the jungle, summarize the aspects of the plot are feel superfluous.Disney never ceases to die one of its characteristic hallmarks, humor. Each film should have its load identifiable humor. After a slightly dark and dramatic tone in the opening, at the time that Baloo (Bill Murray) appears everything changes. Remarkable is the effort of each line written to the bear, where half of that dialogue has a load of humor. And speaking of Baloo, the homage made by Murray to recreate the 1967 song is really emotional.Even more admirable is the delicate and precise design of the grotesquely beautiful animals, it is a disproportionate beauty, it's a beauty that stands out, it's a natural beauty, this is truly an animal beauty.A tiger majestically managed and drawn that looks real. An extremely large snake, where each flake has a pinch real. A giant orangutan in a forgotten temple , accompanied by several monkeys shows the fear and respect for the King of the jungle. A Black Panther give fear or a bear that has no words of description. All this is highlighted and praised as with a magnifying glass with IMAX 3D.All this cinematic perfection is weakened once more by an end of fairy tales. I think that for be a product of Disney must not have a happy ending or at least repetitive end of death of the villain in all of its films. But well, we all knew it was going to be, after all this is an adaptationAs well as his script and plot are increasingly more monotonous, the audio-visual quality of the project is very promising and exceeds limits of what has been done so far in this type of real action products.Favreau and Pope produce a sumptuous and delicate visual experience that brings the best of CGI technology in a movie where the animals are the main feature. Interesting and realistic, Jon's work exceeds the requirements of the tape, but the tape itself is carried to the monotonous and incomprehensible. Again, Disney takes advantage of this move, while Warner Bros. and Andy Serkis are adjusting pants to try to overcome its main competitor. Warner'll let us dumbfounded. I'm sure.",

Throughout the film we are drawn to follow the adventures of Mowgli and his friends. We are also entertained by the singing between Mowgli and Baloo. It wouldn't be Disney if it didn't bring this movie so much fun. The Jungle Book has plots of lightly carried and exciting stories. The film has a cheerful tone and entertaining nuances. If you look at Disney's live-action movies so far, it looks like The Jungle Book has no change from the original story (I haven't finished seeing the cartoon version myself). The Jungle Book has stunning visuals. It can be seen from the depiction of the forest that is so shady and detailed, the model of the temple building that looks magnificent and seems ancient, and the shape of the animals that also looks detailed. The Jungle Book is a nostalgic film with a live-action format full of fun adventures.Actor Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, performed well even though during filming he had to compete with dolls and CGI effects. In addition, Neel Sethi also has a cute and adorable stature. In addition, the film features a lineup of voice actors no less interesting. There are many big stars in it and have a sound that fits the animal it plays.",

            "content": "Sher Khan is bad-ass. It is important to get your main villain right, and this film gets its villain right. I want to see the movie again just for his scenes. It is unfortunate that I cannot say the same for everyone. Out of the good characters only Balou is fun. Kaa, played very seductively by Scarlett Johansson, only shows up for one fairly short scene. King Louie, our good old mafia boss, was pretty cool, but he is also not around for long enough. The kid himself was a little annoying, due to no fault of his own. He was asked to sell your typical movie dialogue but he was like 12 at the time, so what do you expect? Under the circumstances, he did very well. The other characters are just kind of...standard. It seems that, apart from Balou, all the fun characters are villains and they get far less screen time than the boring good guys. I suppose it's that ancient curse of boredom that most heroes have to bear.The CG effects are as good as was rumoured. I would not call Bagheera photo-realistic but the modern lighting engine definitely does its job, creating realistic sunlight and night time. However, it is interesting to remember just how much criticism the world has given the Star Wars prequels for having too much CG content. And indeed, if you were to watch one of those movies now, you could see how badly they aged. This is because the human eye adjusts itself as the 3D technology gets better, and the effects that looked awesome just 5 years ago, now look obviously fake. Jungle Book is nothing but CG and yet its effects are currently being praised by the public. Obviously, the difference between the Star Wars prequels and Jungle Book is that in Jungle Book the other aspects of the film are actually good, but I wonder what the people will think about this movie 20 years from now. The reality is probably that it is not meant to last that long and that it will be remade by then. And that brings me to the somewhat sad conclusion.This film has no lasting power. The Disney animated version from 1967 does, as I still remember it fondly after all these years and I can watch it again today and enjoy it just as much as I did back then, but this new realistic portrayal will not remain in memory for long because nothing besides the graphics and Sher Khan stands out, and the graphics will lose their appeal with time. Having said that, it is still an entertaining and well-executed movie that is well worth watching now.",

The second reason is the reason of everybody, that's the powerful use of visual treatment. Hollywood movies, as we knew are the great treasures of visual beauty and colorful treatment. But Jungle Book is far apart from those kind colorful productions from the early masterpieces like Matrix, Avatar and many more. It is something a vivid way of representation of the new technique collectively known as vfx or Visual Effects. I'm stunned with the maximum utilization of that technique to the utmost and I just went into the forest along with Mowgli (like another man-cab). It's been something a film not about the new technique which is used (as far as concern it is an old technique according to Hollywood movies) it sustain here, in my mind cause of the apt and correct use of visual effects and make the movie live to the audience. Apart from my applause to the Animation films ( because this is something closely connected to Animation films) it is a great and enormous visual treatment to any kind of film lovers (People who love any kind of films not concerning which genre it is).",

Bhaloo was the funniest of all with his punch dialogues and laziness. Om Puri's crackling voice as Bhageera strikes a chord with the ordinance and Priyanka's enchanting voice right in the middle of the dense forest came out quiet of a surprise. The various accents and slang makes watching the movie in Hindi better than the English version of it. The movie is fast paced, thrilling and keeps you tightly seated till the end.

At the same time though, I think it is a above average movie, and I would recommend checking it out. I loved the beauty and cinematography in this movie. It was filmed amazingly and every shot had me glued to the screen. The chemistry between Baloo and Moglie was great as well. Bill Murray kills it as Baloo and shows that the studio could've never found a better choice. That is most of the praise I will give to the film because some stuff such as the first 20 min feeling really boring and dull. Later in the film they're two musical numbers which one of them fits with the tone but the other feels like it came out of nowhere.

And from there on begins the adventure with peril, but also excitement along the way. As far as the on screen talent goes, Neel Sethi delivers a very serviceable performance as Mowgli with Bill Murray and Ben Kingsley being standouts in the voice-over for Baloo And Bagheera respectively. Idris Elba also excelled as Shere Khan, a role very much suited for his voice type.

            "content": "I want to put it out there right now, that I have not read Rudyard Kipling's \"The Jungle Book.\" I have started reading it, but let's just say I'm reviewing this film as a stand alone movie, as well as a remake of the 1967 Disney film.I was worried about the impending \"Jungle Book\" remake. I loved the Disney version of \"The Jungle Book\" growing up. Adored it, even. It was one of those videos I used watch over and over again. I had grown up with the '90s remakes \"Homeward Bound\" and \"The Parent Trap,\" without having seen the originals. I had no baggage. \"The Jungle Book\" is a childhood favourite that I don't want decimated. So I was against it, until I saw the teaser trailer. Damn, this film looked awesome. They took my childhood and gave it balls. Then the official trailer came out. Then the movie premiered and was given tons of praise.I was really excited, now! So, I just came back from seeing \"The Jungle Book,\" and, let me tell you, it didn't disappoint. This is a gorgeous, well acted film with plenty of tension and fun. The CGI is the best I've seen since \"Life of Pi,\" even the backgrounds and jungle look real. The music is fantastic; they implement the Overture from the 1967 film, which was a nice surprise, but the new score, with the original theme and \"Bear Necessities\" seamlessly interwoven with the new score by John Debny, it truly is a lovely soundtrack. I'm glad it isn't a traditional musical, as I don't think it was meant to be. Yes, they sang \"Bear Necessities,\" but it wasn't as such a musical number as just a little sing song with a friend. I was disappointed with how they handled \"I Wan'na Be Like You;\" Walken sings it well, and I like how it was spoken at first, that was good! The thing is, the song is one of those you can't help but stand up and dance along to, while King Louie, in this film just... sits there. Hahaha, NO. Not this song. It's much better just hearing Walken singing it over the credits. Also, why mention that Louie is a Gigantopithecus in the song? Mr Sherman, explain? Honestly though, that's my only problem with \"The Jungle Book.\" I wrote this assuming you all know the story, of the 1967 film, at least. Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is a man-cub who was left abandoned in the jungle. A panther named Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) brings him to the Seonee wolf pack, who, along with Bagheera, raise the \"man-cub.\" Ten years pass, when Shere Khan (Idris Edlba) comes to kill the boy, for he hates man, after Mowgli's own father maimed him with Man's Red Flower. With his beloved pack under threat, Mowgli, much to his dismay of mother-wolf, Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o), decides that it's better to leave. Bagheera then proceeds to take him to the man-village, much to Mowgli's chagrin; he thought he'd be staying with different animals. Along the way, the pair get separated, and Mowgli runs into many different animals, from Kaa the python (Scarlett Johansson), a sloth bear named Baloo (Bill Murray) and many other jungle creatures, including the aforementioned King Louie. All the while, Shere Khan is waiting for Mowgli to hear that he has killed pack leader, Akela (Giancarlo Esposito), so that he'll come back to seek revenge, and face the tiger head on.As I said above, the anmation is fantastic. It's clear that they studied the anatomy and behaviour of the animals closely, and the new software developed for \"Zootropolis\" (which I'm guessing they used here) was certainly worth all that time and effort. The fur, muscles and eyes of these creatures, they way they move and how they sound, it's just a wonder. They look, sound and move just like the real thing. I especially like the details on the wolves, the matted fur on Shere Khan and Louie, and the pattern on Bagheera's fur. Also, Baloo is so fluffy I want to hug him. The actors are well cast in their roles, and all do a grand job at bringing old favourites back to life (I quite like the more snarky Baloo, here, even though I'll always love Harris's version of Ol' Papa Bear). I like how Raksha has more of a role here, and Nyong'o does a wonderful job voicing her. I could feel these animals emotions, especially on Raksha and Grey, and there's a moment where Bagheera's ears go back when Mowgli berates him for not telling him of Akela's death. These are subtle things, but noticeable. Yes, Disney managed to make CGI photorealistic animals be relatable. I never thought I'd see the day.What a fantastic film. It's a visual delight, an aural wonder. The acting (especially Neel Sethi, who is fantastic as Mowgli) and technology, the little throwbacks to the original movie, the pure balls the filmmakers have to make it bigger and darker. By the way, the ending is different to the '67 film, and I honsestly think it fits much better. Dare I say it, the film may be overall better than the original. Go and see it.",

It's visually astonishing with the worlds and animals (a well-deserved Oscar win for the Visual Effects), that you'll really feel immersed into it. The animals are all played well by A-list performers. Sir Ben Kingsley plays Bagheera with genuine authority and conviction, Bill Murray plays the old lethargic slacker to perfection, Lupita N'yongo plays the motherly role of Raksha like any real mother should, and Idris Elba makes Shere Khan really feel like a genuine threat when you detect every ounce of vengeance and malice in his voice. I'm really grateful they included the two most memorable songs from the cartoon as well and hard to believe that Bill Murray would actually sing \"The Bear Necessities\".

While it is said to be live action 95% of the film is CGI with Mowgli being the only sizable live action part of the film. However don't let this sway you as the animation in this film is some of the best I've ever seen. When I was watching this at the theater I was wondering whether a few of the scenes were CGI but I still thought the majority of it was real due to how beautifully made these jungle backgrounds were created. In particular a very small and uneventful part of the film that showcases the films animation talents was a part in the film where Mowgli uses a sharp rock to cut down a vine. This doesn't sound like much however the way that the animators showed this absolutely blew me away. If you were to look at this film without knowing it was CGI there is a high chance you will think besides the animals the whole film is in Live action.So far not many films have managed to animate life like talking animals due to them looking corny and unnatural. However the way that the animals mouths moved was done perfectly and I would say the best that I've ever seen in any film. The voice acting that matched these mouths however was absolutely outstanding. Bill Murrays performance as Baloo would be up there with Robin Williams role of the genie from Aladdin as his voice fit the character so well. The casting director of this film deserves the biggest pat on the back as not one of the characters were voiced poorly.Despite having so many great things about this film there was one thing that I didn't like. The main thing for me was the music. The original jungle book film is famous for its songs and is one of the main reasons everyone loves it so much. In this film I feel like they only put the songs that they put in for nostalgia. There were only two songs during the film and they felt very out of place as they didn't have that groove that the original jungle book had. I think that Favreau should have chosen to either go full on with the songs and included more songs and put more effort into them or had no songs at all. Another thing about this film that isn't necessarily a bad thing but kept me away from the actual movie was King Louie. I can't quite decide whether I liked him or not. The main thing that made me doubt his character in this film was his size. I can understand him being a little bigger than the average orangutan but he quite ridiculous in this. He's over double the size of Baloo and it makes the film seem less real which is what makes the film so unique and special. However despite the size of King Louis I think that the scene that he was in was one of the best in the whole film and Christopher Walkens voice acting was amazing.Overall I think this is without a doubt one of the best movies of the year so far and is a huge landmark for Disney and cinema in general and feel like this movie will be one that people will be talking about for a long time.",

            "content": "What I really enjoyed about this is take is that it's story is close to both the novel and animated film, but it's updated with a slight darker tone and fixing the minor flaws that the animated version had missed in it's time. The characters are all well written and develop throughout the film, giving them personality, purpose and relation to the themes of the story and writer Justin Marks does a worthy job of updating and respecting the original key sources for today's standards. The casting of the animal characters is truly a strong point, the casting of such talents as Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Scarlett Johansson and Christopher Walken is the best factor of the film. Elba in particular gives a great but fearful performance as Shere Khan that can be considered as a contender for this year's best movie villain and overthrows Another strong point for TJB was its highly detailed and state of the art CGI effects and animation for the animals and the landscape of the film (most of the film had used blue screen with a standalone actor whom in which as the leading character Mowgli). This was achieved by Moving Picture Company (MPC) and Weta Digital whom had created the film's visual effects that reaches up to the outstanding quality of Life of Pi, Gravity and Avatar's visual effects. It's certain that TJB could be a contender in next year's movie awards season in terms for visual effects, script work, direction and music.Overall, The Jungle Book is a visual sight for the eyes and a nostalgic tribute to its original works that has succeeded well in the box office and audience reception (including the critics) that is well worth seeing for today's price of a ticket. Whether you have or haven't seen the original, go see it and be amazed by its quality work.4/5 \u2013 Nick With Disney Movies they are either really bad or really good. This one, I am happy to say is really good! It's been 50 years since the original Jungle Book movie came out, and you would think you would have forgotten about it, and this movie makes sure you never forget the old classic, by renewing the classic. The more good news is it's better than the old one, but in different ways. The plot is exactly the same as the old one, so I don't see the significance in doing into the plot.The acting is top notch, both by the voice actors and by Neel Sethi (who plays Mowgli). Neel Sethi is a great actor and I have no doubt he will become very famous in the future in Hollywood. Ben Kingsley (who plays Bagheera) plays him brilliantly. He's tough, firm, down to earth, but all heart. Bill Murray plays Baloo, and he was also perfect. It's like he was born to play this role. His comedic timing was perfect. Idris Elba who plays the evil tiger Shere Khan is also perfect. His voice was so nasty you can't help but to fear him. He is fiercer than the original Shere Khan. Christopher Walken plays King Louie. I was really worried about him playing in this role at first, despite the fact he is my favorite actor. I really thought he could not pull this off, but he certainly did. He comes across as a very intimidating Godfather, king of the jungle type character and he pulls it greatly. He also is quite intimidating and creepy as King Louie. Perfect choice. Scarlett Johansson who plays Kaa the snake was really good, but was only in it for 5 mins, which is quite disappointing. But her voice really suited the character.So many people say it isn't hard to do behind the scenes voice acting, but all of these actors really got to know these characters and brought them to life and into our hearts and imagination. The digital and CGI effects are breathtaking to say the least. You really believe you are in the jungle at all times! The sound was okay, but off at times, and there was a lot of emotion in this film that was truly breathtaking in parts.But by the end you don't really get the best movie ever vibe, but you do leave the theater with a smile and thinking to yourself what a great movie that was! If you are a fan of the original and you have kids, chances are you should see this. You won't be disappointed.4/5 - Jay",

            "content": "Simply put, I loved this version of The Jungle Book.Why'd I love it? Allow me to tell you.The casting was absolutely perfect. Idris Elba was a terrifyingly good Shere Khan. Every time Shere Khan was on-screen, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Bill Murray as Baloo - one of the greatest decisions ever made. Ben Kingsley, in typical Ben Kingsley fashion, made everything that Bagheera said and did regal and dignified. Christopher Walken surprised me with his spot-on King Louie, and I was also pleasantly surprised at the gender change in the seductive Kaa (played by an equally seductive Scarlett Johanssen). And Neel Sethi (whom I hadn't seen in anything prior to this) - I don't know if I have the words for just how impressed I was with his portrayal of Mowgli.It was also visually stunning - the way that it was filmed at times made me feel like I was actually there, running with Mowgli and his friends and family. I was surprised to learn that most of it was filmed in a studio set, and that the rest was basically CGI. It's amazing what they're able to do with technology.Unlike its 1967 cartoon namesake, this Jungle Book was a bit more dangerous and edgy. We keenly sense the danger that Mowgli is in as Shere Khan makes threats against him, and we realize that there is really no one that can completely protect him from that threat. And so begins Mowgli's journey; it starts out as a trek to move far away from the danger he's placed in, but ends as a journey of self-discovery.I thought it was a nice twist that the end of the movie saw Mowgli, not being led away by a little girl from the man-village, but once again becoming part of the only home he has ever known - the jungle. All in all, it was a fantastic movie, a wonderful throwback to my childhood and an enjoyable gem in my adulthood. :)",

I would rather say Yes but in parts, The factor of emotion and feelings that arises between Mowgli- Bagheera and when Mowgli gets separated from Baloo seems to the highly underplayed. (Avoiding wasting time on emotions is one such Disney things huh? ) With the VFX, the film goes to the whole new level and that's the biggest plus for the film to be enjoyed in theater with your family.And Yeah, Bill Murray's dubbing for Baloo was one such awesome things that could have happened to this film.",

Its not every time one see a child going so well in a role. Very well directed? Maybe. But that just increases this movie quality. The feelings, the face expressions, the body language, is all there. I cannot say precisely what is CGI with Mowgli and what it's not. I guess all is CGI for sure but the beauty of it is... No one notices! Isn't that what makes the better movies?Urray for Bill Murray! He also nails it. Like usual... Lets admit it. He just fits well in this and his ways actually improves his character, thanks to the sarcastic humorous thing he does so well for so long.To be nitpicking there was just one little tiny personal think I felt to be out of place: King Louis's voice. It kinda made me loose interest in the story... Maybe he should have been the snake!Any way, its a very well done film, with a plot that actually develops well and the most agreeable thing is... it differs slyly from most of Hollywood animation story telling. If one goes and see it with a child just has to make sure the kid can take it. This is a movie with talking animals, with action and fight scenes. Not extremely violent but the danger is felted and insinuated by bushes moving, mystery, worried animals... A very small child can feel troubled by the natural/quite unnatural laws of the jungle. I'll say... not under 6, at least.Oh, and stay for the credits. Stay!!",

Ben Kingsley did a great job as bagheera.Neel sethi as mowgli was OK..not too bad. Though the main highlight of the acting for me was bill murray as baloo. He did baloo justice. The main thing about this movie was its special effects. GOD THE SPECIAL EFFECTS......The jungle looked so real. the details on all the animals were amazing. After watching the movie i understand why it need 175 million dollars. Nothing i can say about the story because it is a adaptation of a book. But overall this movie was pretty entertaining.

            "content": "The classic returns back to take you on a nostalgic ride. A movie for adults to travel back in time and cherish their childish days.The plot needs no introduction since this is a reinvention of the same old Kipling's tale. But thought to give you a quick snapshot for those who forgot the actual one. A boy raised in the jungle as a man cub amongst the wolf's pack faces threat of his life by an elderly cruel Tiger (Shere khan) and has to leave his only known home. He embarks on a journey and comes across lots of obstacles in fact escapes from being a prey for many ruthless roaring creatures. Finally gets the courage to go back and face the ultimate Tiger Shere Khan and kills him. I liked the whole creation for the fact that there were no add ups done to the original script and it was just left the way it was in the classic animation in 1967. It is a flawless and unmarred remake. So why should we watch this Kipling's eponymous classic? The answer is simple we see what technology has changed in the 50 years. On the execution side call it whatever CGI, VFX, Motion Capture or live action or any other new dimension of the graphics world today this movie boasts the best of the above category. Off course it is from a legendary studio. On the casting part we can right loyally talk about the Indian- American Neel Sethi the small cute boy who takes up once in a lifetime role as Mowgli has emoted like a small bomb. He lives and elevates the role to the next level. With some of the ace actors doing voice acting there is no doubts the talking animals gets the life. The stand out voice acts by Ben Kingsley as Bhageera the black panther and Bill Murray as Baloo the bear. They have delivered a powerful voice performance. Scarlet Johansson does a cameo can't say that may be guest voice performance would be right as Kaa. Idris Elba as Shere khan has given powerful roars and scares.Overall get in for a fascinating, engrossing and enthralling animation movie of the year. Do watch it in 3D or 3D IMAX version to indulge and experience pure cinematic feel.Bonus Buzz feed: Look out for the movie \"Jungle Book \"again in 2018 which will not be a sequel or prequel but it will be the same movie remade by the competitor studios \"Warner Bros\". So I will have a definite job to compare the two. -Sivakumar Balachandran",

            "content": "John Faverau as an director is quite fifty-fifty. Some of his movies are very bad (like Cowboy's and Aliens), some of them are simply great (like Iron Man), so I went to see this Jungle Book with uncertain feelings. Prudence was futile. At the moment when Disney's logo changed to beautiful jungle scenery movie sucks you inside to great adventure. You can only marvel the animation. It just is so awesome. 3D scenery are breathtaking. Neel Seth is great choice to act Mowgli. Animals are so beautifully animated, that you can almost feel them live. If you liked Life of Pi's tiger, count it ten times and you can almost imagine how beautiful they look like. It must be worth of Oscar's. The story honor original story greatly. If the original Disney production was mostly like chain of music videos, this story surprises with it's story and with incredible foto realistic imagery. To honor Disney's heritage they have left two music scenes in to movie. That is also a good thing, that the characters won't start to sing in every corner.Movie is very entertaining, but some parts of the movie are little too scary to younger audience. What was surprising was that the movie was't made in widescreen format. But that is a small fault and easily forgiven. Such a great story, beautiful scenery, amazingly animated animal characters make this movie unforgettable movie experience.",

And at that precise moment we abhorred to share the remote with anybody.However, when these grown up kids got to know that they can caress that feeling again, they couldn't terminate that. Not even me. And when it's running on 3d who dared to stop me.This is the remake of Walt Disney's last creation 'The Jungle Book'; and moreover it's based on a collection of stories by English author Rudyard Kipling , which were first came to light in 1893\u201394. The story is all about a man-cub named Mowgli and his wild-mates. Since Mowgli was brought to the jungle by Bagheera, he was raised by the family of wolves, later honed by Baloo. Baloo, the bear, is as fluffy in nature as his body, though very sarcastic and fat in knowledge.Mowgli was life to his wild-mates, like Jungle was life to him. However, Sher Khan wanted to masticate that life without peace. He even attempted to maneuver man-cub's mind, but failed to cauterize his thinking. It was hard to quell Mowgli's intelligence. Even Baloo needed his help to score the honey.And at the end Sher Khan seized the red flower forever instead of the flesh.Therefore same goes to us, instead of accomplishing the 'respectable leaves' we go for some lightening contrivances. And same destiny we face as the tiger.Well, providing us a chance to be kid again Jon Favreau, director of Iron Man , 'MADE' a stupendous motion picture and 'chef' it in amazing way. And really Neel Sethi this time cracked some 'Diwali' crackers this time.So, are you alone out here? What are you doing so deep in the jungle? Don't you know what you are?You are a man. Behave like a man, and be like a boy by heart. Cause only a boy can hold the wild altogether. Don't hear the ears' ears. Listen what heart says and focus what mind thinks. Cause only you can illuminate your stature. Therefore forge yourself in that way, where you are more likely to give help than ask it. Live in the jungle of yours.Thank you Sir Rudyard Kipling.",

            "review_title": "Stunning animation, great acting, if a little narratively flawed",
            "content": "This has got to be some of the best animation work since Life of Pi. In some ways it's very similar to that film, being about an Indian boy living with animals. What they managed to do in this film is quite impressive, perhaps moreso, than Life of Pi, because while both films were made on a sound stage, the Jungle Book has many more locations, and when Mowgli runs through the jungle, it looks like he's actually there.One of my main worries coming into this film was how the voices would work against realistically animated animals. When I first saw the preview clip of Shere Khan's introduction at the watering hole, I thought his voice acting clashed with the sound FX and animation, but they must've done some extra work in post before the release, because the flow was drastically improved.My main issue with this film is mainly aspects of the story. There is small but noticeable clash in what the producers wanted out of the film. At parts, it seems like a more \"mature\" adaptation of the original book, and at other parts, it acts as a remake of the older Disney film. It feels like the live action adaptation of 101 Dalmations in that way. While the majority of the film has a more serious \"mature\" feel, two songs from the 1967 film (you know the ones) are added in. These are good renditions of the songs, but it's strange watching a movie with only two musical numbers.My other complaint are the two secondary antagonists, Kaa and King Louie. I feel both of these characters were underutilized in favour of the overarching plot, which makes me question why they were there in the first place. Kaa's only role in the film is to exposit why Mowgli was in the Jungle in the first place, and King Louie's role is to tell Mowgli that the Alpha Wolf of his pack was killed by Shere Khan, prompting the climax. Given the size and scale of both of these characters being larger-than-life (Seriously, both of these characters are impossibly huge), it's weird how little they serve in the overall story.In conclusion, this is a fantastic film for all ages. It's some of the best effects work I've seen in a while, and Neel Sethi as Mowgli was a fantastic child actor, considering he was essentially talking to nobody in a blue room for the entire film. It's definitely worth seeing on the big screen.",

We are a long way from realistic CGI for animals, especially furry ones. This film does no favors to advance CGI, so if that bothers you, you will hate this movie. It will be one of those that is unwatchable in 10 years because of how far we will have come, and the acting/story just isn't there.They should have found a different child actor, most of this movie it seems he is just being told to be annoyed/exasperated at every situation; it doesn't matter if he should be scared, traumatized, fearful, joyful, etc, he just goes to annoyed/exasperated for every scene requiring emotion.If you thought the boy in \"Australia\" deserved every award available... this movie will let you down. Seems like a nice kid and has potential, just not ready yet to carry an entire movie.Now to Bill Murray... saves the day! If you love him, you will love him as a bear, I am fairly certain this is the role he was born to play.

The Jungle Book sets a new bar for realistic CGI simultaneously with Zootopia's new bar for cartoony CGI. The human characters, like Mowgli, are the only live-action parts of the movie, with all of the backgrounds and animal characters being animated so realistically that it would blow the balls off of fans of the 1994 remake. The story is taken in a different direction due to the deanthropomorphization (I might have made that up) of several characters, and it actually works out better than the 1967 original. The characters have all-star casting and performances that make it seem cartoony if you focus only on the audio. The action scenes work a lot better than in the original, and I asked myself less questions at my screening compared to when I see the 1967 version at home. It overall adds up to a film that fans of the original should see and may enjoy as much if not more. I myself am more of a fan of dark movies, so it might not work for some others, but it is still a must-watch. I forgot to mention that I liked the revamped songs better than the original, though your opinion may change based on how much you liked the style of the original.",

So when we decided to review the new live action version, I thought I should re-watch the original. But I didn't. I walked in to this movie with fairly fresh eyes, and I'm glad I did. This movie made me feel many different things and I was enjoying it every step of the way. I won't go heavy in to plot details (because most people know the story) but it's about a man-cub named Mowgli who is raised by wolves and sent out to find his human tribe, while the evil Shere Khan hunts for him to exact revenge. Aside from the character Mowgli, this movie is entirely CGI. Environments, backgrounds, animals, are all fake, and it looks (for the most part) amazing. This is the best looking CGI animals you will ever see, not to mention they all talk. There were a few moments when the CGI was a bit too heavy for me, but it never took me out of the story.The voice acting is also top notch and perfectly cast. Idris Elba was a standout to me as Shere Khan while Scarlett Johansson's scene as Kaa was my very favorite of the film. Bill Murray as Baloo was an obviously perfect choice. Mowgli, on the other hand, was just okay. He carries the story well and interacts with the CGI characters convincingly, but there were a few moments when I wish they had splurged on another take. Either way, for a first time child actor doing an all CGI movie, he did a great job.The pacing and story is fast and easy to follow. I've always admired Jon Favreau as a director and he takes his talents up a notch with this one. There is heart, spectacle, and excitement galore. Bare in mind, this is not a musical. There are two songs in the movie. They are not very long and work with the context of the situation they serve. I personally liked the song sung by King Louie, voiced by Christopher Walken. The only lull I felt in the movie was surprisingly when Mowgli and Baloo started to work together. I LOVE Bill Murray and he knocked it out of the park, but I felt a little bit of a drag during a scene where they try to retrieve honey from a bee's nest. All in all, this is an amazing version of The Jungle Book story. The CGI is revolutionary, the pacing is fluid, and the voice casting is perfect. Never have I seen a film ride the line of \"is it for kids or adults?\" like this, but it is pure enjoyment across the board.",

A brilliant CGI/live action experience featuring a great cast of voice actors with an inspiring lead. It follows the journey of Mowgli, a young man-cub raised by wolves, and his adventure through the mighty jungle to protect himself from the vicious Shere Khan. In the first ten minutes, you are sucked in by the stunning visual landscape, along with great use of cinematography. When you first meet the animals, it's incredible to think that they are CGI created, and you really feel the sense of the civilised animal community. The scenery is absolutely marvellous with remarkable detail, which makes it so realistic. So a huge hats off to the special effects team. From very early on, you know these people spent a long time on this.You may think that voice acting is more straight forward then live action, but you can really tell that these actors put all they could into bringing these characters alive. Ben Kingsley was a perfect casting choice for the voice of Bagheera. As also being the narrator of the film, Kingsley contributes a David Attenborough feel to the film. Bill Murray really shows of a real life Baloo that really carries the fun comical side of the film. Idris Elba steals the award for best Disney villain, as he powers his evilness through his voice that clearly shows who's the boss, never have I been so intimidated by a Disney character. Christopher Walken shows a gangster like attitude to the character of King Louie, maybe less fun, but really cool. But the real star is Neel Sethi (Mowgli), who through his eyes brings the whole jungle alive (being the only real live actor in the film).Another awesome feature is the score, a real powerful atmospheric soundtrack of great sound that will really touch hearts and thrill. This is also a key factor that carries the emotion throughout the film. So a brilliant adventure for everyone to enjoy, a much deeper and darker adaptation, but really awesome, and a very strong 8/10.",

The voice acting were amazing,no problems there. Everything is made with confidence.Characters are so lovable and the villain is frightening.Jon Favreu made some of the most exciting and fun family film and I applaud him for this!.",

This mish-mash of new-age sentiments and zingy, slangy one-liners wrapped up in special visual effects has about as much to do with Kipling's wonderful adventure book as the Kardashians have to do with Oxford University. It's directed in a campy, wanna-be-cool style that can best be described as neo-faux Hollywooden car-chase. It uses animals instead of crash cars, but it boils down to much the same thing.Why (oh, why?) do film makers take wonderful books and trash them? Why do they take a genuinely moving tale and turn it into cotton candy? This movie is the cinematic equivalent of junk food.",

            "content": "When I heard they were making a live-action Jungle Book, I shuddered a little. I have never liked The Jungle Book. It's probably my least favorite of the 'classic' Disney movies. It always seemed so plot less and pointless, faults which could have been forgiven if it weren't so boring.Why did they choose The Jungle Book? We'll never know. But Disney delivered. This is the rare remake that does not just prove it deserves to exist but stands head-and-shoulders above the original. Color me impressed.Let's start with the obvious: this film looks incredible. It's probably the most beautiful film I've seen since Mad Max: Fury Road. This is technically the 'live-action' Jungle Book, but it's live-action in the way that Avatar and Life of Pi are. Some films dip their toes in the CG pool. This film baths itself in it. What we end up with is something I can only describe as what I think video game cutscenes will look like in the 22nd century. It's avant-garde yet natural and so very gorgeous.There is a scene near the start of the movie where Mowgli (played well by Neel Sethi, particularly considering he had to play off characters that weren't physically present) runs past a waterfall. I almost dropped the large soda I was sipping. If you have any interest in seeing this movie, see it in a theater. Scenes like that deserve to be a scene on the biggest screen you can find.Fire (called 'the red flower' by the characters in the movie) looks incredible. The climax comes to mind, as does a really neat sequence in which Kaa (played by Scarlet Johansson) shows Mowgli what happened to his parents. Some of the things they do with it used to be animation-specific, yet here they are, doing them in live-action. When I picture fire in my mind's eye, this is what I picture it looking like. Disney is doing things that have never been done before, and I love it.Ms. Johannsson is not the only movie star they got for a voice-acting role. Giancarlo Esposito plays the leader of the pack of wolves that takes Mowgli in, and Lupita Nyong'o (great to see her again) plays the wolf mother. The villain is played by Idris Elba in one of his best performances. When his character Shere Khan is on the screen, it's hard to look away. He's so threatening and ferocious. Bill Murray plays Baloo, and surprisingly, he's actually really good and funny. You'd think he'd be distracting, and he kind of is, but this is the best Murray has been since Lost in Translation. He sounds refreshed and energetic, and he has a lot of great lines.The worst parts of this film come from the source material. It's much tighter and better-written than the original, but there are still times when I let off a tiny groan. As an adaptation, it's monumental. It improves on the original in every possible way. Ninety percent of the issues I had with the first film are fixed, and it handles the whole 'kid in the jungle' dynamic far, far better than the first. The only bad choice they made was keeping two of the songs from the original, but they aren't too much of a detriment.With this film, Disney has opened up a whole new range of possibilities. I wonder what they'll do next.",

Such a perfection in such a tender age is something not everyone's cup of tea. The VFX and animation was no doubt flawless and the story of our loving Mogli has always been perfect. Though at times the movie went boring but the adventure was revived every now and then. Watching it in 3d was an added bonus. Anyone who has ever been a Mogli fan must, for sure, watch this movie.

It will satisfy fans of Disney's animated classic and please those who are only looking great visual spectacle. Director Jon Favreau fills it with so many memorable moments that Bill Murray/Baloo's terrific warbling of \"The Bare Necessities\" almost becomes a footnote in a movie simply swarming with pitch-perfect and major celebrity voices. The 3D and IMAX is perfect. I felt like being in the Jungle myself. The only thing i missed in the movie was the boomerang, which used be Mowgli's weapon.",

            "review_title": "The Jungle Book Review",
            "content": "The new version of Disney's The Jungle Book is not only visually stunning, but also manages to tell a heartfelt story. This movie incorporates elements from the classic 70's animated movie, while giving a slightly different take on the tale; which is based on the book of the same name by Rudyard Kipling. Probably the most astounding thing about this movie is the fact that it was all shot on a sound stage in Los Angeles, CA. Most of the jungle setting and all of the animals are completely computer generated graphics. However, it is done so well, that you will feel like you are in the Indian jungle. The visual style has a similar feeling to that of nature documentaries, such as the Disney movie Monkey Kingdom. Which gives a personal connection to the story involving the animals.Speaking of the animals, the voice actors did a great job with their characters. Ben Kingsley as Bagheera brought a tough yet caring quality, and Bill Murray did great playing the comedic relief bear, Baloo. All of the villains were scary in their own ways. Idris Elba as Shere Khan was intimidating, menacing and felt like an imposing threat. Kaa the snake, voiced by Scarlet Johanson, was great and had an unsettling feeling that played well into the fear of what lies deep in the jungle. One of the standouts has to be Christopher Walken as King Louie. The massive size and eerie calm of this character, really make him a threatening figure for the young man-cub, Mowgli.Mowgli, being the only real character in the movie, is brought to life by the young actor Neel Sethi. Sethi did an amazing job acting against almost nothing but managing to convey real emotions. Without him, the movie does not work, because he is the heart of the story. He brings perspective and insight into the difference and similarities between man and the animal world. For those that love the animated movie, there are two songs that make it into this new version. The classic Bare Necessities, sung by Baloo and Mowgli, and Wanna Be Like You, sung by King Louie. The Bare Necessities seemed to fit well within the narrative, showing the development of the friendship between Baloo and Mowgli. The other song literally comes out of nowhere, and really serves no purpose. It comes off a bit scary in a way, part of that could be due to Walken speak-singing the song. Even so, it was a good way to provide some comedy in between what are two very tense and suspenseful scenes involving King Louie and the man-cub. While there are certain scenes that are dark and violent, The Jungle Book is still a very good, family friendly movie that can be enjoyed by (almost) all ages. For those of you that are fans of other Disney movies such as The Lion King, you will enjoy this film on all levels. It has a great mix of comedy, action, suspense, horror and drama while still feeling like a fun, fantasy film for kids. It is the new standard for live action Disney movies and hopefully a new classic alongside it's animated companion.",

            "review_title": "The Best Disney Remake So Far",
            "content": "Many of us are getting sick and tired of these constant remakes. Mostly, because the movies that are being remade don't necessarily need to be remade. Most of the movies that are being remade were beloved classics, and are only being remade for more money. The Jungle Book, on the other hand, is one of the exceptions. While I do love the animated film, I can see the flaws it has. I also see it as a movie that COULD use a remake. And it got one. So, my thoughts? As the title suggests, this is, in my opinion, the best Disney live action remake to date. This movie does so well with remake the story, and then some. The additions to the story, such as Mowgli leaving the pack to protect them or more focus being put on the \"red flower\" really added more depth to the story. The constant action in the film perfectly represents the harshness of life in the jungle. I also like how the animals in the jungle sort of live in their own society. They have laws, and animals they respect/obey, such as the wolves and elephants.I love how fleshed out the characters were in this film. Bagheera, for example, doesn't come off as a nag as he does in the animated film. He shows that he simply wants Mowgli to be safe, and knows very well that the boy isn't safe anymore in the jungle. I also love how they show more of a bond between him and Mowgli, since after all, Bagheera is the one who found him. Mowgli's conflict with Shere Khan is also more developed, and we're given more of a reason for Mowgli to confront the tiger. Speaking of Shere Khan, I LOVE him in this film. Idris Elba gives more power to Shere Khan with his voice, and sent shivers down my spine. I also like how Shere Khan had a blind eye and a scar on his face. It's a sort of nod to the book, which has Shere Khan as a lame tiger with a crippled leg. So, Shere Khan is sort of lame in the film. I also love that we get to see Mowgli more with the wolves, and even with a wolf mother, who is one of the best characters in the film. I was pleasantly surprised by Christopher Walken's role as Louie. He really made Louie intimidating, as well as enjoyable to watch. Oh, by the way, Christopher Walken fans should look out for a subtle cowbell reference. ;D One nit pick I have with the characters is Baloo. I LOVE Baloo in both this film and the animated film. However, I didn't feel like he and Mowgli had a genuine connection in this film. In the animated film, Baloo saw that Mowgli was alone and wanted to befriend him. In this, he basically made Mowgli his slave by getting food for him. I know it was meant to be \"payment\", but because they had Baloo con him from the start, I didn't feel like he really cared about him that much. Maybe we'll see more of a bond in the sequel.Another nit pick I have with the film is I Wanna Be Like You. When we see King Louie in the animated film, we know from the start he's not meant to be intimidating. He comes off as a laid back orangutan. In this, though, Louie is an intimidating ape who wants power. Seeing him suddenly burst into song just didn't fit. It would've been best if they stuck with him just singing in the credits instead of making him sing in the film.I was a little put off by the end, since we all know Mowgli returns to the man village in the original. However, I'm sure I'm not the only one who's wondered what would happen if Mowgli didn't go back. So, I didn't hate the ending. Plus, we have a sequel coming up, so I'm sure they'll have him return to the man village in that.The Jungle Book surprised me. I was expecting this to be boring like Cinderella, or a jumbled mess like Maleficent. But this exceeded my expectations. This was a beautifully made remake that respected the original, and added in new material that blended well with the original story. This movie has given me hope that the upcoming Disney remakes will actually be good, and has given me a reason to want to see The Jungle Book 2.",

            "content": "The Jungle Book is a perfect representation of the evolution of CGI at the movies. Everything is animated beautifully, along with many of the background pieces in the movie, as absolutely none of this movie was actually filmed in a jungle-like location. That being said, The Jungle Book easily could have been a cheap movie that was just way too reliant on CGI. Of course, it's very different from that. The visuals are so impressive, you will probably at times believe that the animals appearing on screen are totally real.Aside from the CGI, The Jungle Book is nearly perfect anywhere else that could have potentially made the movie a failure. For his first big role, Neel Sethi does a great job as Mowgli. On that note, the members of the cast each nail their individual roles, most notably Bill Murray as the bear, Baloo. After seeing this movie, I could not imagine a better lead for the character. The plot of the movie is very simple, but it also works really well at the same time. It displays many call-backs to the original 1967 Disney classic, but is not a scene-for-scene remake of that film. And that's a great thing too, as it sets this new 2016 version as its own stand-alone film that's not any knockoff of any other of the 639 Jungle Book movies (I made that number up, by the way). Overall, The Jungle Book is the movie that it should have been, and stands as the most notable Jungle Book movie for our generation, and possibly even for all time.Rating: A-",

            "content": "The classic Rudyard Kipling Jungle Book stories have had a long, rippling, effect on literature and on screen. A lot of people, like me, have happy memories of sitting down and watching an old VHS tape of the 1967 Disney classic animation. Remakes and reboots have been a controversial issue, over the last decade especially, however I've always believed that with the right approach and methodology no filmic concept should be dismissed out of hand, and there is always potential in rediscovery.Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is a man-cub raised by Raksha (Lupita N'yongo) among a wolf-pack led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito). He was brought to the wolves as a baby by the Black Panther Bagheera (Sir Ben Kingsley) who has since served as a guardian to the boy. During a water truce between the animals of the jungle the fierce tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) threatens Mowgli's life. To keep him safe Bagheera agrees to escort Mowgli to a nearby man village. Along the way Mowgli must deal with a multitude of other jungle creatures such as the snake Kaa (Scarlet Johansen), Gigantopithecus King Louie (Christopher Walken) and the free loving bear Baloo (Bill Murray).Director Jon Favreau, DOP Bill Pope and the numerous talented visual artists responsible for the design of the film should be applauded for the fantastic world they have managed to create. Crafting a completely digital living jungle is breath taking enough but populating it with the amount of fantastically detailed environments and animals they have done is truly astounding. Neel Sethi is the only live action actor to appear in the film; however you immediately forget this thanks to the brilliant CGI The Jungle Book uses to conjure these creatures to being. Their lips sync perfectly with their speech and the movement whether crawling, walking, running or leaping is phenomenally realistic. The best work is that of the villainous Shere Khan, portrayed with brilliant menace by Idris Elba, whose beautiful design juxtaposes with his aggression and ruthlessness. Neel Sethi, in his first ever acting role, does an excellent job as Mowgli. Considering he spent the entire film shoot on a green screen reacting to pretend animals he delivers a touching and heartfelt performance that matches up to the prolific ensemble. Everybody in the cast delivers, but Bill Murray's Baloo steals every scene he's in. One of the most popular and beloved Disney creations of all time the role of Baloo was always going to be a difficult task but Murray's combination of humour and heartfelt, and his relaxed, yet somehow powerful, line delivery have succeeded in bringing the character out of his animated 'hibernation' and back on the big screen to be loved all over again by young and old. The music is both nostalgically pleasing and impossibly triumphant, and how can anyone not like Christopher Walken as a giant monkey singing one of the jazziest songs of all time. There are a few narrative issues, problems with making the structure of the film work to be a successful collaboration of both Kipling's story and the previous animated feature. But I'm not sure too many people are going to care thanks to the joyous romp that the film manages to be.In the end it is a delight to report that The Jungle Book is a visual masterpiece, a fond nostalgia trip and one of the best films of the year so far rolled into one. Knowing that Warner Brothers also have a live action adaptation planned for release in 2018, directed by Andy Serkis, they're going to have their work cut out as the bar has been set pretty darn high, and I highly recommend a trip to the jungle as an (undeserved smirk) 'Bear-necessity'.Review by Alexander Halsall.

The animated one had me constantly laughing, this one barely a smirk from Bill Murray and that's about it.Packed with such a great cast, but some are under used (Scarlet Johansson) or mod cast (Christopher Waken is a terrific actor but I think he was the wrong choice for King Louie).Personal opinion, I preferred King Louie as a crazy Orangutan as opposed to the giant gangster like character presented here.Also, in the original the elephants were great characters with unique personalities, now they're completely void of any personality.I thought that the end was a little anticlimactic also. It was okay but was over too quickly.Another slight criticism, although for the most part everything looked so real, the faces of the main animal characters looked a little too human.What I really enjoyed, however, we're the fight scenes. The choreography of the animals fighting looked very realistic. They moved like real animals would, as well as being beautifully rendered.",

For the most part it felt generated, flat and lacked an authenticity which failed to captivate or make you care at all about what you were seeing on screen. This was also reinforced by some of the actors chosen for the characters, Idris Elba and Ben Kingsley's voices didn't feel as though they had any connection to the animals they were portraying and Christopher Walken's 'Mob Boss' King Louie was just unsettling (especially when he started singing).It didn't help that the story was extremely disjointed, trying to be original but then at times falling back onto being a replica of the animated version; the inclusion of the songs felt shoe- horned to appease the audience rather than a requirement.There are a lot of reviews which have heavily criticised the lead actor (which seems somewhat unfair given his age) but unfortunately he wasn't very convincing in either what he was saying or of the environment he was in. And this became a major problem for the film, Mowgli was the films last hope, a real person to connect, convince & captivate the audience to the film, but who fails miserably to do so.So, what made the film enjoyable (in part). Certain characters and situations did draw you in, the scenes involving the wolf pack were well delivered and the talents of Lupita Wyong'o and Giancarlo Esposito made you believe in the characters. Scarlett Johansson voice landed itself well to being the voice of Kaa, even though the whole scene didn't feel connected to the rest of the movie.And just as you are about to give up caring, there is Bill Murray's Baloo which pretty much saves the film from being a complete stinker. He offers a moment of both comedy and compassion which the film desperately needed.Unfortunately this 'live action' version of the story ultimately has very little life to it at all.",

            "content": "The Jungle Book was never considered a \"top tier\" Disney classic. Movies existing in that rarefied air includes such immortal tales as: Snow White, Pinocchio, and Dumbo. The Jungle Book remains, however, a very popular fantasy romp about a \"man cub\" saved by a black panther, and raised by a family of wolves. This live action version, is just about as good of a remake of the animated movie that could have been put to film.First and foremost the special effects and CGI animation are gorgeous. The forest denizen are so realistic that they elicit real emotions in the audience. If you're like me, when you get caught up in the spectacle you'll forget that jungle creatures are unable to actually engage in discourse and song. The movie remains true to the book, and original animated feature. Not terribly exciting, but with enough steady action and dialogue to keep the audience somewhat engrossed throughout its running time. The one bright spot for me, besides the sumptuous effects was Bill Murray's voice work of Baloo the Bear. Seriously, this is some of the best voice-over work for a CGI character since Andy Serkis voiced Gollun in the Lord of the Rings. It's hard not to fall in love with that lovable lug of a bear, and I bet you'll agree with me too. Easily the best parts of the movie are the simple interactions between Mowgli the \"man cub\" and Baloo the Bear.The rest of the movie just kind of plods along, just as if you were turning the pages of Kipling's novel. Like the book, it's a somewhat simple and not terribly exciting \"coming of age\" tale, told not by an idiot, but rather by a wise black panther named Bagheera. Rated 6 out of 10 stars.",

CGI effects almost took everyplace in this movie, except the little boy actor. However since I watched at home, so I couldn't experience the amazing 3D effects as theater view would have. Therefore my review can only base on storyline and characters. In addition, I never watched the old cartoon, hence I couldn't cherish the past with others. Pro, animals image are very furry and cute. Their hair still looks beautiful from computer.Con, Most big lose of this movie is the forest fire, it took all my good feeling away.. In a moment, I cant agreen the tiger no more, human can only know destroying. Beside, Jungle Book and Zootopia both released in 2016. I feel lucky I once chose to watch Zootopia in cinema but not the Jungle Book. Overall, still a great story for kids. May you and I always keep children's simplicity, and stay positive of life.",

The film is a visual feast, every frame looks stunningly beautiful, be it the waterfalls, mountains, trees and above all the different kinds of animals. Its really hard to believe that its all CGI...Its indeed a remarkable achievement by the team...All this results in pure magic on the big screen. The characters of Jungle book bring back the nostalgia which we grew up watching on doordarshan- be it Bagheera, SherKhan, Baloo, even the song simple bare necessities is included (which i used to love so much) smile emoticon Mowgli played by Neel Sethi is very endearing and is cast perfectly. Dubbing done for all animals is perfect and it adds life to the film. Background score is also very good. Action sequences are thrilling-the scene where Mowgli is captured by the monkeys- that whole sequence is just brilliant. This movie is one epic adventure which ur kids the kid inside you will enjoy to the fullest. I feel its humanly impossible to make a better version from what Jon Favreau and team has offered us.. Very rarely we get to see movies which have a soul, great story and executed brilliantly which makes up for a great cinematic exp. Jungle book achieves this feat! - 10/10 Not to be missed at any cost....",

            "content": "Disney's The Jungle Book brings back the childhood memories of watching the animated Jungle Book cartoon series and the animated movie of the same name that had us all enthralled and which still rules our hearts. Be it the commanding and goosebumps inducing Sher Khan or the bubbly and kind Baloo or Bagheera who is hard on the outside and a softy on the inside, this classic tale by Rudyard Kipling of an Indian man child living among animals in a jungle is poignant, adventurous and memorable.In this latest adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's classic, we get exemplary graphics, a tight story line and beautifully constructed characters with voices lent by some very famous actors and actresses. The whole environment in the movie is CGI and so realistic that not even for one second do we feel like anything is computer constructed and make believe. It is as if we are venturing in the wild with talking animals and a child who not only understands them but also considers them his family!The movie follows the story in the book but doesn't go into much detail. The Director Jon Favreau sticks to the story but also adds a few twists and surprises of his own. The movie basically deals with Mowgli's encounter and battle with Sher Khan. While I would have loved a more in-depth experience into Mowgli's life in the jungle, I do understand the Director's dilemma of wrapping up the story in a decent run time. The movie's run time is 105 minutes.I enjoyed the movie and loved revisiting my childhood favourite characters and can re-watch it again. The actors and actresses lending their voices to the characters have done a stellar job and their voices suit the characters from the book. The child actor, Neel Sethi does justice to Mowgli's character and has acted like a pro.The graphics are most realistic but in some scenes in the later part which happen in the dark or at night, the scenes got a bit too dark at places and I had to strain my eyes to make out what was happening.I watched the movie in 3D but not many 3D scenes are there. So you can easily watch it in 2D.All in all, Disney's The Jungle Book movie is a lovely adaptation of the book, The Jungle Book and a movie that had me enthralled throughout. I would recommend this movie to everyone and give it 4 stars out of 5. It will be enjoyed not only by children but adults too. So go watch it with your family and friends and have fun following Mowgli as he tackles Sher Khan!This review is also available on Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff",

            "content": "Mowgli (Neel Sethi) having been raised by wolves must now go to the Man Village and live out his life there because the Jungle is now too dangerous for him. The Tiger Shere Khan (Idiris Elba) vows to kill Mowgli. The Panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) and the Bear Baloo (Bill Murray) accompany Mowgli on his journey. I had seen the original Jungle Book back in the day when it was all an animated cartoon and that was a great show with Phil Harris as the voice of Balloo. Now with CGI technology it has become even better. How they did this is unbelievable as they have a human, Neel Sethi, interacting seamlessly with animated cartoon animals and this is simply magical. I cannot explain it any other way. It was more than exceptional. Kudos. Mowgli has a few adventures on his way to the Man Village and we see him almost come under a hypnotic spell by the woman Python snake Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), being stung by bees to help Baloo get his honey, helping a small elephant get out of a hole, and being captured by monkeys who bring him to King Louie (Christopher Walken) a massive orangutan who wants to rule the jungle with him. To be sure there is a confrontation between Mowgli and Shere Khan near the end. (Whaaaat? Isn't this a mismatch?)Bill Murray as Baloo was very good, but most Kudos must go to Christopher Walken as King Louie. Both sang songs that were real toe tappers, but Walken is the clear winner. When the credits roll we hear Walken again singing. Simply great. Other notable Voices: Mogli's wolf mother Raksha: Lupita Nyong'o; Wolf leader Akela: Giancario Esposito; Ikki, a wolf cub: Gary Shandling. Parents should be warned that very small children may be frightened by the animal battles as they are fierce. All in all a very enjoyable movie. Great job on this updated version.

            "content": "How did you feel when you saw Avatar for the first time? How did you feel when you were transported into Pandora with the magic of IMAX 3D? Maybe the predictable plot didn't stick with you, but the visuals certainly did. Now, take a look at this live action re- imagining of the classic Rudyard Kipling short stories, as well as the animated Disney delight from the 1960's. What you see here in 2016 is an immersive trip into The Jungle Book that no other adaptation has ever brought to life, additionally exploring the same themes of man's relation with the wild that were set aside by the Disney cartoon. \u200b This triumph in Disney entertainment owes its thanks solely to director Jon Favreau, who people know for his lighthearted fantasy family fun with favorites such as Iron Man. Now, he proves to be a true showman of the screen in the same manner as Christopher Nolan or James Cameron, building upon several of the same cinematic techniques used back in Avatar. He knew the jazzy, family-friendly tone of the original cartoon didn't fit the photo-real image he had in mind, so went with the feel of danger and mythology in Kipling's original conception\u2014a decision made for the better.The result is a dizzying, majestic IMAX experience complete with grand waterfalls, sunbeams, time-lapse photography, tense mudslides, and eerie fog. Here is the real star of the film: the creation of each individual animal. Their walking patterns are all accurate to their real-life counterparts, with tangible fur textures that add to the weight of each character. However they don't look quite as real when they're talking or making unnatural movements, so it may not be the best showcase of special effects you've ever seen. Yet even so, the visions of the jungle's citizens interacting around a waterhole creates a wonderful sight, and the creation of the major characters truly makes The Jungle Book come alive.Bagheera is voiced by Ben Kingsley, and he sounds miraculously similar to his cartoon counterpart.Shere Khan is voiced menacingly by Idris Elba, and the casting choice could not have made the villain feel more alive.Baloo is voiced by Bill Murray, who unfortunately make things fall apart a bit. He is literally Bill Murray with fur, snapping the typical Bill Murray humor, and removing a bit of the magic.But that is thankfully made up for, as the originally playful orangutan King Louie has been transformed into a gigantopithecus. He sits on his throne like Jabba the Hutt, rests in the shadows like Don Corleone, and appears genuinely threatening thanks to the spectacular voice and facial work by Christopher Walken.The most resonating of all the on-screen moments is the 150-foot long snake, Kaa, whose body coils the forest of vines overrun with echoes. Favreau made such a perfect decision in casting the spooky emotive voice of Scarlett Johansson that punches you in the gut.\u200bThen there's Neel Sethi, the newcomer who plays Mowgli. While he does look, act, and sound exactly like the cartoon, he says all his lines in one breath too often, and simply never acts genuine.The focus is not on the little boy raised by wolves. The focus is on the spectacle of the talking creatures. Although it may just as well hurt the product. Screenwriter Justin Marks has made some changes from the animated feature to expand upon the themes: Mowgli is already a grown boy by the beginning, not a baby found in the river by Bagheera; He is challenged in how he must learn to be a wolf, not a man cub; His resourceful inventions to help him come across obstacles such as drinking water are ridiculed by the wolf pack for not being \"the wolf way;\" He overall wonders, \"how many lives is a man cub worth?\"It sounds like a fairly overused plot about an outcast who learns to be himself. Well let me tell you, it is. It also has some of the other predictable plot devices such as an unnecessary backstory full of coincidences.But for every unnecessary change made, there is another change that makes The Jungle Book 2016 overall stronger than its animated counterpart. There is significantly more focus put into the weapon of man (the red flower, or fire). Each of the characters are more involved in the journey of Mowgli, with the exception of Kaa and King Louie. But that's a good thing, because these characters each had the two best scenes.I will admit, The Jungle Book is an enlightening contribution to movies deserving to be experienced on the largest screen possible. Yet is it the real deal when it comes to that level of entertainment? Not quite. The writing is \"been there, done that,\" for the most part, and the special effects can be easily nitpicked. But setting the flawed narrative aside, try to think of big IMAX pictures such as this one as ways to bring us back in touch with our environment, inspiring us to go out into the wilderness to experience its majesty first-hand. Here is what Rudyard Kipling's original novel was about: defining our relationship with the wild which we're guilty of endangering. Therefore, I encourage you to take your older kids to this adventure, specifically in 3D.Overall Grade: B-",

            "content": "The Jungle Book is the latest product brought to us by Disney and directed by Jon Favreau (Iron Man) and a voice cast consisting of Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Lupita Nyong'o, Scarlett Johansson, Bill Murray and Cristopher Walken. The movie also introduces Neel Sethi as a live-action Mowgli.When this movie was first teased at D23 by director Jon Favreau, he said this was the most technologically advanced movie ever. Many eyebrows were raised, but he had all the evidence to back up his claim. This movie was entirely filmed in a studio lot in Los Angeles and it looks absolutely amazing. You can never tell what's real and what's not. I usually am against the overuse of CGI, but this time they did it right. There is so much detail in the film that you won't really tell if it's real or not. Also the animals look amazing. Sure, there are scenes where you can tell it's CGI, by the way they talk or make face expressions, but that's normal. This is a movie with talking animals after all.Let's talk a little about the cast in this movie. Ben Kingsley plays the wise and most of the time grumpy Bagheera, who acts as a teacher for Mowgli. He was the one who raised him since he was just a baby and introduced him to the rules of the jungle. Lupita Nyong'o plays Raksha, the she-wolf who takes Mowgli in as her own son. Idris Elba is a terrifying Shere Khan, a tiger who has an agenda against humans and doesn't agree with Mowgli staying in the jungle, therefore starting a conflict with the rest of the animals. This is our first great villain performance of the year. Scarlett Johansson is okay as Kaa, but her role is not really that big in the movie, although her sequence has some important moments for our main character. By far, my favorite animal and voice role was Bill Murray as Baloo the bear. He is funny, sweet and the bond he forms with the little human cub is one that lasts for ages. Oh, and he also sings, like really good!We discussed the voice cast, now let's pass on to the live action side. Neel Sethi, the boy who plays Mowgli, had an almost impossible task for an actor at such a young age. He acted the whole time in front of a green screen, with nothing but little hints like puppets for him to know what's going on in the scene. All this considering, he did an absolutely amazing job. He genuinely transformed into Mowgli. His emotions range go from pure happiness to absolute sadness, and he conveys that wonderfully. He is an adorable kid with a bright future ahead of him. Also the 3D in this movie is actually good, and I am always against 3D. I usually feel it desatures the colors and also creates some fuzzy images that completely ruin the experience for my, but with The Jungle Book, this was not the case. I had to see in 3D because my theater didn't have it in other formats (plan was to see it in IMAX, but there was some technical issues) and I wasn't as disappointed as I expected to be. If you have a chance to see this in IMAX, do it. I'm sure it will totally be worth it.The Jungle Book is gorgeously looking movie with a wonderful story filled with emotions and some superb acting by the best in the industry. What Jon Favreau achieved is nothing short of fantastic. If you had doubts about seeing this one in the theater, don't, it's worth every penny! I give The Jungle Book a 9.5 out of 10!",

Akela dying at Shere Khan's hands, Kaa(a female?) trying to gulp Mowgli and so on - a series of upsetting alterations ! Shere Khan is undoubtedly portrayed as a fearsome villain, even Bagheera, to some extent, meets the standards but Baloo, Ka, Grey Brother etc. have fallen from their standards, even the ensemble cast of the Bunder Log is pathetic. Except Shere Khan telling Raksha's kids a story in his wily way, the movie almost has no reflection of Kipling's Masterpiece. Baloo's and Bunder Log's songs do provide a 'feel-good' factor but the background score is average.\nI wish that instead of picking up such classics and morphing them to wind up in a movie less than two hours, it is better to create movie in several parts like a trilogy or series.

            "content": "Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book is about the seventh film adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's book and we already know it certainly isn't the last. So how does this one fare?As with most people, I grew up watching the 1967 animation and fell in love with it, so I was a little irked when I learnt they were going to make, what I thought, would be a frame-for-frame remake, but thankfully I was wrong! 2016's The Jungle Book, although takes a number of ques from Disney's famous classic, is certainly not tied to it; this is it's own thing and does well for it. I enjoyed the fact that I didn't quite know what was going to happen next, and seeing where Mowgli's adventure took him kept my interest; so on a plot standpoint it is familiar on a basic level but with new elements and expanded story lines it felt new and original with a bit of nostalgia sprinkled in places.I do of course have to mention the cast; they were all wonderful in their roles and superb to listen to but I do want to highlight three. Bill Murray is a fantastic Baloo which shouldn't surprise anyone, he delivers some great lines and he's such a likable character, I really enjoyed his performance. Idris Elba plays a very menacing villain as Shere Khan and certainly gives this version of the character a very unlikable bully-type personality which worked well, although it took me a while to stop picturing Elba himself as I watch a lot of his live-action work. And then for me one of the most fascinating and unnerving characters was Christopher Walken as King Loui, he was so well suited to the role I always wanted to see more of him, the character had a huge powerful presence on screen and I enjoyed that a lot. On a side note, Neel Sethi did a top-notch job as Mowgli with a few moments where you could see he wasn't sure where to look for these CGI animals but for the majority he did exceptionally well for his first film and especially one of this sort with very little to act with.I just want to quickly mention the music now; the score is absolutely fantastic, from the very opening scenes giving you a rush of familiarity to the wonderful new sounds John Debney scores over the jungle, it was really a pleasure to listen to. Now the music also segways into some problems I had with the movie...I don't think it's a spoiler to say that a few songs from Disney's animated classic make it into this movie, but I'd like to say I enjoyed the first one they did as it was more of a bantering back- and-forth type of singing without going full musical which I think works better in this live-action setting; the second song they did though I didn't feel flowed as well, almost jarring to a point as it seemed a little off, but that's just me personally. And the third one was my favorite but that wasn't present during the film itself, so sit back and enjoy some of the credits when you watch.Another negative for me personally was some of the portrayal of this world. They had super-realistic animals doing sometimes very animal behaviours and and they cleverly combined that with some of the script and humour but once or twice the cartoony sequences I felt didn't quite gel with the visual realism I was seeing.In the end, The Jungle Book was a fun movie with great story, character and music but had one or two moments of iffy CGI and creative choices. I think it will definitely be the definitive 'Jungle Book' for a lot of kids and look forward to seeing the announced sequel and Andy Serkis' take on the book in a few years.",

Because the visuals are so realistic, you get swept up in the story. At times I wondered how they could let children in to see this: it was so frightening!What lets the movie down is the talking. The animals are given the sorts of voices and dialogue you would expect to find in a cartoon comedy. A ferocious-looking bear starts talking English in a Bronx accent. Other animals have various British accents. It jars with the visuals.

When the movie hits it, well, it was magnificent. To me, It was one kind of movie that perfectly using the maximum potential of CGI. The panoramic, lightning, set-place, colors, they were all above average. It's so different when Favreau doing the Iron Man franchise. It was empty, blunt, and just a mediocre superhero movie. In Jungle Book, I see the things what Favreau can do, maximizing and intensify the use of CGI. Yeah, that's it.I wonder, those beautiful visualization in The Jungle Book could be implemented more into upcoming Disney's. I just hope so.It's been a long time, maybe i forgot when the last time i watch this kind of magnificent family-adventure film. The plot that Favreau used to TJB was interesting. Yeah, journey typical, supported with panoramic, pride, and friendship. Mogwli met so many other creature as the duration goes on. These creature even have it's interesting things. Bear, panther, wolfs, pigs, monkeys, orangutans, snake, tiger, and so on. They all are a character, Favreau successfully put an exact duration to develop their character in the film. Most of the time, the way the story goes on seems unpredictable, it's a good things. That's what made TJB so strong in rating. The journey always give the audience something new, even if it was a creature, place, panorama, legend, etc.Good job Favreau. You successfully made a new standard for CGI use. TJB is an incredible movie. I was amazed by Mowgli's journey. I recommend everybody from all age range to watch this. It's really worth to watch.",

But I enjoyed the 2016 live-action remake even better.Mowgli is a \"mancub\" raised among the jungle animals - specifically the wolves. Although he tries hard to be a wolf, the fact that he is human remains a handicap. He is often told \"that's not the wolf way\". When a drought hits, the river drops, exposing the \"Peace Rock\". During this time, all animals can come to the water to drink and not be harassed. However, Shere Khan shows up. And while he won't harass or eat anyone while the drought lasts, once the river rises, he will return for Mowgli's blood.After much argument by the wolves, Mowgli leaves, as \"I don't want to see anyone get hurt.\" Bagheera helps him, intending to take him to the man village.However, things don't go to plan. Mowgli doesn't want to go. There are a series of adventures and close calls.The movie is quite exciting. It's a bit rougher (as in more violent) than the original, and some scenes may be scary for young children (my then-5-year-old brother cried at one point the first time he watched). I didn't like the small religious element of the movie, either. However, I did like the movie's themes. It's a fun and exciting adventure.But it's also got INCREDIBLE special effects, which really raise the benchmark.A truly brilliant movie.",

            "content": "I've died and gone to Heaven! This perhaps the best Disney remake I've ever seen so far, and I rarely ever compliment a Disney remake. Lately Disney has been doing constant remakes of their famous movies like Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, and many more, which often annoys me. \"Why remake these classics? They're perfect the way they are,\" I always say. And it's true, the original classics are fine the way they are, but then again it's kinda cool to see some of these animated stories come physically to life, while other times it ruins what was good about the original movies. I almost felt this way with this movie, but as the trailers came out I became intrigued and eager to see what they would do.The story is just about the same as the animated: Mowgli, the man cub, who had been raised by wolves, must now go back to the man village to escape Shere Khan the tiger who vowed to kill him. Mowgli doesn't want to leave the jungle and does what he can to stay. Yes it's about the same as the animated version, but the only difference is that this film goes a little darker and a bit of a heavier tone than the other one, and it has actual story. The original didn't have much story structure; it mainly was Mowgli spending maybe 5 minutes with each character and always accompanied with a song each, which was had its own charm. This movie has only two songs in the movie itself (not counting the credits) and develops Mowgli's relationship with each character. He doesn't just spend a song and dance with the monkeys, but talks with them, runs from them, and all the while Louie tries luring him to his demands. You also see the relationship he has with his wolf family, which makes it all the more heartbreaking when he has to leave them. Also the jungle has laws, like how to treat an elephant, peace treaties between carnivores and herbivores, and how each animal has a distinct behavior. It was very intriguing when the animal world was explored in a bit more depth. And to remind us where this film came from, it makes lots of winks to it right from the very start. Not only would some of the characters quote their lines (sometimes sounding phoned in), but the music in the background would match the environment the animated version had been based on. Also the CGI in this movie is really good. The animals and most of the jungle locations are all CGI of course, but somehow they all look lifelike. For instance, there's a moment where Mowgli says goodbye to his wolf mother by touching heads, and it doesn't look like an actor saying goodbye to a blue screen, it legitimately looks like he's saying goodbye to an actual wolf. And even if the CGI was noticeable, the story is so hypnotizing to a point you forget about the actors and the blue screen.Speaking of casting, I have to confess at first it was very unsettling who got which parts. This was mainly because the voices in the original were a major part of the charm. They were pitch perfect, fun to listen to, and had a lot of character and attitude. Ben Kingsley as Bageera was pitch perfect for his sophistication. Shere Khan may not have the rich voice George Sanders had, but he was very intimidating. Scarlett Johansen as Kaa was surprisingly more hypnotizing than Sterling Holloway, and Christopher Walken as King Louie was great. While he was occasionally awkward, he was actually pretty scary (never thought I'd say that about Walken). Though the biggest casting choice I dreaded most was Bill Murray as Baloo. It's one thing to carelessly cast anyone as Kaa or King Louie (still perfect choices), but it's another thing to randomly cast a vital character from the movie who had the most charm. Phil Harris had such a fun, carefree, charming and laid back voice and I wondered if Bill could carry the same charm. The answer is somewhat yes. Both actors had a different charm to the character, and both knew that Baloo was a laid back and fun character. Bill Murray delivered that out perfectly and made this performance his own. This was one of the best movies I had seen so far this year, and I had a lot of fun watching it with my two sisters. I love both the original for it's song playlist and unique characters, and the new for it's story, characters, environment, and everything else. Go see it if you're in the mood to feel nostalgic or just want to have fun (and stay for the credits too, it's really cool to hear Walken and Johansen sing).",

Some reviewers of this film in this website were not paying attention and were merely complaining subjectively instead of being constructively critical and objective. Songs that were in the original The Jungle Book were actually more upbeat than this 2016 version. Yes, this film's version had a more dark and violent vibe to it. Which could make some parents prevent some children from watching this. Sure, the adults who admired the 1967 classic may feel disappointed by this from it not regurgitating the same old feeling the much older masterpiece captures. Disney is not in the business of cowering down to the audience's expectations too much, though. Disney's goal was to make this remake for luring profit in its money vault in order to make better films that are more original and fresh as possible. This is why remakes and sequels of films that have less quality than their predecessors exist. In order to make monetary gain to help make something better come along. By my surprise, I actually liked this adaptation that is 3 years old because it was closer to realism than the cartoon's interpretation.",

Without a doubt, its a visual masterpiece and everything looks amazing in the movie, which is great. What i'm disappointed with about this movie is that I didn't feel it brought anything new and exciting to the table story-wise. It was somehow all very predictable and I feel watching this movie as an adult leaves me wanting more story.I didn't like the performance from Neel Sethi and found most of his acting very bland. I know he's a child actor, but somehow most of his scenes(especially the dramatic ones) felt very cringe-worthy, which didn't help the movie either.Ultimately the thing that saved this movie for me and actually made me give it 7/10 was the voice acting. Ben Kingsley, Giancarlo Esposito, Bill Murray, Christopher Walken and especially Idris Elba nailed the voices of their respective characters and gave the movie renewed energy. When I think about this movie in a larger perspective it's rather disappointing. I think to myself: \"Would this movie even be somewhat good without the famous voice actors?\" and I come to the conclusion that it wouldn't. It's sad that big budget movies now rely on voice actors to save their movies compared to having a good story but its the reality we live in.In conclusion I was actually pretty disappointed by this movie in story terms. However, the voice acting of some very talented actors saved this movie for me and has made me want to recommend \"The Jungle Book\" to other movie lovers even if I feel like it's a pretty forgettable movie.",

Walking out of this movie, I Loved it!! Everyone a part of this movie did an excellent job from acting,Cgi, directing, everything. The blend of real and cgi was done so well, all thanks to the fantastic director Jon Favreau. Every film he does, it gets better and better. This is his best film yet.

Everyone did great, especially Idris Elba as the villain. Bill Murray is fantastic as always. Personally the person who blew me away was Christopher Walken. He was just amazing.

            "content": "The whole execution of the \"classic Disney live- action remake\" project gradually represents an increasing slope in terms of quality. MALEFICENT tries and fails to balance both the mythological aspects of the original source material and a sub textually darker KILL BILL storyline; Cinderella proved to expand the broadest elements of its kin, albeit a little shoddy at times. And now we have THE JUNGLE BOOK, the newest of this experiment with the intent of adapting the original book and the 1967 movie version as well as showcasing envelope- pushing CG effects the same caliber as AVATAR and GRAVITY. So how is it? Personally, even considering some clumsy moments and frequent shifts in tone, I was pretty impressed! Out of all their movies in this live-action experiment, THE JUNGLE BOOK is easily the third-strike home run I've been anticipating for all this time and easily the biggest, narratively complex adaptation of this story since\u0085 well, ever! The story, almost verbatim of the original movie, centers on Mowgli who lives with a pack of wolves under the supervision of Ben Kingsley's Bagheera and his wolf parents (one of them voiced by Gus Fring \u2013 really). After a confrontation of Sheer Khan (Idris Elba) with the intent of killing Mowgli just because, the wolves decided to send the man cub back to his hometown with Bagheera's assistance. Along the way the film detours into the same scenes we expect but with different yet oddly boasting tweaks and revisions. Scarlett Johansson as a man- hungry snake Ka, Christopher Walken as a massive Gigantopithecus, Bill Murray as Garfield as Baloo, etc. This movie, overall, is a visually immense but overwhelmingly bizarre feast of a movie, and yet it works! When he isn't held back by shoddy scripts or no clear sense of purpose, director Jon Favreau is easily the best at implementing comedic quirks, unintentional or not, to deceptively lean films, the kind of aesthetic that elevates his movies like Iron Man and the under-appreciated ZATHURA. Any questions that might be raised by the weirdness of this film like \"why is a giant Christopher Walken monkey singing \"I want to be like you\" in a giant cave\" or \"how can a tiger actually throw a wolf off a cliff with his jaws\" could easily be answered with \"Why not?\"And\u0085 honestly, it's freaking hilarious! Elements like these would not work anywhere else, but somehow fits the peculiar charm of the source material brilliantly, and I could not find any director like Favreau doing this right.But that is what I already expect to enjoy, but what I never expected is how much is implemented in the actual narrative. For a rather simple tale, the film provides quite a lot of complexities to the arched aspects of the original movie as well as paying a few lip service to the actual Jungle book. For example, Mowgli easily becomes more creatively independent in this films as he crafts MacGyver-style gadgetry in order to comply with his wildlife. Baloo acts like the more self-aware version of his character; instead of a cool, upbeat, obliviously selfish Baloo, we get an actually selfish, lazy, slightly competent Baloo (Bill Murray, as always, is the master of this routine) who gets a huge arc in his story as his friendship with Mowgli actually means something, even at the verge of risking his life. But the biggest one is probably the books controversial aspect, which is the concept of Imperialism. In the climax, Sheer Khan taunts a revenge-stricken Mowgli, as Khan claims that he came to virtually terrorize the society he once inhabited. Even though that last part doesn't get too dark (thank god, it is a kids films!)The cast is terrific as expected, and that is to say nothing of the faultless animal renditions that manages to succeed in the ever-troubling issue of having their lips move. Ben Kingsley as Bagheera gives a shockingly resemblance to the original voice, while the cast of the wolves give great comfort. Bill Murray as Baloo \u2013 Its Bill Murray. C'Mon! Christopher Walken as King Louie is about as ridiculously cool as you expect it to be. Scarlett Johansen is barely in the movie, but her voice of Ka fits the seducing aspect of both the character and her masculine-drawing pop-culture image. However, if there is a weak performance, it might be Mowgli himself. He's fine as the film continues, but I can clearly see a fine line of what a good-for-an-kid-actor performance can manage to acting with empty space as CGI animals. But if that is the weak point, Idris Elba as Sheer Khan is easily the strongest point. To say that he steals the show would discredit for how much he devours and conquers it! The film never attempt to address any complexities to Khan even from his growling prejudice against humans, but only because he is nearly perfect as a broadly evil character that made him intimidating yet charismatic in the original source material. This time, however, he DOES. NOT. MESS. AROUND! For such a broad, clownishly evil feline, Elba clearly hams it up in one of the best parts of the movie.However, he does lead to one of the troubling issues with the movies tone. This is, generally, a kid's movie, and him showing up to do some rather nasty thing might frighten kids too much. It isn't too much, but you do start to wonder. Even considering that, I am still shocked that this turned out the way it is. This film checks off the list as being the best visual experience since AVATAR, with the best CG animals since LIFE OF PIE, and easily the best source material adaptation out of a billion of them since LORD OF THE RINGS. Had it not been for frequent detours in tone, it may be perfect, but just as good as is. Go see it!",

The villain is superbly played by iridis Elba who fears humans. This drives his antagonism. Mowgli is superbly played, steady, modest, curious and sincere. Bill Murray was excellent and a perfect compliment to this movie for his lightheartedness and comic genius. In fact, most probably the only character that is poorly played is King Lui. It was a poisoned chalice though, so no one could rescue that role. He's shallow and ignorant and didn't belong. The effects were breathtaking. The scenery was beautiful. The camera-work was excellent. Thankfully, Disney didn't add female ninja warriors or \"girl power\", so the film appears to be sexism free. Disney seemed to have toned down their sexism in 2016. Wreck it Ralph had the female ninja warrior (Calhoun) and Big Hero 6 had its \"woman up\" line and frozen had no redeemable male characters with a backbone.

            "content": "Jon Favreau's 2016 remake of the 1967 animated classic of the same name is not only full of heart and excellent adventure but it also boasts arguably the most impressive CGI ever put on screen. Entire landscapes and rainforests are created digitally along with the sparse animal life inhabiting these settings. The film is bursting with life as we witness the seamless interactions between the CGI and our single human actor. It is immensely impressive and baffling to think that this entire world was created from thousands of hours of meticulous and detailed work, but the awe doesn't just stop there as Jungle Book manages to be incredibly entertaining fun as well as an unquestionable technical feat. Jungle Book features excellent voice acting from a cast of talented actors and actresses such as Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Scarlett Johansson and a singing Christopher Walken as the towering King Louie. The film only features one human actor, played by the young Neel Sethi. At only 10 years of age, Sethi had to interact with animals that weren't even there, which can prove to be difficult as some of his acting was questionable. It's hard to fault Sethi for this, as interaction with CGI is difficult without proper direction, and sometimes the scenes of Sethi's shared screen- time with the CGI creations aren't directed too well. Moments like this are infrequent, but it is noticeable when Sethi is clearly not looking wherever his character should be. Jungle Book tells a story that somewhat follows that of the original, but features different developments while also excluding some. The story has been criticized for it's lack of substance but I never found that to be an issue. Characters had simple motivations and the story is well told, making it easy for anyone to follow while only rarely feeling dumbed-down for children. Jungle Book ranks among my favorite films of the year simply because of it's simplicity and just how enjoyable it is. There are scenes of thrilling adventure, heartwarming character interactions and a constant ability to charm and entertain the viewer. There are times where the child actor's performance is questionable and the story eventually begins to run thin, but Jungle Book still managed to be an exceptionally engaging and fun Disney film. It captures the magic of the original and gives the new generation their version, this time with phenomenal use of CGI and excellent voice acting. Whether or not you enjoyed this film, it should be credited that Jungle Book created an entire world in a studio, which should be more than enough to at least earn your respect.",

            "content": "I was very excited about the live-action remake of the Jungle Book, and rightly so. With an astonishing list of actors with different voices and practically never before seen animation, all that it needed to shine was a good story. The Jungle Book is as familiar, an old book by Rudyard Kipling that in 1967 was adapted by Disney into the musical cartoon film most of us probably has seen. The orphan Mowgli has peacefully grown up in the jungle with a pack of wolves, but danger threatens when the tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) demands that he should be turned over to him. Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) fearing for his life, takes him through the jungle to the man village to return him to his own kind.The new Jungle Book hardly disappoints you. The animation is stunning and I can't at times make out if it is a real jungle or not. The story is deliberately made more serious, probably to distance itself a bit from the childish tone of the original. Even if I know the story well, I still shudder uncomfortably when Shere Khan or the snake Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) makes an entrance. All the classic scenes are more or less here but still always in new ways mixed with surprise moments that makes it impossible for one to sit back and relax in the chair. For example King Louie (Christopher Walken), is remade into a gigantic scary extinct ape. I also need to give praise to Neel Sethi who plays Mowgli, practically the one thing in the film that isn't animated. For never having acted before, he carries the film firmly and constantly with a daring curiosity that makes me feel like a coward for not daring to watch when he approaches enormous elephants.On deeper levels there are a lot to take away from The Jungle Book. It is after all a story about an orphan that in different environments than where he is from and among totally different species, must find a family and a place to belong. I definitely think that there are a lot of everyday questions about acceptance and tolerance embedded into the story and that just makes the film even better. Humour and serious moments are freshly mixed together, especially when the bear Baloo (Bill Murray) enters the story. Also Bagheera and Baloo are here just like in the original, a great duo that combines each other with humor and severity. I would say that Mowgli throughout the film, takes himself through he jungle to meet all the fun and scary characters and in the process becomes a human being. We also of course get a mandatory climax at the end that the story slowly builds up to. Definitely the best live-action remake by Disney so far. Perhaps the next gem could be the upcoming Beauty and the Beast, but that's in the future. For now, enjoy the Jungle Book.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",

            "content": "Did anyone ask for another live action remake of The Jungle Book? Well, someone did, and we got it anyway. Was it better than the other versions? Not so much better than the original cartoon, but better than the Jason Scott Lee version from 1995. I do believe they did pick the right director in Jon Favreau though. Now, I loved the book. And I loved all the characters from the book. Truthfully, one of my favorite characters is Kaa. And in this movie, there is only one scene with that snake and yet again moved to an antagonist role, making him/her the role of the cobra. Like Kaa several of the other characters weren't even used in the right way. Some were killed off rather quickly, and others weren't even used in a speaking manner. It just seemed the filmmakers took out a poll on who everyone thought the best characters were and used them instead of the others. One of the worst parts of the movie was that they changed the ending considerably. Not in a good manner either. It hurt the movie the most in my opinion. The ending was always the best part of the other versions. Mowgli walks out of the jungle to see someone he finds absolutely beautiful. They walk off together and everything works out for everyone. Even the animals. Here, Mowgli stays in the jungle. Where's the joy in that? It's nowhere, that's where. I'm not saying the entire movie was bad. The dialogue worked great. Showing how Mowgli grew up with the animals trying to do better than them was a brilliant idea for the movie. The best part of the movie was the animation. Most of the animals did look quite real, however there was one flaw. Yes, the animals are bigger than Mowgli, but they didn't need to make the animals bigger than what they were. Kaa was the exception. He/She was always bigger than most pythons (at least they didn't make the snake an anaconda). This is a great family movie. Get the kids together, a big bowl of popcorn, a nice couch to cuddle up on that would fit everyone reasonably, and enjoy this movie. I know your kids would.Rating: 7 out of 10That's it for me folks.",

            "content": "I would have given The Jungle Book 10 stars had it taken better advantage of using Shere Khan's wickedness as a means to underscore more clearly why he's gone \"bad,\" namely that humans have made him into what he is. A very unfortunate outcome of such an incredibly well done film is that younger audiences might assume Tigers are bad and deserve bad treatment. It would be so much better if we had the opposite happen: That after seeing The Jungle Book younger movie goers fall deeply in love with ALL non-human beings and come to better understand that everyone (not just humans) has a right to thrive, ultimately growing up into more humane adults than previous generations that save what is left of wildlife and its environment on our planet. I appreciate that there was a desire to adhere to Rudyard Kipling's original tale, as well as the 1967 animated Disney film, but times have changed since then and if Jon Favreau and Disney could have diverted just a little from the original story to connect with what is so important today, and consequentially also make a crucial positive future impact, they would have been more than justified and lauded for it.To call me an animal lover is, as might already be clear, an understatement, so when a film like this is made, aside from getting profoundly moved throughout every scene because of the fantastic visual effects that make you feel like you have that magical connection with what makes our planet so beautiful and precious, it's also a cause for major celebration because it's undeniable that we finally have the technology in film making to tell stories that can genuinely do good and create much needed change. This kind of story can now feel and look completely real, and allow our imaginations to build bridges to deeper understandings of often neglected realms like where we come from and the importance of taking care of the only home we have, along with all of its inhabitants. I'm counting on that we will be very mindful with how we use this technology.This is a genuinely phenomenal film, aside from the Shere Khan character development thing. Please see it. It's like nothing else you've experienced before....it's simply mind-blowingly brilliant!",

            "content": "The Jungle Book is directed by Jon Favreau and is another version of the classic story. And this is a fantastic film with so much to love. The entire film is CGI and I honestly don't understand how because the film looks so real. The animals, the jungle, everything looks so real. The voice work is also phenomenal. My favorites were Bill Murray as Baloo and Idris Elba as Shere Khan. Baloo is the comic relief while Shere Khan is the fierce and extremely menacing villain. Neel Sethi is in his first movie here as Mowgli and he's terrific. He is able to show great emotion throughout when he's not even looking at real people or things, which is remarkable.Other voices include Ben Kingsley, Lupita Nyong'o, and Christopher Walken, and everyone is really good. The story is pretty straight forward and it moves at a pretty quick rate. There are barely any dull moments in the film, but when there are, they're really emotionally captivating. This brings me to my ONE problem with the movie. The scene with Mowgli and Kaa, the snake, kind of comes out of nowhere and completely slows the movie's momentum that was being built before. It was cool to watch but it felt a little misplaced in the movie. Other than that, this is an excellent film. The best aspect about The Jungle Book is its characters since they're so likable and the villain Shere Khan is very well realized and his motivations are clear.Overall, The Jungle Book is an excellent adaption of the source material. It's witty, funny, entertaining, and emotional to make for an enjoyable film for audiences of all ages. The Jungle Book gets an A.",

This movie excels in the CGI and VFX and Neel Sethi as the sole artist not created by VFX and CGI is very good.

I hope my review can be seen as helpful to sensible movie-goers who also have a fulfilling life in many other areas besides analyzing cinema.I did not go to this film with my kids (13,11,8 yrs old, respectively), in order to see Citizen Kane. I have already actively viewed that film with them and they preferred Vertigo to it, go figure! So, consider the company I was keeping ... But I ask that you also consider this: We paid to see this for, wait for it, FUN. Yep. We wanted to go and have fun at the movies as an entertaining and even a bit enlightening story came to life through motion pictures. Be they \"real\" or computer-generated. We didn't care.Fun and entertainment. Twas the goal. How dare we? Well, we dared. Time to be pompous about 'staying true to Kipling' tomorrow, we surmised.The Jungle Book delivered fun and entertainment in spades.Therefor, I applaud Disney. I would have paid more to see this. It seemingly delighted all ages present - I asked some of the elderly in the audience and other families like mine sitting in our vicinity if they enjoyed it and all had rave reviews. I may go see it again with my wife. Surprising for me, but true.The most surprising part though was just how engrossing the animals were. In fact, when they sing, you have to snap out of the trance Disney has you in a little - reminiscent of how a certain snake puts his/her victims in a similar state. I liked all the songs and all the voice acting. To think that this young actor and the studio did all of this in front of studio green screens is astounding. Go and have some fun! It's okay.

Does it beat the original 1967 animated film, not even close.What's missing from the Jungle Book that was in the 67' was the emotional impact of the film. This one felt a tad like the Amazing Spider-man 2 in that it tried to set up a sequel. I didn't enjoy that aspect. There's also a scene missing that I absolutely loved from the 67' version. I wont spoil it for you.Mowgli played by Neel Sethi had the arduous task of reacting and interacting with almost nothing. He was believable in some scenes and in others felt stiff. Not bad for his first major movie.Baloo played by Bill Murray could have been used more in the film. I felt that maybe a couple of his scenes were deleted. Bill Murray was the perfect choice for Baloo.Bageera played by Ben Kingsley didn't give me the same feeling of ownership and protection that Sebastion Cabot did in the original. I don't think it's Ben Kingsley fault though, I think it was probably the animators who did a lot of the non-verbal expression and communication that isn't quite there. Then again I am talking about the expressions of an animated panther.I couldn't decide if I enjoyed Idris Elba's Shere Khan or George Sanders'. After some reflection I believe that Elba's was a much more intimidating and ferocious tiger.I've only seen two Jon Favreau films I didn't thoroughly enjoy and that was Elf and Cowboys and Aliens. I know I'm weird. Jon Favreau did a wonderful job directing a movie that could have easily been another Jupiter Ascending, but The Jungle Book will be for many generations the definitive Jungle Book, but for me. The 67' will always be #1 in my heart.Verdict: If you haven't seen it yet, regardless of your age, go watch it in theaters hopefully in 3-D and XD digital.",

            "content": "This movie really touched me deep inside. It was beautiful, gripping, intense, emotional, and it really gets you thinking about your human existence and what it really means. The Jungle Book followed Mowgli, an orphan boy raised by wolves with a black panther as a guardian. Through the film, we get to see Mowgli face many challenges and temptations to discover his place in the world, with the help of his too friends Bagheera and Baloo. (Their friendship is very cute if I were to say so myself, something that makes you feel warm inside). The story itself has a way of getting deep in to your heart, and before you know it, you will find yourself in love with this movie and its simple but meaningful plot. Mowgli, Baloo and Bagheera are beautifully crafted and beautiful flawed characters that no one can help but adore. But like I've just mentioned, the plot itself is quite simple and at some point even slow, so if you are a person who wants a joyride of a movie then this might not be the thing for you. The one thing I don't like about this movie though - and the reason that I'm giving it a 9 instead of 10 - is that the ending just doesn't feel complete to me, I generally don't mind \"kind of\" open endings but this one just doesn't feel finished. I just expected more. Overall in the film industry you'll find a lot of film that you can call awesome, cool or even great. But the Jungle Book is one of the very few masterpiece that a man can call beautiful, and because of that, it's worth the watch.",

The rhythm, the creative ideas... everything makes this film a magnificent rendering of Disney's previous takes on the novel. PG-13 at its best. Great voices and characters. Great plot and development. A treasure for all ages. Mowgli, though, is closer to the book and much, much difficult and rough. A different (the first ever) take that drives the spectator to new heights. The rendering by motion-capture is perhaps the best job ever put on film (even by Harry Potter's and The Lord of the Rings' standards) until 2020. The story is not for everyone because of its radical departure from Disney's more approachable narrative. Both films are mesmerizing and revolutionary. Different takes with different technologies make this story a very new experience. The reason why this happens with both films is because those technologies do not interfere with the story, they provide lots of resources for the viewer to him or her glued to their seats.

Up 'til that point, I found every single one of Disney's live-action adaptations to be disappointing; their screenplays were boring and lacking substance.However, I was surprised when the film received staggering box- office numbers and glowing reviews. I decided to give the film a chance - and found myself blown away. Not only is this Disney's best live-action adaptation to date, but one of the best live-action adaptations of a classic children's tale - period. \"The Jungle Book\" is a visual spectacle that boasts top-notch animation (unsurprisingly) and convincing CGI. The script is fantastic in that it improves on the original premise of the animated classic by mixing it with a thrilling sense of drama and adventure. The story focuses less on musical numbers and more on Mowgli's journey and the conflicts that arise among the animals over the protagonist's true identity. Most importantly, in my opinion, is that Justin Marks (writer) made a smart decision to present Mowgli as a smart and resourceful kid who can act on his own rather than a clueless troublemaker. Marks could have made this film a painful experience to sit through if he decided on the latter but luckily, he didn't.The plot is also a lot darker than that of the original's - there are a couple of twists in there that really caught me off-guard. Luckily, the film is balanced with a number of lighthearted sequences that recalls fond memories of the original animated film.The cast is superb. Newcomer Neel Sethi captures the essence of Mowgli with reverence and heft - he receives top marks for both his sadder scenes with his wolf clan and his joyful scenes with Baloo; he also does his action set pieces with solid determination. Additionally, all of the voice actors do a great job with their respective characters - but Idris Elba and Bill Murray are the standouts. Elba delivers a spine-chilling and brutish performance as Shere Khan while Murray is hilarious as the relaxed and lovable Baloo. If Disney allowed their filmmakers more time to elevate their future live-action adaptations to the same level of quality as \"The Jungle Book\", I would be more than happy to see Disney continue making these kinds of films.",

            "content": "Disney has yet again done the magic! Offering a blend of live-action and photo-realistic computer-generated effects, this action-packed 3D adventure is for movie lovers of all ages. The Story of Mowgli (the orphan man-cub raised as a wolf and hated by the ferocious Bengal tiger Shere Khan) is a tale that has captured the world's collective imagination since Kipling wrote it in 1894. The best way to enjoy this movie is to watch it in 3D. Visually stunning and expertly acted, with some heart-stopping thrills and action sequences, The Jungle Book has young Neel Sethi as Mowgli, a toddler raised by wolfs and panther. Sethi (Mowgli) is remarkable for an actor his age, especially considering the fact that he had to act with puppets on the set as all the co-stars (the animals) were computer-generated. Shere Khan is the villain and the character that comes across as the most impressive and powerful. He hates Mowgli with a vengeance - because the boy is a man-cub and he believes that man is the destroyer of the jungle. Shere Khan is right in his own way but he doesn't realize or bother about the fact that Mowgli loves the jungle and wants to live with his wolf family and animal friends. Thus, to protect his own family and himself, Mowgli flees and find help in shape of adorable sloth bear, Baloo. But this is not the end of Mowgli's troubles and I will not disclose more of the story line for those who didn't know the famous jungle tale. Thankfully, Disney doesn't give us an overdose of songs or it would have disturbed the story-telling. The Jungle Book effortlessly merges comedy, action, drama and gives us a Disney masterpiece to behold.",

            "content": "The Jungle Book follows the story of Mowgli, a foundling child who is raised in the jungle by wolves. When animals fear he will become a danger to the forest when he grows up, the panther Bagheera tries to guide him back to the human world. Mowgli is pursued by the tiger Sher-Kahn, who wants to kill him, and he meets Baloo, a bear whom he befriends.\nI have learned to be sceptical of Disney remakes and sequals, especially the live-action remakes of the last few years. I felt that, usually, they didn't add anything new or overall be any kind of improvement over the original. This one, however, is truly remarkable: It resembles the story of the original book more than the first film, it has absolutely amazing visuals, and has well-written characters. Especially Sher-Kahn, the tiger, is more interesting in this version because he has actual motivations and reasons for his desire to kill Mowgli, and we get to know more about Mowgli's relation to the wolf pack where he was raised.\nHowever, it probably isn't suited for children, as it is quite violent and features scenes that can be quite scary for children at times. If they want to watch a movie, then it would probably be better to show them the old movie.",

            "content": "Rudyard Kipling's classic tale The Jungle Book, now CGI-assisted, is a concoction of tactful direction, soulful music and powerful modern-day graphics. It has the right mix of everything and the feel of a blockbuster.The movie opens with an intense chase where Mowgli competes with his canine brothers while his friend Bagheera, a black panther, guides him through the forest. Soon, the narrator tells us about a terrible drought that grips the land. The law of the Jungle forbids animals to hunt near the only source of water and everyone including Sher Khan, who holds a grudge against Mowgli and wants him dead, respect the truce. It is near this watering hole that Sher Khan threatens to kill the man-cub, Mowgli, when the rains return and the truce ends. This leaves the family of Mowgli, a pack of wolves, with a difficult choice\u2014 to face the wrath of Sher Khan by keeping Mowgli with them or to abandon him. At this point, Bagheera suggests that Mowgli be taken to the man village where he would be safe. Reluctantly, the wolves allow Bagheera to take Mowgli with him. But Sher Khan attacks them in the first part of their Journey.Mowgli narrow escapes Sher Khan but is now alone and vulnerable in the Jungle. There, he meets Kaa, a large python, who tells Mowgli about his father and Sher Khan. Mowgli lets his guard down and is about to become Kaa's food when Baloo, the most likable character in the film, saves him. They get to know each other and Mowgli helps him in collecting honey for his hibernation, which later turns out to be an innocent lie. The story now reaches a point where Sher Khan has murdered Akela, the pack's leader, in an attempt to lure Mowgli back. Mowgli with his two powerful allies, Baloo and Bagheera, and some new friends have to fight Sher Khan not only to save Mowgli's life but to free the Jungle from Sher Khan's cruel rule. The movie never presents a dull moment and its tasteful music complements the build up to some of the most exciting scenes. The voice of characters given by accomplished artists is nothing short of a treat. The graphics make up this movie's soul\u2014 the vivid landscapes and most importantly the animals, both big and small, have been rendered with life-like precision. Yet, the length of the movie is disappointingly short, forcing some scenes to look like they were running against a clock. But that is just about the only complain anyone can have against The Jungle Book.",

Christopher Walken as a menacing King Louis Scarlett Johansen at Kaa and a MASTERFUL Ben Kingsley as BagheeraFrankly I LOVED this version and will definitely be going back for a second look.

            "content": "I won't lie when I say I went into this movie with such high expectations. I loved the original Jungle Book movie and the trailers had me really pumped up. The best part is that most of my expectations were met. The CGI was so beautifully done it slipped my mind that there weren't real animals in that movie and that it was effects. All the voice acting did amazing, with Bill Murray making Baloo the bear we all love, Ben Kingsley turning Bagheera into a fierce and fantastic panther, and Idris Elba turning the rather cocky and posh-like tiger into a true villain that stands your hair on end. The plot, although slow to start, not only takes elements from the 1967 original, but adds in new material to prevent the movie from being a modern copy. Despite King Louie and Kaa's roles being dimmed down a bit, it's all for good reason.There were few things that bothered me in the movie. For one, Bare Necessities was done very well and I couldn't stop smiling the entire time, but King Louie singing I Want To Be Like You didn't fit with the monkey that was portrayed in this film. Another was Baloo's and Mowgli's relationship. It went from being reluctant to best friend so fast, I didn't have time to think. The bear almost took the kid instantly, yet a few minutes earlier it seemed like he was just using him This all fades away once we see how good they are for each other, and how much the bear cares for the kid.All in all, this is an amazing remake, which is quite rare in the film business, and it doesn't matter if you've read the book, seen the 1967 animated original, done both or neither. You will enjoy watching this movie.",

As a die hard fan of the original animated Disney classic, I was very worried that this version would be rubbish but it actually lives up to the original in all areas, heck I dare say it might exceed it.The cast is absolutely spot on. Bill Murray as Baloo has to be one of the greatest casting decisions of all time. Can't think of a better person to play Baloo. Idris Elba is menacing but eerily suave as Shere Khan. Terrified me in every scene he was in and raised the tension of the movie very high. Ben Kingsley as Bagheera delivers a very wise performance. Scarlett Johannson is quite seductive as Kaa. Lupita Nyong'o is emotionally heart wrenching as Rhaska, Mowgli,s adoptive mother. Neel sethi who plays Mowgli is very impressive, for a child actor. He does very well acting around green screen. Very witty with his line delivery too. Christopher walken as King Louie was the only weak link in an otherwise impressive cast for me. His \"godfather\" like accent speaking voice wise is quite good but his singing \"I wanna be like you\" kind of threw me out the movie for a minute considering how weird it was and slightly out of place.The cgi is absolutely magnificent. The environment is stunning and the animals look so natural. But what I truly loved about this film was the nostalgic feel of it all. From the opening scenes, which match the opening scenes of the original complete with the original music to Baloo and Mowgli singing \"bare necessities\" while floating down the river, it just made me feel so enchanted. I even cried in odd places of the film cause the magnificence of the film overwhelmed me and I couldn't believe my most favorite Disney film had come to life so magically. The only minor problems I had with it were King Louie's singing and *spoiler alert* baloo's attempt to make Mowgli go to the man village as I felt it was a bit flat and forced.But overall, I really enjoyed this film. I think it's gonna become a classic in its own right just like the original has.",

After that, the Disney film disgusted me, mostly because Disney took WAY too many liberties from the book, americanized the original material, and took out all of its dignity and seriousness. I went to see this second live-action remake (yes, there is a previous one from the 1990's) in hopes that it would be more loyal to the book, would have the book's gravitas, and would have nothing to do with the animated film. Or at least that there would be an equilibrium between fans of the animated movie and fans of the book. And DEFINITELY that there would be no songs from the animated movie. But I was wrong. My hopes were crushed. This film is practically a carbon copy of the animated film. It appeals ONLY to fans of the animated film, not the book. And much to my distress, it does reprise the songs \"The Bare Necessities\" and \"I Wanna Be Like You\". When those songs came on, I actually involuntarily put my fingers in my ears and scowled up at the screen with rage and frustration. Not only was it embarrassing, it was pathetic. Oh, and top it all off with kids in the theater who sang along. For Disney cynics like me, this is pure torture. On the bright side, however, it is refreshing to watch a good old-fashioned family-friendly adventure film in the theater. One that also has a heart. Because of that, I have the generosity of giving this film a 7/10.",

This movie is yet to amaze others who have not seen it and always will. The Junlge Book contains everything a Disney movie should, the CGI (Computer Generated Interfaces) is extraordinary. The acting and voice acting is great, the story is great. In many ways this could be the greatest movie of 2016. The characters are introduced in new and interesting ways. When Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is told by Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) that he needs to return to the village for his own safety because a fearsome tiger named Shere Khan (Idris Elba) is hunting him, Mowgli then meets a freedom-loving bear named Baloo (Bill Murray) they help each other in various ways. Near the end of the movie when Mowgli confronts Shere Khan, i was biting my finger nails, the ending was amazing, it was fabulous and it couldn't be any better.

Rudyard Kipling's classic story, once retold by one of the world's most inspiring men, has now been retold once again in this epic CGI sculpted world. From the music, composed by John Debney, to the story, retold by Justin Marks, this film was a born-again classic. Who says you can't mess with the original? While the acting fell a bit flat, the story and the visual effects did not. This movie had, undoubtedly, the BEST visual effects I think I have ever seen in a film thus far. Never have I seen a film with such an impeccable and lively plot either. I truly loved that Kaa, played by Scarlett Johansson, was able to deliver Mowgli's back story. I also loved that the writer incorporated the music that we so dearly loved from the original Disney classic into this new-age classic. I must also mention the outstanding attention to detail when alluding to the original film. At some points, I may or may not have teared up thinking about the man that put this story on screen for the first time. I guess that's what great storyteller's do.

            "content": "Chances are if you grew up in India, you would remember Mowgli fondly. Jungle Book got back memories that my mind had hidden away somewhere. Like the Bare Necessities song. And the Hindi series of the characters had this other song called 'Chaddi Pehen Ke Phool Khila Hai' that translates into 'You have bloomed like a flower in your underwear' :)The beauty of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book is the simplicity with which he brought to life animals from the jungles of India and the man-cub Mowgli who has been brought up there. For the uninitiated, Jungle Book is about Mowgli who was rescued by Bhageera, a panther and handed over to the wolves to raise him as a part of their pack. The other central characters are Baloo the bear, Kaa the gigantic snake, and Shere Khan, the almighty tiger. Jungle Book was published in 1894 and since then there have been countless adaptations of the book and the characters.Jungle Book, 2016 is directed by Jon Favreau of the Chef and Iron Man 1 and 2 fame. He takes the central characters described above and does wonders - I just loved the new movie. Plot: Jon Favreau stuck to the main plot of Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi) being part of the pack of wolves and Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) as the main caretaker. Sher Khan (brilliantly played by Idris Elba) is introduced as someone who hates humans and it doesn't matter if its a grown up or a young kid - he wants to devour Mowgli. Mowgli runs but gets caught by Kaa (Scarlett Johansson). She is about to finish him and Baloo (Bill Murrey) saves him. With Bagheera and Baloo by his side, King Louie (Christopher Walken) is brought in who is the king of the apes and wants to use Mowgli to create fire and become the king of the jungle. The only difference is that in this movie they show a Gigantopithecus instead of an orangutan as Louie and he is just amazing. The rest of the story about what happens when Louie tells Mowgli that Shere Khan killed the leader of the wolf pack. Why you should definitely watch it?Nostalgia - I almost cried when I heard Bare Necessities - it made me go back to my childhood when I used to watch the Disney or the Hindi versions. If you haven't seen it before, still watch it because its directed really well, the story and editing is tight and the animation is just kick-ass. Characters - Whether you know them or not, it doesn't matter. You will fall in love with the characters and the animals. There is a certain warmth when it comes to jungle stories be it Lion King or Born Free - the rules of the animal kingdom somehow just make sense. Its the same here, you will like them all - from the evil Shere Khan to the mighty King Louie to the smallest of the animals shown in the movie. Apparently there are over 70 animal species shown in the movie. A special mention for Neel Sethi as Mowgli - this kid was just superb. He had the heart, the daring and the vulnerability all bundled up in one. And it definitely didn't look like it was his first time acting. Animation - The animation is just great - the jungles and the animals really come to life. I thought it would be stupid to see the animals talk, but I was mistaken. You still might find it weird at first when you see Bagheera talk but within 10 minutes into the movie, you will see it is absolutely normal for the animals to talk. What I didn't likeI would have liked all the animals to talk the same. But they portray some as not talking, like the monkeys. And the story is set in the jungles of India, maybe Mowgli should have had an Indian accent as well as the animals? But I am really nitpicking here. Go watch it - alone, with your partner, parents, kids, grandparents, grand kids - there is something for everybody - watch it once, twice, thrice or many times. One of the best movies I have seen this year.",

The animals in close shot were very detailed, the fur, the emotions were very real, however, from mid to long shots, the CGI went from good to bad, might as well be a bunch of silhouettes. But, the lighting was possibly the best part visually, brilliantly arranged and changed to decide the mood for the scene. The soundtrack was basically the same as the original 1967 Disney movie but with different tunes, instruments and quite a nice change of genre. Some singing was a little off-tuned and off-beat, but all well considering it's a child actor. However, the plot was possibly the worst part, basically the same as the book and the 1967 cartoon but with dozens more of plot holes and dialogue errors. The ending was something you'd called anti-climatic. Nonetheless, the narrative was quite great with a few small interesting twists you wouldn't think would make it in a PG-13 movie. Nonetheless, the strong character development are more than make up for it. Mowgli's actor still has a way to go.

So he runs away, but then realizes that the jungle is his home and decides to stay there by scaring all the animals with fire and killing the tiger. This is a typical child-hero movie for children to watch. The child seems too small to do anything that he does in the movie, but as it is \"just a movie\", it doesn't really matter. I actually expected something much better when I watched the trailer, something more imaginative and visually pleasing. But what I found was something predictable and ordinary. The story starts off pretty well, and the scenes with the bear and some other animals are fun and cute. But like all the other movies just like this one, the child-hero realizes that he can somehow \"protect\" himself and his friends and family from the evil tiger. He uses the thing that animals are most afraid of- the fire. With it, he succeeds in scaring and showing off to all the animals and killing the tiger.The visual effects of the movie was of course good quality, but it didn't really catch my eyes. The thing that I liked the most about the movie were the scenes where the bear would sing- it was actually entertaining. But overall, it felt like the story was lacking detail, and just focused on getting to the victory at the end, and there were little creative aspects in any way in the movie.",

            "content": "First of all, I think 9 out of 10 people can agree that this was a fantastic film and that it was outstanding in nearly every aspect of it. The Jungle Book is a live-action/CGI fantasy film that retells the story of Mowgli, an orphaned human boy who is steered and protected by his animal guardians that have become his parents due to circumstances that have already been notified. It shows the story of Mowgli who has set out on a journey of self-discovery while dodging for his life (literally) the threatening Shere Khan. Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli and does an excellent job at that, the casting team made a very clear cut decision. Throughout the film he is the only human that actually appears on the screen apart from the beginning when we get a glimpse of his father trying to protect him from Shere Khan. The computer generated imagery (CGI) is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the most realistic to appear on screen for a long time other than Tarzan (2016) in which it was so believable it didn't even enter my mind at some points that it was CGI, with the development of digital technology this is becoming and will start becoming more of a convention and it will also appear on our screens. I think the main reason as to why this has always been such a successful film is because the storyline never gets old although it does follow Todorov's theory of Equilibrium it will still be told for years to come and I'm sure that there will be many more editions made of it. In addition, the casting was brilliant throughout I mean lets take a second to appreciate Bill Murray as Baloo, the man is a legend!! Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he's in. The cinematography and videography as well as nearly all other film aspects were on point although it was largely influenced by the use of CGI it was still very much focused on.

            "content": "This Rudyard Kipling classic was a big task for Jon Favreau with the world watching to see if he would do the story justice. Starting with the aspect of vocal performance, this movie packed an all star cast of which would make any movie buff overly excited. Bill Murray as a friendly bear, Ben Kingsley as a wise panther, Idris Elba as an cunning, evil and strong tiger, Scarlett Johansson as a seductive snake, and Christopher Walken as a greedy singing orangutan. In regards to voice acting this movie deserves applause. although the main (and pretty well only actual actor) Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, has a week array of acting skills but I wouldn't expect much more from a child his age. My first thoughts after watching this movie had to do with the obvious message about the relationship between humanity and nature. Humans are viewed as a destructive force that brings destruction wherever they are. This is the fundamental reason Elbas Tiger wants Mowgli dead. The music and songs really emphasised the feel of each scene. Although some would argue that the lack of sound and music created a empty unfulfilling space. I feel as though the 'lack' actually created a more exciting feel. This movie fulfilled every aspect of cinema extraordinaire that i would expect from an adventure film. Favreau has fulfilled this amazing display of a great work and has succeeded in taken audiences on a adventure journey filled with comedy, action and suspense.",

            "content": "Honestly, the movie is solid, it has much of the feel of the original. The songs are preserved, and the re-cast voice actors do well. It's been called \"darker\", but I just think it feels a bit more real. When things are drawn like goofy cartoons, you lose the gravity of real life. When you have live action and CGI, however, you re-gain some of said gravity. Just as an example: King Louie, a giant ape, is set in the shadows of an old temple, and it makes him look absolutely beastly. But what can you do? This is the medium, it's beautiful, but when you're watching an old, flat cartoon... you do of course lose the weight, the atmosphere, of things like the collapse of a building. So the \"darkness\" isn't really dark, it's just something which looks incredibly close to reality coming to call. A snake that looks real is much more foreboding than a cartoon snake. There's a bit of violence, but it's just animals fighting. There's no blood, it's all implied, and it has an ending that is equally as happy as the original film. \"Darker\" is a stretch.So, I would have given the movie a good 9 stars, save for one aspect. The animal figures look like they're out of the late 90's. They're quite beautifully textured, but when compared to the figures in say, Zootopia, who have been rendered so carefully and with such precision, it's disappointing. Zootopia's characters had INDIVIDUAL HAIRS and there was a program for the characters during the animation, which ran SIMULATED REALISTIC WIND, to make it look real. Since these two movies came out at roughly the same time, I have to give this movie flak for not living up to potential. When we know they can make the goofiest little animated characters look like living, breathing creatures, we shouldn't have these animal characters that look, quite often, very wooden in movement, and very cardboard around the edges. You can do better, Disney. I know that Zootopia was done by Pixar and that the Jungle Book was done the Jim Henson studio/ company. But it's 2016. If your animals only look slightly better than the animals in Doctor Dolittle (from 1998), then you need to figure out what you're doing wrong. I have video games from five or six years ago, that have cut scenes with more sophistication. Get on the ball.",

It does look like Mowguli he is talking to the animals and the animals are talking back to him. But however the few scenes you can tell he is not talking directly at the animal because he is on a sound stage in the real physical world while the animals were all CGI characters inside a computer. In other words, he was looking into space because animals were not there. In a few shots, you can tell he was superimposed on it because he was a little too bright compared to the rest of the scene. They even worked three of the songs from Disney's original animated version of this into the movie.It was well acted and I believed in every single character. However, I was a little disappointed, but not much, in Bill Murray's portrayal Baloo. It was a little flat because he played it too laid back. The bear was more of a con man and hustler to which I have seen Murray can play that type of character before. A little more on the hustle please.This version is a little dark and scary. It may not be appropriate for real little children like under five. Particularly the Shere Khan scenes.However this film does includes many of the story details usually left out of all the other films. It is the best version of Kipling's story because it remained really faithful to that book despite that facts that in the book King Louie is not in the book and that the Snake Kea is a friend and adviser to Moguli and not a villain.",

In my personal review of the film, it was much better then the old 1967 film version of Kipling's work. The chemistry between the wolf pack and Mowgli was much more satisfactory. Mowgli's adopted parent's were given a much better role in the film. The villains were much more terrifying (in a good way). I just wish that they could permanently do away with the musical numbers (it was not a musical, save for a brief reprisal of \"I wanna be like you\" by Christopher Walken's King Louie). Scarlett Johannson's Kaa was disappointingly put in a memorable one scene, when she was hinted to be a major character in the promotional material. Another thing I wish for is that there was more connections between the antagonists. In the film, Kaa and King Louie were one-scene secondary antagonists, with Idris Elba's Shere Khan being the primary antagonist in the full film. Both Kaa and King Louie seemed to be aware of Shere Khan's existence, but none of them seemed to have a connection. The physical confrontations between Shere Khan and Mowgli's companions were a satisfying and entertaining scene to watch. The Special Effects were amazing. In the film, only Neel Sethi was not computer animated. Everything else, including the locations were all computer animated. All in all, it was a pretty good film",

Every inch of the forest is mapped out with incredible detail. Every leaf, every fur, every spark of fire, everything managed to come to life in the hands of the animators and director Jon Favreau.The movie also boasts a strong voice actors, starring from Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray and Idris Elba to Scarlett Johansson and Lupita Nyong'o. Neel Sethi also gave an amazing performance as Mowgli. Given he has to work with motion capture, green screens and fake pieces of jungle all the time, he manages to deliver a satisfying performance.The storytelling and pacing of this movie is a bit slow, with the final duration of the movie clocking at 2 hours. Each character introduced plays an important part in the movie, and none of the subplots seem to be wasted.

The shaping of these characters has a certain concept of breaking the convention, but it also shows the personality of various people in this era.Not only that, the description of the red flower in the film is also unique, but it also warns the world to protect the environment. The red flower can bring warmth and hope to people, and it can also bring darkness and despair to the world.In the same way, the existence of each race has its indispensable family rules and beliefs. Just like the wolves, they always keep in mind their own family rules and beliefs. In the film, there are many scenes of chanting family rules. This also illustrates the lack and pursuit of faith in contemporary society.

I do miss the great Phil Harris as Baloo, but Bill Murray's Balloo is lovable and entirely sympathetic. All the casting choices are terrific...I would argue with the reviewer who didn't care for Neel Sethi's Mowgli; the kid is no Olivier, but Mowgli doesn't require a great thespian, he has to be likeable and winsome, and able to elicit a little pathos (frickin' kid is an orphan...). The heavy lifting in Jungle Book is done by the animals, and this production is aces across the board.I'm pretty old, so I'm not very interested in how convincing the CGI is; I grew up with Rudolph The Rednose Reindeer and Godzilla Versus Bambi.

Unfortunately as we know, unless an American takes the prominent role in a movie, then American audiences just won't show interest in it at the box office. This is an ongoing tragedy.

            "content": "I was concerned that Disney is trying to reboot their animated films into live-action ones. I was already burnt by \"Alice in Wonderland\". So, I was skeptical with \"The Jungle Book\". But, having heard that people liked it, even Angry Joe, I decided to watch it.What I can say is that the film's actually good.It's more or less of a re-telling of the animated film from 1967, with some minor changes. Thus, Bagheera found Mowgli as an infant and had the wolves adopted him. Eventually, the wolves have to give him up because of Shere Khan and his hatred towards humans. Along the way to the \"Man Village\", Mowgli gets to meet the elephants, Kaa, Baloo, and Louie and his monkey minions.As you might realize, the art (especially the realistic CGI) and storytelling seem impressive, especially when the film shows that the dry season exposing a monumental rock in the lake causes both predators and preys to drink from the same water in \"truce\". I find it impressive, and how Shere Khan shows up, putting the other animals in line, to give a dire warning about Mowgli.There are two things to note, and one of the two annoys me.What annoyed me was that the movie tried to out-stage the animated film. It even took two lines of Baloo from the original: \"Man Village? They'll ruin him! They'll make a man out of him!\", and \"If anything happens to that boy, I'll never forgive myself.\" The movie re-introduced Baloo and Louie's songs, with lyrics and lengths being altered. I prefer the originals. In Baloo's case, remember how he and Mowgli interacted with stuff all around the forest, scratched their backs, and swam, to illustrate the points in the lyrics? Well, here, Mowgli and Baloo swam the whole time the song was sung. As for Louie, not only they made him King Kong size, they altered the lyrics to complement that too. The original was enjoyable because the other moneys sang along, played instruments, and one of them annoyed Louie. Here though, only Louie sang the whole time. Even the new lines in the lyrics were odd to me. (Don't expect Baloo showing up in a disguise to save Mowgli this time, but he was almost thrown off the cliff.)Both Louie and Baloo, from what I remembered, delayed reading some lines in their lyrics a bit, that the singing felt odd.Still on the topic of annoyances, Shere Khan being a creep to the surviving wolves sounded something straight out of James Bond's \"Spectre\". They both spoke of the demerits of a cuckoo bird.The other note's that the movie does have differences to the animated film.Apart from the absence of Mowgli's new friends, the vultures, Mowgli actually returned to the wolves. Despite warning, after learning that he killed his wolf foster father, he found a torch from the nearest man village to fight Shere Khan... and burning the forest, and scaring his animal friends, in the process... leaving Shere Khan with an \"I told you so\" finger-pointing. The battle was more complex this time, similar to that of Disney's \"Tarzan\", but with fire, making use of the same dead tree that ruined Mowgli's practice at the beginning of the film.Also, Mowgli ended up staying in the forest at the end, in what seems to be a decent ending. So, yeah. He has no girlfriend this time.Overall, it was a good movie, with a few funny moments like \"Bears do not hibernate in the forest\", but it could do without trying to be too much like the animated film by borrowing this or that. I'd recommend this film for family viewing. But, if you want something serious, consider Disney's 1990's live-action Jungle Book film. For a much funnier version, I'd recommend the animated film instead. It even has a bit more of Kaa, and those missing vultures.",

Otherwise, the movie was a vapid valley of fluff story and lackluster substance that was a couple steps down in quality from the joyous original.This movie, compared to Alice in Burtonland and Cinderella, is a better example of what they should have strove for. Enough is similar so that the ol' nostalgia still clicks, but enough is changed that most audiences can accept this film was almost necessary. The voice work by Kingsley, Murray, Nyong'o, and Elba is fantastic. That being said, the musical numbers did not belong in this movie, nor did Christopher Walken the Monkey Man. The storybook credits were the best parts of the movie, for my money. Also, what was with the Scarlett Johansson lounge song at the end?Who knows? Perhaps next year's Beauty and the Beast will upset the original by throwing caution to the wind and daring to be even more inspiring than the original. But I'm not holding out hopes for such, as the original is Already PERFECT!!TL;dr: Disney --> STAHP!",

            "content": "It is a pleasure, as someone born in the sixties, to have re-visited a film and story that was a part of my formative years. I was born in 1963, and as a cub and then a scout (or as my younger sister called them tubs and sprouts), missed out on the Austin Powers- esque hedonistic, flower power era. I was instead the owner of a book that included a 7 inch single containing the soundtrack of the Jungle Book. An unusual 7 inch, as it played at 33 1/3rd rpm and when 'Tinkerbell' rang her little bell, you had to turn to the next page of the book and read along. Of course, the sixties film version is one of my first cinema trips, so, now at the age of 52, it was with some intrigue that I joined the punters at my local world of cine to see what Jon Favreau had done to this classic.What a film! The first thing that struck me was the jungle. There is a slight resemblance to Birdman in that the camera took us on a journey, constantly moving, drawing us along in what seemed a single take. Jungle book has a similar approach to the cinematography. From the moment the Disney logo and fanfare appears, and on this point there is just one of these at the beginning, unlike the number we are normally subjected to, the adapted Disney castle acts as the starting point. The camera then pulls us into this visually stunning set, which in itself is a leading character in the film.Neel Sethi, as Mowgli, leads on that journey, and what a revelation he is. Slightly uncanny, just how he has visually pulled off bringing a 2D character from the page of a book to the three dimensional screen. Great film can do that - seeing and hearing Andy Serkis play Gollum in the Lord of the Rings 'sextuple-ilogy' was similar. I read those books in my teen years and had a visual and sound reference for both and he was just it. Same here, Neel is Mowgli way back in my head in the sixties. But it isn't just his stance, movement or voice, the finest actors always present very nuanced performances on screen - a flicker change of expression, a raise of an eyebrow - it has to be subtle. There is an incredible moment towards the end of this film as Mowgli faces his fear of Shere Khan, were you can just feel that the character has slightly matured. How did this young, unknown actor achieve a subtle change?On this point, I turn to the aspect of fear and the film's rating. I was at a late evening Saturday performance and it was full, many families present with quite young children. They were enthralled and captivated by the film. I am reading a great book, by the philosopher Frank Furedi, about how fear pervades our modern lives. In it, he talks about how we fear everything and how words like safeguarding, vulnerable and victim are applied to everyone and everything these days. Are all children vulnerable, or should we allow them to build resilience and enable them to think for themselves by gaining critical thinking skills? There is mild threat throughout this film - that is its point - but children can deal with that and process it. Back to my childhood in the sixties, Saturday night wouldn't have been complete without hiding behind the sofa when Jon Pertwee was battling Daleks and waking in bed upstairs not yet having worked out that Daleks and stairs don't mix.Favreau has produced a remarkable film. It makes a change to go to a nice, family film that doesn't have some super hero marauding around making a lot of noise and usually leaving a body count of squelchy mess proportions. This is great cinema and I think it will introduce a whole new generation to the big screen.",

The effects are so hyper-real that one can almost forget that they are man-made, and the talents of the stars doing the various animals' voices are great!My concern is the levels of anxiety-producing violence (and threats of violence) in the film. I suppose that after the first viewing, a kid would know how each scene ends, so maybe they wouldn't be that scared any more. But a first viewing would be way too intense for any kid under about 10. Which makes the PG rating appropriate. But, as we know, too many parents don't pay attention to the ratings, and they take even little kids to films like this and/or buy the DVD, which I think isn't good for them.I'm also sad that the tiger is the bad guy in this film. As we know, the number of tigers in the wild is only in the hundreds at this point, so they are very close to extinction. Yes, yes -- I know that's how Kipling wrote the stories, but it still makes me sad that kids may start judging tigers to be evil because of this movie.",

Even as an adaptation this movies does nothing new with the characters. \"Why was this movie made when the original is still good?\" Is the stigma that these live action recreations of animated classics have to carry and this movie fumbles right out of the gate (by the way the answer to that hypothetical is that someone wanted money, that's obvious so moving on). Let's break down this movies failings1. The main kid can't act, his line delivery is painful. the dialogue is also really, really bad and predictable. I caught myself completing dialogue sequences multiple times until I had to stop myself.2. None of the characters work. the trailer and poster all show Kaa (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) which is the only character that sorta works but her scene is short and pointless in the overall story. 3. Most scenes are pointless in the overall story. the excuse that this is a kids movie is no excuse at all. most scenes do not work with each other or lead in to other scenes.4. The fact that most \"actors\" in this \"live action\" retelling are CG animals is a problem compounded by the fact that Mogli can't act. to be fair the kid probably had to talk to a lot of tennis balls on sticks and that can be hard (see Olsen's performance in Avengers 2 whenever she had to interact with Ultron) but there is a serious disconnect with every character on screen even when the animals talk to each other.5. Every veteran actor in this sounded like they read their script the morning before they had to go on. The worst example of this is Bill Murray, pay attention to his acting and its clear he didn't want to be there. The only ones that were not phoning it in where Scarlett Johansson and to a lesser degree Christopher Walken and that's probably because he was one of the few singing performances.6. There is only one complete musical sequence, and its with Christopher Walken. If you're a fan of hairspray you are in for a treat, even if its brief. This movie threw away damn near everything memorable about the original and didn't replace it with anything new and it shows with its lack of musical sections. 7. The new Ending is bad. it has a hamfisted message that I think is supposed to be pro-environment. I say I think because it was not delivered very well. Minor spoiler, Mogli is hounded for most of the movie because he's human and the tiger Shere Khan wants him out of the jungle because he thinks Mogli will bring ruin to the Jungle. In the final confrontation Mogli steals fire from the local human village to fight Shere Khan and he brings ruin to the jungle. Mogli is supposed to learn something from this I think but like I said, not acted or communicated very well.In brief they stripped everything fun about the story. If you like the original animated Jungle Book I would be surprised if you found anything good in this. if you want a live action Jungle Book movie it's been done better before. if you want to see a live action retelling of a Disney animated classic go watch the only good one that tells a new and interesting story, Maleficent.",

The blend between CGI and Live-Action works in a very special way I've never seen before.Sound: Great Sounddesign and mixing.Editing: Its very well edited, although the editing really isn't special. I wouldve wished for longer shots though, sometimes the movie cuts inbetween shots a bit too often.Acting: Honestly, while I have huge respect for child actors in such centric roles, I dont think that this movie is well acted in any way. His emotions are very limited and it really sometimes deosnt feel like it he is a boy in a jungle. Unfortunately the acting doesnt sell the script and some voice actors dont fit their animals. The voice acting itself is also sometimes really overacted and sticks out like a sore thumb. Christopher Walken as King Louie is a delight though.Final Thoughts: Although I knew that realistic looking animals would speak in human language, it really put me off at first. I needed some time to adjust myself to it and after that, the movie became enjoyable in some way. Mainly because of the looks. Other than its honestly really beautiful appearance, this movie seems to be really forgettable.

Neel Sethi's Mowgli may be the only living, breathing entity in this live action-CGI stew but you would consider Bagheera, Baloo, Shere Khan and party equally real by the time the show's over.Favreau and his team of tech wizards don't just give you CGI for the heck of it, they make it an integral part of the storytelling. The film is an eye-popping spectacle where the jungle breathes and animals emote with their eyes. The wizardry is overwhelmingly successful in the portrayal of the animals. They are so real \u2013 from the way they talk to their loping, sinuous walk to even their eyes \u2013 that you eventually forget that some graphic artist just made them up.The voice work is excellent all around. We hear Shere Khan before we see him and Elba brings an air of menace to the film. Khan is enjoying his cruelty and the actor shows it. Villain of the year, anyone? Ben Kingsley's Bagheera, also the narrator, is a statesman- like figure, Mowgli's father figure and the voice of sense. But the real winner is Murray's Baloo. A slacker who is not above a bit of lying if it can get the job done, Baloo is the story's comic relief. His relationship with Mowgli gives the film its heart and Favreau lets it breathe. The fact that he gets the film's best dialogues also helps.The duo also gets to sing the classic Bare Necessities together and that itself justifies the price of the ticket. The shaggy ambling sloth bear is a perfect fit for Murray and Murray's lazy dialogue- delivery is a perfect fit for Baloo. All in all, a casting choice made in heaven.So, how does it measure up to The Jungle Book versions we have seen till now \u2013 the Disney film made almost 50 years ago and the classic anime show on Doordarshan in the 90's? It matches up. The tone may be different and it may be edgier, but at heart The Jungle Book is still an adventure and a coming-of-age tale. Favreau gives us that sense of wonder, something we so desperately desire in these days of one franchise too many. The fact that he manages to do it in a story we all know so well is remarkable.",

Disney's Jungle Book kept me nostalgic about the good old days, but not for long.The screenplay keeps you engrossed and demands your attention right from the first frame to the last. Action-packed with fantastic visual effects and charming picturisation of the jungle, Jon Favreau's version of Rudyard Kipling's classic is an adventurous and thrilling ride.

The introduction and the other chase scenes as well as the climax are other notable scenes shot masterly. Some scenes, including the last one, are pictured exactly the same way as in the animated version, which most of us are familiar with.I want to give a special shout-out to Neel Sethi, the actor who has portrayed Mowgli, for an impressive performance. It has been quite sometime since I watched a movie that entertained, thrilled and kept me hooked until the end.I love this thought-provoking line from the 'Law of the Jungle' (and also the law for the wolves) that is repeated in chorus throughout the movie, \"...For the strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack.\"",

            "content": "Those who have read any of my reviews know that I am a 69 year old non entertainment industry person. I just like to watch movies. For those who don't know me at all, I have a tendency to be as excited writing a review as I am while watching the movie. So, here is Bill's common guy review of the 2016 remake of Jungle Book.This is as modern and up to date technically and artistically as you can get. You give Disney a run with anything and they will make it fantastic family entertainment. The visual and audio side of this offering is breathtaking, whether human, animal, and scenery. For me, it was hard to concentrate on the voices because I was so deeply entrenched in the scenery and all the different animals.I've read Rudyard Kipling books while growing up. This both as personal reading for pleasure and the forced reads in grammar and high school. I have also seen all the Jungle Book movies filmed since the 1942 original. Now I'll be waiting for the proposed next version scheduled in 2018 (hopeful).The JUNGLE BOOK by Rudyard Kipling was written for the young. The movie is made for the young and the young at heart. This newest version with all its modern technology is the best so far. Those who watch this will be truly amazed. All of the Professional Actors who played the voices of the various animals and Mowgli are perfect coming out of the animated character animals and the Human Hero. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9SPOILER ALERT: ScarJo has a very seductive voice. She almost had Mowgli and me hypnotized into submission. I'm glad Mowgli escaped. I think I'd have stayed around for a good firm hugging by KAA and its snaky altar ego. Scarlett. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9See this animated amazing movie. Mom, Dad, and all the kids. Do it together and enjoy this as a family.Everything in the movie builds until you are hit with the most anguished, depressive, and demoralizing crescendo of terror, heartbreak panic, and heroism. You will be on your feet clapping and yelling for a couple animal heroes. You will not know from one second to the next if you will be laughing, crying, afraid, or cheering. These last scenes are what will make you stand on rubbery legs when it is over and try to get your senses back to normal. This movie gives you everything you could ever ask for (no sex) in a real human character film. I loved it!!!! WFHBear",

I applaud Disney for bringing The Jungle Book back on the big screen. It was a masterpiece. I loved watching this film with my mum. Lot of emphasis on family, love, mother child relationship ( in the form of the relationship shown between Raksha the wolf and Mowgli ) etc in this film. Rudyard Kipling would have been proud to see this rendition and adaptation of his book. It was absolutely brilliant, great screenplay, visually stunning and a film with a heart.

Wolves were as good as no match to SherKhan ... again (wasn't MOWGLI raised by wolves?) so something not correct in story/direction here.4. MONKEY's episode had no bearing on the movie & was totally pointless!5. KAA had very little screen time ... 2 minutes?6. BALOO was made as as funny character - his honey hunt was not required to be shown for 15 minutes.I liked the last scene (red flower fight) ... though, even that was really flawed in many ways ... like SherKhan climbing a tree like he was a MONKEY :) he he :)overall the entire movie looked too dark ...

            "content": "The original Jungle Book was a childhood favorite of mine. Among other animated Disney films, I watched it countless times as I grew up. The characters, musical numbers, and crisp animation that made Disney so lovable drew me in constantly and taught me a lot of the moral lessons that I still reference to this day. Therefore, when I heard they were making a live-action adaptation of The Jungle Book, my skepticism couldn't be subdued. More often than not, remakes yield unpleasant and disgraceful results. But, upon viewing this movie in defiance of my jadedness, I was quite pleasantly surprised! Jon Favreau did an excellent job with this film. His attention to detail is clear, as is his respect for the source material. First and foremost, I must say the CGI looks spectacular throughout the movie. It's a marvel to look at and the folks who animate behind the scenes deserve a standing ovation. The scene with Kaa and the water buffalo sequence stood out as the cream of the crop, but the entire movie never breaks from it's beautiful and passionate foundation.You'll feel completely immersed in the fantasy. The admirable debut of Neel Sethi helps propel the narrative without any hiccups along the way. There were a few minor slip ups in his performance, but he's just a kid and I'd be very interested to see what sort of doors this film opens up for him. In addition to the child actor, the voice acting is wonderful. Bill Murray, Idris Elba, and Christopher Walken are especially fantastic. While the accent disparities can be somewhat jarring at first, you quickly get accustomed to them and realize they give each character a unique twist. The voices mesh perfectly with the on-screen characters and the facial capture technology helps them connect with their roles on a deeper physiological level. Across the board, the performances are great and Favreau proves yet again that he can get the most out of his actors.Overall, this film is a really great time. It's by no means perfect, but that really doesn't matter. The message is strong, it's family friendly, and there are tons of sensational and smart moments riddled throughout the film. You may laugh, you may cry, you may do both; the fact remains that this movie is well-worth your time and money. I felt like I was five years old again in the theater. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and go! If you have kids, bring them too, because this film is chock-full of fun and charm.",

            "content": "From a Theatre artist's perspective, music speaks for things at sort here... The Jungle Book is a roaring success! With its CGI, actions and emotions all intact, there is nothing more I could ask from it. While others whine about how absurd the injection of the two short musical pieces \"Bare Necessities\" and \"I Wanna Be Like You\" turned out in the film, I'd rather those were the evoking and gentle areas in the story; likely serving as asides for the emotionally-larger than life characters, Baloo and King Louie. In fact, I could even hum a tone for Shere Khan, the chilling and villainous Bengal Tiger who would do everything to eradicate Mowgli from the jungle. Technically, music speaks for things at sort here- hatred, fear, love, frustrations, etc. We can't entirely get away from it. And music, as a good old piece from musicals and other theatrical conventions, gets a fresh touch in this non-musical live-action adventure. Nonetheless, even with the wolf pack's stoic pronunciation of the \"Laws of the Jungle\", familiar notes are already rung in the audience's hearts. But, had it been that they decided to turn this into a full musical, the film would definitely flop! A well-presented story\u0085 Eventually, for the first time since Avatar and Life of Pi, I enjoyed a seamlessly presented story. A story that stands on its own- the Jungle Book will always be remembered as it is. It may not be an utter classic, but it is enough a masterpiece to behold. Ultimately, the Jungle Book goes beyond the Disney branding as a distinct collaboration of talents, Jon Favreau (Director), Justin Marks (for the characters' well-paced dialogue), Ben Kingsley (voice of Bagheera), Bill Murray (voice of Baloo), Lupita Nyong'o (voice of Rakhsa), Scarlett Johansson (voice of Kaa), Idris Elba (voice of Shere Khan), Giancarlo Esposito (voice of Akela), debuting actor Neel Sethi (as Mowgli) and most of all, Rudyard Kipling for penning the classic story of the same title. A wholesome package! The Jungle Book has everything in it. It could be a political satire when it wants to, or a dark and grim propaganda. It may relieve the intense atmosphere off with a wry humor or tearful goodbye, a little bit of music and jovial monkey dancing as \"verfremdungseffekt\" and even perhaps a wild chorus of primitive growls that speak of more serious human agenda at hand. Magnanimously, the Jungle Book reawakens the Lion King in its head- docking stampedes, resurrects the Passion of the Christ in Mowgli's bearing of the weight for the greater good and stupendously animates Alice Walker's Flowers in Mowgli's rite of passage, symbolized by the Red Flower (Torch of Fire) he carries facing Shere Khan. As mentioned earlier this film will roar at all ages since it is more than just a children's action, adventure and entertainment tale. It will snarl at you, shaking and swinging you from the gut. (One last note though: Don't bother watching this if not in IMAX 3D. Otherwise, you might only end up cheating yourself of the spectacle.)",

The way it is done with the effects works brilliantly with the young Neel Seethi, who delivers a role that captures the brilliance and love in the first Mowgli. The Bare Necessities was used fantastically and Bill Murray is amazing, but is the second song well used? It is in a serious moment in the movie and King Louie has a great presence, but he suddenly breaks out into song, strange! Idris Elba, Scarlett Johanson, Ben Kingsley, Neel Sethi and Bill Murray are just some of the names that make this movie, their acting is phenomenal and they are at their best.

            "content": "Life-Action adaptations have been around for a little while now. Even though the reinterpretation of 'Maleficent' wasn't quite my cup of tea, I was hooked on Favreaus vision of 'The Jungle Book' since I saw the first short teaser. One thing in advance: I wasn't disappointed. Completely filmed in studio, 'The Jungle Book' is visually a unique experience, starting from the first shot. The jungle is directed beautifully. The captivating and hazardous aspects are brought to the screen through a lovely cinematography but also retains it's mystic tone. The animals are the highlight of the entire movie. They look realistic but also contain a human features, which I was in no way put off by. Their interactions are genuine and pretty to watch especially due to the entertaining and well written script. Emotionality isn't missing either, which is remarkable for a movie that was almost completely created on a computer. Particularly noteworthy is the work of Idris Elba (Shere Khan), Bill Murray (Baloo) and Christopher Walken (King Loiue). The latter appealed to me personally primarily because of his smallish monkey-like music performance. Those who watched the original know that there will be a song warbled from time to time. Here however they are authentic and mostly adapted to the situation. The songs that weren't brought in, are instead skilfully worked into the score. Well- sounding for every nostalgic.\u00a0 First and foremost the movie is supposed to entertain and it does. It's funny, specifically ascribable to Bill Murray, but also has it's serious and frightening moments, most of all offered by Idris Elba's intriguing vocal performance of the vengeful Shere Khan. In my opinion both sides are well balanced and give the movie a pleasant flow. Overall the movie is a bit darker in tone due to the realistic looking CGI, which is why I thought the pg rating was pretty generous. For a brief moment the movie dragged a bit but this could simply have been due to the fact that I knew what was yet going to happen. In the end I had a great time with 'The Jungle Book' and will definitely want to revisit the theatre because it is plainly made to be seen on the big screen.Conclusion: Favreau's new directed Mythology succeeds at all levels. Storywise 'The Jungle Book' maintains the essential things of the original and in some places puts a new spin on the the story successfully. Visually a masterpiece, that will hopefully be considered for the Oscar Season. Those that were blown away by the visuals should definitely watch the b-roll. At this point I would like to praise the work of Neel Sethi (Mowgli) who had to bring this movie to life\u00a0solely with his imagination.

It's just so realistic that the animals barely have any expression when they talk. It's hard to care, at least for me, about a cast of animals that just kind of... Look like animals, and have human voices. When you give them human qualities (like a voice) they need to make anthropological facial expressions, otherwise it doesn't register with you, as a human viewer. Or at least that's how I felt. I also really didn't like Neel Sethi as Mowgli. I know it was his first film, but he was rather underwhelming. In addition, the editing is really choppy and jarring at a few points, especially when they're running around through the trees, etc. It would have been more effective to do long takes without cutting (Again, my humble suggestion).

            "content": "Going into the film, I worried that it would be a strict, shot-for-shot remake of the 1967 cartoon; however, those fears were quickly allayed. While it retains the popular characters, songs and basic plot of the original, the new \"The Jungle Book\" focuses on the dangers of the wilderness in a film that is intense, awe-inspiring and has more in common with the \"Planet Earth\" documentary series than with its jazzy, musical predecessor.\"The Jungle Book\" is a truly breathtaking movie. From muddy, rushing rivers to misty jungles, the depiction of India feels realistic yet mythical, as if something so beautiful couldn't truly exist on our polluted planet.The animals are convincingly lifelike and pose a visual treat, varying from Baloo's (Bill Murray) lazy smile to the monstrously scarred visage of Shere Khan (Idris Elba). The audience sees the world from the perspective of Mowgli (Neel Sethi), and shares in his childhood wonder of the jungle and the animals who inhabit it.The movie's treatment of nature is respectful and often frightening, which helps to ground its serious tone and lends greater meaning to the film. When the bear, panther, tiger and wolves fight, they clash with such anger and ferocity that the audience is reminded of how ill-equipped humans are to fight for survival. Threats like stampedes and landslides wait around every corner, emphasizing the danger and unpredictability of nature.As a human, Mowgli is at a physical disadvantage compared to his animal friends, and the film underscores the power of man's cleverness as the boy is forced to create tools to survive. Humanity's greatest tool, the \"red flower\" of fire, plays a central role in the film, conveyed as the destructive potential of man and the ultimate enemy of nature.Despite the gravitas with which the film treats nature, it deftly couples levity with humor. Baloo's laziness and carefree attitude remains the perfect outlet for comic relief. Although the new film deviates from the classic Disney musical spirit, two of the original film's most popular songs make appearances.Hearing Mowgli and Baloo sing \"The Bare Necessities\" while floating down a river will prompt nostalgic tingling from the audience's childhoods. King Louie's (Christopher Walken) song \"I Wanna Be Like You\" is subtler than Louis Prima's original jazzy style, but feels forcibly shoehorned into the film and fits more naturally as the credits song.Part of what makes the film so convincing is the quality of the voice talent. Elba's portrayal of the sinister Shere Khan drips with malice and self-righteous rage in a more threatening version of the character. Ben Kingsley's calm demeanor gives Bagheera a wise, grandfatherly aura, like the panther Gandalf of the jungle. Walken imbibes the previously selfish yet harmless character of King Louie with a quirky menace and avarice.As far as reboots go, Disney delivered the gold standard with \"The Jungle Book.\" It is an awe-inspiring film that places man at nature's mercy and as its master. Its visuals effects and thrilling storyline make for a refreshing take on Rudyard Kipling's classic tale.",

            "content": "The original 1967 Jungle Book is really legendary and one in my top 5 favorite animated Disney movies of all time with one being Mary Poppins and two being Fantasia. The 1967 Jungle Book goes in 4. Too bad I never grew up watching the original cartoon movie as I grew up with its cut rate 2003 sequel don't get me started on that. This film is abhorrent on every level taking the original Walt Disney classic and making it dark and gritty doesn't make for a good film. I don't care if the CG animation looks to life like it doesn't add any sentiments to the film. Most of the acting in this is wooden and doesn't feel genuine except for a few lines. Jon Favereau is a prominent film maker and Chef is my favorite film he made but he doesn't hit the mark with this film. The score by John Debney wasn't the greatest either I would have preferred a score by John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith. The things that are bad in this movie is Baloo being a stick in the mud to Mowgli a few times. Like forcing him to get honey and providing him with protection but then for him to say \"I DON'T WANT YOU ANYMORE\" that's not what the 1967 Jungle Book gave us so why do it here? I could practically see Walt Disney rolling in his grave with lines like this. The worst thing that I absolutely loathed about this movie is Shere Kahn literally MURDERED A WOLF AND ITS SHOWN ON SCREEN! OMG! I literally almost walked out of the Theaters after seeing that. Why Disney? It's films like this are the reason why Wolves are getting wiped off the face of earth and are being pushed to extinction. You already this this in Make Mine Music 1946 with the stupid Peter and the Wolf segment which is garbage I don't care if it was done in hand drawn animation stop doing this. The only satisfaction I got was when Shere Kahn died in the film he fell from the tree and burned up. That's when I said Mmmmm Burnt Cat. Overall this movie is dark gritty way too gripping and it's an inferior remake of the 1967 classic the last animated film Walt Disney had involvement in.",

Disney are definitely doing an amazing job transitioning their iconic animated movies to live screen adaptations, first with Cinderella and now The Jungle Book. My wife and I aren't overly huge fans of the original animated movie but we took our two boys aged 10 and 7 to see the movie today, and we were thoroughly impressed. And our children loved it. The thing I find truly fascinating is except for \"Neel Sethi\" who plays the man cub Mowgli, everything else in the movie is completely CGI. Just imagine that for a minute...just imagine how hard this would be for a seasoned actor, but this is a child actor in his first film role. And what an amazing job he does interacting with these beloved characters giving them life. Shows you what a real talent Jon Favreau is as a director. And what an amazing ensemble cast they have doing the voices. Loved Bill Murray as Baloo, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, and Idris Elba voicing Sheer Khan was terrifying but in a good way. Granted there may be a few scenes young children may find scary, but I feel Disney have definitely knocked this one out of the park. This is a movie that should not be missed at the cinema, and if you get the chance check it out in 3D. If this movie isn't in contention for an Oscar it would be truly disappointing.",

But the movie is astoundingly beautiful in every way, the CGI creatures are so lifelike it's almost mesmerizing, and to that extent, the voice acting flows well with that all, not being as weird as one might think.

I remember growing up watching the original animated movie from 1967, and the trailers for this, and I got very excited for it. And, believe me, it did not disappoint me. First up, is the special effects. Simply put, these effects are phenomenal! The jungle looks absolutely stunning, and is a very beautiful world to look at, and the animals look so real! Speaking of which, this film features more species than the original did (e.g water buffalo and a pangolin). Then, there's the acting. Once again, fantastic! Neel Sethi played Mowgli perfectly, and had such wonderful energy and charisma! And, Bill Murray, for the most part, was very well suited to play Baloo. Ben Kingsley did an amazing performance as Bagheera the panther, playing perfectly the part of a stern, yet wise and caring mentor figure. Christopher Walken gave a very interesting performance as King Louie, making him somewhat of a mix between King Kong and the godfather, which is a stark contrast from the Jazzy clown that Louie Prima gave in the original movie. But, then, there's Idris Elba, who plays the role of Shere Khan, the tiger. This incarnation of Shere Khan is incredibly tough, reminding the audience that he is the biggest, baddest bully on the playground. Which reminds the audience of why every creature in the jungle is afraid of him. And, I will admit, when he killed Akela, it made me jump in my seat. Thanks to Elba's performance, every line said by Shere Khan sends shivers down my spine. And, finally, the script. It follows the story of the original film very well, and it doesn't take too many liberties. It also pays several homages to the original, like when they played the overture from the original movie at the beginning of the film. It even uses elements from the novel that both films are based on. For example, the code that the wolves always recited throughout the movie was actually a poem from the original novel. The concept of the water truce was also taken from the book, and the film uses a few quotes from the book as well (such as when Raksha tells Mowgli \"You're mine, mine to me.\") Overall, The Jungle Book is easily the best film of 2016. I would highly recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the original movie, and to anyone who was a fan of the novel.",

This film used limited references to the old film, made it loveable to watch, had good CGI and visuals and perfect amount of action. Shere Khan, the tiger was more scarier than the old one and Jon Favreau did a really good job with recreating Shere Khan with CGI. This movie had very clear CGI for the animals and the visuals for the background of India's jungles were fabulous. There was definitely emotional weight and comedy too.

The actor for Mougli (Neel Sethi) was amazing and for it being his 1st role in a movie is unbelievable and for him being the only human in the movie was quite an achievement you really feel that his talking to people then CGI animals.The effects in the movie were fantastic it looked like a lot of hours were put into the movements of the animals as they all move in a realistic way that is also mix with cartoon like movements, and the cinematography is so far the best I've seen all year as every shot looks great and I wouldn't be surprised if this gets nominated for best cinematography at the Oscars.The voice acting I thought was not that great as when I hear Baloo and Bagheera I don't hear Baloo or Bagheera I hear Bill Murray and Ben Kingsley in a recording studio and I can also see them reading lines so every voice actor isn't that good. Idris Elba was OK as Sere Khan but you couldn't beat George Sanders voice in the original and Scarlet Johansson I though was a terrible Khaa as she was not memorable at the slightest and she is killed off after around 3 to 4 minutes of screen time and Christopher Walken's King Louie was OK but his singing was some of the best I've heard from Disney. The soundtrack I thought was better than the original as the music felt more alive, like King Louie's song \"I wanna be like you\" was done really well manly because of the score and Walken's amazing singing voice and it is now one of my favorite Disney songs. The other songs were also good like \"Trust in me\" that is played during the credits by Scarlet Johansson and \"Bear Necessaries\" by Bill Murray which was also realty good, all of them have good scores and is my favorite soundtrack so far this year. In the end the film was one of the best remakes I've seen and also one of the best movies of the year and the only thing I didn't like about it was the voices and the ending which changed from the original but that's it, the film was epic, well shot and is Disney's best remake, so that's why I'm giving it an 8\\10.",

Mowgli, the man-cub, was left behind by villagers when he was a baby an since then, he has been raised by Akela and Raksha, the wolves. They were a very happy and peaceful family until Shere Khan, the tiger, threatens Akela. Shere Khan says that Mowgli must return to the man village, or he will kill him. Mowgli leaves with Bagheera to return to the man village. On the way Mowgli gets separated from Bagheera and is caught in a trap by Kaa, a snake, however Baloo saves him just in time. In the meantime while Bagheera is looking for Mowgli, Mowgli is with Baloo helping him to get honey. When Bagheera finally finds Mowgli, he tells him the terrible news. And then Mowgli and Baloo and Bagheera are off on another adventure to hopefully save everything. In the Jungle Book there are very realistic sounds that help you understand everything. The visuals are really what tells the story. The pictures help build up the intensity of the situations. The facial expressions of the animals and Mowgli help to build up the viewers emotions.The theme of family is perceived very well in the movie. Even though Mowgli is a human, the wolves treat him and love as though he is their own cub. And even though Akela ad Raksha are wolves, Mowgli still treats them and loves them as though they are his actual parents. The wolf cubs also treat Mowgli as though they are his real brothers and sisters.Over all, the move is very well put together and a very excellent movie. 10/10",

The Jungle Book is about a man club who was raised by a wolf pack in the jungle. The animals are mostly curious about Mowgli but not Shere Kahn the most feared animal in the jungle, a Bengal tiger, is furious about the boy living in the jungle among the animals. Mowgli's caretaker Bagheera, a black panther, is forced to return him to the man village to keep him safe from the tiger. Many life lessons and adventures occur during the journey to the village. Mowgli runs into trouble and makes many new friendships along the way too.In the Jungle Book the movie had very good visuals that went with the story. The sound effects were spot on. The animals all sounded very realistic and the weather conditions also sounded very accurate. The movie was a good pace but could go slow in some scenes. At the beginning the movie seemed slower but picked up toward the middle and end when the action was happening. The Jungle Book's theme was centered toward friendship, lessons, and peace. Mowgli has several friendships with the animals of the jungle like Baloo the bear who turned out to help him and understand him. Mowgli learned many lessons throughout his journey like to help others. The animals always had Mowgli's back and so did he. The animals got along and had a peace truce during the drought to help everyone out so everyone could get water. That kept order and peace throughout the jungle. The Jungle Book movie was an overall good film for the whole family to enjoy. It had many adventures and thrills though out the whole movie. There's many life lessons about friendship that everyone could benefit from. I would defiantly recommend this movie. 9/10",

When I saw the trailer of this movie, I instantly liked it, may be out of sheer nostalgia and sweet childhood memories which we always look back with rose tinted glasses. So I went to theater with huge expectations. What I saw was just, a splendid and spectacular graphical representation of forest, animals and fight sequences. Overall ambiance and sound effect was cherry on top. Undoubtedly one of the finest CGI I have ever saw. With 3d glasses it made me feel like I am living life of Mowgli in Jungle. Alas.... It does lack content. Innocence of Mowgli and his friendship with other animals was missing except relation of Bhaloo and Mowgli. That was beautifully shot and that is what I was expecting throughout movie. Instead it was heavy graphical bombardment. I didn't understand the need of surprise sound effects during fight sequence or middle of the dialogue like suspense or horror movies. By being an adult I was terrified in 3-4 scenes, No wonder Indian Censor Board gave it U/A certificate considering scenes might be violent for under age kids. As far as Hindi dubbing is considered, Voices were chosen wisely I guess. Full marks to Hindi dubbing. Nana Patekar for Sherkhan - Super Irrfan Khan for Bhaloo - Super Om Puri for Baghira - Super Only 1 actor is in movie to judge. And we can say that Neel Sethi nailed it as Mowgli with his body language and expressions. If you are going with the expectation to experience Jungle book which we saw in animated cartoon version then you may face disappointment but if you want to experience 3D, CGI and good sound effect then go for it.",

That is for its sheer intensity, suspense, emotion and wonder beautifully weaved by Rudyard Kipling. Doing justice to this timeless classic is both difficult and important. This movie succeeds to a good extent but has its flaws, some really crucial ones. But let's talk about the bright side first. The animation and effects are simply mind-blowing. The subtle details are truly amazing. Neel Sethi seems to be seamlessly pulling off Mowgli. The screenplay is very gripping and the audience just cannot keep their gaze off the screen even a bit. The background score elevates the awe of the movie all the more. A great visual treat! Now the hiccups! While Mowgli's character is decently developed, Akela (his wolf father) is almost invisible in the movie with minimal character development. Sherkhan kills Akela in a snap. I personally believe that it deserved a lot more character and a lot more drama. There is no Tabaqui. While Tabaqui is not a central character, it is crucial to intensify the ploy. Sherkhan doesn't really scare anyone. That 'cruel king of the jungle' feel and the heavy voice are so missing. And then, Kaa's character is completely different, why? Because Kaa tries to kill Mowgli, unbelievable! The movie is so not Rudyard Kipling. Take your kids for the visual treat but nothing more!",

Read at your own risk if you have not yet viewed Jungle Book.Hello guys, I've been told I'm a pretty fair reviewer of things, and I decided to give movie reviewing a shot. Just for clarification, all movies will be given an exact score with a maximum of 4.0 stars. So without further ado, here is my first review and it is for a great movie: Jungle Book.First off - the Hazel rating. Yes, you heard right, this cute dog on the left is also rating this movie, and she has given Jungle Book a score of 4/4 stars. Now Hazel and I don't always see completely eye-to-eye and so personally, I'll give it a 3.7/4.0. After all, this is a review site and even the best movies have flaws. But first - the good. This movie is stunning to look at. The CGI is nearly impeccable, with each character sporting a sense of realism not often achieved in other movies that make heavy use of it. Clumps of dirt and individual hairs can be seen on the wolves in particular, and by the end of it, you might feel as if you are really are living in this amazing jungle. Which brings me to my next point of praise for Jungle Book. The world-building. A movie with this much hype and CGI effects could be in danger of losing the essence, and the magic, of its source material. But in my opinion, this live action movie only builds upon its predecessor. These jungle animals all have a sense of their culture unique to their species, and this really shines through this film. The wolves have a sense of honor, the porcupine has a sense of humor, and the deer have made a pact with the panther during the dry season. Another praise (and I'll admit, this one worried me) was the talking animals. We aren't talking about voice overs like in Black Beauty, but actual mouths moving, animals talking. While usually disastrous in movies, such as the not very good Racing Stripes, it is done unusually well here. Instead of distracting the viewer, it actually enhances the entire experience. As for the cast, Neel Sethi was nearly a perfect Mowgli. I felt that he and Ben Kingsley were especially fit for their roles. I wasn't sure about the adaptation of Baloo's character, but I will say Bill Murray won me over in the end with his endearing performance. I was especially impressed by the treatment of Kaa's character, and the gorgeous visuals that go along with her appearance amounts to perhaps the film's strongest scene. The backstory that Kaa provides elevates her status as a character and she rises above being a mere plot device quite nicely.Now for the not so strong points: When Mowgli leaves the pack in the beginning, I feel as though the movie wasted a much needed opportunity for character development. I don't think the film got as much of a sense of empathy from the audience as it was going for. While Lupita did a phenomenal job as Raksha (another one of the film's many triumphs!), by having Mowgli leave without saying goodbye to a single other pack member leaves doubt in the viewer's mind of his status within the pack. This is only increased by the conversation leading up to his leaving, and unfortunately the movie never quite rectifies this, and in the end Akela's death feels a bit more hollow than it should have. Another valid point is the clear wavering between a child's movie and an adult movie, without ever finding solid ground on either plane. Thus the decision to include the classic songs from the animated version feel forced, rather than a natural event, and the movie never ends up fully deciding on its target audience. Luckily it reaches enough people in both the young and older camps to make this only a minor failing.I must also say that I was a bit disappointed by the absence of the song \"My Own Home\", but I do feel as if the change in the ending suited this movie quite well.All in all, this is a terrific movie, and a splendor to behold. It was thoroughly enjoyable. With Hazel the dog's input, the adjusted score for this movie is 3.8/4.0 stars. Thank you guys for reading and I hope you enjoyed my review. Don't agree? Comment below!

            "content": "The Jungle Book is a completely average movie yet, because this is made by the \"gods\" known as Disney it gets spammed with 10/10 Reviews on this website. As for the film I'd certainly give it a point for some of the creature design. However whenever Baghreea specifically talks it freaks me out because of how uncanny his movements are. People are also praising Mowgli's actor for some reason even though he sucked. As for the sequence of events it's completely predictable. As soon as they would introduce a scene you could tell how it would end. As for the Music it was okay. The problem was it appeared 2 times in the film. I must admit I liked both songs even without seeing the original. As per usual with these types of movies the cast is a cast of all celebrities and, one new guy isn't that surprising. The problem is they aren't playing human characters and, whenever these animals talk they just sound like the actors. Who wants to talk about the scene with Scarlett Johansen? I know I do! This scene is really creepy because Scarlett often uses certain elements of her body (her tits) to enhance her performances. After seeing movies like Under the Skin where this works it really ruins the experience to know this actress normally does \"sexy\" performances. It seems very creepy that she is doing this to a Young Boy. That's more of a personal preference but, I feel it's still worth mentioning. Anyways, that's about all I have to say about this movie and, how average it is.",

It was more relaxed.The animation/CG in this film is absolutely splendid and on point, from the movement to the emotion expressed through their faces!

            "content": "Almost 50 years after the original release comes a modern retelling of one of Disney's most memorable movies.I watched this film last night. You can call this film a retelling or a remake but there is a lot more to it than that. When the live action project was announced 3 years ago many were highly skeptical, including me. But then they started announcing the cast involved and my interest started to spike. Bill Murray as Baloo, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, Idris Elba as Shere Khan and the crowning jewel\u0085Christopher Walken as King Louie. How can you possibly say no to this amount of talent?Then you find out that the entire film is made in a studio. Every single aspect of this film except Mowgli is CGI; every tree, every bush, every stream or river, every drop of rain, every animal\u0085everything! Which means Mowgli (played by newcomer Neel Sethi) is acting against green screen and tennis balls. My hats off to this little kid, he is going places.The film as a whole was immensely enjoyable. The story follows pretty much the same through line as the original version. While the few small changes are a welcome addition in my opinion, I do miss some of the musical numbers. Do not be disheartened altogether; the director Jon Favreau still manages to seamlessly weave in the two iconic songs (Bare necessities and I wanna be like you) into the story. My only other little gripe is that some character decisions seemed out of place at times. However, the several laugh out loud moments sprinkled through the movie keep you engaged.Technically speaking, it was a marvel unfolding on the screen. I watched it on a 3D IMAX screen. The IMAX was worth it but the 3D wasn't. Generally speaking I wouldn't recommend watching any film in 3D but good luck finding a cinema showing a 2D IMAX showing in your area.In short, if you're a fan of the original Disney classic or a fan of Disney films in general, this film is definitely for you. My score \u2013 8/10 and a definite recommendation on the big screen.Review from: https://pratikrambles.wordpress.com/",

            "review_title": "'The Jungle Book' (2016) Review by Infectious Reviews",
            "content": "When 2016's 'The Jungle Book' hit the theatres it was well received. Critics were saying; \"As lovely to behold as it is engrossing to watch, The Jungle Book is the rare remake that actually improves upon its predecessors - all while setting a new standard for CGI\" - Rotten Tomatoes. Apart from Rotten Tomatoes' comment on the CGI - which is remarkable - I do not agree with its mention about its predecessors. First of all, I would like to say, watching this for the first time - I actually enjoyed it and even went out to buy it on 'BluRay'. However, the second time round, I found it was problematic and tedious.The character portrayals were not engaging in the slightest - there was no life to the hyper-realistic animals. With 'live action', you cannot display human-like emotions, nor have them dancing and singing through a whimsical script, as you can in an animated feature. 1967's 'The Jungle Book' manages to get away with it because it knows it is an animation. Theres no surprises and no alarms to say \"look at me! I'm an effect\". The whole point of an effect; is to simulate reality. Whilst watching 2016's 'The Jungle Book'; as 'good' as the effects were - it was not enough to make the characters candid and alive - especially when they break into song. If they had kept the story to the book, maybe I would have been inclined to change my mind about the 'life-like' animation. Even so, when the animals are not singing; their characters are forgettable and uninteresting. For instance, Shere Khan, voiced by Idris Elba (Zootropolis), does not have the same impactful evilness as Sanders. I admire Elba, but don't think he is a suited to this role. I think voice acting is something that every actor thinks they can do but in reality, everyone in this film, apart from Ben Kingsley's Bagheera, is wooden and boring - there is little activity behind the beautiful CGI. However, I do not think the, cash grabbing, A'list cast are completely to blame.Shift your hunting ground for a few years and everyone forgets how the law works. Well, let me remind you. A man-cub becomes man, and man is FORBIDDEN! - The Jungle Book (2016)The dialogue is neither here or there. Because the film is trying to balance out two narratives, the screenplay, written by Justin Marks, cannot keep up with - feeling rough and patchy. Having said this, theres a particular mantra, originally written by Kipling called \"The Law of Wolves\" - that is repeated throughout the film. This mantra is a code for the wolves and something Mowgli struggles to follow - as he is not a wolf. When Mowgli is on his search for acceptance he is also being told to leave the jungle. In the original story, Mowgli actually leaves the jungle and joins human civilisation but is later rejected, for being too wild. Kipling tells his story of not belonging and 1967's 'The Jungle Book' simply focus' on Mowgli's strive to literally stay in the jungle. 2016's 'The Jungle Book' looks at these two narratives, but cannot choose which direction to go in. At the end of 2016's 'The Jungle Book' - Mowgli defeats Shere Khan and stays in the jungle, but doesn't necessarily find acceptance. I understand that there is an upcoming sequel to Faverau's blockbuster. Maybe this will focus on Mowgli's rejection from human civilisation. However, I think all of this could have been told in one film. For these reasons, there was no need for another version of 'The Jungle Book', that told a different story, nor was there an example of a good remake. Why would you want to remake something that is already perfectly sound. This is the issue with a lot of 'Disney' reimagining's - they try to be something different, but because they try to please all audiences, the films end up being sloppy and pointless. This is apparent in 2019's 'The Lion King', directed by Faverau - not offering anything new. It was very tedious and had me just wanting to watch the 1994's original. Other 'Disney' reimagining's such as 2019's 'Aladdin' - slightly change the aspirations of some of the key characters. This has no effect on the overall narrative and takes away the basic themes such as everyones desire for freedom and opinion on power.",

            "content": "As a mother of three children, family of 5 it's expensive to go to the movies. We do not go often. I have to admit I was looking forward to this one. I loved the Disney 1967 version and after sitting thru a few remakes was excited to see one that follower the Disney cartoon. Sadly it just left me wanting my money back. We don't get to go out often and when we do we are picky about the movie we pick. I'm sick of throwing hard earned money away on crap . Well we did tonight. Out of a family of 5, my husband and myself, three children 7, 9 and 14, not one of us even remotely enjoyed it. The songs I was excited o see and hear again however they were just creepy! Bare necessities was tolerable hut face it bill Murray can not sing. King Louy was creepy and just horrible! Out of all the crappy jungle book remakes I've sat thru looking for a good one, this is by far the worst of them! Here is an idea.... Instead of spending your entire budget on CGI effects.. How about spend it on good writers! Of all the characters King Louy was the absolute worst! I'm so disappointed Disney. I'm going to request that people just stop trying to remake Jungle Book. Stop wasting time and money. After this movie, I think I'll stick to redbox. I can afford to loose $1.50 on a bad movie I think it's time to just forget about going to the movies, we said goodbye to video rental stores a few years ago, it's time to say goodbye to going to the theater. I can't decide which was worse, this version of the jungle book or batman vs superman. I've had it with horrible scripts, cheesy CGI effects and bad actors.",

            "content": "No Hollywood movie could create such a hype in India as did by \"The Jungle Book\". The movie is setup in Indian Jungles based on the work of Rudyard Kipling. The originally written in 1893, Kipling was born in India during period of British colonization. But saying this, books or short stories by him may not have such a impact to Indian audience, as his adaption in anime during 1990's. Mowgli become house hold name at that time and with the comeback of all favorite characters, no wonder the \"The Jungle Book\" is expected to be huge hit in India as well. With a early release in India, I chose Imax 3D to experience the my childhood again. Many of beloved characters like Mowgli, Bagheera (A Black Panthar), Baloo (A Bear) and Shere khan (A Tiger) were returned. But of the entire star cast the most striking character is of Shere Khan. He is mesmerizingly evil, beautifully dangerous and charmingly showstopper. The team did brilliant work on the character and made sure he remain one of the fieriest and deadly villain of all time. The Jungle Book's virtual effect is lot praised in earlier reviews and compared with the epics like Avatar, Life of Pie and Gravity. I would not be tempted with the comparison since Visual effects is indeed splendidly beautiful but what makes a \"The Jungle Book\" a great experience is that it well produce movie. The movie is brilliant adaption of book, the character and emotions are beautifully captured, the life of Mowgli in Jungle is correctly portrayed and Script could not have been better. The jungle Book is a showcase and performance of entire team.With a run time of 105 minutes I had my doubts on its faithful adaptation. Would it able to capture the spirit of characters and plots? But my entire doubt were subdued by smart script. From the first scene the movie had fast moving plot and action pack adventure. The timely entrance and delivery of Shere Khan created all new level for future antagonist. It is the movie all about Mowgli and Shere khan and the battle between Innocence and Evil. As expected Shere Khan own our hearts again. For Indian fans, they can relate with everything from their memories and they would just cherish the movie again.",

            "content": "An excellent movie. If you've seen the 1967 animated classic, this movie won't disappoint you, although its tone is a bit different and is slightly faster-paced. Jon Favreau does a wonderful job of staying true to the story, while giving the audience things they may not have otherwise expected. Mowgli, the young boy who is central to the storyline, is on a journey of self-discovery who happens to entangle himself with all manner of animal creatures along the way, and ultimately finds himself in a battle to prove who he really is.The CGI (computer effects) in this movie is nothing short of fantastic. Practically all of it was shot indoors on a soundstage, and yet the movie looks so real that you feel like you're in the middle of a lush jungle. The real trophy are the animals themselves, who also look extremely real, and can openly talk- although they still retain their 'animal' feel while doing so. The voice casting is stellar, as the actors lend real feeling to their animals.This is one of those summer 'must see' family movies; although, it is a bit darker at times, so younger children may be a little scared. There are two villainous animals, in particular, that are intimidatingly performed and may put kids on edge a bit. The final sequence is equally a bit dark (though very exciting). The ending is also one you may not expect, as it is different than the cartoon version. Overall, this is a wonderful movie- go and watch it! 9/10.",

All the animals, especially the wolves, are incredibly detailed and have fluid movement. and the jungle environment really does pop off the screen in the best way. The story is also well done; there a few changes here and there from the animated 1967 version and of course from the original book, but they all serve this film well by making it quite a bit more intense. This isn't just a movie for kids or adults; teenagers will definitely enjoy it too. There's plenty of animal action and epic set pieces.The voice actors all do great, especially Bill Murray and Lupita Nyong'o. Both have some surprisingly emotional moments that have not been given away in the trailer. Of course, the movie is carried by Mowgli and the little boy who plays him turns in an excellent child performance, one of the best in a while. (Which is especially impressive given that he acted to a green screen most of the time.) Overall, The Jungle Book is a great family movie with very high production value. See it no matter your age.",

            "content": "This movie is indeed an improvement, way better than the original. Very creepy and dark, scary not only for children but also adults like myself, a legit Disney horror movie. However, this whole picture, except for the main character, is CGI \u2013 all of the animals, with no exceptions, right to the jungle itself. They were not real, but they look so realistic that you can't help but live the illusion. It was animated in a way it would put AVATAR to shame, it's beautiful, never lacking of wonder and a sense of dangerous adventure. Moreover, it received acclaim for its story and characters. Let's talk about those characters:\u2013 The hero, Mowgli, the young human boy raised by wolves \u2013 or rather the \"man-cub\" as he's called \u2013, is portrayed by newcomer Neel Sethi. For me, Mowgli is the best character in this movie, because Sethi's acting was superb, he knew how to act with things that were not there, and was not at a loss like most child actors are; on the contrary, he was acting confidently. Basically, he's a little boy playing a little boy trying to find his place. And that is the main focus of this movie: a story of self-discovery, in which a feral child searches for his identity, and tries to survive in a hostile environment. He is confident and curious, exploring his surroundings with confidence and unease alike; he can be stubborn, but never so as to be whiny, unlike his animated counterpart who was so annoying with his stubbornness that I never cared for him. Sethi as Mowgli wants to live in the jungle, his true home, but still he knows the dangers of the green hell, especially Shere Khan. Hence, in every minute, I cared for Mowgli and felt empathy for him; and needless to say, I was always at his side whenever he was in danger.\u2013 The antagonist, Shere Khan, is voiced by Idris Elba. While he is not the best character in the movie (that distinction goes to Mowgli), he is still the best animal character. Elba voiced the embodiment of pure evil, a big cat with a deep, bone-chilling voice to match his disturbing looks. He voiced him with a thick Cockney accent that can scare the living sh** out of you, with a deep voice that constantly goes from low, gentle whispers to loud, blood-curling screams, mixed up with real tiger growls. It was the first time I saw an actual scary Disney villain, by far scarier than most of the animated villains \u2013 believe it or not, I dare even say he is one of the scariest villains of all time, both Disney and non-Disney! This ferocious feline is an improvement upon the original because we saw a lot of him in the movie \u2013 and in that way, I understood why he's considered to be the biggest threat to Mowgli's life. Plus, I remember being furious at him for being so mentally deranged, showing his inflammable hate for Man that he clearly shows no tolerance to Mowgli and no will to let him live, and hence I never wanted him to win. But I was still terrified of him for allowing his desire of killing the boy to turn into an obsession. To make the story short, Idris Elba as Shere Khan is ungodly creepy and scary, frightening and terrifying no matter what he does.\u2013 As for the side characters: Bill Murray as Baloo is hilarious, lovable and caring for Mowgli, much like the original, but sadly I hated him for being most of the time self-interested, something his animated counterpart was not. Scarlett Johansson as Kaa was more frightening and manipulative than her animated counterpart (the fact of changing the character's gender is innovative, mostly because the animated film lacked female characters, and also because the giant constrictors we fear are actually females), but she sadly had only one scene. And I have mixed feelings about Christopher Walken as King Louie \u2013 from the trailer, I never appreciated him, though he can be creepy. On the other hand, Bagheera is brilliantly portrayed by Ben Kingsley, since he's shown to be more tolerant and open-minded, and less whiny than the original. The same thing is said about Giancarlo Esposito as Akela. But the best of the side characters is definitely Lupita Nyong'o as Raksha, the caring and loyal mother to her cubs.Like all great films, the 2016 JUNGLE BOOK certainly has its good sides as well as its flaws. Here's the thing: all those who loved it (me included) couldn't help but point out its flaws, and all those who hated it had enjoyed some of its moments! But nevertheless, the Favreau film is an improvement, especially in its story. Of course, it is a remake of the 1967 movie, but not a copy-paste remake like the recent BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. On the contrary, it was faithful to both the animated film and the Rudyard Kipling books, while at the same time, it was telling its own story, mostly focusing on the conflict the main character is going through as well as the menacing villain. And because of that, it can be considered as a true JUNGLE BOOK adaptation \u2013 I daresay, it's the best JUNGLE BOOK film to date! Of course, it isn't perfect in comparison with the book, but it still has its elements. For example: the animals call themselves \"People\", recite the Law of the Jungle and come together in a Water Truce proclaimed by the Peace Rock; they have their own language, for they call fire \"the Red Flower\", and see elephants as the creators of the jungle, very much like the books. But again, it isn't the perfect adaptation \u2013 the upcoming Andy Serkis version appears to have that distinction. Still, the Favreau movie wins.",

So Disney brings out a new 2016 version, and so what's not to like about this one too? For me, the scenery and action were great; my knowledge isn't good enough to comment on the shortfalls of the high tech animation and special effects but it looked good to me. Bill Murray's Baloo was excellent and Ben Kingsley's Bagheera and Scarlett Johansson's Kaa were great too. I had to look up the cast list to figure out whose voice was King Louie's and when I found out it was Christopher Walken - was I pleasantly surprised - his voice was fantastic for the role. My main critic would be that the dialogue, unlike the original cartoon version, had a definite American twist to it, although there's nothing wrong with that, but.... So the bottom line is, it's difficult not to compare the new film with the original 1967 version but DON'T or you'll lose out. Both versions have their merits, so enjoy both - I know I did.",

            "review_title": "Hit or miss - but more of the latter",
            "content": "Another live-action Disney remake, in a trend that shows no promise of slowing down. Hoo-rah.Jungle Book is a difficult movie to say whether I like or hate, because when it does something good, it's really good. The casting of the animals is nearly perfect and brings out the greatest qualities of their respective characters. I can't complain too much with Bill Murray as Baloo, although he does seem to be channelling Garfield a bit too much here. Strange, considering he hated doing that one. Christopher Walken as Louie sets him up as a sort of Godfather ape, which I certainly didn't mind, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera preserved the panther's upright nature, Scarlett Johansson made a frightening Kaa, and Idris Elba's Shere Khan was very intimidating.All that said, however, I don't think this remake entirely gets the point of the 1967 original's appeal. The animated version of the sixties was not only a much more lighthearted outing, but also a product of its time - slang terms and jazz musical styles that were popular at the time were incorporated in. Now, remaking that into a more realistic, dramatic version isn't a bad idea in and of itself, but it lacks its own identity. Two of the songs from the original are shoehorned in for absolutely no reason other than to evoke memories long past. Seriously, if you want to build a comedic musical from the sixties as a dark and dramatic tale of survival, I doubt highly that musical numbers are going to come across as anything other than incongruous. That said, I'd be lying if I said that hearing Christopher Walken recite and expand upon I Wanna Be Like You didn't make me smile a little. But if you're going to go the nostalgic route, why only include two songs? Where's Trust in Me (only in the credits), Colonels Hathi's March Song, That's What Friends Are For?I can answer those last two, because the elephants (easily the best part of the original for me) are barely more than some demigod cameo and don't speak a single word of dialogue, and the vultures are conspicuous by their absence, except in perhaps an even briefer cameo. Another great character that barely gets any screen time is Kaa, who was built up in the trailer, only to be in the movie to spout exposition for five minutes and then go away forever. Not only is this a slap in the face, but her exposition is entirely pointless. Why not just have Shere Khan do that bit? It definitely would have felt less forced. Speaking of our feline antagonist, he's in it plenty, but I feel his character has had a bit of a downgrade. The 1967 Shere Khan was almost a Shakespeare villain, but with claws and teeth. Even when he knew others were lying right to his face, he'd just smile and lure them into a false sense of security, making their entrapment all the sweeter. That sophisticated sense of intimidation made him so interesting and compelling. The modern Shere Khan comes off as your hypocritical, antisocial, violent villain. \"Roar, man is evil and I shall kill the man-cub who dares to dwell in our presence. I am so determined to kill the man-cub before he does evil things that I will do evil things in the name of the law that I have broken before, apparently.\" This character's motivations make little sense if you think about them too hard, and loses a lot of that charisma in the process. Finally, while Mowgli isn't the unlikable little brat I found him to be in the original, he still isn't helped by some of the worst child acting I've seen in a long time. People tell me to be easy on child actors since they're just kids and they haven't learned the ropes yet. That's nonsense for two reasons. One, that's on the director to make us believe that the kids are the characters they're playing, rather than just doing an imaginary game of pretend in front of a camera. Second, if Shirley Temple, Dakota Fanning, and Taylor Momsen were able to give believable performances as children, then what's the excuse here? Heck, the titular character in Finding Nemo was voiced by a ten-year-old boy! When Neel Sethi screamed the line, \"You're lying!\" I legitimately had Last Airbender flashbacks when the kid playing Aang did the same thing. I doubt that's a good sign. If this kid wasn't surrounded by acting giants giving their best, the movie would be crumbling around his ears like King Louie's temple. Ultimately, while I can't call The Jungle Book a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, it is a bit of a confused one. It can't seem to decide whether it wants to stick closer to the 1967 animated film, the book by Rudyard Kipling, or do neither and interpret the source material its own way. The good parts are great, don't get me wrong, the problem is those bits are outnumbered by misfires.",

            "content": "True to its name, 'The Jungle Book' is all about the jungle. Here, Mowgli (played so convincingly by Neel Sethi) is known as the 'man cub', a strange creature that's widely accepted in the wild society primarily because of his patronage with the wolves, and particularly so with Akela the wise (voiced by Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha his adopted mother wolf (voiced by Lupita Nyong'o). Ah yes, Lupita. She confused me so with this vocal performance - it's difficult to distinctly draw her out, as say one would with Idris Elba who voiced Shere Khan, the big bad Tiger of the jungle. Her versatility in acting and voicing s definitely one to admire.While Mowgli is virtually the only human we get to interact with on the ride, the true attractions are the magically concocted CGI generated animals, who's characteristics and personalities are eschewed in such a relate-able and emotionally-strapping way that we can actually see ourselves in them.In the film, Shere Khan the tiger cannot stomach the fact that a man cub has chosen to settle in the wild, a place that he has ruled over with an iron grip for as long as one can remember. He employs propaganda about an injury he obtained from mankind to demonstrate to the rest of the animals how they cannot be trusted and why Mowgli should be 'gotten rid of' in whichever sense of the word.Akela the leader of the wolf pack, and Raksha, will hear none of it but Mowgli has already chosen the safety of his pack and the community above himself, and under the wise counsel of Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley) who brought him to the wolf pack in the first place, he charts his way to the nearest village to be re- united with his kind. No one said it would be an easy feat, as he's literally caught up in a hypnotic fray with the deceptive giant snake Kaa (voiced by Scarlett Johannson) and ends up meeting the cocky, happy-go-lucky Baloo (voiced by Bill Murray) and they forge a friendship that takes us back to the bond we're so familiar with amidst a musical 'The Bear Necessities' performance.Disney's 'Jungle Book' is a fantastic balance between introducing a generation that may not have watched or grew up with the classic, and taking the generation that already knows it too well not on a trip down memory lane, but on a journey of the intricacies of animal interaction, jungle chaos and beauty, and how delicate and interwoven life really is.",

Now, his acting is not the best but it sure is impressive how he managed to be the only real person on screen at all times and still be good.The Jungle Book impressed me with its visual effects, witch are gorgeous to see on screen. Sometimes I asked myself \"is this really CGI?\". Honestly this movie is one of the most beautiful films in terms of visual effects that I have ever seen. It all looks so real, good job to Jon Favreau and his crew!Another guy who I need to give props to is Bill Murray, who gives us very good \"performance\" as Baloo. Bill hasn't choose the best films to be in recently (Rock the Kasbah) but this one is just on point! If you watched the old Jungle Book movie from 1967 you'll remember how fun Baloo was, well this one is better (my opinion). Bill often makes jokes and make us laugh at the theater. Baloo is there to give the film some comedy to it, and Bill gives us the perfect amount. His relationship with Mowgli is adorable and fun to watch and also is Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). Bagheera is the panther who adopted Mowgli still as a baby and brought him the the wolfs. You can really sense how protective Bagheera is, and how he worry's for Mowgli.There are 2 music scenes in this film, I'm okay with both of them. I liked one better than the other, I feel like one of them was wrong timing and there was no need on putting it there.Shere Khan the main villain of this film, who for a PG movie is pretty scary. He's the tiger who killed Mowgli's dad when Mowgli was still a baby. He was burnt in the eye by the fire that the dad was holding to protect himself, after he killed Mowgli's father he ran away, leaving Mowgli alone. After some years when Mowgli was adopted by the wolfs, Shere Khan came back to kill him as he was afraid that the human could bring any harm to the other animals and the jungle. Bagheera couldn't let Shere kill him, so they make a trip to the man's village to bring Mowgli safe to his people.On the way to the village Mowgli finds himself lost and he has no idea where Bagheera is. He than meets Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) the snake who hypnotize him , I personally found these scene very enjoyable and I think they made a very good job translating the old version of Kaa to this one. Although the scene is not very long, it gives Mowgli a flashback and we can see the full story of how his father died witch was important for the plot.Another very cool character was king Louie (Christopher Walken) who is the Orangutan Gigantopithecus or the gigantic Orangutan. We received a kind of action and tense scene, for me it was were the 3D made the most difference, one more time a very enjoyable and entertaining scene just like the rest of the movie. I don't want to go any further into the plot because of spoiler proposes, its better if you see it for yourself. It's definitely a film worth of seeing at the theater! I wish you'll enjoy as much as I did!",

            "content": "I just want to get out that if this movie doesn't get at least a nomination for an Academy Award then not only would it be very disappointing, it be very disingenuous for the major motion pictures that they promote.The 2016's Disney Jungle Book is directed by Jon Favreau and is another live-action interpretation of Rudyard Kipling's novels with the same name. Now there's been a lot of recent classic Disney animated movies being turned into live action spectacle such as this one. Though now that I think about it the movies don't really stand similar with the original. Nevertheless, this movie, I must say, is probably the best live-action Disney movie I've seen in years!The acting I think is pretty great. The casting for this is gold. Baloo is played by Bill Murray, what better person as a laid back fun guy. Ben Kingsley as Bagheera is great. When he is sentimental, when he needs to be. Though, I never really found him that menacing, more or less as a big, cuddly kitty. Scarlett Johansson as Kaa is pretty awesome. Now, with a great voice like that, it can't go unnoticed from the sound department where you can hear the echoing of the hisses that break each one of her submissive sentences. What is more awesome is that if you stay for the credits you will, for once, hear Kaa's hypnotizing song in full length with Scarlett singing. However, she never really played a major role other than producing exposition for no reason than because the script said it should. It was interesting to me when I learned that Kaa isn't actually a villain in the original books. Next is the amazing, one-of-a-kind, Christopher Walken as none other than the king himself, King Louie. Not only that he actually sings a little from the original cartoon. 'I Wannna Be Like You' will be forever remembered, for me, as him actually singing it. Also he sings the whole song at the end credits, so stay and watch that. Next is Idris Elba as Shere Khan. He, on the other hand, is very menacing as an antagonist. He isn't a star that I have seen a whole lot from, but man does he have a voice. The funny thing I should mention is that Idris has played the chief in Zootopia, and also will have a role in the new Finding Dory as well. He's great and I can't say any more than that I just said. Finally Neel Sethi played Mowgli. He was fine. I can't say that he did an amazing job, but I can't say he did a bad one as well. I can tell that they did as much as they could to boost his enthusiasm for the character. So there's some parts where he tries to say the lines, but they are a little too different than what the scene is trying to convey. He great at the emotional scenes, but don't let that stop you from seeing this movie.I find the story to be very fun and exciting. I like the adventure aspect very much, than I really care for Mowgli's goals. I do enjoy the message of having him to find who he truly is as a good lesson for the character to actually see that he is in fact human. The part where he runs through the jungle with fire and accidentally catches the jungle on fire and where he concludes his character arch for deciding to go with the wolf pack. I find this story to be very linear and which it should be as a family movie. I recommend that you watch it soon and on the big screen where you can hear the music, the sound, the voice acting and you can see the photo-realistic animals; all for your choosing of coarse.",

So basically, the film is 95% male, at minimum, and of the two minor female roles, one is a stereotype. In an animal film for kids there should be an even gender split. I would definitely not show this to children.",

Was he going to base it off of the 1967 animated movie where Mowgli was a boy in the jungle or the 1994 movie where Mowgli was an adult man that had a realistic feel to it.He based it off of the animated movie. He gave human-like personalities to the characters, but they still kept the characters are very similar to the animated version. For example, King Louis was like a jazz artist in the animated version but is more of a mob boss in this one.I really enjoyed Neel Sethi as Mowgli. His interactions with the different personalities in the animals. He also did great being the smart \"human\" but yet doesn't have a clue what he can do even though he does them.",

But lets not forgot the front-man Neel Sethi who executes the role of Mowgli exceptionally well. He reminded me entirely of Mowgli from the original.

            "content": "For future reviews, check https://thetalkingpicturesblog.wordpress.comWe've been waiting a while but now it's finally here! The new live-action movie \"The Jungle Book\" is in theaters now. Disney put a new twist on an old but very familiar story. It's a swinging, thrilling and stunning adventure that will surprise you every minute of the movie.The original Disney movie that was released in 1967 is a story that everybody knows. How do you re-imagine a great story that everybody knows? With a lot of imagination, a great director (and a green screen).Let me begin by saying that Neel Sethi did an amazing job. This upcoming new actor didn't only play the part of an iconic Disney character (Mowgli) but was also able to make this movie a worldwide success. Neel Sethi was actually the only \"real\" human on the set, the other actors were only voice actors for some iconic characters.Starting with the hungry and cheerful Baloo, who is played by Bill Murray. Baloo is well known as the singing bear with his own song. Murray was in my eyes the perfect actor to make this bear come to life. He was able to win your heart over and over again throughout the movie and even had his own version of \"the bear necessities\". Which made you forget about your worries in no time.Moving along to the wise and overprotective Bagheera played by Ben Kingsley. Bagheera is a black panther who rescued Mowgli and protected him his whole life. This is also the case in this remake. Bagheera is a pillar of the movie and is always there to save the day, even when things go south sometimes.Nobody but Scarlett Johansson would be able to trick everybody with only her voice. She was casted to give the powerful Kaa a voice. Johansson had the whole audience in some kind of hypnosis from the moment she was introduced till the last. You really feel part of the movie when Mowgli looks into her eyes and she tells him the story of his life.But it doesn't end with these incredible actors. Lupita Nyong'o takes on the role of the loving mother/wolf Raksha and protects Mowgli with her loving husband Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) by her side. Who's better than Christopher Walken to play the role of the monkey king \"King Louie\"? Walken gives this iconic/swinging monkey his own voice. He makes the audience move with his own version of \"wanna be like you\", which makes you want to dance in your seat.And last but not least is the deep voice of Idris Elba, who gives life to one of the most feared Disney villains \"Shere Khan\". He makes you shiver from the moment that he appears on screen till the last \"edge-of-your-seat\" fight at the end of the movie.This movie is a real must see movie and one of the best live-action movies I've seen so far. You can find a trailer at the end of the review and for those of you who haven't seen it (yet), you should really jump in your car and go see this movie. \"Trust in me\u0085 this movie is worth every penny!\"",

            "content": "Reboots are always very risky. Judge Dredd (1995) was a movie that received much criticisms and dislikes from fans and critics but was a success at the box office. Its reboot, Dredd (2012), was very good but suffered at the box office. We also have the popular Nickelodeon animated series Avatar, which was made into the movie The Last Airbender (2010). The Last Airbender is the most disappointing movie ever made in the entire known and unknown universe.The Jungle Book (2016) is the reboot of the animated movie Jungle Book (1967). The animated movie was based on the collection of books The Jungle Book written by Rudyard Kipling. The animated movie was a beautiful piece that raked up over $200 million box office profit. Just like any movie, we tend to find plot holes. View the plot holes here.The Jungle Book (2016) fixed all the alarming plot holes in the animated movie. The visuals were stunning and breath-taking. The computer graphics looked very real. The animals, though very realistic, had a \"larger than life\" look to them. This might have reduced their realism but it was very pleasant to the eyes.You might be familiar with the animated movie, but I bet you'll still be filled with suspense while watching the movie. They had the right amount of twists that made the story fresh, yet true to a large extent to the source material.You know I'm a fan of Villains. The villain Shere Khan (Idris Elba) was ruthless and filled the atmosphere with fear. He was perfect. The movie's ending was way more pleasant and ideal compared to that of the books' and that of the animated movie.In conclusion, it's a beautiful movie that captivates and enthrals. It's a fresh interpretation of a familiar story. It's also quite different from movies we've seen this year. It is definitely a must watch and I would rate this movie an 8/10.For more reviews, please visit http://cinemashoulds.wordpress.com/",

I understand it's a remake but the original jungle book has so much humor...

            "content": "I was eagerly waiting from the day I saw the trailer. It was exiting,it was like revisiting my childhood. The movie starts in a simple fashion, 3d effects kick in. The sets are stunning and the effects blend in. Neel Sethi as Mowgli as done a great job and having Ben Kingsley as Bagheera was the best choice. Story stays simple, but interesting characters are bought in at regular interval and are timed perfectly. Voices of Scarlett Johansson as Kaa, and Bill Murray as Baloo do grab attention. The thing that left me wanting for more was the run time, that could have been easily stretched by another 15-20 min. The important character in Jungle book is Shere Khan and Idris Elba's voice strikes fear. The Shere Khan character is one which fearsome chord and really takes center stage, reminding us of danger and wildness of the jungle. What I don't understand is that for some reason the character in the movie is much darker(than in books), fearful but kind of ugly too. Shere visual presence just make us feel he is weak/old and that was too way off than what I had experienced in book or animated movie. The songs are situational and good, but are not that fine tuned as any other Disney movies.Being down all of these, it's still a good movie for kids and adults alike. Stunning visuals, some great chases and neatly done effects leaves us much to cheer for. The adaption is justified and Rudyard Kipling's writing and the scenic beauty of Indian jungle are neatly pictured on screen. So drop into theater's to enjoy and experience the adventures of Mowgli and the difficulties he and animals faces on being in jungle.",

Remember, this is Sethi's first acting gig and he did phenomenal for a 12 year old boy surrounded by just blue screens and only puppets to interact with. I guess Jon Favreau's directing had a lot to do with it. Also, those animals! They looked very real...and it was awesome. I heard this movie took more animating than Avatar did which isn't hard to believe since everything is CGI except Mowgli and his sweet stunts (which Sethi did almost all on his own). Perfect for all ages and for all personalities. Can't imagine someone hating every part of this movie, there is something in it for everyone! And for me, that \"something\" was the whole film. This is a masterpiece. If there is one thing I'd change, it would be Kaa's screen time. In the trailers, it seemed as if SHE would play a bigger role in the movie, but that was very false. I hope in the sequel she comes back because I've always liked her interesting and slightly creepy personality. As for the sequel, I have high hopes. They for sure left this movie with a sequel in mind, and with all this success it's not doubt they're already on it. I have no idea what they have planned plot- wise, but I know Disney will create something extraordinary. Overall, wonderful job to Sethi, Favreau, and everyone who worked on this picture, it truly is Oscar-worthy.

Bagheera's typical Om Puri attitude and Baloo's Punjabi accent would keep you smiling. The only thing missing was our favourite, \"Jangal,jangal pata chala hai/ chaddi pahen ke phool khila hai\". Well, you can't be 100% perfect.As a freelance digital artist, I found the animation every bit as spectacular as expected from a Walt Disney movie. The camera-work is dynamic and always action-centric. In fact, I found myself enjoying every second of the movie. At this point, the only thing that can ruin a perfect production like this is a sequel.PS: The movie has shown, and has always shown a very subtle politics, a moral dilemma that we, as countries face to this day.

            "content": "Jon Favreau's 2016 live action remake of The Jungle Book is surprisingly good for a movie which is 90% FX and stars a child actor in his first feature. Personally, I thought it was absolutely fantastic, and brought me back to my childhood days when I had watched the 1967 Disney animation and became fond of the story. The Jungle Book is one of my favorite animated movies ever, as well as one of my favorite books, authored by Rudyard Kipling starting in 1893. The characters are all made in a computer except for one, which is Mowgli, the man-cub of the forest, raised by wolves, living among the animals of the Indian jungle, played by Neel Sethi (no whitewashing!). The voicing cast is absolutely legendary, consisting of respected people from Ben Kingsley (Bagheera, the black panther) to Idris Elba (Shere Khan, the tiger) to Scarlett Johansson (Kaa, the anaconda) to Bill Murray (Baloo the bear). I loved how Jon Favreau based his screenplay more off of the actual book by Rudyard Kipling rather than a completely G-rated children's film. The infrastructure of the film follows the major points of the animated film and adds to it with a more modern touch in action, movement, sophistication, and dialogue, succeeding in making a powerful film of compassion, loyalty, persistence, deception, and responsibility. I adored the soundtrack and John Debney's exotic use of not just the instruments in traditional orchestral pieces, but also the percussion and wind instruments native to India, the setting of the movie. He also remade one of my personal Disney favorites \"Bear Necessities\" into a full-fledged orchestral, choral masterpiece of adventure and radiance, a piece which I have been listening to on repeat for a few hours straight now. I highly recommend you guys take some time out of studying for finals, AP exams, and a plethora of other high school adventures to see this film, not only because it's powerful, inspirational, and beautiful, with gorgeous CGI and cinematography, but because the experience is an absolute dream, especially if you spend some extra bucks to see it in IMAX 3D, like I did. I'd probably give this film an 8.5/10.\"Look for the bare necessities, the simple bare necessities, forget about your worries and your strife...\" *sheds a tear or two*",

            "content": "The original The Jungle Book has never been among my favorite Disney films, and I watched it such many years ago that I don't remember practically anything about it (I went to see it to the cinema, when it was released in 1967 -I guess that says everything about my age-). This allowed me to watch the new live action version with fresh eyes, and the result was entertaining and visually impressive, but forgettable due to a predictable screenplay which rarely reaches the emotional heights it was obviously aiming at. On the other hand, the emphasis on adventure and adorable animals might be everything the kids need to assimilate the ecological message of the film. However, I don't know whether \"ecological\" is the right term. It might be more appropriate to consider it \"philosophical\", because it examines the relationship between man and nature, their mutual fears and responsibilities and the possibility of a pacific co- existence in which the attributes from each species are complemented with each other, instead of competing for the ruling of one over the other (typical Disney fantasy). Unfortunately, the \"magic\" gets a bit diluted if we contemplate the irony of a movie dedicated to celebrate nature... employing the most advanced digital technology to create hyper-realistic images which could have never been captured in the real world. Due to my general misanthropy, I couldn't swallow some scenes of The Jungle Book (2016), and I occasionally agreed with the evil Shere Khan; but I recognize the value of introducing those valid learnings to new generations in a way which doesn't feel like an ethics lesson, but an organic tale which suggests ideas, instead of imposing them. However, what I most appreciated in this film were those fake/real images.The Movie is excellent! Very Good! The Sound Effect's & The Music is Low!",

Over all, other than one awkward line and some speech from Kaa that looked a little off, this movie is wonderful and my personal favorite in a very long time. I cannot recommend this film enough, even people who hated the 1967 animated version. This film is sometimes happy, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, and sometimes it has a lot to say.

I can honestly say this movie looked very realistic and it was cool I felt like I was there. in conclusion I think this film is a must see for all ages it captivates all who see the film and it is definitely by far the best film of 2016 as well as the best of Disney pictures.",

A live action adaptation of the classic animated story we all grew up with.2) It's directed by Jon Favreau. The same guy who directed big screen favorites such as Iron Man and Elf. Favreau has had a couple directing flops, but overall he's decent and can be great at times, and the greatness shines in Jungle Book.3) Bill Murray plays Baloo! I honestly didn't know this going in to the movie, but as soon as I heard his voice it all made sense. He's the perfect guy to play the smart alec, bare necessities bear that was so iconic to a lot of us.Overall, it's a great movie for all generations. Older 80's kids like myself will love the re-telling (even though Jungle Book is from 1967), as we all remember having that Disney VHS tape in our collection. And it's going to be a good introduction for the new generation. If you have kids who have never seen the original, you could definitely let them see this one first and then show them the animated film at home.Also, this movie is WAY better than the first live action adaptation. Some of you might remember the forgettable 1994 flop. I barely remember it, as it was very loosely based on the original story and featured a grown up Mowgli! Ugh. But not this one. This movie isn't a \"continuation\" of the Jungle Book. It IS the Jungle Book.",

Though the trailers looked good, I still wasn't sure if I would actually enjoy it.And, honestly? I did. I really enjoyed it, in fact. It was exciting, funny, and comes with a lot of heart. I teared up more than once thanks to Lupita Nyong'o ( who voices Raksha, Mowgli's wolf mother ) --- she did a really excellent job providing genuine, heartfelt emotion in her voice, in particular. That said, I think the entire cast has a very distinctive voice, and gave excellent performances. Idris Elba was certainly another stand-out as Shere Khan, and Scarlett Johansson was a hypnotizing Kaa with her husky vocals. I could definitely go on all day, but I won't.If you like the Jungle Book, you should probably see this movie. If you like a good movie, you should probably see this movie.

            "content": "The 1967 animated film to me is still one of Disney's best of the \"classic era\". This is not just nostalgia talking, quite a few childhood favourites have not held up, but 'The Jungle Book' is an example of one that has.\n\nExpectations were mixed for seeing this film. The trailer looked great, the voice cast is filled with enormous talent and the featurette was fascinating. It was just that, relating it to the other Disney live action adaptations, whether it was going to be one example of a re-boot that looked stunning, was well-written and performed, respected its original source material(s) and added its fresh spin, like 'Cinderella, or a well-made film with enough other decent elements to make it watchable but also one lacking in soul and charm, like 'Alice in Wonderland'.\n\nFortunately, 'The Jungle Book' is an even stronger example of the former, and is one of Jon Favreau's best films along with 'Iron Man'. Fans of the animation will love recognising the familiar characters and scenes and it was also really nice to see more of Rudyard Kipling's writing and story telling here, the ending being closer to that of the animated film. 'The Jungle Book' is wonderful on its own merits too, just like the Disney animated film was, which was a poor adaptation of the book but worked so well as a film on its own that it didn't matter.\n\nCriticisms for the film are very few. The first criticism is that Kaa's scene and screen-time is far too short, a great character like Kaa deserves far more than a mere five minutes or so. And it is a shame because it is a very suspenseful and hypnotic scene with some of the film's most striking visuals, and the deceptively maternal story teller approach was beautifully written and delivered. Regrettably, the other criticism was \"I Wanna Be Like You\". While one of the highlights of the animated film, and one of Disney's most iconic moments, because the scene is darker and King Louie more intimidating (in size and manner), also because it comes out of nowhere, the light-hearted fun of the song that worked so brilliantly before just doesn't fit here (if Christopher Walken really did desperately want to sing the song, it didn't show in his singing because he sounded uninterested and hesitant).\n\nOn the other hand, the film looks amazing. The rich, expansive cinematography is some of the best of the year so far and the scenery and settings are so vividly detailed and colourful, that reading that it was shot entirely in a warehouse was a shock. The rendering of the animals are staggeringly realistic, especially Shere Khan, Bagheera and the monkeys. Favreau directs with a keen eye for detail and spectacle, yet doesn't forget the drama, cast or the storytelling once. John Debney's music score is full of energy, atmosphere, warm orchestration and vibrant emotion, its referencing of familiar themes feeling nostalgic and affectionate rather than cheap. As for the songs in the film, although \"I Wanna Be Like You\" was a disappointment \"Bear Necessities\" fitted right in and was as good-natured and easy-going as one can hope and \"Trust in Me\" is worth listening to if you stay for the closing credits, Scarlett Johansson with her low-register, smoky yet sensual tone does a surprisingly good job with the song.\n\n'The Jungle Book's' script is very funny (Baloo getting the funniest lines, and some of them were hilarious) without being childish or simplistic while also easy to understand and thought-provoking, there is a good amount of depth too without being too dark or sugary sweet. The story moves quickly and is constantly enthralling, one thing it does better than the animated version is expanding on motivations and making characters more interesting (as great a villain as Shere Khan is in the animated film, his motivation to me seemed clearer here). The climax is dramatically satisfying and darkly tense.\n\nA great job is done with the characters also. They're not complex, but they are likable and interesting, are very true in personality to their animated counterparts and all serve a point in the storytelling, some like Shere Khan and the wolves expanded upon. It was easy to identify with Mowgli, Baloo is a breath of fresh air and to me a great villain is one that one can totally see why the villain is hated or feared but one can also understand their point of view, which is the case with Shere Khan (this is true of the animated film too, but as Shere Khan has more of a back story here it came through stronger to me). The cast were a talented one to begin with and their talents absolutely shine through. Newcomer Neel Sethi does very credibly as Mowgli, it is incredibly hard to react against nothing and apart from a few naturally stiff moments to begin with he handles all the different emotional elements very well. The superbly chosen vocal cast are even better.\n\nBill Murray was born for Baloo (sounding far more engaged than as Garfield), his relaxed but witty voice-work matching the character's easy-going, good-natured personality. Idris Elba effectively puts dread into one's heart as Shere Khan, he's silky, regal, charismatic and genuinely menacing, though George Sanders brought over the suavity and oiliness more. Ben Kingsley is a stern yet sympathetic Bagheera, and Christopher Walken, in a characterisation that is like a mix of mobster boss, Colonel Kurtz and Walken's own mannerisms, makes King Louie intimidating but also entertaining. Scarlett Johansson's voice work for Kaa is eerily sensual, Giancarlo Esposito is a dignified Akeela and Lupita Nyong'o's Raksha is movingly compassionate.\n\nIn conclusion, a truly great film. Works very well as a live-action re-boot and works even more as a film in general. An epic visually stunning adventure, told with fun, heart and depth. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Okay I get why the Director made it cause he wanted to make it more mature and grown up but comparing it to the original which was the last animated movie to bear Walt Disney's person touch is downright disappointing, and if Disney was still alive and saw this film he would have straight up walked out.  At over two hours long it gets way too boring and too many plots are going on they could have made it in an hour thirty and done better but nope they stretched it out and left too many things out. On top of that this movie is straight up living proof that Disney has little to no respect for the original animated movie.  By making a PG rated remake and stretching the run time to over two hours is absurd.  They ruined the jungle book with the sequel released in 2003 now this remake is an atrocity to the 1967 film and the characters that everyone else has loved.  It is not engrossing to watch and has little improvement over the original.  It's just a tarnished remake that has little value in the world of film.",

Knowing that the only real thing we are looking at is Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, is truly a wonder for the time. All the animal characters look photo realistic. Casting Bill Murray as Baloo was a terrific idea. Ben Kingsley is great as Bagheera, Idris Elba plays a menacing Shere Khan and I love Scarlett Johansson's take on Kaa. Now here is the problem: they tried to keep the musical aspect of the original animated feature. I love the music from the original, I believe the music made that movie great. But here it is gutted from its intended purpose and is only included for nostalgic reasons. Scarlett Johansson's version of \"Trust In Me\" is great, but they only used it during the end credits because they needed her character to be an exposition dump. That is a terrible use of Johansson's talent and the money they spent for her studio time to voice Kaa. I could rant about this film for quite awhile, but to sum up I think this film is only worth a watch if you're interested in the technical animation achievement that it represents.",

The cast is complied of Hollywood\u2019s finest actors and actresses, all lending their voices to these beautifully rendered computer generated animals.

From the individual strains of fur, to the types of animals included (I've done so much research on Indian wildlife today), you can really see the details of the cg effects.  Just watch the end credit sequence alone, and it'll prove it.\n\nThere are 3 huge improvements to this versus others: Sher Khan's face, King Louie, and the intensity of the animal fight scenes.  The movie isn't free of problems: I imagine someone will have issues with talking animals vs non-talking animals, that he'd have to learn the language (so how would he ever understand Sher Khan or Baloo?).\n\nIf anything, I think the writing took a hit.  Where the original had a subtle but strong fables sequencing to it (sort of modular moral stories with shifting focus on characters), this is structured much closer to how many video game stories are structured, serialized chapters with some level of power creep and shifting focus of environment and goals but all focused on Mowgli.  And I don't think the writing is bad, but this Jungle kid (never actually reveals his backstory, somewhat of a relief honestly) is performing clean engineering using vines and pulleys and armor (that wouldn't work) with calculated positioning.  I understand that some people just have talent for some things, but I had to question whether or not I could do the same thing.  I could, but I'd have to do it different ways.\n\nAnd in all fairness some of the stupid /inconsistent things he gets up too, even though he's a \"take charge\" Mowgli in this version really got to me: I was literally cheering for Sher Khan at certain points.\n\nUltimately I had a good time with it, and I think most people and possibly their pets will too (my cats were interested for a while).",

Some of the emotional moments really worked for me. Also, I like Bill Murray as Baloo and Christopher Walken as King Louie. Also, there are only 2 (technically one) song numbers that are decently funny. However, the technology is the highlight of the film. The photorealistic backgrounds and animals are revolutionary in cinema and changed film as we know it (for Disney anyway). Overall, some beats don't work, but enough do to make this a great film.",

The big pull of this film is its visual effects, the whole thing is just visually stunning, and well deserving of its Oscar win amongst other accolades. A lot of the casting choices were just brilliant, Scarlett Johansson as Kaa in particular was a stroke of genius, and we can't ignore the performance of young Neel Sethi as Mowgli, that kid has a bright future ahead of him, especially should he choose acting as a way forward.

From it's amazing \"non politically\" picked cast to CGI animals that actually show emotion when they talk. It is truly a masterpiece of a movie. \n\nNeel Sethi (Mowgli) gives an amazing performance given he's interacting with CGI animals that aren't in front of him. Of course it helps when your voice acting cast are actual actors. Idris Elba as the tiger Shere Khan, is perfect, you really feel his vengeful spirit. Bill Murray as the lazy but lovable bear Baloo is hilarious. Ben Kingsley kills it as the wise panther (or leopard?) Bagheera. Scarlett Johansson as the seductive giant snake Kaa was really good. Christopher Walken gives a creepy but awesome performance as the giant Orangutan King Louie.\n\nThe reality is that this movie was PROPERLY CASTED and you feel the results throughout the whole adventure because the animals do feel alive with emotion. You never feel like someone is just reading a script in a booth (like you do many times in Lion King) and that helps deliver the message of \"accepting others even though different\" very well. \n\nThe story is not a complete copy of the original (unlike Lion King) which helps give it more freshness. I don't know how director Jon Farveau's (he directed both Jungle Book and Lion King) two movies could feel so apart from each other in quality. Perhaps Disney executives got involved in the casting of the most recent movie? The original Jungle Book is not a very popular animated film in my opinion, so maybe that's why Disney selected ACTORS NOT SINGERS for this one. \n\nFINAL REVIEW: 9.5 out of 10. Masterpiece.\n\n\n\n\n",

Once the tiger Shere Khan finds out about Mowgli his presents in the jungle, he won't stop at nothing till he gets the boy killed. Mowgli has to flee from the wolfpack and ends up in another part of the jungle where he makes new friends and enemies. Once Mowgli hears of a tragic event that happend back at his home with the wolfs, he goes back to fight Shere Khan with the Red Flower (aka fire).\n\nEverything, and I mean, everything in this movie looked so real. I know most of it is animated but I really got confused sometimes, the special effects were amazing. I'm very interested in seeing how exactly they filmed everything. Neel Sethi (who plays Mowgli) did a great job, when you think about it, he probably had to act with a lot of green walls and shapes. The parts where he had to talk weren't sometimes as great, but I think he really did a good Mowgli. I saw this movie in IMAX 3D and most of the time I'm not very impressed with the 3D, but I loved it in this movie! There were a few times when water came at you and even stuck on the \"camera\", I really liked that, it gave even more dimension.\n\nThe voice actors really fitted their animals, or the other way around. It was just right. Bill Murray as Baloo brought some fun laughs. All the animals in The Jungle Book looked magnificent, and they where so large. It was really impressive. All the nature was so detailed, the home of King Louie looked really great. King Louie looked really impressive as well, and I don't know if it's just me, but when I looked at him I felt like I was really looking at Christopher Walken (That doesn't really sound like a compliment now does it, haha), his eyes just had that little something in there, I don't know. I liked it. Although I didn't really liked really liked that scene in particular, it didn't brought much to the story. I can't really remember the old Jungle Book, so I can't really judge story wise, but I really liked it and it felt like the movie ended before I even realized it.\n\nI really enjoyed watching The Jungle Book. Everything looked so beautiful and realistic, I can only imagine how many great things they can do with this technology. It was one of the first times I really listened and enjoyed the music in a movie, it fitted perfectly and gave an even more wonderful experience to it all.",

Akela never raged at Mowgli for bringing the Red Flower to the council saying he brought shame to all of us, rubbish .  Mowgli saved Akela life while driving out Shere Khan and the coward wolves who took the Tigers side.  The King Louie character is a joke the bandar-log were all monkeys in the jungle no apes.  When the movie introduced a white person, I was out of there .  I found the movie insulting and patronizing to my memories and feeling of my Love for the Jungle animals and their wildness.

You may call me a purist and I suppose I am but I don't feel this trash does little if no justice to the fine literary style of Rudyard Kipling .  Thank You",

He used every special effect he could to ensure this looked great. The story hits the same beats as the original for the most part, but does so in a more mature and modern way. I must credit Neel Sethl (Mowgli). His performance is very strong, especially when you consider what he was up against. He had to lead a major film while only interacting with CGI characters around him. That\u00e2(TM)s a tough ask but the kid nails it. He showed a wide range of emotion and delivered his lines well. The voice cast is very strong with Idris Elba (Shere Khan), Sir Ben Kingsley (Bagheera), Bill Murray (Baloo), and Giancarlo Esposito (Akela) doing the strongest work. \n\nWeaknesses: As noted, this was a more mature version of the story. That worked in some places but made others awkward. King Louis (Christopher Walken) came across strangely for one. For another, the music in the movie lacked. There\u00e2(TM)s not a lot but the songs from the original are fun and memorable. In this one, they lose everything that makes them enjoyable and are easily forgettable. I wish we got more from Kaa (Scarlett Johansson). The character is a key part of the original story and a decent piece of the animated film, yet it relegated to a single scene here. It\u00e2(TM)s extra disappointing considering the good voice work by Johansson.\n\nOverall: it misses some of what made the animated film so beloved, yet this remake still has a lot going for it.

Sure, having Jon Favreau at the helm was promising, but how could they possibly bring this to life without being extremely, well, bad. The answer is with dazzling CGI sets, an amazing voice cast and a good effort from newcomer Neel Sethi as Mowgli; they not only made it possible, but did it to a degree that would be difficult to improve upon. Sure, the CGI isn't quite photo-realistic yet and the whole thing was missing the familiar light-hearted, silly feel to it that the original animated classic had (although the scene with Baloo and Mowgli singing 'Bear Necessities' captured it perfectly), it was still pretty darn good.\n\nGreat effort Disney, looking forward to more live-action stuff.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, it looks like Disney decided to re-make an old classic.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Can you re-make a new classic? Let s recap The Jungle Book.\n\nSCOTT: We meet Mowgli (Neel Sethi), a young man-cub who was left for dead in the jungle and then rescued by a black panther named Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). Mowgli is raised by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and her pack of young wolf-cubs. The young boy tries to act like a wolf but on occasion he can t help showing the cleverness of a human. During this particular year, the dry season hits the jungle hard. All the animals call a truce so that they can all drink safely at the ever-shrinking watering hole.\n\nGREG: That s when Shere Khan arrives and declares that there s not enough room in this jungle for him and the man cub. Once the truce is over he wants young Mowgli turned over to him. But Baheera decides to return the boy to the man-village so that he can be among his own kind. And so begins the boy s odyssey.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, I have to admit, I greeted the arrival of this movie with skepticism and cynicism. I m a big fan of Disney s original 1967 version of The Jungle Book, and I saw no need to revisit such hallowed, near-perfect ground. Well, I m here to tell our readers that as fabulous as the original movie was, this 2016 version is even more wondrous and spectacular. I m reluctant to call any movie flawless, but this film was damn near perfect. I m talking about character development, hero s journey, supporting characters, CGI effects, you name it. I was dazzled and beyond satisfied.\n\nGREG: Yeah, The Jungle Book was a much more sophisticated bit of animation than its predecessor. You will believe a tiger can talk. However, there were moments when I wondered if Mowgli was animated himself. When a film is clearly a cartoon (as was the 1967 version) you aren t thrown out of the story by such questions. But there were times when I was asking myself  is this Mowgli a CGI or not?  And in those moments I was looking at the technology and not the story. It was a bit of a distraction. But on the other hand, when you compare to a movie like Zootopia where the characters are animated - Jungle Book seems light-years ahead. The animals looked like lions and tigers and bears. Also, the story itself is subtler than the original. The original story has Mowgli going from animal to animal trying on their lifestyle to see if he fits. Ultimately, Mowgli finds the man-tribe and realizes this is where he fits in. Bears should be with bears, and boys with boys. But that message doesn t fit with 21st century sensibilities. In 2016, Mowgli returns to his wolf pack. He is a member of a blended family and he is at home with his differences. He draws strength from the variety of the animal kingdom and he takes his place as an equal among different animals. It s a more complex message.\n\nSCOTT: The heros journey is compelling and non-traditional in some ways. It follows the classic journey in that Mowgli is sent away from his home and then encounters his bear friend Baloo and a couple of villainous obstacles in the form of the snake Kaa and the orangutan King Louie. Usually a hero is missing some inner quality that he must obtain in order to triumph. The Jungle Book turns this formula upside-down by identifying his human intelligence as his fatal flaw. At the beginning of the film, the animals with whom Mowgli lives are critical of his humanity and try to drill it out of him. It s also one of the reasons why Shere Khan wants him gone. But rather than shed this quality, Mowgli stays true to himself and uses his human cleverness to help himself and others. In fact, at the film s climax, it is Mowgli s ingenuity that saves him from Shere Kahn. Thus we have an interesting hero s journey that turns the hero s transformation on its head by underscoring the importance of not changing as a means of completing the journey. Instead of needing to find his missing inner quality, Mowgli has already been in possession of it and must hang onto it despite pressures to abandon it. For me this makes his hero path fascinating and unique.\n\nGREG: That s an interesting distinction. Mowgli gets many mentors in this story. Of course there s Akela from the wolf pack, and Bagheera, later Baloo shows Mowgli how to enjoy the easy life. Ultimately, Mowgli listens to his inner self and combines all his mentors into a whole. I enjoyed The Jungle Book more than I expected. Disney has taken animation to a new level with the photo realism of the jungle animals. I was occasionally distracted by trying to determine if I was looking at a real person or a CGI image, but other than that I was drawn into this story and completely enjoyed myself. I give The Jungle Book 4 out of 5 Reels. Mowgli makes for an interesting hero. He starts out sheltered and naive and grows to become mature and confident. It was a gradual process and enjoyable to watch. I give Mowgli 4 out of 5 Heroes. The mentors in this story, including the unwritten code of the wolf pack, gave Mowgli the direction he needed to overcome his lack of confidence and allowed him to grow into the person he was destined to be. I give the mentors in The Jungle Book 4 out of 5 Mentors.  Movie: Mentors: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: You re right about the richness of the mentorship in this movie, and I have some observations to make about it before launching into my ratings. We re learning that heroes receive assistance from many different types of  helpers , for lack of a better term. A mentor is one such helper, and we define a mentor as an older figure who serves as the hero s teacher. Sometimes these helpers assume a parental role; in this film, Akela plays that role with Mowgli. Sometimes these helpers are guides who know the terrain and who lead the hero to the special world; here Bagheera assumes that role. These guides could be called Charons, named after the ferrymen in Hades who guided people between worlds across the river Styx. Other helpers are bodyguards who offer physical protection for the hero; this role aptly describes Baloo the bear. Still other helpers are coaches who physically train the hero; Akela and Bagheera both share those duties here. As you ve pointed out, Greg, mentoring can also come in the form of an internalized code of conduct; the wolves code in this film plays a pivotal role in steering Mowgli toward noble behavior. So we have physical, transportational, parental, and didactic teachers all helping our hero survive the jungle and defeat Shere Khan. The Jungle Book is one of the richest mentor/helper stories we ve encountered in the movies in 2016. Overall, this movie is a true gem, one of Disney s finest offerings of the past decade. This coming-of-age story is as old as storytelling itself, centering on a hero who must find his true identity. Mowgli cannot be trained to become a wolf, although he certainly makes the effort. His journey is a path toward manhood, and only through defeating the evil Shere Khan can his humanity be revealed. Every aspect of this movie is stirring and triumphant. It s Reel Heroes Hall of Fame material to me, and so I m more than happy to award this film the full 5 Reels out of 5. As I m mentioned, the hero s journey is cleverly turned on its head, with Mowgli s apparent flaw of  cleverness  being precisely the quality that must be cultivated for Mowgli to achieve success on his journey. So ironically, the transformation that our hero s friends implore him to undergo at the beginning of the movie is exactly what he must avoid undergoing in order to succeed on his journey. Mowgli is a wonderful hero on a classic journey in every sense of the word. He merits the full 5 Heroes out of 5. I needn t delve again into the rich assortment of mentor-like characters who assist our young hero on his journey. These characters are an inspired collection of teachers with unique and appealing personalities, and they help Mowgli emotionally, mentally, and physically. They are among the best mentors in the movies we ve seen this year, rivaling those seen in Eddie the Eagle I award Mowgli s helpers a Mentor rating of 5 out of 5. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:",

It's really well done but no matter how goof CGI gets, it will never be completely believable. And this film has CGI everywhere you turn, and at points it can be a little unnerving. All in all, I don't regret seeing this film, but I don't think I'll be buying the DVD any time soon.",

When a tiger named Shere Khan threatens to kill a boy who's been raised by a wolf pack, they decide to return him to the local human village for his own protection, but the trek is a long and dangerous one.  Featuring the voice talents of Bill Murray, Idris Elba, Christopher Walken, and Scarlett Johansson, the film has an impressive cast.  And the computer animation is exceptionally good and remarkable photorealistic (though the seams show from time to time).  Also, the score does a nice job at working in the original themes and songs from the animated version.  However, nothing is really gained from the live-action format.  Still, The Jungle Book is a solid family film that's entertaining and fun.",

This movie has set the standard for CGI, it's very hard to tell what is real and what is CGI, but it's all stunning. It's a fantastic adaptation of the original story, and includes just enough references and nods to the animated classic for us old folks that remember it. It follows the same basic structure of the animated film, but this version is much darker. It ain't just a romp through the jungle, Mowgli is in real danger at all times, and the danger is palpable. The story itself is still pretty standard and can even get a little dull, but director Jon Favreau has done an excellent job of keeping it moving and introducing elements to keep the viewer entranced. (And has anyone else noticed that this story is exactly the same as \"The Lion King\"?? Seriously, think about it, it's identical in structure and themes). As a fan of the animated film, it was hard for me to hear other people voicing these characters, but I have to admit they are really wonderful... especially Ben Kingsley as Bagheera and Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who are purrrfect for those characters (I'm sorry, I couldn't resist!!!). I missed the great Phil Harris as Baloo, but Bill Murray was a great pick for how this Baloo is written. The exception is Christopher Walken as King Louie. While the animated King Louie was more of a comical good-time character, this version is really menacing, and Walken's quirky, New-York-accent-heavy voice was just too comedic for the character (I loved the \"More Cowbell\" reference though!). This adaptation will certainly be hailed as the definitive \"Jungle Book\" film, and I wouldn't expect a reboot anytime soon. P.S. Stay for the closing credits, they are really clever, and you get to hear the full versions of the revamped songs.",

Watching both movies back to back can truly allow for the adults to relive their childhoods and also allow their children to benefit from the live action remake. The voice work was alright, but hearing Bill Murray and Christopher Walken sing, especially versions of songs that are universally loved from the original movie, I could have lived without that. My main complaint about this movie is of course the fact that none of it, outside of Mowgli, is real. It looks great, but knowing that this kid ran around basically a green screen warehouse with bits and pieces of foliage, dirt and water made me worry about the upcoming Lion King remake. This movie is still a great family night that looks stunning and has the possibility to be as memorable and historic as the 1957 film.",

This movie already loses a star, because it exists. And than comes the acting, and the CGI.... Here is the problem with special effects: We know it isn't real, so it bugs the hell out of me. I loved the CGI in Rogue One, I actually stopped for a second and though \"Wait, did they found doppelg\u00e4ngers??\". IT WAS THAT GOOD. I found out the whole Jungle Book is CGI after I saw it and it still looked fake as shit. Aside from the plot-holes that this movie didn't bother to fix, to the acting, CGI. This movie WILL make you love the original even if you hated it. I don't understand why people liked it. It's so lifeless. Just watch the original again... I hate this movie, almost as much I hate the fact that it even exists.",

Shere Khan, a tiger and king of the jungle, is angered at Mowgli's presence, as he knows Mowgli will one day grow up and adult humans are a threat.  Mowgli leaves the pack and makes for the nearest human settlement, but this isn't enough for Shere Khan, who is determined to see him dead.\n\nBased on the Rudyard Kipling novel and with roughly the same central plot as the famous 1967 version, this is not in the same league as that version.  While the 1967 one had a wonderfully innocent, feel-good vibrancy to it, aided by some great, stick-in-your-head songs, this version is much darker and far less energetic.  While this is not necessarily a bad thing it just doesn't work as well for the story.  The songs are what carried the 1967 version along and made it so memorable, and, but for two tunes, the 2016 version is music-less.   \n\nHaving decided to make a dark drama, director Jon Favreau then tries to introduce comedy/lightheartedness, in the form of Baloo, and this jars with the remainder of the movie, feels forced and largely falls flat.    \n\nOn the plus side, the CGI is great (though that is a given for a 2016 movie). \n\nOverall, mildly entertaining.  Do yourself a favour: watch the 1967 version instead.  (Never thought I'd find myself preferring a musical version of a movie to a largely-non-musical version, but there it is).",

The wolves (and the rest of the jungle) must contend with Shere Khan, a ferocious tiger who would see Mowgli dead. Along the way, they are helped by the carefree bear Baloo.\n\nWhat the plot summary cannot tell you is how utterly breathtaking this movie is. The computer effects are stunning, and the animals are incredibly realistic. Incredibly, the performance of Neel Sethi elevates the film further; this is no bratty kid, but a strong and confident lead.\n\nThe voice cast is also excellent. Ben Kingsley strikes a great balance between Bagheera's obedience and compassion. Bill Murray similarly does very well with Baloo's carefree nature. Idris Elba is very menacing as Shere Khan.\n\nIt is simply marvelous that animals could have such realism and expressiveness. This is the gold standard for CGI going forward.",

The CGI was awful, the animals didn't move correctly (I'm not including them talking, obviously that requires a suspension of disbelief since animals don't talk) and they were... rubbery and unnatural... it was just unpleasant looking. It never looked like the kid was ever actually interacting with real things, it was more like Space Jam for me only at least with Space Jam it is supposed to look and be ridiculous so you can just laugh it off. Aside from the CG the story was just... boring and forgettable.\nI'll be the first to admit I don't really love CG but I can get over it if it has a purpose and is really well done, like Gollum, he is freaking awesome looking and feels so real that I can easily suspend disbelief and buy into Gollum actually being there. Now this is half because Andy Serkis is amazing and half because they actually did a great job with the animation. This movie, on the other hand, was just a mess and was horribly unpleasant to watch.

It has really surpassed them all. \nI remember growing up with this story, watching the VHS version from 1967 while singing with Baloo who was voiced by one of the best (if not the best, certainly my favorite) Mexican comedic actors, Germ\u00e1n Valdez \"Tin T\u00e1n\". Some of these memories are quite mixed. Good feelings, happily singing with my brother (Hi bro!) and not making it to the end of the film because I was too stressed with the fire and all. \n\nSo, moving on to this reboot. Directed by Jon Favreau, starring Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Christopher Walken, Lupita Nyong'o, Bill Murray, Giancarlo Esposito, Scarlett Johansson, and introducing Neel Sethi. \n\nThe best way I would describe this movie is certainly as a rollercoaster of emotions. I have not read the book, but making a comparison with the last movie, I believe the story is well preserved. It starts a bit stressful, full of chases and dangerous tasks. While having the expected introductions, we meet Mowgli, a man-cub living in the jungle. And Bagheera, a panther who entrusted the boy to the pack of wolves that raised him. The characters are well developed, the actors did an amazing job capturing their essence in a deep story about teamwork, family, and friendship. Friendship overcoming obstacles, and bonds stronger than stone. \n\nThe story is about family and friendship, about growing up and having the adventure of a lifetime. Mowgli, learns to accept himself for what he is and understands that sometimes you don't know best, but still can do good and help those you love. \nNature is always the greatest teacher, and it will never cease to amaze me particularly how it was captured from the landscapes to traditions and laws. In my head, I want to believe that the water truce is something that really happens in the Jungle, and all animals pay their respects to elephants. \n\nOn the other hand, I must say that the animation is superb, I really didn't know where reality ended and the animation started. So, the morning after watching it, I went on YouTube to look for some insight. Blue screens everywhere! Oh, what a great time to be alive! Simply amazing. \n\nI highly recommend this picture, I suppose that some of you have seen it already, but for all of you out there who haven't, please go! Right now, stop what you're doing go watch it!\n\nFrom my blog: filmpressionist.blogspot.com",

But it was fine, it was okay, and I appreciated the nods to the previous cartoon in the score.   \n\nWhen Christopher Walken (now a parody of himself) turned up as King Louie, though, that's where I got clued as to what *did* offend me about it:.\n\nThis is \"The Jungle Book\" for squares, daddy-o.  I like a little (actually, a lot) more jazz in my jungle, and this one swings...like a rock.

So while the eye is trained on marveling at the wonderful graphics like the ruffles of feathers or individual strands of hair or oddly accurate mouth movement for the animals who speak, all that together makes for one expensive show.\n\nAt just over 90 minutes, The Jungle Book is a short-lived wonder.  Most of our time is spent with Neel Sethi as Mowgli while he traverses the jungle on two feet while his \"brethren\" paw around on all fours.  It really is like watching an animated movie come to life.  His interaction with each beast, whether it's hugging or stroking or bumping into, makes you wonder if he really did this with actual animals!  The short run time also keeps us from fully developing certain characters from the books like Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) or King Louie (Christopher Walken), but we get a ton of fun with Baloo (Bill Murray), Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) and one of the best animal/human villains, Shere Khan (Idris Elba).\n\nThe Jungle Book has opened up a new phase of remakes in Hollywood.  We'll see classics like The Lion King, Mulan and others roll into this 'live-action' genre soon enough, but if they can match what The Jungle Book did aesthetically pound for pound, we'll be in for a treat.",

            "content": "While, like any child since the 1970s, I have seen the 1967 Disney's The Jungle Book, it has been a fair number of years, and all that really stuck is \"The Bare Necessities\" and some chatter from Cub Scouts. But even without a deep bond with the most famous adaptation, the live-action redux seemed unnecessary from the trailers for one reason: its grimness. Check out the original trailer again, and feast yourself on that smorgasbord of animal scowling. Notably, it ends with Baloo lazily swimming down the river, and while it certainly has some unnecessary action and scare elements to it, it still has the same feel-good spirit in its veins as the animated version, putting a just-fresh-enough spin on the material to justify double-dipping.\nThe decision to go half-and-half with CGI and live-action pays off rather well, immediately distinguishing it visually from it predecessor, and with high-quality animation that only rarely betrays its true computerized nature. It's still a bit off-putting the first time a panther opens its realistically rendered mouth and speaks, but its easy enough to get over. The voice cast is mostly excellent and occasionally eclectic; Bill Murray as Baloo the bear and Christopher Walken as King Louie the monkey have no reason to really work, but Murray's amicability and laid-back delivery suit Baloo perfectly, and Walken's disjoint mafioso delivery saves what's otherwise the least essential part of the film. Scarlett Joahnsson's Kaa appears only briefly, but re-affirms her as a surprisingly stunning vocal character actor, an inviting yet otherworldly presence. Idris Elba is fierce as Shere Khan, although his accent breaks through distractingly at times. While the film wisely decided not to be a musical, \"The Bare Necessities\" does make an appearance. While its not the show-stopper it was in the original, Murray's laid-back approach suits the film perfectly. Less perfect is the in-film brief interlude of King Louie singing \"I Wanna Be Like You\", which distracts and clashes tonally. But some of songs are re-done with the movie cast for the credits, showing that the cast would have been more than up to the challenge had they gone for a straighter remake.\n\nWhile it is less of an issue than the trailers made it out to be, the new Jungle Book is still aimed at an older audience than the original (maybe 10 year olds instead of 5 year olds). It makes scary characters out of not only Shere Khan, but King Louie and Kaa. The characterizations work, but often end up devolving into action sequences the pile up to make the back half slightly overstuffed. While I would not want to deprive the world of Walken as King Louie, the sequence really could have been excised, particularly its action denouement. But Favreau brings some art to it all, staging some great shots of the beasts at his disposal (I'm a big fan of the scene where Shere Khan confronts the wolf pack). And as overused as the action tropes are, the message that being able to tie a knot makes you a worthy adversary to something with the sharpest claws is certainly one worth sharing with your local Cub Scouts.",

There was not a single moment the camera was still, it was always moving about, which really added to the sense that everything in this jungle is teeming with life. The director Jon Favreu (who did Iron Man) made some brilliant choices which lead to some truly beautiful shots. I'm not a huge fan of CGI but the animation work in this film was sublime and bar a few minor points, everything felt so real. It really was a visual marvel and I regret not seeing this on the big screen in 3D when I had the chance. \n\nThe cast was a huge draw and I was initially worried some of the major talent they had would be wasted but this was certainly not the case. Each actor brings amazing life to these familiar characters with Bill Murray as Baloo being a particular standout, Murray's trademark humour really lending itself to the character. Newcomer Neel Sethi as Mowgli was also amazing, especially as this was his first film and he had to interact with characters who were not really there. I hope we see more from this talented young kid. \n\nThe modern take on the Classic Disney film's songs were also wonderful, and who knew Bill Murray and Christopher Walken had such great voices? \n\nAs you can tell, I loved this film. In a year ruled by rushed and unimpressive sequels, remakes and reboots, this film is truly one of the best films 2016 has had to offer. I recommend this to everyone. It truly is a bear necessity to watch!",

You can end up with wonderful movies like the new Cinderella and you can end up with pointless, hopeless movies like Maleficent. But I have faith in what Disney is producing at the moment. They seem to be the master story tellers of our time. The Jungle Book was simply terrific. The acting from the one human and the voice acting was splendid. The characters were so loveable or so menacing depending on what they were trying to convey. I loved the world that Disney has created with this movie. The wolves have an oath that they say, the jungle has a truce that happens in times of drought, each character has history and some characters only meet for the first time during the movie because the jungle is a big place. It is so well thought out. Disney classics are beautiful to watch and remember how great they were and how important they were in movie history. But overall they are not amazing stories. The animated Jungle Book is really not a very well made movie, it just has catchy songs. This new movie however is far better and deserves its own place in being a modern classic.",

However after seeing it on Netflix only 6 months after release date  made me nervous i guess that shouldn't have mattered since a lot of great movies are on that platform. the voicing in this movie was the biggest let down and to be honest i would still give that a 3.5 at it's worst meeting all of the greats Con had to be one of the best. but my favorite part of the movie was when mogile had to get away they did a great job making this movie appeal to people who seen the original and people who may haven't. this is a must see for any jungle book fan!!!!",

            "content": "The Jungle Book: Is a Movie That Will Captivate the Viewers Heart\n\tThe Jungle Book remake was made in 2016 and the original animated Disney version was aired in 1967. The director of the new film was Jon Favreau. The cast's major actors for this film include Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, and Scarlett Johansson. Neel Sethi who played Mowgli, the young boy, got his break-out role with this film. The character of Mowgli was the only human in the film since the other characters are all CGI animals. The film was full of emotion, suspense and amazing CGI effects. Everyone that was involved with this film did a superb job of making the treasured Walt Disney's 1967 version come to life. The movie's purpose was to captivate the heart of its viewers by giving a unique emotional tie to each character in a way that is different from the animated version. The movie's central analysis makes the reader ask the question of \"what should humans relationship be with wild animals and how far should that relationship go?\" \n\tMowgli was found as a boy by Bagheera (Ben Kingsley), a black panther. Bagheera takes the young boy to a group of animals, a pack of wolves, who he knows he can trust to raise the young boy. The wolves raise Mowgli as one of their own while Bagheera watches over him at a distance throughout Mowgli's life. Mowgli meets a best friend during his travels in the form of a bear named Baloo, as voiced by Bill Murray. The bear encourages Mowgli to view the jungle as a relaxing place and to understand that there is more to life than living by the rules. The movie has multiple villains that the animals in the jungle as well as the audience are afraid of. One villain was a human-hating tiger, Shere Khan (Idris Elba).  He's out for vengeance against humans and once he learns about Mowgli, he decides to not rest until the boy is dead. The second villain is a python named Kaa voiced by Scarlett Johansson who uses hypnosis on her prey. The red flower (fire) serves as another villain and plays a major role in the films plot symbolizing fear and power. For example, King Louie, an orangutan, voiced by Christopher Walken desires the red flower which he thinks Mowgli has or can create. The dynamic personalities within this film provide entertaining characters that the audience is connected to.\n\tThe film starts out full of suspense and lets the audience immediately see the pretty colors of the jungle. When I watch this film, I see and feel darkness, happiness, family, friendship, fear, power, beauty, and fear of the unknown. A strength of the movie is that the director stayed true to the characters and plot in comparison to Disney's 1967 version of the film. I believe the reason why this movie is so impactful is because it brings the audience's fears to reality. A weakness of the film is that certain parts of the movie were dark and not suitable for younger audience. Why did the director decide to take this route? Some might say that younger children are becoming used to darker scenes and this movie did not seem scary. \n\tIn conclusion, this movie will leave a lasting impression on its audience leaving them wanting more. I strongly recommend this film to teenagers and adults but, depending on how young a child is, parent discretion could be advised. The CGI in this film is purely unbelievable and is enough to make any movie goer see the film. Lastly, the movie makes the reader question what human relationships with wild animals should include and how dangerous we are to their lives.",

            "content": "Though not too fond of the reboot trend in current Disney films, with The Jungle Book earning massive critical acclaim there was no way of missing it.\n\nThe Jungle Book (1967) was one of my favourite Disney animations as a child even though I had never read Ruyard Kipling's original source novel. So admittedly I was hesitant at the announcement of a live-action reboot. However, Jon Favreau's continuous accomplishments as a film director gave him enough status to earn the role of director in my view. Having been released to worldwide positive reception, I must contend that I did not find the same magical experience as countless other viewers. And frankly, The Jungle Book has far greater ambitions than reboots such as Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Malificent (2014). It does insist on turning the story into a darker adventure film with a climactic battle as the reboot trend demands, but at the same time it desires to be a fun tribute to the original Disney film with the same lighthearted charm. For all its gracious attempts, the ultimate result is a really inconsistent one.\nThere isn't any real story development in The Jungle Book. Structured like a series of vignettes with one different setting after another unfolding with the same protagonist in every scene to tie everything together. Audiences are taken on a journey through a visual-effects constructed world of CGI animals but little actual consistent development in the narrative. The story cuts between this and some sporadic sequences depicting Shere Khan discussing the political backdrop of the animal kingdom, failing to tie these two narrative together all that nicely. Essentially, the story oscillates between Mowgli's adventures with several different animals and a series of dull talkative moments. Politics aren't likely to be the interest of a young audience, but in a means to reach out to them the political dialogue of The Jungle Book is a little too simplistic in exploring its themes to be sufficiently innovative.\nBut what's more frustrating is the fact that The Jungle Book doesn't offer any kind of real comedic flow. While the intense atmosphere captures the reality of surviving in the jungle's harsh conditions and evading predators, the story forgets that it is a fantasy. It's based on a Disney film about a boy in the jungle surviving with his animal friends, and yet at the same time it really insists on maintaining the darker elements of its source material. The ambition to combine both is never an easy one, but as much as Jon Favreau tries he just cannot form a smooth hybridity from these elements. Instead, the film succumbs to bricolage and ends up a construction of several elements that exist independent of each other. The Jungle Book consistently changes its tone and it's narrative direction without ever developing its story in any major direction, and this can prove really jarring. The main source of comic relief in the film should be the loveable bear Baloo, especially since he is portrayed by comedic legend Bill Murray. Unfortunately Baloo's dialogue is too simplistic without being all that clever or emphasing his individual charm. Relying too much on a self-aware sense of humour, Baloo makes simplistic jokes and then keeps reminding everyone that he's just made that joke. He milks a cheap sense of humour for far too long in The Jungle Book while relying on his cutesy charm to support him along the way, but it wears thin extremely quickly. There are essentially no other characters intended to be funny in the story and so when the one who should be bringing the laughter comes up short, it's clear that the film has a severe problem. In essence, The Jungle Book lacks enough innovative drama to explore its story in the best manner possible while also coming up short on humour.\nHowever, The Jungle Book makes for an unforgettable stylish experience. Since the story is essentially Life of Pi (2012) on land, the demand for visuals to be up to the same standard is clear. Jon Favreau's mastery of visual style is at some of its finest in The Jungle Book because he creates an entire universe on one big green screen. With tremendous detail for realism yet a passion for the cartoonish colour of a Disney film, The Jungle Book builds a magnificent universe that is both extremely convincing in its realism and a magnificent experience of fantasy at the same time. The imagery in the film is unforgettable, and Jon Favreau even experiments with surrealism during the scene where Mowgli is hypnotised by Kaa. This sequence has the sophistication of Salvador Dali's work on Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945) with its own stylish distinction. The entire spectacle is supported by a magnificent musical score which maintains elements of George Bruns' score for the original Disney animated film while also having the tense sophistication of its own right. Occasionally the abundance of visual effects leave moments which are obviously not shot on location, but the sporadic nature of these lesser stylish moments fail to stand up in comparison to the superior moments of true visual glory in the film. The Jungle Book is a brilliant experience of imagery and music which will prove powerful enough to distract many viewers from the story flaws.\nThe real endeavour of the entire experience is the way that the film characterises King Louie. While he was merely a friendly Orangutang once upon a time, Jon Favreau's version depicts him as the long-extinct Gigantopithecus. His stature makes him all the more intimidating, and given that he is supposed to be the king of the Jungle this seems so much more appropriate. King Louie is a really frightening presence without being too scary for anyone's good, and he provides a really intense segment to the story. King Louie has the greatest animation of any of the characters. All the animals in the film have amazing detail to their design and movements which is some of the most realistic \n Christopher Walken's voice performance in the role proves to capture the role perfectly, grasping the part to characterise him like the King of crime. However, the presence of King Louie's song \"I Wanna Be Like You\" doesn't make sense. When he is dictating his role in the jungle and his demands to Mowgli, he slowly progresses into the song through delivering the words in a spoken word manner. Had he just completely spoken the entire song like a spoken word piece then it would have worked very smoothly, especially considering the nature of Christopher Walken's line delivery. But it was just awkward when pushed into a narrative that is trying to be a lot more serious, especially within the context of this scene. This song played out much better in the ending credits because the musical nature of it didn't break away from the reality of the scene this time, rather just present to encourage a fun closing tune for audiences. Frankly, the entire film is far too serious for musical numbers to have any real presence in the film, particularly one coming from the Godfather of the Jungle who should be more serious than anyone else. Given that King Louie is actually terrifying with the best characterisation of the film, this disruption can prove very frustrating. But luckily enough, the positive aspects of King Louie's characterisation overshadow the lesser ones, and he stands out among the cast.\nNeel Sethi's lead performance is a decent one. It is clear that he is an inexperienced actor, and to make a feature film debut in a Hollywood blockbuster that constructs both its universe and characters out of computer generated image is an immeasurable challenge. Neel Sethi's dedication to the character proves strong in many parts because his parkour-trained physical acting really makes the universe come to life while his interactions with the CGI characters really make their existence seem legitimate. However, his actual charisma is limited. There isn't any major characterisation of Mowgli outside of using a generic hero archetype that seems like a combination between Tarzan and Piscine Molitor \"Pi\" Patel from Life of Pi. It's clear that Neel Sethi is inexperienced because he fails to add any distinctive charm to the part, but his genuine engagement with the universe is very tenacious. Neel Sethi has his hits and misses in The Jungle Book, but there isn't much reliance on the quality of his performance to carry the film so it functions well enough.\nBill Murray is certainly worth praising. On the surface he sounds like the perfect casting decision for the role of the iconic loveable bear Baloo, and he fulfills that prophecy. The humour isn't up to the caliber of a comedic legend of Bill Murray's sizeable credibility, but the man's natural charm and friendliness gives the character the warm and fuzzy feeling that fans have come to expect. He uses his natural likability to create his own version of the character while also harkening back to the days of Phil Harris' portrayal in the original Disney movie. Bill Murray is a perfect casting decision in The Jungle Book.\nIdris Elba and Ben Kingsley contribute sohisticated voice efforts, but one cannot help but feel that they would have been more suited to each other's roles. Scarlett Johansson also manages to capture the perfectly slick and seductive tone of voice for Kaa.\n\nThe Jungle Book maintains a talented voice cast and some top-notch production values, but the segmented and underveloped story combined with a tonal inconsistency and insufficient humour fails to leave a sizable impression.",

Instead of listing them all to you ill give you the top three. The Jungle Book  has extremely good visuals (animation). Another thing i like about the movie is all the different species were all in a \"peace treaty\" due to depleted water source. They even had the bear necessities song . Some downfalls to the movie are that none of the humans could speak and act like wild animals which was kinda disgraceful. Also the lion cub mowgli  is only halfway clothed.\nAll considered i would rate this movie ? so if you see it invite some friends and family to enjoy it too.",

And the songs, although classics no doubt, are just forced and corny here. As weird as it would be to see a Jungle Book remake without \"The Bare Necessities\" ....it might have been for the best. I think it's definitely worth a watch, but the overly simple plot left me wanting more.

When an evil and intimidating tiger named Shere Khan (Idris Elba) makes him to leave his home and flee the jungle, it forces him to stand up and fend for himself.  Now I have had mixed feeling about this live action remake trend with Disney.  I don't know if they are pushing these out just so they don't lose the rights to these properties, but they have been executed with varying degrees of quality.  So far, we've gotten Maleficent and the somewhat lacking Cinderella.  You better get used to it, because they have eight live action fairy tale movies slated to come out in the next three years.  If they are all as good as The Jungle Book, we've got nothing to worry about, because they've put together a piece with craft and care for days with this film.  What really makes this so special is just how outstanding the special effects look.  They're ridiculously well done, and it is so flawless that I'm pretty confident that this is the best talking animals have looked in any live action movie of all time, and I say that without hyperbole.  It makes perfect sense that this is directed by Jon Favreau, as he has had a lot of experience directing special effect extravaganzas in the Marvel Universe, and he really nails it here.  These animals have a lot of life, heart, and they really help to move the story forward with a lot of emotion.  You hate Shere Khan because he is so intimidating and mean (typical cat), and you love Baloo because he is so light and lovable, and he is voiced perfectly by Bill Murray, so much so he ends up being the standout part of the movie.  All of the voice actors are great for their parts... with one exception, for me at least.  I think Christopher Walken is miscast as King Louie.  I dug what they did with the character, making this larger than life orangutan that almost comes off as a mobster, but I don't like his voice for the part, and much like he already proved with Peter Pan Live, singing isn't in his repertoire.  This is a fast moving adventure for the whole family, although it does get scary and intense in parts.  I only saw the animated version a few times, but I ran the live action 1994 movie into the ground growing up (still need to go back and see if it holds up).  There are constantly talking animals which make the movie, although it makes it a bit odd whenever there is an animal that can't talk (they address it briefly, but don't really give you a concrete reason behind it all).  Neel Sethi is good as Mowgli, and I am sure he has a bright future ahead of him.  The Jungle Book completes its job quite well, and its job is to fill you with a sense of wonder.",

Directed by Jon Favreau, the entire film was shot indoors on sound-stages with blue screens, motion capture performances, and state-of-the-art technology that truly immerses the viewer into a completely fake jungle; they never once shot on-location! The story follows closer to the original Rudyard Kipling novel than a strict adaptation of the animated classic, most notably with the lack of a musical approach and thus leans heavily on the dramatic story which is quite powerful here. The film stars only one human character, Mowgli, played by newcomer Neel Sethi, who rose to the occasion and carried this movie insanely well, having to interact with a completely faux reality must've been tough. Luckily, he did have help from an amazing voice cast: Bill Murray, Idris Elba, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walken, Lupita Nyong'o, and Scarlett Johansson all give impressive performances, Bill Murray perfectly cast as the laid-back Baloo, and Idris Elba commanding the screen as the villainous tiger, Shere Khan! The story plays out basically the same as the original, with a few nice additions such as the animals' fear of the red flower (fire) and Mowgli's family being directly responsible for Shere Khan's rage, but don't expect too many surprises here. The Jungle Book was a pleasant surprise featuring real heart, drama, and humour, and though it's completely unnecessary considering the original is still excellent, it's a perfectly solid substitute to a film that's nearly 50 years old!",

Not only is new actor Neel Sethi excellent in his CGI environment, but so too are seasoned actors like Bill Murray as Baloo the bear, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera, and, most commendably, Idris Elba as Shere Khan, now one of the scariest villains I have ever seen in a children's movie. Having never seen The Life of Pi, I am in awe at how far CGI has come, and how director Jon Favreau uses this for a more primitive portrayal of the characters at hand. There may be law in the jungle, but when push comes to shove, we see the characters fight and move like the animals that they are. This is even more effective when they stop speaking English altogether, and instead call out through their native tongue. They even keep the Sherman Brothers songs, which, while standing out as the weakest components of the movie, will certainly delight both young kids and those who have fond memories of the 1967 Disney adaptation. So great, from start to finish. I look forward to seeing what Favreau does with The Lion King.",

Although I will say right now that I have not seen the Disney movie since I was a kid and I have never read any of the Kipling stories sooo...I know almost zippo here. Yet...I believe most of this is generally coming from the Disney version, more so than the original stories, seemed that way.\n\nThe plot is very simple with this tale, simple and dumb. A baby Mowgli is left for dead in the Indian jungle after his father is killed by the ferocious tiger Shere Khan. Luckily Mowgli is found by a black panther named Bagheera and taken to a pack of Indian wolves to be looked after. The wolf Raksha raises Mowgli as one of her own in the depths of the jungle, Mowgli becomes a man cub. Everything is fine and dandy until one day Shere Khan decides he wants to eat Mowgli, so the wolves (and other animal friends) decide it would be best to send Mowgli back to his own people. So yeah you gotta take all this with a huge pinch of cosmic salt naturally. Firstly, the animals all have names because of course they do, secondly, they obviously talk...but some don't?? don't question it. Thirdly, the plot makes no fecking sense at all, why didn't Bagheera take Mowgli straight back to the human camp (or any humans) when he first found him? What possible good could come from giving him to a pack of wolves to be raised?? Clearly he would never fit in because he's a bloody human being, hello? Lastly, why on earth does it take many years before Shere Khan decides he wants to kill Mowgli? Did he not notice the human child being raised by the wolves? I mean, they all live in the same vicinity do they not. Yes OK its a children's fantasy, but still, no sense whatsoever (and that goes for the Disney version also).\n\nAnyway this being a modern movie the main hook will of course be the visual effects, the visual CGI effects and how mesmerising they can be, but are they? Well they are and they aren't really, on one hand the backdrops and locations are gorgeous to look at, even of they are all fake. But if there's one thing CGI can do well its landscapes in the background and oh my this doesn't disappoint. What's even more impressive is some (or all) of these backdrops and landscapes are actually based on real locations in India (so I've read), so even though its CGI magic, its based on real mother Earth. That being said it still can't escape the dreaded greenscreen monster which always rears its ugly head against the live action Mowgli. I'm afraid I have the same complaints with the CGI creatures too. On one hand some of the animals look truly amazing, incredibly authentic...such as the elephants, Bagheera, the wolves, Shere Khan and various smaller mammals. On the other hand some animals look obviously CGI and in some cases hokey...such as Baloo the bear, the monkeys, King Louie, Kaa the snake etc...Another issue I had was the implementation of the actors features into some of the animal characters. This mainly stands out with both Baloo/Bill Murray and King Louis/Christopher Walken. Why the flip would you want either animal to have similar facial features to the voice actor?? It makes Baloo look ridiculous and King Louie look positively scary with his glaring sky blue eyes. Speaking of King Louis, my God! since when is King Kong in this story?! Jesus Christ they really fudged up on that. Changing Louis from an Orangutan to a Gigantopithecus might be more accurate for the creatures native habitat but it will scare the shit outta the kids! Plus the whole size thing is ludicrous.\n\nSegue of sorts onto the voice work here, nope! just no!! Now don't get me wrong, most of the animal voices were fine here, mainly because I wasn't really sure who was providing the voices, and that's exactly what you want, what you need!! The casting of Bill Murray, Edris Elba and Christopher Walken was terrible! absolutely terrible! Bill Murray is literally just doing his usual Bill Murray-ish, deadpan, sarcastic ramblings which might work most of the time, but lets be clear, doesn't work all of the time and in no way fit this character. Walken was clearly given the role to give King Louie a comical, light-hearted, crime kingpin-esque twist on the character which again isn't really right (plus he's too scary for the kids). And lastly Elba voices Shere Khan...so a Bengal tiger with a cockney accent, riiight. I'm sorry but these recognisable voices just didn't fit the bill for me and threw me right out of the picture every time. Naturally the two Disney songs forced in didn't help in any way either, holy schnitzel Walken's singing was atrocious. Without the background chorus from the other monkeys (in the Disney classic) the song just sounds bad, plain bad, all the oo oo oo's and so forth really sound stupid without backup vocals. But needless to say there was really no need for the songs at all, the movie is going for a more sensible approach based on the original stories, the songs were a Disney thing, the two don't really blend here. This ultimately just felt like a cheap nostalgia hook.\n\nI also found myself questioning many many stupid points and some plot holes along the way. It is mentioned that elephants are treated almost like Gods of the jungle, that they created the jungle by creating rivers with their tusks etc...wut?? How are they so God-like exactly? oh and why do elephants apparently not speak? Come to think of it birds don't speak either. Near the start Mowgli is trying to escape from Khan, he finds himself jumping into a muddy trench which suddenly gets clobbered by a stampede of buffalo...yet he survives this by managing to grab onto a passing buffalo horn and riding to safety. Remember, this Mowgli is live action, not a cartoon. Towards the finale Shere Khan is able to beat all the wolves and Bagheera at the same time which in itself is pretty impressive, yet none of the other animals help, not even the rhinos who could surely beat Khan. As Mowgli races back from the human camp with a lit torch he accidentally manages to start a [b]HUGE[/b] jungle fire that spreads real fast, from a single ember? At the same time as this Mowgli also manages to run all the way back to the area he grew up in (with the wolves), from the human camp which I thought was a long distance away?? I mean, the whole movies runtime is spent following Mowgli progress further and further away from his home (with the wolves), because he's supposed to be going back to the humans (supposedly some distance from where the animals dwell deep in the jungle). But then right at the end he's able to run all the way back in an instant. Oh and I might mention that both Baloo and Bagheera see where Mowgli is headed at this point in time, but are unable to catch him...and they're animals. One final point which kinda sums up the cheapness of the plot here, Baloo is seemingly bitten badly by Khan in the final fight. I say seemingly because nothing happens with it, it happens, we see it, and there are no consequences. Next scene he's all good and we're moving on. Surprising actually as I was expecting a really gooey emotional moment with that.\n\nSo in the end what does this offer over the Disney classic? Well not much frankly, visuals aside not very much at all and that's because this movie is essentially all about the visuals. They have used all sorts of new special effects jiggery-pokery for creating realistic animal animations (courtesy of Weta) which admittedly do look slick and sexy for the most part, and as said backgrounds and landscapes do also look fantastic. There are times when this does look more like an educational documentary, and I have since learned more about the jungles of India, but overall I simply can't help but think that's all this is. A glossy effects flick showcasing how good glossy effects can look with the right amount of dosh thrown at them. There was really no need to make a live action version of this tale, for me personally, it just doesn't look right, probably never will, and will always look better animated. In all honesty I can see myself saying the same thing about other future obligatory live action remakes ('The Lion King'). But yet again I find myself asking how this movie did so well, have movie standards really dropped so low? do people just accept anything average now? Sure this is a fair ride but its nothing special, in no way. A bland, simple remake with shiny effects, generally bog standard A-list voice work, glaring plot holes and touch and go with whether or not its too scary for the kids, hmmm.",

It proves that it's impossible to duplicate Walt Disney's vision and amazing storytelling methods, which has touched people around the world of all ages. The mixture of true life and CGI worked extremely well in this film but it's not upbeat like the original, which is also known for it's brilliant music, and I found it hard to connect to the various characters. Neel Sethi (Mowgli), played his role extremely well, and I have to give him recognition because it must have been hard to interact with characters that aren't really there but the songs popped up in weird places and it lacked the fun aspect, that we all loved from the original. Its still a joy to watch, and I'm sure that the kids will love it but I've got a feeling that people will still be going back to the original film. I have to commend the director, for taking on such a massive task but I personally think that he should have worked more on the storyline than the visual experience. On the plus side, the actors who were chosen for the voices, we're spot on and Bill Murray (Baloo), added some, much needed, humour to the movie. I just think that it's time for some new storylines, and that people should stop trying to bring back the magic from the old time classics. Watchable!\r\n\r\nRound-Up: \r\nWith such a big task, I'm not surprised that this movie cost so much to make, and judging by the box office takings, Walt Disney's original concepts, are still pulling in audiences around the world. Jon Favreau, 49, took on the huge task of portraying Mowgli's amazing journey in the wild, and with another Jungle Book movie in the pipeline, he certainly impressed the big wigs in Hollywood. With movies like Elf, Zathura, Iron Man 1 & 2, the awful Cowboys & Aliens and Chef under his belt, along with a successful acting career, his enthusiasm for film is what has pushed him to new heights, especially with the success of the Iron Man movies. He certainly achieved a new type of movie making with this movie but the original was much better, in my eyes.\r\n\r\nBudget: $175million\r\nWorldwide Gross: $964million\r\n\r\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their family/adventure/dramas, starring Neel Sethi, and with the voices by, Bill Murray, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Christopher Walken, Scarlett Johansson, Lupita Nyong'o, Giancarlo Esposito, Garry Shandling and Jon Favreau. 6/10",

But, if it's one thing that this updated live CGI action film did justice to this cherished classic was the visuals gave this story a whole new look and life to it. The Jungle Book not only impresses but it surpasses all its CGI brethren of films. From the look of the jungle to the facial animations of the animals, it's mesmerizing to say the least. The breathtaking visuals add a visceral look to it's all non-threatening cartoon animation counterparts with their loud vicious roars, low growls, and threatening animalistic sounds. The sound is truly spectacular immersing you in the depths of the jungle making you feel every step in the mud hearing rain create percussion sounds as it lands on the bed rock. What brings these animals to life is their amazing voice actors giving A+ performances. This film may not bring much to the forefront of story telling but it's visuals will you talking and pleasantly satisfied for months to come until the next Disney live action film arrives. I'm looking at you Beauty and the Beast. (8/10)",

            "content": "If you are looking for one of those films that demonstrates new techniques in visual imagery, than Disney's \"Jungle Book\" remake is for you. It is on that same list that sets \"Avatar\" and \"Gravity\" from the dozens of other films using (or mis-using) CGI. And visually, \"Jungle Book\" impresses. However, if you're looking for any kind of magic regarding story and script surprises, you will be less successful. Watching this gave me strong vibes of Disney's \"Dinosaur\" back in 2000, which boasted (at the time) revolutionary animation, but was sorely lacking on all other fronts. \n\nLet's start off by analyzing the favorable:  the animation will flabbergast you. The creatures are so lifelike, I was under the impression that artists had superimposed CG lips and eyes over real animal footage. By comparison, they make the animals in \"Narnia\" look like utter garbage. But the truly awe-inspiring feat pulled off by \"Jungle Book\" was not in the wolves, bears, and large wild cats; no, the real stunner was the fully-photorealistic and completely believable environments these animals lived in. Trees, foliage undergrowth, rocks, streams, hilltops, and temples, every background looked like something pulled out of a Discovery Channel show. All of it looked believable.\n \nWith that said, I do wonder why Disney decided to go to obscene lengths to animate all backgrounds, as the finished film did not utilize the technology to its fullest. For the most part, \"Jungle Book\" played like a live action film with not as many carefully-planned camera swoops and pans as I would have expected. The Kaa sequence, as an example, was a waste of potential; while the Walt Disney classic had the snake demonstrate its awesome length by coiling, turning, grabbing Mowgli and playing with its food, this Kaa was so static and unmoving it might as well have been accomplished through matte painting. The entire thing may have felt \"grounded\" in part because of the way filmmakers chose to bring Mowgli to life... \n\n... And this leads me into the first major complaint I had with this film. Mowgli. I will give young Neel Sethi a break because he's a kid and I won't dwell on the fact that he was no Haley Joel Osment, but I will criticize filmmakers for not truly pushing the boundaries in animation by attempting to pull off a fully-lifelike CG character. In short: they cut corners. They didn't even try to go the extra mile in the one area of CG that needs the most innovation. Boo to Jon Favreau and team for being so paranoid of the \"uncanny valley\" they didn't even attempt to innovate. If they had just tried, I would have given them a full star more in my rating. I will give them credit for seamlessly blending in Neel Sethi into every background, but I do think using a live actor greatly limited the scope and vision of the overall film. \n\nNow, for the deluge of criticism...\nThe story was a complete mess. The script was an even greater mess. I have criticized Walt Disney's 1967 animated film for its lack of narrative direction, as the story seemed to be a series of unrelated antics tying one scene to the next, story obstacles to prevent Mowgli from reaching the man village. Here, the events are even more random and convoluted. Kaa appears and then she exits the story forever. King Louie appears and then he exits the story forever. The elephant herd appears and then leaves the story forever (without saying a word, too!) At least the animated classic integrated these characters and had them return. For example, the animated film had several scenes with Kaa, and a very memorable and tense encounter between Shere Khan and Kaa. Not here. In the animated film, there were important interactions between Bagheera and the elephant pack. Not here. I would have forgiven these antics if they could have at least ended the story. In this version, nothing gets resolved, as far as Mowgli learning to be a man. (I assume he will be enslaved to con-bear Baloo in honey-capers for the rest of his life? What a waste of human potential.) Mowgli does not even reach man village, which defies the entire point of the plot! Wasn't the symbolic image of Mowgli wielding and controlling the \"red flower\" supposed to denote that he alone possessed powers and ingenuity no animal could possess? The whole film ended flatter than a popped tire. I left feeling as unsatisfied as watching part one of a two-part cliffhanger (ahem, \"Deathly Hallows: Part I.\") \n\nThere were so many things that I disliked about the story. The Kaa scene especially was   annoying. First off, I was puzzled why Disney did a gender swap; I hope it was not because Disney realized there was only one female character in the film, and (like always) they need to have at least one evil female in movies nowadays. But even worse than gender-swapping was how Kaa hypnotized Mowgli; apparently someone in the story department thought it would be intelligent to shoe-horn a flashback sequence here-and-now, completely with mysterious Scarlett Johansson narration to remind us of Galadrial in \"Lord of the Rings.\" Honestly, did we need to see Mowgli's past? And even if we did, couldn't somebody pick a better moment for the flashback? Another horrible aspect was the way Shere Khan was handled. I got the impression that instead of being frightened by fire, he was drawn to it, because he willingly and stupidly climbed a dead tree in the middle of a forest fire without having the foresight that a dead tree might snap. For that matter, how did Mowgli get off that same tree during the same forest fire? How was Mowgli able to run with the torch of fire all the way from the man village to the wolf den, unless the forest was only 50 feet long? And top top it off, I wish everyone would quit referring to fire as \"red flower.\" I'm pretty sure that in Kipling's original, \"red flower\" referred to the physical attributes of a campfire, not a raging forest fire. If I was Shere Kahn witnessing half the forest burn down, I would not exclaim: \"Look at that red flower!\" Instead, my reaction would be more primal: \"Ahhh!!! Red hot terror!!!!!!!!!!!\" A  red flower? No. Just no. \n\nWhen it all boils down, the only sequence I truly enjoyed was King Louie. It was funny, it was scary, it had an awesome remix of the classic \"I Wanna Be Like You.\" Here, filmmakers used CG to its fullest potential, in this case turning King Louie into a 15-foot-tall ape of incredible strength,(the song cleverly incorporates new lyrics saying that he is, in fact, a gigantopithicus. Bonus points for that.) I also sense a dark humor in screenwriters when the monkey temple crushed King Louie, rendering the last remaining gigantopithicus extinct. A nice touch. The entire sequence was loaded with a level of fun and innovation the entire movie should have had, but did not. What should have been laughs throughout was constipated dialogue.\n\nIn the end, while I dig the animation, this new \"Jungle Book\" was too butt-kissy to the Walt Disney classic to stand on its own two feet. And yet, it was not dark and realistic enough to be a faithful adaption of the Rudyard Kipling original. It resides in no man's land. Honestly, Rotten Tomatoes, 95% fresh?",

Well I just watched The Jungle Book, and I found all three of those compliments to be patently untrue. That might sound like three issues, but in reality they all boil down to the same one thing, suspension of disbelief. Or more accurately, the lack of it. From the word go, there wasn't s moment that I found myself being continuously drawn out of the story because of one of those reasons (usually the look of the creatures). I was not once able to fully engage, and though I recognise that from a plot point of view, this version was even better than the 1967 one, I still found myself constantly aggravated by the harsh meshing of Mowgli against the world around him.",

The Disney done it again bring all the classics to a new life, but it is a great team work, especially the post-production was terrific.\n\nIt is one of those stories never gets boring for repeat reading/listening/viewing. Of course, there were plenty of changes to the original source, but I would say it was upgraded so well. Jon Favreau did an awesome job as the director, definitely it is his one of the best films and will be remembered for very long. All the above he got the best screenplay with supportive production and crew.\n\nNeel Sethi was obviously a perfect choice for the man-cub, he had given his best and no one could doubt it was his first film. The entire film was shot in the studio settings and the whole time he had to act alone, because the remaining characters in the film are CGI. So in that viewpoint he actually did a breathtaking job being a very young.\n\nThe CGI characters were really excellent, but the non-fur animals like elephant looked a bit fake. I mean anatomically and character performances were perfect, only visually the 3D models were out of the blend in the screen with others. These are very small things to notice, but for the todays technology, it was not bad, especially thinking the film is primarily targeted children.\n\nThe story was simple, like half of the film was an introduction and almost all the important characters from the book were launched at a high profile. It was actually the story with a backdrop of red flower. So the narration moves different part of the jungle, lot like the levels in a game. Various adventures take place and well composed stunt sequences.\n\nI mentioned stunts right, but there were no violences, I mean nothing seriously to concern about as expected for a Disney film. Yet because of those actions, the film is very much suitable for adult viewing. So apart from the children and families, it can be watched by anyone. One of the top Disney films to do best at the box office worldwide by grabbing almost $1b.\n\nSo aggressive, furious Shere Khan ever to portray. I think the little children may get scared for his unpleasant face look and the strong roar. By the way all the songs were amazing and the end credit was very interesting. Finally, I saw it after a long wait and anticipation, most importantly, I'm very happy how beautifully it was made.\n\nThe film was not shot in India, but the locations were so resembling and gives the perfect Indian feel. Climbing a cliff by Baloo and fighting the monkeys, like that there were numerous jokes. Surely one of the grandly made children's film at the recent time. I've heard the sequel is already on the progress, so bring it on, at least a trilogy before Neel turn to a big boy.\n\n8/10",

            "content": "My reaction towards The Jungle Book reminds me very much of Zootopia, another Disney movie.   The latter film has a near perfect percentage rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  It has only four negative reviews out of 220 tallied on the site.  People praised it as one of Disney's best animated movies ever.  And, when I saw it, honestly, I was a little underwhelmed.  Don't misunderstand me, Zootopia is a hell of a movie.  But it's nowhere near close to Disney's best when it comes to animated movies.  Not even close.  Not saying that this one had the same reception, it's got 95% reviews on RT, but a lot of people were indeed raving about the movie.  And, again, much like Zootopia, I was left a little befuddled by that.  This is nothing more than a good movie with fantastic CGi work.  But, to me, it's nothing more than just a good movie.  I gotta give them props, though, because the movie is darker than one might expect a Disney movie to be, but there was just something missing.  There's many issues I have with the film.  But, to me, the most important one of all is the fact that Neel Sethi, the kid who plays Mowgli, isn't a very good actor.  That's just the truth of the matter.  It wouldn't have been much of a problem if Neel had been cast as a secondary character, but Mowgli is the central character of the story and one of the very few humans in the actual film.  So the fact that they chose him is mind-boggling when I'm sure a ton of other kids auditioned.  If he was the best of them all, then I really don't wanna see the worst of the bunch.  There's literally nothing behind his eyes.  He's just a kid, reciting lines.  He doesn't embody the character whatsoever, he doesn't add life or personality to the character.  There's some scenes where he's fine, but there's some scenes where he's just terrible.  For example, the climactic scene of the film when the wolf pack, Baloo, Bagheera and Mowgli finally decided to fight back against Shere Khan and everyone else rushes Shere Khan.  Mowgli, before rushing at Shere Khan, does this battle yell to, somehow, try to appear intimidating and it was just absolutely awful.  And it wasn't meant to be comedic or anything like that, this is the climax of the film while there's a giant wildfire going on in the background.  So talk about embarrassing.  This is supposed to be the moment when Mowgli stops trying to run away and face his fears head on and that yell was just awful.  I'm surprised they actually let it even make the final cut.  I would have just cut it out, no questions asked.  Neel's delivery on some lines is just so wooden and bad.  It's seriously surprising how this kid actually got the role.  And I realize I seem to be bagging on him too much, but he's the lead and the story is completely centered around him.  So he's the one that I'm gonna focus on the most out of anybody, as he's the only human in the film.  So, yea, this kid was awful.  Secondly, the narrative of the film absolutely did not engage me in any way whatsoever.  Like none, you're just sort of thrown in this universe with minimal introduction and you're somehow supposed to be invested in it?  Eh, doesn't work like that.  There's no real attempt at world building outside of the introduction and some little bits and pieces.  And then to top that off, you have the 'emotional' connection between Mowgli, Baloo and Bagheera.  And I put that in quotations because there was no actual connection between them, just the film telling you that they were close.  Yet again, there's no actual development between these three characters, they don't really build those relationships well at all.  The movie just tells you that these three are super close and that Baloo and Bagheera are willing to sacrifice their lives to help this kid, but you just never see it.  Again, the movie just tells you and expects you to believe them.  And, apparently, a lot of people bought it.  I think this all comes back to the casting of Neel as Mowgli.  It really does.  Every other character in the film is CG animated, so it all comes down on Mowgli to sell that connection he felt to the wolf pack that he'd want to go back to face Shere Khan and to Baloo and Bagheera.  I seem to really be ragging on this movie, huh?  There's two musical numbers in the film and both of them are horrifyingly out of place.  Bare Necessities is in there, I'm assuming, at the behest of Disney.  Maybe I'm wrong, but it just feels like one of their moves.  The other musical number, featuring King Louie, is far more elaborate and even more out of place than the Bare Necessities one.  Like what was the actual point of it all.  Why were there two musical numbers randomly placed in the movie?  Particularly when, as I mentioned, the tone of the film is far more serious and darker than the original film.  I can kinda see justifying having Bare Necessities in there, but the King Louie one is just unacceptable on all levels.  This one is far more nitpicky, but I still felt that it hurt the movie.  They even replay King Louie's song over the credits and it would've made more sense for it to have been placed there as opposed to in the actual movie, where its placement is unjustifiable.  I think that's about it as far as the negatives.  The positives are, as mentioned, the CGi is just outstanding.  Like, literally, it's some of the best I've ever seen, in terms of realism, even down to small movements, and just the amount of detail put into them.  It is something to behold to say the least.  The voice acting is top-notch, all around, everyone is great.  And they would have to be seeing how bad Neel Sethi was.  The movie is also, surprisingly, action-packed.  There's a lot of set-piece moments that are actually really cool and really well done.  So no complaints on that front.  You know, as a whole, in spite of the flaws taking up, like 70% of the review (maybe even more), I'd still say that this is, by and large, a pretty solid movie.  Is it better than the original Jungle Book?  Probably, I haven't seen the animated version in ages.  But this movie is still rampant with flaws that can't be overlooked.  This is a solid rental, at best.  It's just got too many negatives to be anything more than that.",

I truly don't know where to start, top to bottom, \"The Jungle Book\" delivers, the acting from Neel Sethi was really good, especially considering he was talking to nobody for the entire movie. The story is pretty much parallel to the classic original film, but this new version has it's own twists that make it seem fresh. The 2016 \"The Jungle Book\" is a lot more serious and dramatic than the 60's version, which was more cartoonish and more for young kids. I don't now if this remake is better than the original, just because the 1967 movie is a Disney classic, one of the most iconic Disney movies of al time, but it certainly does the original justice, and stands its ground against the classic. \"The Jungle Book\" is probably the closest I've come to giving a movie 5 stars, but is still an unbelievable movie.",

Infact they look and move better than I've seen, quite possibly ever, in terms of CGI. The story and dialogue is pretty standard stuff bar a few funny bits. Scarlett Johansson had a paltry role in the film, so much so they unfortunately let her 'sing' a bit in the credits. The other voices were bang on, Bill Murray, Idris Elba and Ben Kingsley were great as their respective animals. Neel Sethi as the jungle mancub, Mowgli, did an ok job but his voice was unfortunately slightly irksome when he said more than a few sentences. Naive doesn't have to be wine-y.

While the CGI quality is generally solid and it boasts couple entertaining scenes, this modern adaptation has a fair amount of elements which just don't fit. \n\nFirst you have the voice acting. Actors appeared to be largely picked on their current celebrity status instead of suitability, a common occurrence in today's animations. The supposedly terrifying tiger, Shere Khan, is hard to take seriously when he has the Londoner accent of Idris Elba. I'm surprised he did not threaten Mowgli by saying \"You want some, you want some do ya?\". Admittedly he grows into the role but the casting definitely could have been better. Christopher Walken as King Louis gives the impression that he wasn't going to tolerate any monkey business since he plays the orangutan like a mafia boss. This is fine and actually worked in conveying greater intimidation up until he breaks into the famous \"I wanna be like you\" song. It just did not compliment the atmosphere that had been created while Walken's old fragile voice struggled to hit some of the higher notes. This leads onto another point that this and the 'bear necessities' song were shoe-horned in. I thought the style of this movie lends itself to a music-free narrative, however they felt obliged to honour the popular soundtrack of the Disney original. Understandable but not a successful choice in my opinion. Lastly, we have Mowgli's interaction with the animals. The actor looked the part but, and I feel harsh criticising a child, he could have prospered from more direction. It became too obvious sometimes that the animals were not there and he was interacting with a green screen. I'm not saying it is easy but it made it difficult to become fully immersed from an audience point of view.\n\nMaybe a cruel evaluation of a movie which probably satisfies the intended role of good family entertainment. The story still holds up and the action scenes with Shere Khan and King Louis are impressive. In my book, modern adaptations or remakes will always suffer from comparisons to the original and on this occasion it is clear the 1967 animation continues to be King of the Jungle (Book).",

            "content": "The Jungle Book transports you into a beautiful world filled with incredible set-pieces. If director Jon Favreau's intent was to have each location create a shift in mood, he wildly succeeds. The rocky stomping grounds of the wolfpack creates an air of lightheartedness. Once Mowgli sets foot on the watering hole or trudges through the open plains of high-grass, you instantly get a feeling of uneasiness, like something bad is about to happen. Go further into the jungle depths and it will make your skin crawl as you await the dangers that are seemingly lurking around every corner. All of these set-pieces are not only distinct, but succeed independently of animal interaction. I was nervous for young Mowgli's safety inside the Monkey Temple long before King Louie showed up.\n\nThe characters make up the other half of the movie's successful equation. Each animal, originally done in their own right, dominate their respective scenes while advancing the story. Even the smallest parts, like the giant squirrel played by Sam Raimi, are completely unique and help flesh out the jungle world. My favorite character, Ikki the porcupine (played by Garry Shandling) had a minute role but made me smile the entire time he was on screen.\n\nMowgli the \"man-cub\" has been raised in the wild by a family of wolves. While the wild is all he has ever known, his parents know that eventually he is going to have to insert himself into human life. Bagheera the panther, Mowgli's mentor, decides now is as good a time as ever to take Mowgli to human society as the man-cub suddenly finds himself being hunted by Shere Kan the vicious tiger. While the film is plenty enjoyable, it definitely isn't without its faults.\n\nDisney's movies, Pixar in particular, are particularly good at stirring up emotion within the audience but there were moments in The Jungle Book that missed the mark for me. There is one particular pivotal moment in the film that occurs that should have been a very moving moment, but it happens...and nothing. I'm not sure if emotional conveyance is the proper terminology, but if it is, this film could have used more of it.\n\nI was also a bit thrown off by the motive of the antagonist Shere Khan. Shere Khan wants Mowgli gone from the jungle because he is a man-cub and men only bring danger and destruction to the life around them. I get that part. What I didn't understand, however (spoiler alert?), is why Shere Khan continued to be so persistent after Mowgli tried to leave the wild. Why not, I don't know, just let it go? Most animals, when threatened, move on once the threat has seemingly been eliminated. While I did appreciate Khan's bad-assness, I wasn't quite sold on his necessity of pursuit.\n\nFinally, I want to take a moment to bring up Neel Sethi's performance as Mowgli. Though nothing stellar by any means, I thought it was a decent performance. I actually liken his performance to that of Jake Lloyd when he played young Anakin in Star Wars: Episode I--The Phantom Menace. I find it a bit funny that, while Sethi's performance was lauded, critics came down extremely hard on Lloyd's acting. At the end of the day, they're kids and they shouldn't be expected to have the same chops as Sean Connery or Liam Neeson. Lloyd wasn't the problem in The Phantom Menace just as Sethi's ok performance in The Jungle Book doesn't make the movie any less enjoyable. \n\nThe Jungle Book is a good family movie that's just as much beautiful as it is fun. I give it an 80.",

            "content": "It's hard to believe that it was 49 years ago when Disney released an animated interpretation of Rudyard Kipling's collection of stories known as The Jungle Book. I was a young tyke at the time and I loved the film so much that my parents must have regretted buying me the soundtrack album afterwards. I'm sure they grew very tired of hearing \"The Bare Necessities\" and the other memorable songs on the LP being played over and over again. (How was I supposed to know, or care, about the whole backroom drama surrounding \"I Wan'na Be Like You\"?*)\n\nAs I was watching the film again the other night, I was struck by how simple it was. The story plays out like eight or so (I wasn't counting) Flintstones-like episodes about the panther, Bagheera (voiced by Sebastian Cabot), and his attempts to get young Mowgli to leave the jungle and return to the man-village. The film's mood was very light and references to pop culture at the time were woven throughout the storyline. Both Baloo and King Louie were obvious lovers of Dixieland/New Orleans jazz, which is not surprising given who voiced these characters (Phil Harris and Louis Prima, respectively). As the sun set on the jungle and Mowgli went off with his new love, we were assured that everyone would live happily ever after. Although the 1967 version of THE JUNGLE BOOK doesn't rank as one of Disney's best efforts, it does hold up to time although perhaps more so for very young viewers. Today's nine-year-olds might find the animation laughingly primitive or the story too simplistic.\n\nThe 2016 version of THE JUNGLE BOOK is a whole different affair. Although director Jon Favreau (CHEF) used the 1967 film as his inspiration, he created a Disney film for today's audiences. Mowgli and the gang are all back, though this man-cub is played by real-life, 12-year-old actor Neel Sethi starring in his feature-film debut. Both the animals and the jungle were created on computer screens in downtown Los Angeles, we're told in the closing credits, and they are so lifelike it's often hard to believe that they're not the real thing. This interpretation of Kipling's short stories is slightly different too. There are no Beatle-esque vultures here, and the elephants play a less prominent role. Shere Khan (voiced by Idris Elba) has a larger role and is much more menacing than his 1967 counterpart. As a result, the film has a darker tone than its predecessor and may not be ideal viewing for very young children. Favreau's TJB is also more violent - one animal dies and the jungle catches fire due to carelessness (no doubt an environmental message coming from drought-stricken California where forest fires are now becoming a regular occurrence). But, as an homage to the 1967 film, Favreau included three of its classic songs, two of which are sung during the film and the other during the closing credits. Unfortunately, while this was a noble - even romantic - gesture, it doesn't work and the two songs seem jarringly out of place. Favreau, or perhaps even Disney's execs, may have thought the story was getting too dark and they wanted to lighten up the mood with some bouncy tunes but they were completely unnecessary. Today's audiences are sadly used to darkness and violence.\n\nSurprisingly, or perhaps Favreau was keeping close to the 1967 screenplay, King Louie appears in this film too. (The simian was never a character in Kipling's original works.) However, rather than being an orangutan again, a species that is not native to India, Favreau's King Louie (voiced by Christopher Walken) is a Gigantopithecus, an extinct species of great ape. Favreau and Walken also draw upon contemporary pop culture by having Louie sound like Marlon Brando's Col. Kurtz from the film, APOCALYPSE NOW! I doubt young viewers would see the connection but anyone who is old enough to remember the original film will get it.\n\nSethi's performance is nothing short of golden, and not just because he's the only human in the film. He had to learn parkour so that it would appear that he could bound over rocks and swing from vines with the greatest of ease. Ben Kingsley (the voice of Bagheera) lends the perfect amount of gravitas to the role, and Bill Murray (the voice of Baloo) is ideal as the carefree bear. In a break from the 1967 film which had an all-male but one cast, Favreau cast Scarlett Johansson as the voice of the s-s-s-s-seductive python, Ka. She, too, makes the most of her all-too-brief encounter with Mowgli. Christopher Walken is the weak link among the voice actors in the film. Once we see King Louie in all his hirsute glory, Walken's characterisation of him changes from army man-gone-native to New Jersey mobster. Perhaps if he could carry a tune, his rendition of \"I Wan'na Be Like You\" wouldn't have been so annoying.\n\nEven with its missteps though, the 2016 THE JUNGLE BOOK is still a winner and will be remembered as a Disney classic. Go see it on the big screen and be sure to sit through all the credits. (Keep your ears out for the late Garry Shandling who provided the voice for Ikki the porcupine.)\n\n* King Louie was a character created for the 1967 film, and was written with jazz legend Louis Armstrong in mind to be the character's voice. Walt Disney, however, was worried that King Louie would be seen as a racist depiction of black people, a concern made even more apparent when Armstrong would have to sing the line, \"An ape like me can learn to be human too\". Armstrong was ditched and jazz musician Louis Prima was brought on board to voice the character.",

The story was very well written, and the film was brilliantly made and directed.  The voice acting was superbly casted, and I thought this movie was better than the original Animated film from 1967.  But Parents take heed; this is not for little one's.  I heard too many children under 6 crying (50+ screaming unhappy children who were not babies) in several \"intense/dark\" spots throughout the film.  (this movie's PG means 6+).  Outside of this, I think it will be a surefire family classic for decades to come.  The best part is that they left 2 of the Sherman Brothers' classic songs which lightened up the film and kept it from being too dark to enjoy.  4.3/5 stars.   Theater-worthy and very enjoyable.",

            "content": "The 1967 animated film to me is still one of Disney's best of the \"classic era\". This is not just nostalgia talking, quite a few childhood favourites have not held up, but 'The Jungle Book' is an example of one that has.\n\nExpectations were mixed for seeing this film. The trailer looked great, the voice cast is filled with enormous talent and the featurette was fascinating. It was just that, relating it to the other Disney live action adaptations, whether it was going to be one example of a re-boot that looked stunning, was well-written and performed, respected its original source material(s) and added its fresh spin, like 'Cinderella, or a well-made film with enough other decent elements to make it watchable but also one lacking in soul and charm, like 'Alice in Wonderland'.\n\nFortunately, 'The Jungle Book' is an even stronger example of the former, and is one of Jon Favreau's best films along with 'Iron Man'. Fans of the animation will love recognising the familiar characters and scenes and it was also really nice to see more of Rudyard Kipling's writing and story telling here, the ending being closer to that of the animated film. 'The Jungle Book' is wonderful on its own merits too, just like the Disney animated film was, which was a poor adaptation of the book but worked so well as a film on its own that it didn't matter.\n\nCriticisms for the film are very few. The first criticism is that Kaa's scene and screen-time is far too short, a great character like Kaa deserves far more than a mere five minutes or so. And it is a shame because it is a very suspenseful and hypnotic scene with some of the film's most striking visuals, and the deceptively maternal story teller approach was beautifully written and delivered. Regrettably, the other criticism was \"I Wanna Be Like You\". While one of the highlights of the animated film, and one of Disney's most iconic moments, because the scene is darker and King Louie more intimidating (in size and manner), also because it comes out of nowhere, the light-hearted fun of the song that worked so brilliantly before just doesn't fit here (if Christopher Walken really did desperately want to sing the song, it didn't show in his singing because he sounded uninterested and hesitant).\n\nOn the other hand, the film looks amazing. The rich, expansive cinematography is some of the best of the year so far and the scenery and settings are so vividly detailed and colourful, that reading that it was shot entirely in a warehouse was a shock. The rendering of the animals are staggeringly realistic, especially Shere Khan, Bagheera and the monkeys. Favreau directs with a keen eye for detail and spectacle, yet doesn't forget the drama, cast or the storytelling once. John Debney's music score is full of energy, atmosphere, warm orchestration and vibrant emotion, its referencing of familiar themes feeling nostalgic and affectionate rather than cheap. As for the songs in the film, although \"I Wanna Be Like You\" was a disappointment \"Bear Necessities\" fitted right in and was as good-natured and easy-going as one can hope and \"Trust in Me\" is worth listening to if you stay for the closing credits, Scarlett Johansson with her low-register, smoky yet sensual tone does a surprisingly good job with the song.\n\n'The Jungle Book's' script is very funny (Baloo getting the funniest lines, and some of them were hilarious) without being childish or simplistic while also easy to understand and thought-provoking, there is a good amount of depth too without being too dark or sugary sweet. The story moves quickly and is constantly enthralling, one thing it does better than the animated version is expanding on motivations and making characters more interesting (as great a villain as Shere Khan is in the animated film, his motivation to me seemed clearer here). The climax is dramatically satisfying and darkly tense.\n\nA great job is done with the characters also. They're not complex, but they are likable and interesting, are very true in personality to their animated counterparts and all serve a point in the storytelling, some like Shere Khan and the wolves expanded upon. It was easy to identify with Mowgli, Baloo is a breath of fresh air and to me a great villain is one that one can totally see why the villain is hated or feared but one can also understand their point of view, which is the case with Shere Khan (this is true of the animated film too, but as Shere Khan has more of a back story here it came through stronger to me). The cast were a talented one to begin with and their talents absolutely shine through. Newcomer Neel Sethi does very credibly as Mowgli, it is incredibly hard to react against nothing and apart from a few naturally stiff moments to begin with he handles all the different emotional elements very well. The superbly chosen vocal cast are even better.\n\nBill Murray was born for Baloo (sounding far more engaged than as Garfield), his relaxed but witty voice-work matching the character's easy-going, good-natured personality. Idris Elba effectively puts dread into one's heart as Shere Khan, he's silky, regal, charismatic and genuinely menacing, though George Sanders brought over the suavity and oiliness more. Ben Kingsley is a stern yet sympathetic Bagheera, and Christopher Walken, in a characterisation that is like a mix of mobster boss, Colonel Kurtz and Walken's own mannerisms, makes King Louie intimidating but also entertaining. Scarlett Johansson's voice work for Kaa is eerily sensual, Giancarlo Esposito is a dignified Akeela and Lupita Nyong'o's Raksha is movingly compassionate.\n\nIn conclusion, a truly great film. Works very well as a live-action re-boot and works even more as a film in general. An epic visually stunning adventure, told with fun, heart and depth. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

It was hard to differentiate between the real-on-set objects and the computer generated ones -- that's how CGI is supposed to be used. It's a new and modern take on this classic story, with very similar moments from its source material. Still; very different due to its realism. It got a great development of its story -- with great pacing, action, & many classic Disney-traits like morality, what's life, who's worth more -- and how it is to be different. It even got some interesting perspectives on humanity & the constant hunt for power. It's a truly touching story -- even emotional, with all the happiness circulating around the well visualized characters. I must say -- I did not expect a so captivating film. But wow -- funny and well-fitted character-traits to these beloved individuals is a wonder! They interact in a very natural way with the environment and other characters. Our main \"Mowgli\", got this personal dilemma -- reflecting where to go in his life -- should I be myself, or fit in society. The film perfectly illustrates how people can affect your opinion -- is Disney trying to be the parent of movies? To summarize; 'The Jungle Book' is a stunning film for youths as adults -- it's so much more than a CGI adventure. Yes; it might not take a very different path from the original film and its story, and it's sometimes a bit too predictable. Another flaw is that I wanted even more inside to the main character -- not only about everything around him, but more about his inside and personality. Everybody out there might not consider it as a \"very eventful film\". But I think it's a groundbreaker! A remake? Yes. But that totally surpass its source material.\n\nPersonal rating: 80/100\nCritical rating: 88/100",

            "content": "If there's any more proof there aren't any new ideas in Hollywood, it's the fact that beloved animated classics are being remade as live-action films. Sometimes this works, but more often than not, the ploy to attract those nostalgic feelings from the audience fails, thus leaving the viewer with the sense that their childhood is ruined. I'm generally pretty hesitant of these types of films, mainly because part of me doesn't want to admit that the original films sometimes weren't that great. That being said, the latest in these adaptations, The Jungle Book (2016) certainly surprised me.\n\nUnlike some films like Maleficent (2014), which takes a different point of view from the main story of Sleeping Beauty (1959), and more like Cinderella (2015), which covers the same material as its predecessor, Cinderella (1950), The Jungle Book takes the main ideas from Rudyard Kipling's book, via the animated interpretation of The Jungle Book (1967) and brings the adaptation to near perfection. While The Jungle Book's classically animated predecessor certainly had its moments, a lot of its appeal fell to obvious popular culture references (like the Beatles as vultures), and a number of catchy and flashy song-and-dance routines. As a result, I can't honestly remember what the plot of the original film was trying to convey. This was why I was quite impressed with director Jon Favreau's adaptation: the plot was direct and made sense, while also highlighting man's ability to create useful (as well as deadly) tools. It was clear how Mowgli (Neel Sethi) needed to adapt to his strengths to survive in the jungle instead of just hanging around with his animal friends. Also, the clear distinction of the connection between him and Shere Khan (Idris Elba) created a much-needed tension to the story.\n\nSome will recall that The Jungle Book has already been made as a live-action film with The Jungle Book (1994). However, advances in computer-generated imagery over the years have made the ability to create talking animals a mind-numbingly realistic endeavor. The voice acting cast for this version was pretty spot on, and the pacing was fantastic. What's more, there still were snippets of songs and subtle pop culture references (my favorite being the cowbell in King Louie's (Christopher Walken) lair), but they didn't distract from the flow of the film.\n\nA superior film to its classically animated predecessor, 5.0 stars out of 5.",

            "content": "Jungle Book is a well made remake that succeeds in delivering a slightly different story, capitalizing on state-of-the-art CGI and laudable performances to suit the whole family.\n\nWhen I first watched the trailer, I had real goosebumps when I heard Bare Necessities playing in the background. The nostalgia and euphony of the tune urged me to see the film without a pounding heart. After nearly 5 months I can finally take a close look at this remake. I am a big fan of the 1967 version, which features one of the best sets of songs ever put to the big screen. This 2016 is somehow a much darker, serious film, with more scares and ponderous themes. Throughout most of the screen time, while marveling at the breathtaking scenery and astoundingly realistic CGI (breakthrough performance on the computer's part), I was occasionally bothered by how the plot and scripts deviated from what I expected, and the lack of warmth and humor I enjoyed when rewatching the 1967 musical. The third act is well done, nevertheless, and along with the incredible CGI so as Neel Sethi's extraordinary performance as Mowgli forming the backbone of this remake. Jungle Book is a well made remake that succeeds in delivering a slightly different story, capitalizing on state-of-the-art CGI to suit well for family audience. (Too scary and dark for a kids film, too generic for higher level audiences)\n\nMan, the CGI alone is worth the ticket price (in my case download time). Scenes could have been awkward if the technology had not reach this level, and Mowgli's performance is very worth praising because he expressed and acted naturally even though the characters were not there. \n\nYet, I am somehow less satisfied with the film than I thought I should be. Supposedly comedic scenes were somehow dramatized and were given darker turns, and sometimes they feel hollow and disappointing. Elephants scenes are an example. Not only did the elephants not talk, they didn't attain the sarcastic humor that prevails in the 1967 version. Shere Khan was more violent and evil, thus losing the witty sense of humor, and so did Kaa. Another thing is that the relationship between Mowgli and Baloo was not quite as intimate as the first film. Yes, both characters might not be animated this time, but still a weird decision to have Baloo befriending the man-cub just for honey. Baloo's apparent sacrifice at the end was also omitted. As a result, \"Bare Necessities\" scene was not as memorable as I thought of, and that's cuz their bond was not well developed yet!\n\nI could go on and pick out more stuff that I disliked during viewing, such as how the film ruined \"I Wanna Be Like You\" by having a big ape throwing fruits everywhere while monkeys squeaked at the background. The scene should be like how the end-credits depicted (King Louie dancing around in his palace). However, I won't go into that much criticism because its a good film. The CGI's amazing. I love how they gave the wolves more screentime and significance, since they are barely developed in 1967 version. Vultures are cut off, good. The third act is also something I never thought would happen in Jungle Book, providing a deeper message and a more thrilling climax than the predecessor. At the end of the day I won't say I am fully satisfied, but yet I'll say I am decently entertained by the CGI and the overall tone of the story. Besides, is there anything better than listening to \"Bare Necessities\", \"Trust in Me\" once more with a little modern mix? Priceless.",

While there are a few small improvements ( a better environment and more polishing) the film's a mess with barely any coherence and horrendous pacing, the voice cast is good but not enough to save the film (Sethi is unbearable at times). I expected better from Favreau since he directed ELF and IRON MAN and already had high hopes for this adaptation but was sorely disappointed. Sparkly CGI was used as an excuse for decent storytelling and depth. The additions to the story were unnecessary ( keep in mind this is adapting the 1967 Jungle Book animated film). The score was average at best but the songs, though whimsical in the original are manhandled here. The 2016 version of THE JUNGLE BOOK is a atrocious mess that fails to capture the magic of Walt Disney's classic film. I'd give THE JUNGLE BOOK a 1/10.",

Walking out of this movie, I Loved it!! Everyone a part of this movie did an excellent job from acting,Cgi, directing, everything. The blend of real and cgi was done so well, all thanks to the fantastic director Jon Favreau. Every film he does, it gets better and better. This is his best film yet. Now Neel Sethi, this was his first ever movie and for that I thought he did a great job. There were scenes I didn't think  he would be able to do but I was totally wrong. Everyone did great, especially Idris Elba as the villain. Bill Murray is fantastic as always. Personally the person who blew me away was Christopher Walken. He was just amazing. Overall The jungle book is another fantastic movie by Disney and Jon Favreau is only getting better as a director. Definitely needs to be seen in a theater and I do recommend seeing it in 3D. Kids and adults will have lots of fun.",

I thought Kingsley was a perfect Bagheera, but did not think that Murray's personality best fit the goofy Baloo. Kaa's presence was drastically cut in comparison to the first film, but done rather well. The King Louie scene was probably the most different take, but the film in general replaced goofiness from the original with charm, or darkness.

One of the best examples I can think of for a children's film that most adults would also enjoy, unless severely opposed to the subject etc.",

I won't lie, I'm likely being biased with this review since I absolutely love the 1967 animated version of the film.

The acting and voice acting was superb, the story was engaging, and the special effects - even in this day of CGI wonders - was executed to perfection.  I can't imagine special effects getting better until the time comes when we watch holograms and sniff olfactory chemicals in the cinemas of the future.

Sure, the Tiger carries the human-hate baggage a little too far, but in no way is the audience allowed to sympathize as his scarred face was accompanied by a ominous theme song each time he appeared on screen. The child actor was extremely annoying to watch, listen to. I ended up hating him before the movie was even finished.

            "content": "The Jungle Book was easily a Disney favorite as a child. How many times did I watch the cartoon? Beyond count. Then in 1994 came the first live action adaptation with Sam Neil and Cary Elwes, which was a solid take on the classic book. Now Disney takes another stab at making a live action adaptation of The Jungle Book, and at a point in time where Disney is rebooting all their classic cartoons to live action. Not a very likable time in my opinion. Outside of Pixar, Disney continues to keep originality on long term hold. This continuation to reboot and recycle the same material in Hollywood annoys me. The story is set, and it is pretty much the same story we've all grown to know and love. Now comes the part where a lot of recent films have failed. Seeing that the filmmakers actually gave a damn about telling the story as well as making the experience fun, rather than phoning in the project due to it's already established success. Jon Favreau is the director of this live action adaptation. With a unique filmography ranging from Made to Elf to Zathura to Iron Man to Chef, his take on the Rudyard Kipling book is both genuine and wonderful to watch. He completely homers here with The Jungle Book, which for me quickly became the first film since Mad Max: Fury Road where I was struck with complete awe and wonder. \nThe Jungle Book is a great journey from start to finish. It's not just another kids movie filled with over-the-top goofy corny G-rated gags. Nor is it another kids movie catering to an audience of just kids. When it's being funny the film is funny, when it's thrilling the film is exciting, when it's sad it even got an emotional response from me. With an A-list cast featuring great names like, Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray, Christopher Walken, Idris Elba, and Lupita Nyong'o, the film is carried by one single live action performance from a 13 year-old actor named Neel Sethi. The pressure of Neel's performance as Mowglu was crucial to The Jungle Book, cause every other actor only had to lend their voice. The result, you could not ask for a better performance from a 13 year old, like the one Neel gives as Mowgli. He carries the whole film without needing a single adult actor to step in for help, even though there are some great scenes from both Bill Murray and Christopher Walken. Both steal the spotlight, but only for a little bit. Another key character to the film is the jungle itself. The film's jungle is structured heavily with CGI, and yet the film does not lose it's balance to it's effects. The visuals are certainly jaw-dropping and breathtaking, but they do remain a backdrop for the characters and the story. But what a beautiful backdrop the visual effects are in The Jungle Book. To be impressed by visual effects is becoming more and more of a rare thing these days. The Jungle Book's visuals did more than impress, they dazzled me with child-like glee.    \nTo watch Favreau's Jungle Book, was almost like being catapulted back through time and into a child-like state of mind where you find yourself laughing, smiling, and being  at the life's simplest things. Not since Babe has there been this great of a live action movie featuring talking animals. Jon Favreau knows exactly how to reach kid in all of us.",

            "content": "See more reviews like this at chrisbreviews.blogspot.com\n\nBefore I begin, I know what you're going to ask, and yes, they kept the Bear Necessities and I wanna be like you songs. There were a lot of considerable similarities and differences to the original actually. Similar: the characters, general plot, and songs. Different: certain events of the plot, new sub-plots, the closer attention to themes, and the overall quality of the film. This one was better.\n\nThis is a reboot of the original 1967 cartoon version of the film, and Director Favreau displayed his supreme directing skills in balancing the existing events of the original and giving older audiences some nostalgia and making the film more contemporary and making the characters and areas of plot a lot more three dimensional. This skill matches that of J.J. Abrams in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Without any spoilers, there are little changes in the plot that cause big ripple effects to what is the final product which may make some fans upset, but I found these changes to be welcoming and even required for this film to be a success. I will further explore each of these differences throughout the review. Needless to say, Favreau switched the film up in a way that made it deep, fulfilling, and entertaining for all audiences despite it being labelled as a children's movie.\n\nI did have some issues with the plot however- namely Shere Khan's role. In the beginning, Shere Khan, the ruthless bad guy tiger who kills animals all the time, shows jungle etiquette by giving Mowgli a head start to get out of the jungle before he kills him. How nice of you evil tiger. After one half-hearted attempt at snatching Mowgli, he devises a plan to take over the jungle (no spoilers, but something happens here) and, assuming word gets across to Mowgli, Mowgli will then come to Shere Khan and then he will kill him. So the element of a chase movie that was present in the '67 version was more lacking this time round. The tiger's patience gave Mowgli plenty of time to make new friends and have a couple sub-adventures. Even though for the larger portion of the film Khan didn't do much, he was a very scary and menacing villain in both destructive capabilities and in his manner; a worthy villain for the intelligent man-cub Mowgli. Different to 1967, he had motivation for going after Mowgli which made him a better and more intriguing character. His tale was very much a tale of revenge. I was scared of him! Parents: don't be surprised if your young one is scared too.\n\nFavreau brought the film quality, and a great cast to go with it! Even though most of these guys where voices, you could see characteristics of their face in their character's face- especially Walken's character, which I found very interesting. The cast included Neel Sethi, Scarlett Johansson, Bill Murray, Idris Elba, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Walken, Lupita Nyong'o, and Giancarlo Esposito. All of their voices suited their characters perfectly. I loved re-exploring the chemistry and relationship between Mowgli and big bear Baloo. Each character brought with them their own tone when they were on-screen whether it was menacing, mysterious, lighthearted, tense, protective, or loving, this film was an emotional rollercoaster. This was actor Neel Sethi's first performance and he performed brilliantly, portraying Mowgli in a way that did justice to the character. I look forward to more of his work.\n\nGenres were extensive due to each character's contribution. There was action, adventure, comedy, drama, family, fantasy, and thriller. It blended each of these with great finesse and the movie had great balance. Thriller was a bold addition, but just made the film all the more satisfying. Our setting was, once again, the jungle. Themes played a big part in this movie including belonging, acceptance, sacrifice, morals, revenge, undeviating love, peace, prejudice, family, journey, and teamwork. While Walt Disney focussed on telling a fun story that lets the imagination explore, Favreau concentrated on recreating this world while making the film a deeper one to be enjoyed by a wider variety of audiences. The themes created valuable morals which young audiences can learn from. Win win.\n\nThe special effects were flawless, there wasn't one instance where I doubted that a character wasn't real. There were a couple of risks made in this one, but they all worked out fine. The script was also impeccable, there were some valuable gems in it. For those who have seen the film, I especially enjoyed the story told by Sheer Khan to the baby wolves, and the law of the jungle.\n\nThe running time was longer than the average for a family film, so young audiences attention spans may wander, but I was thoroughly engaged throughout. Although there were a lot of sequences part of the 'adventure', they weren't necessarily central to the story. This may bore some. The editing kept a fair ratio of screen time to Mowgli's adventure and what was happening meanwhile at the heart of the jungle. In terms of box office performance, I don't think it will get as much as it should get mainly due to the minimal marketing and potentially other films drowning it out.\n\nThe Jungle Book doesn't have heaps it could work on, but I would say that the monkey king sequence could've been cut out, there wasn't much contribution to the story, it was mainly just killing time which didn't need to be there in the first place. Maybe you could work on the element of the chase more.\n\nTo Conclude, this is one of the first family films that I can safely say adults will enjoy watching due to their relationship with the original and its excellent quality. It's got something for everyone. Favreau was successful in conveying the intended morals and I can say that The Jungle Book has a HIGH rewatchability level. It's not surprising that this film is excellent with Disney's almost flawless track record, and I'm looking forward to Disney's 2016 films such as Alice Through the Looking Glass, Finding Dory, and the BFG.",

            "content": "Disney arrives with a truly visionary and amazing film this 2016, this time a live action retelling of the classic Rudyard Kipling story, which they first adapted in 1967 as an animated film, though this film is more of an inspiration, going in its own direction, with a slightly darker spin and approach.\n\nThe film follows Mowgli, who seeks out a journey, aided by various animals, while the threatening and evil tiger Shere Khan attempts to kill him.\n\nThe film is a visual wonder and great treat, with a terrific cast. Newcomer Neel Sethi depicts Mowgli and is the only human actor in the film, since many of the actors are computer generated creations. Sethi does an amazing job, since as an actor, he has nothing to work with. He wonderfully commands the screen, making you believe in his journey, while remarkably depicting Mowgli as a strong-minded and strong-willed child. Throughout the entire film, he is able to command the film, while he also has great chemistry with the actors voicing the animals. He's not only believable, but delivers a performance of realism and believability. In all honesty, he truly deserves a nomination for Best Actor for managing to work with absolutely nothing on the film. The voice cast is impeccable and brilliantly picked. Ben Kingsley voices Bagheera as a general, with a true sense of command and knowledge, while he also shows compassion for Mowgli. Bill Murray is wonderful as Baloo, bringing the right amount comedy, while also appearing serious in scenes. Christopher Walken is terrific as King Louie, who is given a slightly larger appearance, as a secondary villain. Walken is menacing when he needs to be and friendly at other times. Scarlett Johansson is exceptional as Kaa, depicting the character with a more serious approach, instead of a comedic foil, which the animated film had done. The real standout in the voice cast, though, is Idris Elba, who voices Shere Khan. Elba is absolutely magnificent in the role, appearing splendidly evil, while allowing the character to be highly menacing, even off screen. Elba, as Shere Khan, has got to be one of the greatest Disney villains, since Jeremy Irons as Scar in The Lion King, Keith David as Dr. Facilier in The Princess and the Frog and Richard White as Gaston in Beauty and the Beast. Lupita Nyong'o and Giancarlo Esposito are also perfectly cast as the wolves that watch over Mowgli.\n\nJon Favreau masterfully directs this film, crafting a film that is not only original, but also full of magic and wonder. Favreau, who is probably mostly well-known to this generation for bringing Iron Man to life, is an amazing choice for this film and also seems like the best choice to deliver a new tale of The Jungle Book. Favreau crafts a film with real heart and relatable characters, successfully having us follow a young child on journey of self-discovery, while encountering danger at every turn. With the help of Favreau, as well as screenwriter Justin Marks, you not only relate with Mowgli, but also the countless characters he encounters on his journey. Marks, especially, manages to craft an original film as screenwriter that feels like something for a whole new generation. Bill Pope's cinematography is astounding, wonderfully switching color for every scene and location that Mowgli encounters. At times light, other times stark and dark, the lighting and camera angles are perfectly developed and handled, while this film also works well in 3D, primarily IMAX 3D. Watching it in 3D you feel like you are part of the film and action, while seeing it on a giant screen like IMAX further adds to the action and adventure in the Indian jungle and landscape. John Debney's score has a mystical feel to it, at times incorporating elements of the score from the 1967 film in a smart and genius manner. The songs The Bare Necessities, Trust In Me and I Wan'na Be Like You are interwoven brilliantly into the plot. While the film mainly relies on speaking, instead of singing, elements of the songs appear in speech, while the songs appear in full through the end credits. This approach perfectly goes along with the film, since switching to a musical for a short amount of time would seem awkward and out of style for a film that is approached in a more serious and darker manner.\n\nThe real treat of this film are the visual effects, which brilliantly and realistically bring the animals. While watching the film, I never thought that the animals were CGI, since they appear so life like, which one of the film's many successes. This is similar to Life of Pi, where the animals, mainly the tiger, were CGI, but in a very realistic approach. The animals in this film walk and sit like actual animals, proving that visual effects are constantly evolving and changing. I do believe that this will gain the film an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, which it truly deserves.\n\nThe end result is a film full of magic, while also proving that Disney can still deliver films of originality, with real heart, magic and wonder. While not a direct remake of the 1967 film, and in my opinion very superior, the film is more of a love letter, while also acting as a film for a whole new generation of film goers. Bravo! Bravo indeed!",

Would we be smart enough at such a young age to overcome all the obstacles being presented us the manner that he did or would we falter and cave in to the fear? This is a movie for all of the kids out there over 6. From 6-106, this movie has something for all of us. Now grab ahold of your seat and let's swing into the fascinating world of mowgli and the Jungle book. Action=5, acting=5, story=4.5. Cgi=5 all in all I give this movie 5 stars.

The animals all were so well done. The boy that played Mogley was perfect. All of the voice acting was top notch. The story itself was beautiful, although I realize it's based off a book. Now I want to read those books! I don't really like Disney as a corporation. But they really do get some talented people to make some of their movies. Maybe the director will have started a new trend in movies like he did with Iron Man. Well I guess the Cinderella movie last year would count too. i could see myself watching this movie many times. Especially if I ever have kids...",

            "content": "Fantastic live action adaptation of the Jungle Book. Based on the animated The Jungle Book (1967) this version spins it slightly different and meanwhile still pays homage to the original. Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is a young boy who's been raised by Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) a wolf along with the rest of her pack. Mowgli was brought to the wolf clan by the panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). When a massive drought hits the land the fearsome tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) returns and discovers the secret of Mowgli. Shere Khan gives the wolfs an ultimatum telling them when the water returns they must give the boy to him. Mowgli feeling like he's a problem to everyone decides to leave with Bagheera and be with his own people. On the way Mowgli comes across many different animals including the hypnotic snake Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), the goofy Baloo (Bill Murray) and an orangutan named King Louie (Christopher Walken) that has an agenda of his own. The movie has a lot of heart and you really feel for Mowgli and his situation. He's a stranger in a very strange world. Always trying to fit in, but never realizing that he's his own person. The film looks absolutely beautiful. Although, a lot of it is shot with CG it looks. The voice actors give life to the life like animals and everything blends together quite well. Small gripes could be the movie runs maybe about ten minutes too long (how many chase scenes do we need?), but the pacing outside of that is pretty well done. Overall, give it a look if you haven't checked it out!",

I liked how they brought some of the original songs back like \"Bear Necessitates\" and \"Trust in Me\" and  \"Want to be like you.\" We get to see Bagheer the panther and Baloo the bear bond together with Mowgli on new but similar adventures.

            "content": "I would say any further attempt to recreate another adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's eponymous classics The Jungle Book series is close to suicidal. Another film made to capture the hearts of both young and adult, with talking animals, creating the magical bond between a boy and a bear, and obviously extreme ineludible lengths of CGI dependency, not an easy task. We have had many versions produced in the past, some rather successful especially Disney's 1967 animated film version, and we've seen a variety of Mowglis as well, from Jason Scott Lee (1994) to Brandon Baker (1998). Nevertheless the trailer for Jon Favreau's version of The Jungle Book, the fourth and latest edition by Disney, was enthralling enough to bring me to the theatres. Still doubtful though about the storyline (forgive my skepticism, the screenwriter is after all Justin Marks who gave us the marvelous Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li in 2009) I knew I had to watch it in IMAX 3D to at least come out visually entertained. The verdict? Favreau's reimagining of Kipling's dense world of the wilderness is nothing less of spectacular, the screen is bursting with exuberant colors and movements, and watching the anthropomorphic animals going about in their adventures is surprisingly absorbing. Twitter is already calling it \"The Revenant\" for kids, as it brings the children tale into a darker level, with some thrilling scenes which can be quite overwhelming for younger audience.\nStaying close to the 1967 animation storyline, it tells the story of orphaned Mowgli (Neel Sethi) who is found by panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) and raised in the wilderness by a pack of wolves led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito), along with Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) who cared for him like one of her own cubs. Peppy but docile, Mowgli soaks in all life lessons taught by his mentors and guardians, and yearns to grow up to be just like the wolves in his pack. His childhood is however abruptly shaken when a nefarious tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) visits and demands that Mowgli be turned over to him for an unsettled vengeance from the past. Reluctantly, the orphan decides to leave Raksha and the rest of his family, whilst Bagheera concludes further that it is in fact time for Mowgli to leave the jungle altogether and join his own species, pivoting a series of both enlightening and treacherous adventures including meeting Baloo (Bill Murray) the friendly bear, witty and blithe in spirit, Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) the seductive serpent, and King Louie (Christopher Walken) the ape who seeks ultimate power in the animal kingdom.\nEntrancing, Favreau's Jungle Book is a visual achievement. The handsome lush Indian landscapes with the clever combination of realistic and fantastical elements provide one of the most interesting, photorealistic all-digital climate to any films we have come across. With ten year-old Sethi being the only live-actor role and the entire story filmed in a studio in LA, Favreau has managed to re-create the beloved classic with a muscle, where his usual mastery in action sequences are put to efficient use, and at the same time coming off emotionally moving. I like the way Mowgli's humanity (and his \"man tricks\") which inevitably draws him away from his animal families and home, is used as the central theme of the story, but eventually becoming his ultimate weapon to win the battle and find his way \"home\". Much is put into work to make sure that the animals talk and move in the most realistic manner. You can almost \"see\" the actors when the animals emote, especially for Shere Khan, Baloo and Bagheera. And for me, it was Sethi's endearing portrayal of the man-cub that stole my heart. A perfect casting choice. \"I think it's time to update the story and the themes a little bit for this generation,\" Favreau shared when explaining the importance of using CGI the right way. Indeed he pulled it off, one example of CGI put to good use. So good, that both Favreau and screenwriter Marks are already in talks with Disney to return for Jungle Book 2.",

It is hard to put my finger on just what is wrong with them.  All l can say is they were too perfect. Like rosy cheeked kids starving on an island. It just wasn't - right. King Kong as an orangutan? I'm sorry but to me that was dumb. Mowgli? The kid was fantastic! Loved his acting. But the rest? My wife fell asleep several times and she was the one who really wanted to go see the film. I think if the director had just transported the animated version to real life (as per the OTHER Jungle Book movie Disney made) that they would have had a real hit on their hands. The kid steals the show.  Maybe that is what was wrong - the animals were trying too hard to steal the show? I don't know.  All I can say is - if you put the first Narnia next to this movie and watched them both - I am sure you would understand where I am coming from.  Narnia - The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe - is perfectly done.  Everything fits together perfectly, all of the animatronics is flawless, the CGI is flawless and it all works. This - it just doesn't. There is just something wrong with it. That's all I can say.",

It would have been nice if the committee in their board room had let someone do a Wicked style side story. But they voted to keep the songs short and limited and not break a working formula. There was a lot of acting and musical talent behind this film and it was leashed and you can feel it. This was about easy money and justifying budgets. The CGI is seamless and the only thing that breaks it is when you realise they have captured the actors faces in the characters. This is striking and with King Louie haunting. It is done so well and keeps with the films beautiful realistic style. The many accountants and lawyers behind this only held the movie back, they are pointless and damaging. The teams of talented and wonderful artists I love you. Your time will come you will be free. You made a wonderful film.",

The visuals are incredible considering their creation in a warehouse in LA. The voice performances are all spot on. Neel Sethi is delightfully wide-eyed as Mowgli. Bill Murray is dryly amusing as Baloo, Ben Kingsley wise and stern as Bagheera, Idris Elba menacing and intimidating as Shere Khan and Lupita Nyong'o warm as Raksha. Christopher Walken puts in a fine speaking voice but when the film busts out in a weird and creepy rendition of 'I Wanna Be Like You\", Walken can't quite hit the pitches. Scarlet Johansson even gets a wonderfully unnerving scene as Kaa. If there was any proble,s with the film other than the awkward inclusion of two musical numbers, it would be in the CGI which looks gorgeous but can distract at times where it is more noticeable than others. However, the film is consistently enjoyable and the action finale is edge of your seat stuff. Disney's live action reboots continue to surprise. Here's to Beauty and the Beast. Rating: 86",

This is a very dramatic film that doesn't slow down the pace too much. Something is always happening around every turn. The story is not award winning or original, but it was intriguing enough. Most of the movie was computer graphics, which may take some viewers away from the film, but the CG work is very realistic and won't take you out of it unless you think about it. Much praise to the musical score, which gave this film amazing life, and also nodded to the original animated musical. \nOverall this film is very entertaining and good for all audiences. The voice acting is convincing and the musical score is impressive.",

            "content": "For a film where the cast is almost entirely voice acting, and a jungle made by CGI, The Jungle Book soars to new heights since its Disney premiere in 1967. I'll admit, I was always a fan of the original classic from the 60s, but expected the remake to be just a visually stunning version of the same script. Instead, we are given more background on the main character, Mowgli, as well as a deeper dive into the characters that were left on the back burner by the original animators. Of course, our classic heroes Bagheera and Baloo, as well as the trickster, King Louie, and the villainous Shere Khan, all make an appearance, but we also get to take a look at other characters, most importantly the wolf family that Mowgli is sheltered in since birth. Director Jon Favreau puts a spotlight on the aspect of family, using the wolves as a centerpiece of the film. The choice to highlight these creatures, brought to life brilliantly by Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad) and Lupita Nyong'o (Star Wars: The Force Awakens, 12 Years a Slave), along with an adorable batch of wolf cubs who bring \"aww\"s and smiles to every moviegoers eyes, is brilliant in putting heart into an otherwise emotion lacking film. Of course, Bill Murray's Baloo is a masterwork and delivers most of the laughs in the film as well, and Ben Kingsley's Bagheera is so perfect that you could listen to him talk for hours and hours, and just love it more and more. Scarlett Johansson has a smaller role than the typical Kaa from the original film, but still delivers a credible vocal performance, bringing the expected chill from her soft voice that captured our attention in Spike Jonze's \"Her\" in 2013. Now for the BEST and WORST of the vocal performances: starting with the best, Idris Elba as Shere Khan the tiger. His vocal presence is perfect for the villain, and sends chills down the spine, and a sense of fear to the audience in a fantasized story like this. Christopher Walken, on the other hand, falls a bit flat for me. His voice doesn't fit the size and power that his character, King Louie, has, and his song is almost unbearable to listen to. The monkey scene is a tad drawn out and the song doesn't bring the intended excitement to the scene either, given Walken's soft tone and the monkey's lazy stature, and lack of movement. Regardless, the CGI in the film is incredible, and much credit is given to Neel Sethi, the man cub himself. His acting isn't good, but the ability to keep up with a blank set and simply voices is what gives him the impressive edge, and makes the performance bearable. The jungle is beautiful to look at, and the long pans of sunsets, jungle brush, animal herds, and water is breathtaking, and help make this the most beautiful film that Disney has ever made. Similar to Ang Lee's \"Life of Pi,\" the CGI in the animals is almost unrecognizable, and there's really no sense of gimmick or lack of detail. The detail is so precise, from the shed snake skin to Shere Khan's damaged left eye, making the animators and visual effects artists the true champions here. The voice acting is excellent, but what elevates this from the original is the visual masterpiece that we are treated to. This will not leave you disappointed, and is a fun watch for any age or type, packing song, jokes, and lots of heart into a quick 106 minutes of boundless joy.",

            "content": "Watching Disney's 'The Jungle Book (2016)' is an exhilarating, terrifying, fun time. Disney and Director, Jon Favreau have taken the two-dimensional, coloring book cut out characters, of the original Jungle Book; Mowgli; the man-cub abandoned in the jungle when he was just a baby and raised by wolves, Bagheera; the devoted, black panther who has vowed to protect the helpless man-cub he found, Baloo; the opportunistic, laid-back bear who grew to love the man-cub, Shere Khan; the menacing vile tiger that vows to kill the man-cub, Kaa; the snake with the hypnotizing stare is intent on making the man-cub her dinner, Raksha; the kind, loving she-wolf; the only mother the man-cub has ever known, and King Louie; the orangutan leader of the monkey army who kidnaps the man-cub, for his enjoyment, and transformed them into larger than life, anthropomorphic, CGI brilliance.  \n\nThere is one thing for certain, this is not your grandma's Jungle Book. It's even better. It's edgy, it's exciting, it's spectacular. It is terrifying. Shere Khan (Idris Elba) makes Scar, of 'The Lion King' and Disney's previously most vile feline, look like Bambi. He vows to kill the man-cub just like he killed the man-cub's father. Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) recognizes the man-cub's need of the 'peoples'. It becomes apparent exactly how much the safety of the entire jungle is threatened by Mowgli's mere presence, when Shere Khan (Idris Elba) violently murders Akela (Giancarlo Esposito), the Alpha-wolf that adopted Mowgli. As Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) bids her man-cub farewell, her love and sheer sorrow pulls the audience into her sense of loss. Bagheera escorts Mowgli on an epic journey out of the jungle to find the 'peoples' village. The journey is fraught with danger. Mowgli, all the while, must stay ahead of Shere Khan. We meet Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), the enormous she-snake that tries to hypnotize Mowgli into becoming her next willing meal; Baloo (Bill Murray) an enormous giant of a bear equipped with claws, teeth, and lack of morals, becomes Mowgli's best friend. We encounter the absolutely terrifying monkey army that delivers Mowgli to King Louie (Christopher Walken), enormous and red. King Louie is the jungle's own mob boss. His appetite for papaya and power is insatiable. Mowgli and his companions are tested by every danger the jungle contains. Mowgli leaves the legend of the man-cub and the jungle behind, to begin life with the 'peoples' but not before his battle to the death, with Shere Khan.  \n\nUsually remakes of classic movies leave the audience let down. Not this remake. 'The Jungle Book (2016)' remains true to the original, complete with the dancing and singing we loved from the original. 'The Jungle Book (2016)' is a work of cinematic genius. Special effects and CGI are mind numbing. However, I would refrain from taking small children to see this movie. The majority of this movie is terrifying. I was at the end of my seat, my hands ready to cover my eyes. Director, Jon Favreau, did a fantastic job keeping with the feeling of original without making it feel dated. The casting is amazing. But it is 12-year old Neel Sethi, cast as Mowgli, that has a brilliant career ahead of himself. His portrayal of Mowgli is warm, engaging, thoughtful, relevant, and most of all believable. The only human of the movie, Sethi's entire performance is alongside a green screen.\n\nRudyard Kipling would be proud.\n\nI give this movie 4 of 5 'fresh tomatoes', due to how frightening this movie is.",
