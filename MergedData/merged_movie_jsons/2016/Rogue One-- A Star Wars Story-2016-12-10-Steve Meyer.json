It expands the Star Wars lore to explain why the Death Star has that strange weakness, gives us an amazing Gold Squad Cameo, as well as great action sequences. \nAbsolutely recommend\n\n\nIt's so hard to understand how this movie could be made by the same company as The Force Awakens.",

            "content": "I give this movie 4.5/5 stars for its thrilling story, its stunning visuals, and its respectful homage to the Star Wars legacy. It is a film that expands the Star Wars lore and adds new layers of depth and complexity to the conflict between the Rebellion and the Empire. The film also features some of the best action scenes in the franchise, especially the climactic battle on Scarif. The film also showcases some impressive performances from its diverse cast, especially Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso, Diego Luna as Cassian Andor, and Ben Mendelsohn as Orson Krennic. The film also pays tribute to the original trilogy with some clever references, cameos, and easter eggs.\n\nHowever, I also think that some aspects of the film are slightly flawed, such as the pacing, the characterization, and the music. The film sometimes feels rushed and uneven, especially in the first act. The film also struggles to develop some of its characters and make them memorable and relatable. The film also lacks some of the iconic musical themes by John Williams that are synonymous with Star Wars. The film also relies too much on CGI for some of its characters and scenes, which can be distracting and uncanny at times. Nevertheless, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is an excellent addition to the Star Wars franchise and a thrilling standalone adventure that fans and newcomers alike can enjoy.",

This is much darker with more of an adult feel than other movies in the franchise.  Having said that, it has its humorous parts that are dropped in at just the right spot and are not juvenile or goofy.  The best thing about the movie is the extent to which it draws you into the world of the Rebellion's espionage.  That part of the movie is tense, and feels real with real consequences.

Many blogs and websites have essays and videos dedicated to analyzing the director's choices and exploring the richness of characters' development. THIS episode encapsulates the very best of all the films and leaves out much of the low-hanging fan service the more recent films have relied upon for box. office success. THIS film is rarely pandering and though many plot choices are dubious in their motivations and execution, it's more of a structural necessity than mere demand for a suspension of disbelief. Felicity Jones as Jan Erso is delicate but fierce, vulnerable but straightforward, and believable beyond all expectations. With the backup of heavy hitting veterans like Diego Luna, Mads Mikkelsen,Forest Whitaker and Alan Tudyk, Jones perpetuates the protagonist heroine into the resolve of the movie's climax quite perfectly. The cinematography (obviously largely CGI-driven) is impressive in its detail,  but restrained to not be over produced for the sake of being spectacular. The sound design was extremely enveloping overall and made sure precision was executed in the editing. ADR was barely noticeable (that's a good thing) and the film editing was nothing short of perfect- no continuity or storytelling snafus that I noticed after multiple screenings, and with so many choices, everything felt alive and correctly transitory. This will likely remain the grandest and most consumable chronicle of the Star Wars cinematic universe.",

I heard this film was recommended, even to non-Star Wars fans, however, so I decided to give it a go. Its certainly not a bad film - its reasonably tense and atmospheric at times and it is somewhat gripping as well, with good chase scenes. There's a decent cast present too, including Forest Whitaker and Mads Mikkelsen, among others. Its pretty entertaining and I thought the special effects were well done but its very much a sci-fi film and the plot is somewhat complicated. I'm pretty s ure you can enjoy it, even if you don't pay much attention to every last plot point, however. Its not the sort of film I think I'd want to watch again but its certainly a good film and so I'd say its worth seeing if it interests you, or if your a sci-fi fan, then yes I would recommend it.  I can think of worse ways to spend a little over 2 hours, though it isn't exactly greatly meaningful or memorable, its definitely not bad either and does a good job of keeping the viewer entertained, even if said viewer may not be entirely sure of everything going on. Sometimes escapism is all thats needed in a film, especially these days.",

It felt like the writers didn't feel there was a need to flesh these characters out hardly at all because they all suffer the same fate but that isn't an excuse for lazy writing. And because of that that is why the acting also feels like its nothing special either. The actors aren't given much to work with except be likeable and accouple of quirks that are I guess meant to substitute for personality. Acting and the Characters were the main problems I had with this consistently. And it really starts to weigh the longer things go on. But still every other element is very well done especially a very well done action packed ending. This is a classic of its franchise and if your a fan of Star wars you'll like it it is definitely worth at least one viewing but this isn't anywhere near the quality of the original trilogy because of the lack of rich characters.",

Even small wins, like opening the shields, felt so significant in this movie and for the first time, the feeling of dread and terror was ever presence.  The cast/characters - particularly in the second half of this film - were so likeable because of their arcs and genuine bravery.  There was no plot armor, no character was safe from demise, yet, they sacrificed everything for information that gave them nothing more than a mere chance of survival.  The closing Vadar scene also culminated the quality of cast and story.  The extras who played the Rebels put in such an incredible performance during that final scene.  The feeling of sheer horror when Vadar's lightsaber shone was totally unlike anything I'd felt while watching a movie.  The \"LAUNCH\" scream from one the rebels highlighted how terrifying and evil Vadar had become.  It also gave 'A New Hope' so much more meaning which is quite a feat.  They HAD to succeed in their mission after the Rebels gave up their own lives to get the Death Star plans.  Jyn was perfectly cast and an example of how to write a strong female character.  She was so easy to like, her script was brilliant and she was the consummate hero.  Jyn was arguably the most important \"side story\" (for lack of a better term) in all of Star Wars.

The Easter Eggs make the universe feel small and ruin the idea that this is hundreds of planets with trillions of beings.

We see the stakes are high when near the 1 hour 30 minutes make we see many people sacrifice their lives to get the Death Star plan. Really, I find it quite sad seeing all those rebels die for such a good cause \u2014 try to take down the deadly weapon by getting the plans for it. Granted, this is just a movie, but also I feel the stakes are higher particularly in this film. I really don't know why; maybe it is because we see so many rebels dies or maybe because the whole mission was set out by not many people, I really don't know. But I feel the stakes in this movie the most out of all the other Star Wars film. This one is good because it can manage to do a spin-off Star Wars story but manage to keep it somehow consisted to the Skywalker Legacy! It probably could have been its own Star Wars movie but maybe it was for the best! I also like this because it did not exactly give a happy ending \u2014 it was in fact more than happy, it was quite sad truth be told. It manages to balance out the action, drama, sadness, and a good storyline which is what a movie should be: it should balance everything out! Granted, this is not the best Star Wars movie (well technically it is a spin-off movie to the series) and I kind of wished John William's amazing score would have been in here: it would have been added half a star if John William's score was in here. It is such a creative movie with bright visuals and great cinematography, and glad to see Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin come back to this film \u2014 with of course C-3PO and R2-D2, how could we miss on them!! Overall a great movie to see and to be honest a great spin-off movie to the Star Wars series!",

The cast is brilliant, but I wish their characters had been able to do more. The scene where Darth Vader slices his way down the hallway makes me terribly emotional because it's so brutal, dark, and cruelly violent, but I feel like it gets played off like it's supposed to be cool, and everyone talks about how awesome that moment is, which is far from how I feel about it. I don't like the mentality that the villain of the story brutally slaughtering innocent good guys is what makes the film \"awesome\". In the end, it's not worth it to watch a whole 2 hour film for a 60 second hallway scene. Even still, I will always appreciate this being canon and I will always appreciate having seen it.

I had a great time when I first saw this film in December 2016. Is this a prequel that prepares us for Episode IV: A New Hope, and does it succeed? Yes, I would say. This film introduces several new characters, and my favourite is K-2SO, who is essentially a black skinny C-3PO. I really like Director Krennic, who is played by Ben Mendelsohn, who is known for playing villains. The character moments were enjoyable, and we know a little about them. My favourite aspect of this film is that it features Darth Vader, the most renowned Star Wars villain. Warning: This film contains spoilers. My favourite scene is when we first encounter Darth Vader at his palace on Mustafar. This time, instead of John Williams, Michael Giacchino is in charge of the music, and he did a fantastic job. I still listen to the music now and then, and the visuals are fantastic. When the star destroyers collide to destroy the shield, the final fight is epic and takes place in space. Since the end of Return of the Jedi, the ending is arguably the greatest I've ever seen in a Star Wars film; in my view, it's the best finish in all of cinema! But Rogue One's ending was great; when Darth Vader becomes a badass and we see Princess Leia, it ushers us into Episode IV. A fantastic picture, and one of the finest of the year.",

I like the arc that Cassian Andor goes through in this movie. Donnie Yen was amazing as Chirrut \u00cemwe in the movie, and Jiang Wen's final scene as Baze was moving. K-2SO was funny. Director Krennic was a nasty son of a cur in the movie, but he was a good villain. It was incredible to see Tarkin in the movie. Plus, Darth Vader's final scene against the Rebel soldiers was both horrifying and amazing. It's just a great Star Wars story. It's the best Star Wars film that Disney produced. Unlike the mess that was the Sequel Trilogy, this movie is as good as the original films from 1977, 1980, and 1983.",

I can't remember and she can't act. She has no range or emotion \u2014 she's just stiff with botox, and the bad guy, Mr Croconut was just a sad paper character. The movie was filmed twice (now trending for Star Wars Stories) and the cinematography suffers horribly from chronic SHAKY CAMERA SYNDROME, completely departing from the brand's cinematic feel. The story is a thorough mess that jumps from disconnected scene to scene, conflicting exceptional art direction against a quagmire of poor film directing \u2014 perhaps a steady cam emulator, a calm editor, and the omission of bad acting could revise this film into a better product, but for now just save yourself the agony of enduring this flop and watch the very fun space battle (without the ground fight) on YouTube.",

In fact, much of the movie just passes over okay for the first two thirds. Certainly not bad, but nothing special either aside from some cool bits of worldbuilding (the death troopers and U-Wing are pretty awesome). But this is all made up for with the climax, which is easily one of the best finales in Star Wars history. It's like going from a 5 to a 10 in full whiplash. The battle of Scarif is  so epic with its action-packed skirmishes and it really puts the \"War\" in Star Wars. The tension builds as the characters are picked off one by one and the rebel alliance rushes in with all their cavalry as they finally step out of the shadows to defy the empire. And that final hallway scene with Darth Vader was epically haunting. He's more like a force of nature that you can't kill, but only escape from. But as epic as the conclusion is, the meandering first two thirds of the movie kind of drag it down for me. I'd be more forgiving if they made the lead character Jyn more interesting. They should've made her feel like a real rogue, like Cara Dune or a female Han Solo. Instead she spends most of the time with her head down, saying he lines quietly and often being overshadowed by her male co-stars. The worst example being when Cassian explodes at her for daring to be angry that her father died indirectly because of his actions. His defense that he's \"been in this fight since I was six years old\" is such a laughably contrived Freudian excuse that comes out of nowhere and has little to do with the argument. Especially when considering how Jyn's been in this fight since she was nine years old, except she was abandoned and left to fend for herself on the streets. And this is  never brought up! A character with such a harsh upbringing should feel more assertive rough around the edges, but instead she comes across like a frail mopey teenager that always looks constipated. The writing and direction surrounding her character felt low-key sexist to me. But I guess being a cynical rogue with a heart of gold is only cool when men do it. Many of the other characters are either bland or too over-the-top. The cameos are sometimes exciting, and other times feel so contrived and random. The only character I really stuck out to me was K2-S0, the snarky security droid. He easily had the best dialogue and was cracking me up.  So overall, I'd say this movie was quite the mixed bag for me. But the lows aren't too low and the highs are high enough to bump my score up to a 7/10, even if the highs are mostly just blatant fanservice. But I'm a Star wars fan at heart, so it touched the inner child in me that just wanted to watch starships and space wizards.",

The action is also done very well in this, and the worldbuilding is still very spectacular. About the only bad thing I can really think about this film is that there is quite a number of instances of fan service, though I think that this film handles it better than most other films do. Jones, Luna, Mendelsohn, Yen, and Tudyk are some of the better actors that really give it their all in this film. The humor is also very well and lands a majority of the time.

This movie took a risk by dispensing with the orthodox Star Wars formula by not being focused on the Skywalkers, and instead introducing a new set of main characters who all died at the end. The risk paid off. A change in pace from the normal style of Star Wars films worked well. It was nice to watch a Star Wars film without countless scenes about the force and pompous Jedi preaching. Instead we had an intertaining action film which expanded the lore of the Star Wars universe in an interesting and exciting way. The final Battle of Scarif was very well executed, with an epic space battle and a satisfying and unorthodox ending. My only issue with this film is the character of Cassian who was supposed to evoke some sort of false-equivalency between the empire and the rebellion with his stories of committing unforgivable war crimes for the rebellion. This might be a good point regarding conflicts in the real world, and it might have worked in Star Wars but it was awkwardly executed and unbelievable considering the very black and white perspective we get on good and evil in other Star Wars films.",

By the time it arrives at the familiar plot points, set pieces and characters that fans of the saga love, it becomes a white knuckle kamikaze about sacrifice for the greater good. And just when you get the lump out of your throat from the emotional impact of what just happened, the film jerks you back upright with an unexpected one-two punch. For what feels like the first time in a 40 year saga, we see what is arguably the best Darth Vader scene in the Star Wars universe- an edge of your seat look at how singularly dangerous and devastating one of the most iconic villains in cinema really is. Finally, capping off the darkest chapter in the Star Wars saga since The Empire Strikes Back, Rogue One brings things full circle by flickering a light of nostalgia and hope (okay, and fan service) that places it seamlessly into the lore literally moments from the beginning of A New Hope. Rogue One serves up drama, tragedy, loss, triumph, action, and last but not least, a tasteful seasoning of light hearted laughs without (and this is important) the price tag of any insufferably cringey or corny character(s) delivering it. It isn\u2019t a perfect film (the first half can be a bit slow at points), but it\u2019s damn good\u2026and easily in the top 3 best Star Wars films yet. If only the prequel and sequel \u201cEpisodes\u201d had been this good.",

The only thing I knew about this movie is the Darth Vader scene, and I thought if it has that scene, it must be having plenty such scenes. Turns out that scene is to this movie what Flash and Superman's slow motion fight is to Josstice League: The only one good scene in the entire movie. Most of this movie is just talking, talking and more talking.\nI won't complain about it though. I didn't know the \"We were on the verge of greatness\" meme was from this. I used to think that meme is about an agriculture scientist from Discovery telling how his experiment failed. So subsequently the \"Are we blind? Deploy the troops!\" meme also had to be from here, another one I didn't know where it was from. I ended up liking K2SO, he was my favourite character from the movie. I felt really bad seeing him die.\nThe action scenes of this movie are very good, now that I think back about it, especially the one with the blind Jedi. The scene where a droid that looked like H2SO gets shot and then the actual H2SO comes from the back saying, \"I hope you knew it was not me.\" was hilarious. But that's the only scene I remember, other than the Darth Vader scene of course. Most of the scenes from this movie are very forgettable. Out of the over 2 hour of runtime, I only remember barely 2 minutes from it combined.\nI don't see the point behind the making of this movie. It just answers a question nobody asked. I wasn't even paying attention because I was waiting for the Darth Vader scene, as I had begun thinking it isn't in this movie until the very end. I could definitely give it a rewatch whenever I get a Disney+ Hotstar connection, but that's really far from today.",

Visuals are really good though. Riz Ahmed & Whittaker are by far the best performances. Both lead actor/actors (Jones & Luna) are average at best. Another problem of mine with this movie is, that they are really trying to do a lot of story-telling, but they fail to keep me invested in it. One scene I actually liked is the Jyn speech in the council, by far the best acting from Jones. The finish is more Star Wars-like and features some really solid action.

I had a blast rewatching this. I first think I should talk about the problem most people have with it. That the characters aren't devoloped, but the thing is that it's not supposed to make you very well attacthed to the characters and its more of telling what really happened, from that one single opening title line in A new hope. The basic premis of this movie sounds great! And thanks to great directing and a good screenwriter, it made in my opinion, the best disney star wars movie. The actors do well with what they are given and have great timing, subtlety and display the faith in there characters. My biggest problem though with the movie, is that they make a lot of these characters and give the main character and her love interest a character, but not the rest which didn't make too much sense. There are times where I couldn't really follow through and the pacing could be a bit slow from time to time. I also didn't like how they put relationships in characters and gave some characters some personality and others not and just to throw it away really bothered me.

It never majorly affected my viewing experience, but I could feel it slightly dragging here and there. I also didn't like the cast on anything more than a neutral/standard level.\n\nFelicity Jones does an admirable job in the lead role, I did like how they set her story up at the beginning. I also found any scene with Mads Mikkelsen good to watch, while Riz Ahmed and Forest Whitaker are solid; Alan Tudyk is OK as well. Diego Luna and Ben Mendelsohn, however, didn't do anything for me.\n\nThe story itself is satisfactory, the ending to it is more meaningful than I was expecting and features a few nice shots; the whole film looks lovely in fairness. I personally would've shaved 10-20 minutes off the run time and got more devilish antagonists, though.\n\nStill, it's at the very least a good film no doubt.",

A well-received movie visually speaking. However, there are some wasted storylines such as why is Galen Erso so vital to the Death Star being completed? What's the story behind Saw Gerrera? Why did he leave the Alliance? That point is brought up by the movie writers that his tactics and actions caused problems for the Alliance leadership, but it is never addressed. Forrest Whittaker's performance as Gerrera seems wasted. Great seeing Vader but was his scene with Krennic needed? What was gained by it? Ultimately what is Krennic trying to accomplish in the end? Get control of the Death Star back from Tarkin? When the movie was over, I felt like I had \"checked a box\" in regards to saying I had watched the movie.

Sadly the rest of the film feels unnecessary, the purpose of the movie is to build these characters so by the final mission you are fully invested.

The characters are also actually pretty ok contrary to popular belief. I find Jyn to be a pretty tragic and interesting character and you really feel for them. They're just trying to do the right thing and even though we knew what was going to happen, I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie wondering how the hell are they going to make it out of the situation and I love how Disney took a risk and made them all die, making for a really emotional ending and that Vader scene is everything I wanted. Rogue One does drag in a couple of places (should have been 10 minutes shorter) and while the characters are ok, they are generally unmemorable and there's way too many of them but it's still a great movie (A-)",

Not the West End Games one either. You know how they go, someone always has to play a martial artist.\n\nIt's one of those frustratingly bad films where you've got competent actors, the visuals are certainly of acceptable quality and your brain is just sitting there rewriting the film as you watch it to be way more interesting. Entire plot threads are just left laying on the ground unused in favor of some random cameo of characters from 30 years ago. As a for instance towards the beginning of the film a character witness the death of their mother as a child at the hands of the forces of the antagonist. This isn't brought up again in the whole film, not even when those characters meet again in the climactic confrontation. It's basically that for 2 hours.\n\nPersonal opinion it's an easy pass for watching. Probably the worst Star Wars film and not in the Star Trek 5 kind of way where there's still an, \"We are our pain\" scene or something in it to reward the brave.",

            "content": "Admittedly, as someone that grew up with the original Star Wars Trilogy, one was a little skeptical hearing the news George Lucas had sold the rights to his space opera to Disney. The Mouse House did a fine job with The Force Awakens (2017). However, it was a gold-mine of callbacks, narratively mirroring A New Hope (1977). Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was something new and refreshing. A part of the chapter fans had only heard brief snippets of. Finally, we were going to see the group of rebels that risked their lives for the blueprints of the Death Star.\n\nOne thing I loved about Rogue One is the characters are slightly different to usual noble Jedi and smugglers we're used to seeing. These are the grunts relegated to the background in the Saga franchise. Felicity Jones (The Theory Of Everything) does a solid job as Jyn Erso. She's emotionally engaging and contains the rebellious spirit of Luke Skywalker. Diego Luna (Narcos: Mexico) is equally watchable and heroic as Cassian. The captain of Rogue One starship and secondary hero of the feature. The central trio is completed by K-2SO, brought to sardonic life by Alan Tudyk (I, Robot). K-2SO is undoubtedly the highlight. The reprogrammed Imperial droid is far more entertaining than C-3PO, R2-D2, and BB-8. Also, one would be lying if seeing Peter Cushing (Dracula) and a young Carrie Fisher on the big screen for one last hurrah didn't bring a tear to my eye.\n\nDirector Darren Edwards (Godzilla) succeeds at the daunting task of creating new characters and settings while putting together a captivating story. The new worlds we visit are vividly realised, with some beautiful cinematography to enhance their authenticity. While variations of familiar characters such as the all-black Deathtroopers create their own iconography. His use of the Death Star will leave one shaken. The grand scale of its power is fully utilised, creating a sense of dread as it looms over neighbouring planets. The final battle on the planet Scariff combines the most iconic moments of the originals. From rebel starships causing Star Destroyers to crash in to one another, to AT-AT walkers duking it out with rebels on a beach. The finale easily trumps all of Disney's entrances to the Skywalker Saga, bringing a dark and uncertain tone to its conflict. Resulting in one of the most powerful conclusions in the franchise. Rogue One bravely foes down a similar route to The Empire Strikes Back (1980), finishing on a minor key. It is an all-out war movie, and the sacrifices of the characters hammer home the significance of the battle they've fought.\n\nAlthough Rogue One begins with the familiar \"A Long Time Ago In A Galaxy Far Far Away\u2026\",  and the signature pan across a starfield. It's clear from the opening moments this is going to be a different kind of Star Wars story. It's a gritty, boots-to-the-floor war picture that often feels like a WWII or Vietnam war movie. Edwards succeeded where the prequels failed and creates one of the best Star Wars movies since Irvin Kershner's entrant. Rogue One is a thrilling cinematic experience that feels genuine and authentic to the Star Wars lore. Whilst simultaneously working as a stand-alone feature.",

The plot was very clever and actually adds context and significance to the plot of Episode IV. Unlike the Sequel Trilogy, which truly harmed the story developed in previous sagas, this movie made the Original Trilogy even better by showing you what the Rebels endured to obtain the Death Star Plans.\n\n*SPOILERS*\nAnd the idea that the flaw in the Death Star was deliberately added by someone who knew participated in the project knowing that it would be completed by someone else anyway was masterful. Having him take advantage of the confidence and trust that the Empire had in his abilities by joining the project only to sabotage it was very interesting and very clever. And this is not to mention how he must have felt, knowing that there was every chance that his exposure of the flaw would go undiscovered, and that the Death Star might go around spreading death and misery across the galaxy, never to be stopped.\n\nThe tragic ending for all of the characters also made this film a great segway between the Prequels (which were about tragedy) and the Original Saga (which was about hope). The balance between tragedy and hope is absolutely perfect in this film.\n\nSo, minor flaws aside, this is a great film, and worthy of being called 'Star Wars'.",

Darth Vader was awesome in this movie. But the CGI was awful when it came to resurrecting dead actors or making Leia young again. I will never understand why people praise the CGI on Tarkin or Leia. Leia\u2019s face didn\u2019t look right; she didn\u2019t capture Carrie Fisher\u2019s likeness, and her eyes seemed unfocused, glassy, and dead. Tarkin unfortunately looked like a video game character. When I saw this movie in theaters, I was only a casual fan and didn\u2019t know the actor was dead. I remember seeing Tarkin on screen and wondering why his skin was so rubbery and weird. If someone who doesn\u2019t know that the actor is dead (because people who knew he was dead can convince themselves it\u2019s fake anyway) can tell that something is wrong, they should fix the CGI.

All of which turn out to be normal people without The Force (a first in the movie series). This direct prequel to \"IV A New Hope\", is everything we wanted out of that plot, and more. It really improves the original film by adding new layers of depth to it.\n\nFirst, because it bothers to explain the political background of the original film, and even more impressive it manages to keep it simple, without over-explaining it. Then, it also layers of gray morality, whom add new depth to the Saga as a whole. Like \"The Last Jedi\", this films dares to question the heroes of Original Trilogy  and the Prequels, it doesn't santify them and that's why this movie is great. These people who stole the Death Star plans, all turn out to be the most flawed persons, simply looking for redemption\n\nThe Darth Vader hallway scene where he kills 30 trained rebel soldiers seems written to criticize how Kylo Ren couldn't even beat 2 untrained kids in \"VII: The Force Awakens- A New Hope the remake\".\n\nI like how the villian Krennic is a secondary villian aspiring to be a main villian. The whole reviving of Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin by CGi is weird to think about, but is really respectfully done. And enhances the character. I also really like how by the end of the film, Jyn Erso and company realize that they aren't the main characters, and they are fine with it.\n\nBringing the animated tertiary character Saw Herrera into live-action, and elevating him into a main character was such an inspired and nerdy choice. The people doing this movie really have nerd cred. Because they saw beyond the films, that's what puts Rogue One above the lazy JJ Abrams remakes, whom can't even come up with something that wasn't a remake.",

This weak story is kind of saved by the fact that it opens up many doors to new possibilities. Now, characters and minor side stories could get their own films.

This movie made me like A New Hope even more and explained a plot whole on why the death star was so easily destroyed. I like that idea of Galen giving information out to the Rebels so they can destroy the Death Star and his death was emotional. \nCons: The first two acts are very boring. Some of the characters in this movie like Gyn and Cassian are some of the least interesting characters in this franchise. Some of those were some pretty big problems for me. Grand Moff Tarkin doesn't have good CGI for him and Chronic as a villain felt a bit bland. \n\nI still like this movie a lot even though the first two acts took a lot away from this movie.

What Rogue One is to the Star Wars universe it show us that you don't need some enormous, painted costumed council, braveheart style gigantic war scenes, goofy back stories, and silly love scenes to be an epic story within an epic saga. It is a dark tale of suffering and sacrifice that doesn't end well for anyone in the movie that you have heard of before. And that is what makes it excellent. It has real impact and depth upon a surface skin we all recognize. it shows you that it's not all fun and games, and it deserves praise for being exactly that.

The Mandalorian is the only exception to that notion except that it's a television show, and equally excellent to the original 3 and Rogue One. If you haven't seen it yet, do so.

I have respect and appreciation for those both in front of and behind the camera that can honor what the essence and nature of a movie saga is without incorporating their own so called twist to it which would ultimately be corrosive to and change the feel of the story to those of us that have been on this ride for almost 40 years now.

It's a fun and more grittier adventure to the galaxy far, far away.Rogue One; like all the SW-premieres are always a fun event to experience. Fans and non-fans alike collectively get together once again for this space adventure. It's visually a big upgrade from the prequels, and it does to a certain point manage to embrace the original film's charisma. Fun, bright and enjoyable characters is a big trace -- and forget romance! This is a pure war film where companionship is everything. We follow 'Jyn Erso' and the main story is greatly focused on her, but a major letdown is the underdeveloped side-characters. They are all well presented and we get some inside to their personalities; but there's no major background nor development to characters like 'Cassian Andor'. Our main antagonist 'Orson Krennic' is very much the same. But there are some deeper layers to him, but sadly not enough to be considered a complex nor memorable villain. Because of this lack of greater depth to characters; the few emotional moments that does exist could have been even greater, because there are some great ones. The great one-liners from K-2SO is on the other hand very much appreciated, it's great that they really understand the importance of humor in the SW universe.The story that takes place is full of action, as expected -- but more importantly; the characters are the major players here. A great character-filled first act, a more passive & calmer second act, to a stunning and perhaps too massive third act -- that's Rogue One. There're many characters and places involved in this story. All of this made some of the story uneven. It kept going, from places to places, characters to characters and so on; it became an experience that's a bit too far- stretched. It lost that \"wow-factor\". The second act takes a step back and didn't impress me on a personal level. It's okay but nothing really impressive got to me. But I am confident enough to say to all the big SW-fans out there that you will definitely love this film, and yes there are some really impressive action pieces -- but I never got many \"wow moments\". It drags on and lacks a greater long-term stamina when it comes to action. When looking at the CGI; it's a major technological achievement, except for two major CGI characters that look all other than alive. They are impressive to look at; much details, but the way they interact and talk is so fake. Add a non- Williams score that's underwhelming, well the flick got flaws. But other than that I really enjoyed it!It's a good Star Wars movie. Not the best nor the worst. It got its flaws concerning the uneven storytelling and undeveloped side-characters, and some flaws are more serious than other. It's a beautiful story that's partially gritty and it got a stunning visualization of Vader. Add a darker tone, a very satisfying finale and an ending that manages to wrap everything together! That's Rogue One. It's the pure definition of rebellion.*psst don't enter this film expecting much Vader.Personal rating: 82/100 Critical rating: 70/100",

Luckily, Gareth Edwards directs 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story', a title that might put-off some fans, but the movie itself is definitely worth a watch. We meet a young girl named Jyn (Felicity Jones) who had to escape after her father, Galen (Mads Mikkelsen) is informed by Director Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) forces Galen to work on the crafting of the Death Star. After some decade and a half, Jyn meets Rebel Officer Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) and she is informed about the Death Star.She also meets a droid named K-2SO (a very funny Alan Tudyk) whose mannerisms and personality seem unusual, but helpful. They travel from planet to planet to find more clues on how to get the plans to destroy the Death Star, and they also find more characters to come and help. There is so much of this movie to talk about, but a \"Star Wars\" review can be easily spoiled, so I'm just going to summarize my thoughts on the movie. This is a really steady paced, dark and thrilling movie. The third act is one of the best third acts in any \"Star Wars\" movie, ever. The war battle that rages reminded me of the opening battle scene in 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), obviously not that violent, but for this franchise's standards, it is. There are many familiar faces that return in this movie, most notably, Darth Vader (reprising the voice of James Earl Jones), who only makes two small appearances in this movie. But, they are so great, I cannot elaborate further without spoiling it, so I'll leave it there. This movie, which takes place before the events of 'Star Wars: A New Hope' (1977), really relies mostly on story as opposed to character. You get to know a lot about Jyn, a little bit about Cassian and K-2SO... but the rest are kind of glossed over as far as development goes. Director Gareth Edwards did a capable job of actually making this feel like a \"War\" movie, whereas the other movies were a space-opera spectacle. The first two acts are a little pacey here and there... but that third act is truly one of the best highlights for this entire franchise.",

The direction feels very different at first, feeling more handheld at not super Star Wars-esque because of its grittier more grounded style, but this is great and works for the film. It ends up making it feel like a real war and struggle for the rebellion and it ends up changing later towards the end in tonal shift and direction to blend into A New Hope.Pacing is a little odd at first, but the first section is interesting enough to keep you very invested, especially with all the character introductions. The second act is a littler quieter and a bit of a lull but still has enough going on and differs itself from the rest of the film to keep it fresh. The last section is an intense all out action masterpiece, and really gives a space feeling of something similar to the end battle of Saving Private Ryan. Characters are well enough written for you to enjoy and like them all, however they are a little underdeveloped for the most part and you end up wanting more from them. This ends up not hindering the film too much since the film is a standalone. This film does carry itself well, it knows when to be dark without over doing it and changes location at a nice rate with a clear understanding of where and what folk are doing.This also the first film where Darth Vader is actually fully terrifying, he is almost like an insanely powerful sci fi MikeMyers. Even thoug he isn\u2019t in it much, his presence is palpable.The good thing about Rogue One also is that it doesn\u2019t try to keep using nostalgia to interest its viewers (which TFA did a lot) but does have plenty of nice little easter eggs.The droid K2SO in the film is also the comic relief of it, but whilst a few jokes hit the mark a lot are unnecessary and too forced in, and there is (like TFA) a lot of cheesy 2016 throwaway jokes just put in there. Disney need to learn to restrain themselves from certain jokes, and when they do put them in they need to understand when to end the joke and how to fully have them come across.Last two complaints, the new score for the film is cheesy and doesn\u2019t fit the film at all, and really takes away from it as a whole sadly. Dubbing John Williams over it would be very cheap, but to be honest it would probably make the film feel more epic and fit more. There is also some questionable CGI characters in the film which just look unnatural in the film but still don\u2019t ruin it too much.Overall, this film diverges enough away from Star Wars to make it feel fresh but also very nicely connects itself to the original trilogy. Action is awesome yet characters are a little underdeveloped, special effects are gorgeous but score is disappointing. It is a tragic war film set in the Star Wars universe, and Gareth Edwards did something brave with what he had.Bravo to you sir.8/10",

It has an uneven, and somewhat uninteresting beginning, a fun but rather incongruous middle, and a spectacular end. Along the way, it both suffers and benefits from the world in which it's set.Rogue One is a unique journey through a very familiar world. It has everything you'd hope to see in a Star Wars movie - space battles, stormtroopers, new alien races, lovable droids, rogues turned heroes. Yet it still manages to feel fresh and different from the rest. I personally felt that this was one of the film's strengths, that it was something different. However, the film also pays a little too much homage to Star Wars: A New Hope, its immediate successor in the Star Wars chronology. There are several character from the original film who appear in Rogue One, a couple of whom are digitally rendered. It doesn't work. At all. It's rather unsettling to look at, and I'd much prefer they just recast those roles if they're set on using those characters.Once the film builds momentum, it's delightful to watch. The humor is great, the action is thrilling, and there are some genuinely real character moments. Sadly, the film is also punctuated throughout with heavy-handed attempts to inspire (you've never heard the word \"hope\" used so many times in a single screenplay). And there is an evil lair which is laughably on the nose. It couldn't get more stereotypically cartoonish.Despite its faults, Rogue One is a great time. It's definitely worth seeing in the theaters, but be aware: it might be a little intense for young kids.",

The general consensus of last years Force Awakens was that the spirit of the original trilogy returned. However, the problem with Episode VII is in how the spirit is captured identically. In having returned so reverently, the franchise needed to display a willingness to tinker. Enter the newest cinematic addition to Star Wars. Rogue One is a balanced movie of hope and despair. The last Star Wars movie to find this magical balance in tone is The Empire Strikes Back. Likewise, Rogue One finds a unique synergy between old and new. The first anthology Star Wars movie works in its inevitable lead-in to an almost forty-year-old classic with a sense of invigoration. The movie smartly covers up modern filmmaking conventions with amazing throwbacks to the original trilogy. Seventies style facial hair can still be found on the Rebel pilots while a few smart cameos make the Star Wars initiated feel at home. The amount of Star Warsness to the film allows director Gareth Edwards to comfortably recton A New Hope. A problem with Rogue One is how the film can only be best enjoyed by a Star Wars fan. Rogue One is a decent enough war movie. The dogfights are exciting. The characters are charming and funny enough. The overall plot can\u2019t be fully enjoyed without having seen A New Hope. In addition, the cinematic impact the film has on the future of this storied franchise also can't be appreciated by an outsider. Rogue One features the most diverse cast of any Star Wars movie... as well as the franchises more intense scenes. The mentioned scenes make up some of the best moments in a Star Wars movie to date. Rest assured the future of the franchise is in the very capable hands of Disney. Rouge One is how a franchise should make the old relevant.",

I agree character and pacing is a bit off, but I think people forget that Star Wars never really had great character development to begin with but rather great actors giving a really good performance (ie Harrison Ford's lines a lot of his one-liners were ad lib). My personal gripe with this film is probably that a lot of the characters felt a bit tagged on - like the blind dude etc, and some of the choices they do (ie in the ending) feels forced and illogical -and could have been written better in terms of what happens to them. The ending is rather unambiguous and a certain CGI character appears too much and does something at the end for no reason (only to ensure there won't be a sequel). Also Gareth Edwards could've shot some of the action scenes better and give some character's a proper arc which was lacking. Lack of a crawl and insistence of using location cards were a bit off-putting.However Rogue One has the best world building, plot development, costume design, lighting and story flow out of the other Star Wars films. The film doesnt rely on wipes to get to one place to another which is great. Rogue one also have amazing action sequences and impeccable sound design. All the locations feel like real worlds compared to Force Awaken (which felt like small set designs). Although the score lacked more distinguishable motifs, I thought it flowed really well with the action o the films - and more of the traditional motifs were integrated well.  Overall I thought Rogue One was a better Star Wars film than TFA and maybe even ROTJ, only because the world building and action was impeccable.",

I read a lot of reviews before I actually went and saw this film. So while reading these reviews I was beginning to become skeptical myself, they ranted and raved about how the Disney keeps introducing planets and characters that they want us to fall in love with or force upon us and have never heard of. This is a side story all on it's own, so we are going to meet characters that we don't know, we are going to see planets that we haven't seen before, and that is ok.\"Rogue One\" is probably the best Star Wars film since \"The Empire Strikes Back\", it leaves us right where it is supposed to chronologically in the saga. It has you pulling and falling in love with all the characters for the most part. The little cameos that we see here and there are well placed to give you that little nostalgia feeling.If we all remember in \"Episode IV: A New Hope\" where the leader of the Rebel Alliance Mon Mothma says that a lot of people had lost their lives to recover these plans. Well \"Rogue One\" is the story behind what she was talking about.Jyn Erso the daughter of Galen Erso, was played by Felicity Jones, an English actress known for playing the role of Jane Hawking in the film \"The Theory of Everything\" in 2014. I am sure now she will be known as the actress who starred in \"Rogue One\". She played the role with poise and gumption, bringing the character to life with the strength that her character stood for in the saga. We first meet her character at an adult age when she has already been captured by Imperials and is then \"liberated\" by members of the Rebel Alliance. Those Rebels would be Cassian Andor and K-2SO played by Diego Luna and the delightful Alan Tudyk. Diego Luna plays a rough around the edges and very secretive scoundrel role in this film, where you don't know if he is good guy or bad guy, while Alan Tudyk plays his sarcastic and very blunt comedic sidekick that is sure to leave you laughing and begging for more.If you are going to go see this film, keep an open mind that this is a story that we knew little of, and that Disney did a great job bringing this story to life and giving us more of an insight on what the Rebel Alliance went through to overcome the great evil that was the Empire.This movie isn't meant to be compared to any of the other episodes that we have seen in previous years. It is to tell the prequel story of the most beloved Trilogy of all time. So don't go to this film with doubts, go to see this film with the hopes to catch a glimpse of something you have never seen before, there are no preconceptions of what to think, because this is a whole brand new story, so you can take it for what it is for, a wonderfully filmed movie, with characters you can connect with for the first and (spoiler alert) the last time.The film has everything, AT-AT's, AT-ST's, sarcastic droids, Dog Fights, real plot lines and a grand finish! A must see in theaters, don't wait to Redbox this movie, you need to go see it in theaters to appreciate it's full value.I hope this review was helpful, and I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did.Vader is still a beast!-Devin of All Things Nerdy",

The use of the CGI was unexpeted but welcomed.All in all, this movie is a must for a Star Wars fan.For non fan, compare it the Saving the Private Ryan with lasers :)",

I'll explain.Firstly, a lot of what makes Star Wars, Star Wars, is absent.  No Jedi vs Sith light saber fights here.  No Jedi at all actually.  Vader is a fun presence in the movie, while he's on screen for all of 5 minutes in a 2 hour movie, but he's only in it for 5 minutes.  There's a lot of little references to A New Hope, that I'm sure fans enjoyed, but they're pretty forced.Jedi aside, one of my favorite things about the original trilogy was the banter between Leia and Han.  Nothing really resembling that here.  Or the daring getaways in the millennium falcon.... again, not really.What there is here, is a by the numbers simple rebel rebellion war movie, crippled by a need to give constant nostalgic nods to better movies of the past, and a PG-13 rating.  I hear people calling this one \"gritty\".  Compared to what exactly?  Certainly not compared to an actual war movie, like this is doing a poor job of trying to mimic.  Gritty compared to a Disney cartoon?  Well, maybe not even that.  No cussing, no blood, no dark references of any kind... This is a wannabe war movie sanitized for little kids.That's a problem, however, since the first 2 thirds of the movie involves a LOT of standing around talking, nothing happening, with boring characters.  Children will be bored.  Very bored.  Adults who aren't huge Star Wars fans should be bored.  It's a stupid predictable plot, with paper thin characters, and bad dialogue.  Trying to end on a positive note.... There was a good scene with Vader (about 3 minutes long), that I enjoyed, and K-2SO can be pretty funny sometimes.  So, about maybe 10 minutes of good stuff in this 2 hour movie for this guy.  What do I have this at?  A 4?  Thinking about this better, lets lower that down a notch.  A 3.  For the 3 good minutes that had Vader doing cool stuff.",

What I just saw blew me away. What I came out of was \"Star Wars\" at it's best. \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" is, IMHO, now the TRUE best Star Wars film since \"The Empire Strikes Back\". Set before the original \"Star Wars\" from 1977, this film shows us a true WAR in \"Star Wars\" by having spies of the Rebel Alliance go up against the evil Galactic Empire to steal the plans to their original Death Star. And, since Gareth Edwards, the director of this movie, really wanted to deliver a war film set in the Star Wars universe, akin to \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Black Hawk Down\", he was telling the truth coming out of what I saw. It really feels like a Star Wars movie in a whole new way. I will admit that I enjoyed \"The Force Awakens\", but, after a while, I've come to realize that while it is watchable, it feels safe in some ways. This one, really showed how original, different and new it was while being familiar when it knew too and it payed off big time in what I consider it's most serious, if not darkest, Star Wars ever. The entire cast of this movie shines. Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso, our lead hero with strong brashness but such vulnerability you can't help but feel bad for her when you see how things play out for her in the film, especially with her father Galen (played by the always devious yet charming Mads Mikkelsen). Diego Luna puts effort into his role as Cassian Andor and makes it as memorable as his character's arc in the film is. Riz Ahmed really shows how conflicted his character, Bodhi Rook, is as he delivers playing a former Imperial cargo worker now struggling to redeem himself. Donnie Yen,\" and Jiang Wen are awesome as the pair of Force-believing warrior Chirrut Imwe and trigger-happy gun-wielding Baze Malbus. And, Alan Tudyk as the sarcastic reprogrammed droid K-2SO rounds out the cast to help make this movie work in their best way and they all get moments to shine in such iconic ways. Ben Mendohlson really showed his determination playing Orson Krennic in a different kind of villain for \"Star Wars\" to show. Darth Vader when he shows up really shows in this time where the film is set, he really is the Vader everyone grew up with. But, I cannot get off the hook without saying how impressed I am by Forest Whitaker's performance of my most anticipated character from this movie, Saw Gerrera from \"Star Wars: The Clone Wars\". While he was in this movie for more or less of what I expected, Forest Whitaker REALLY got into character as Saw and portrayed him in all the ways he was portrayed when we first saw him in \"The Clone Wars\". Also, if you generational Star Wars fans are hoping for ties to the Prequel Trilogy instead of just the Originals, well you're in luck, as we get appearances of not just characters and actors from the Prequels but also planets from the Prequels as well. We also visit new planets that help expand many parts of the Star Wars mythology such as where people stand in believing the Force and what it took to build the Death Star. Plus, be on the lookout for appearances and mentions of certain characters and ships from \"Star Wars Rebels\", which you can watch on Disney XD, when it returns with new episodes in January. Also, two important characters from the Original Trilogy make a return in some of the most well-made VFX ever put to film. I'm not spoiling who they are, so, you'll just have to watch for yourself. And, you'll feel like you're part of the action especially once you get to the epic space battle in the climax of the movie. Finally, Michael Giacchino really delivered with his score for this movie that really brings out the action and emotional development these characters go through to complete their mission as well as bringing something new to score in \"Star Wars\" while sprinkling familiar scores when needed. Overall, if you're looking for a phenomenal \"Star Wars\" film, \"Rogue One\" is that. It truly delivers on taking huge risks, like abandoning the traditional opening crawl, and finding its place into the \"Star Wars\" universe while remaining a standalone movie that really doesn't need to setup anything for the future of \"Star Wars\". And, that's good. I hope this movie is successful enough to do more riskier Star Wars spinoffs, especially if Episode IX is the last of the core Star Wars saga. I hope you all love this film, because I most certainly did. This film is for all generations of Star Wars fans. Go see it. You'll be glad you did. 5 stars. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f10/10",

With almost documentary-like camerawork, this is the most handheld Star Wars film by far, offering a more grounded and realistic feel, but the dialogue can feel cheesy and cliche at times. Very well shot but also very imperfectly shot, this film looks flat-out gorgeous. The editing can be a little choppy at times though, but that isn\u2019t anywhere near as distracting as the CGI version of Grand Moff Tarkin, as well as some other CGI characters. Which brings me to my biggest gripe - The characters. Likeable, funny, but that\u2019s about it - They lack any depth, background, or proper development, and we aren\u2019t given any reason to care for them. Director Orson Krennic is an extremely weak villain and doesn\u2019t even compare to Darth Vader, who was only in TWO SCENES. This wouldn\u2019t have been as much of a complaint if the rest of the characters were more interesting, but it still would\u2019ve been a stupid choice. The first act of the movie is quite messy, and feels like a series of loosely tied together scenes, jumping from location to location too quick and repetitively. There isn\u2019t really much else for me to say about the rest of the movie apart from the last act, which is a long if not too long action sequence, and although VERY entertaining and brilliantly directed, it has endless cliches and does get repetitive after awhile. Lacking any suspense that the previous Star Wars excelled at, this is a fun, decent ride with incredible effects but it is a very disappointing installment to the Star Wars franchise. I don\u2019t see there being any replay value either. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story gets a 6 out of 10. It\u2019s decent.",

Anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of the series will know where it is heading from the introduction of Felicity Jones, as Jyn Erso who is the daughter of scientist Galen played, by Mads Mikkelsen. Without giving away any plot if the daughter had listened to the father about a mistake he made on purpose the picture would have been only an hour instead of the 2 hour 13 minute running time.The movie has more wars than all the Star Wars pictures combined plus one of the loudest soundtracks heard in a long time. The CGI effects are out of this world, no pun intended, and in some cases amazing as an actor who has been dead over 22 years is very much alive, another looks 40 years younger and another who is in their 80s sounds like a teenager! They are the set up for the very first Star Wars movie ever made though the ending leaves nothing in doubt.I wasn't familiar with many of the leading actors but I was impressed with Donnie Yen as a blind monk, Wen Jiang as a warrior, Riz Ahmed a pilot and Diego Luna as one of the leading rebels. Oh yes, a nod of the head to Alan Tudyk for the wisecracking 7-8 foot droid K-2SO. Forest Whitaker is wasted in a cameo which really has nothing to do with what the screenplay by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy is heading for and director Gareth Edwards is all over the screen in the action scenes and only hits the warmer minutes towards the end of the film.Oh I forgot to mention Ben Mendelsohn's villain maybe because he is forgettable?I am not a fan of Star Wars or sci-fi films and told Allen he is on his own for future Star Wars films.Unless you are a fanatical fan of the series or a couple of CGI effects regarding people I would suggest staying away.",

Disney isn't even pretending anymore that this whole project isn't just a cash grab on their part (why cast 2 famous Chinese actors and barely use them? Gotta get that foreign box office!). The story adds little if anything to the universe, frankly it clashes badly with the tone and themes of the original trilogy. The action is dull and same-y; I never really felt worried about what would happen next, even when characters were actually getting killed. Above all it's virtually impossible to invest in the characters or care what happens to them, partly because they're bland and poorly developed, and especially because we've all seen this stock lineup of Hollywood-diverse plucky underdogs a million times before (fighting white male Space Nazis of course. Whether Marvel or Star Wars or whatever, these days the enemy must always be white male Nazis) and it's beyond a cliche at this point. Note how even positive reviewers all admit that the most likeable character was the droid. Felicity Jones was especially awful, a scowling, frigid blank slate light-years away from the feisty, vivacious Princess Leia of the original movies. She gives pop culture heroines a bad name.The bit at the end about struggling to get a signal and transmit a file was especially embarrassing. So cliched you half expect it's about to turn into a Verizon ad.I think the NY Times said it best: \"the only force here is force of habit\". The whole reason Disney bought this franchise (because apparently \"Star Wars\" is now something you can just buy like an old couch on Craigslist) is because they know people are so addicted to the brand that they'll line up at the theater even if their new movies are mediocre.

The charactersMovie is LOONG and boring, you will literally be sitting in the theater for an hour and a half before the movie starts picking up and getting decent. I will say this about the actual movie, I'm not going to include spoilers. The characters aren't going to grow on you, this is not an \"Epic tale\", you probably won't remember the character's names a month from now after seeing this movie.  This is not Starwars,this is not the franchise we grew up on. And thats why I'm giving this movie a bad review, I'm not going to give it a \"Free pass\" just because it's starwars. Also with that being said, most of the people that I know personally that like the movie are pure George Lucas haters, they hate everything George Lucas did, and love everything he didn't do. They couldn't name one thing they really loved about the movie other than the action towards the end/the ending.  I can't name a single thing I personally liked other than the action, so Hence the 3/10 score.  FAILAs a side note I will say this is how I personally rank the SWs movies. 1-8 1 being the best1.) A New Hope   2.) The Empire Strikes back3.) Return of the Jedi4.)Revenge of the Sith5.)The Force Awakens6.)The Phantom Menace7.)Star Wars Rogue One8.)The Clone WarsI am an avid Starwars fan, and to be honest Rogue on had less going for it than Clone Wars. The characters were that bad and they just couldn't convince me enough through poor acting (With a few major exceptions), and a poor/poorly written plot to care about them. I mean this is my personal opinion, I'm not telling you to not watch the movie, you should just lower your expectations so you won't be disappointed, or you might even like it more than you expected you would, the action scenes are great, but lets be real here if thats all it takes to make a good movie Taken 1/2 would be 8-9/10s.",

But as a movie all its own, as the Star Wars Story it's meant to be, it does fall a tad short on what could've been a very interesting solo Star Wars tale. It's intentions are good, it's build-up is strong, but the movie lacks focus or coherence for the first hour or so. But once our characters begin to set out on the mission of their lives, the gears amp up and so does the emotion. Rogue One goes out like some beautifully tragic pre-movie to a video game, in the most epic fashion imaginable. Including an escape sequence involving an iconic character, that's made to shock your nerves. But outside of it's final lap, Rogue One doesn't really have that appeal or rewatchable quality to it you'd think it'd easily have. Only for its send-off experience, but the movie as a whole as a story, and as an experience is all about the ending and not so much about it's foundation.",

Rogue One has completely changed my mind on that. One can make a case that the first 30 minutes of the movie are a bit forgettable but ultimately they create the groundwork for the rest of the film, which connects phenomenally with Episode 4's first moments. Where Rogue One succeeds over Episode 7 is the visceral feel of the film. This is absolutely a space epic with futuristic technology and tons of gloss but somehow it all comes off with a little grit and loads more adventure than last year's Episode 7. Rogue One shows that there are stories worth telling in between the major events seen in each Episode film. Even if you're not an avid Star Wars fan, you can appreciate what Rogue One is, but tuned-in fans will love seeing several familiar faces of the early Rebellion.

Starting with this one, Disney took it upon itself to purvey an annual movie within litigating film release schedule. Kathleen Kennedy and formidable crew of the factory covet with making an empirical universe about the preternatural galaxy far, far away; and to achieve this, they have concluded to try its luck with Edwards' war experiment in order to elucidate whether it is beneficial to create a line of independent events out of the Skywalker family. \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" opens by far a feasible wave of dissimilar films of a galactic anthology while focusing and securing its strongest point in the director's fervent declaration: war film which does not drink neither George Lucas' nor J. J. Abrams' lymph for manufacturing a deferential, nostalgic, cogitative, and sometimes dispiriting extension in Star Wars mythology.Its narrative component emulates the scale clich\u00e9s of the original trilogy: a princess, a robot, a misanthrope, a strife between the dark side and the light side and of course display of spaceships assailing each other. Conversely, this compact design takes risks as for inquiring into primitive and uncommon perspectives, which foster a fortification of a deeper concept around mythology. And although as a last resort is a war celluloid more than remarkable\u2014in spite of it merely sketches certain characteristics and focuses its plausible references in \"The Dirty Dozen\" (1967) by Robert Aldrich\u2014does not manage to be a corporeal Star Wars movie since it's constantly held on by fan service and generates a quite primary treatment to the development. A prime look to unfamiliar areas from a standpoint's as ordinary as opposed, a wit tinged of tribulation and grief and one of the most honorable final thirds in a blockbuster in recent times are the unforeseen top ambitions by the filmmaker.It takes place before the events of \"Episode IV,\" \"Rogue One\" came up from a shallow idea of visual effects supervisor and CCO at Industrial Light & Magic John Knoll, which consisted in clarifying the time- space around what was the itinerary of the Death Star plans until being in Princess Leia Organa's hands , route somewhat named in \"A New Hope\". So this is the story of those ordinary beings who achieved the extraordinary. Innocent Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) opens with a retrospective scene about her girlhood, underlined by tragedy and misfortune. Thereon, it introduces her as a redeemed prisoner who is moved to a Rebel Alliance HQ. There, a transcendental mission has commended her in order to make contact with his fading father for locating and discovering the nature and the place of a substantially powerful weapon. Ordinary people clan gradually takes form, finding its cardinal mover into the force. Although the fabled team bounces from a planet to another for terminating its commission, we figured out exiguous details about the crew captained by Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) \u2014who made me very proud;\u2014likewise, most fans clamor for more background in Saw Gerrera's story, the leader of the Onderon rebels. Despite the fact that the depth was an authentic reverb, character designs and performances are what many fans were waiting for. Displaying a heterogeneous and multicultural acting cast, which delves into each contemporary civilization, the film takes advantage of the cultural range to generate a vast human-racial universe inside its world, in the same way, each performer gets its moment of glory before the decisive and evocative ending. Their performances made the audience proud, so much so that was ineluctable not yell in the credits of the motion picture.More suitable for adults than infants, more suitable for warsies than mass audiences. If it were action and conflagration scenes, the near-perfect third act would lead the film to the sublime, sadly, its burning and high-octane last forty minutes aren't enough to keep afloat lack of enthusiasm and the multiplicity of the beginning and exposition, opportunities lacking in momentum and vigor that exclusively are notable for performances and special effects. In time record, Giacchino composed an entrancing, nostalgic and fortifying soundtrack, which is assembled with the dark tone of each frame, also it testifies him as the first author in breaking John Williams' musical canon. \"Rogue One\" is more a war product, in where its spectacular music, sparkling performances, and nearly excellent action sequences invade unexplored lands and nothing irreverent in Star Wars world, also, the film gives a message of hope and encourages all us, who this year lost a great woman: imposing Carrie Fisher.

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI find it amazing so many people like and even love this movie.The worst problem it has is characterization. In a movie in which the main themes are heroism, villainy and the clash between two opposite forces representing antagonist ideals, it is impossible for me to get involved with characters this flat, uninteresting and with no sort of interaction amongst themselves. Aside from that, as far as storytelling goes, the movie is very clumsy, going from one scene to next with no connecting threads or imaginative way to link the set pieces together. Showing you the name of the planet where the action was going to take place was a bad joke and the most witless technique i have seen in my life. Then there is the fan service. This is probably the worst part, because they put in characters that didn\u00b4t do anything important and weren\u00b4t really a part story just to make fans happy, they did the same in The Force Awakens, but at least there they made them do something. The worst of all was the final scene with Darth Vader slaughtering rebels and people applauding it, when he is the bad guy, but of course, they didn\u00b4t give a hoot about the good guys in the movie, they just wanted to see the iconic Star Wars characters in action not caring a bit about how little sense it all made in terms of storytelling.I could write for hours about all the flaws in this movie in terms of bad pacing, boring dialogue, and complete lack of imagination in execution.Overall, I don\u00b4t think it\u00b4s a terrible movie, it\u00b4s just a completely uninspired, average sci-fi film with really good visual effects that takes advantage of Star Wars iconography to seduce non critical masses. But it really gets on my nerves when people say this is better than The Force Awakens and even the original trilogy, cause it\u00b4s not, it is one of the worst Star Wars movies along with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nLike many people, I went to rewatch this after being let down by The Last Jedi, and boy, did I forget how much I enjoyed this film. It's basically a war movie set in the Star Wars universe, and as such isn't limited by the trappings of a Star Wars movie (no opening scrawl! No Jedi or lightsaber battles - the closing scene is an exception, but more on that later) and I remember thinking this film represented so much potential for the Star Wars license now out of Lucas's restrictive hands - imagine, an entire universe of Star Wars stories being told on the big screen without being tied down by the restrictions of a main \"Star Wars\" Episode. Rogue One is a great start to this Anthology universe.Spoilers abound!THE GOOD: Yes, there are a lot of characters, and some have criticised that we don't have time to get to know them before they all die horribly and hence the deaths aren't emotional for us - but I didn't feel that way. I thought the characters worked - Jyn was a strong female protagonist who clearly had chemistry with her father Galen, Cassian served his purpose, and Chirrut and Baze were standouts to me (even though a great many stormtroopers had to play into the stereotype and die stupidly to establish Chirrut's awesomeness). I fell for K2SO - he grew on me and his end was tragic (perhaps biased by my fondness for Alan Tudyk and his character's equally tragic end on 'Serenity'). The crew's deaths worked for me, because I felt I grew to know them enough over the course of the movie to care about them - I know this wasn't the case for everyone. When Cassian tells Bodhi the pilot \"You're our only way out of here\" before the final battle on Scarif, I thought this was going to be another happy-ending no-stakes Rebel tale - didn't see the grim ending coming until K-2SO took a blaster bolt to the chest.Darth Vader in the hallway at the end - sweet Christmas. I swear there was a mass orgasm in the cinema when that scene happened, and I'm not ashamed to admit I was part of it. Yes, shameless fan service - but it worked very, very well. The OG stormtroopers, Imperial sets and the Death Star also scratched many nostalgia itches for me.Original Trilogy cameos - I felt these were more than fan service since Rogue One was supposed to be a prequel to A New Hope. I'll admit I'm big on nostalgia so all the cameos worked for me - I was overjoyed at Grand Moff Tarkin and even loved Dr Evazan and Ponda Baba (more poignant as Dr Evazan's actor passed away shortly after my viewing).Finally, the cinematography in this film was amazing (one of The Last Jedi's strongest points as well). The wide shots of the Star Destroyer over Jedha City, the Scarif beach, the Death Star ominously peeking over the horizon, the view of Scarif from space through the Rebel flagship's floor, the space battle itself - I found it all breathtaking.THE BAD:Krennic as a villain served his purpose, but I felt he was underused. In the iTunes extras, director Gareth Edwards explains he couldn't make Vader or Tarkin the villain because they had plot armour and clearly survive the movie - this is probably why they had to cook Krennic up. Mendelsohn does a good job but is clearly upstaged by Vader and Tarkin whenever they are onscreen.Forest Whitaker was wasted as Saw Guerrera, I feel - this character has a far more interesting arc in the Clone Wars and Rebels animated series, which explores his fanaticism and his hatred for what the Empire did to his sister. In this film he was a plot device.I'm all for diversity in film - but while watching this film I could tell that the diversity was inserted on purpose. Not a bad thing, but it felt a little forced.As with all Star Wars films, suspension of disbelief is required - stormtroopers still can't shoot for nuts, a whole battalion of them are defeated by a blind man with a stick in the beginning but by the end of the film they are a credible threat to a well-armed band of Rebels.THE VERDICT: A thoroughly enjoyable film, and well worth Disney buying the franchise in my opinion (The Last Jedi notwithstanding). Spells a lot of potential for future Star Wars Anthology films - here's hoping Solo lives up to the mark.",

Check out my review of the latter, if you can find it.>What's Rogue One (RO) like?: Story-wise, it's like other past films where the protagonists had to risk their lives to infiltrate the opposite side so as to steal something, except that here, there are also spaceships and lasers... It was better than TFA, but it also has several problems. >Pros: >1. TFA broke many of the conventions and principles behind how The Force works and how things work in general! For no apparent reason, Rey knew how to pilot a complex spaceship and how to fight with a lightsaber without having been trained on either task beforehand. (This is all down to JJ Abrams. On Star Trek (2009) it was inspiring, but Into Darkness and TFA just made me question his destructive creativity. His earlier films were also quite unruly. I've decided to never watch his films again.)  RO avoids this by not invoking the use of the force that often. Most events made sense. This film is a fitting addition to the Star Wars Expanded Universe.>2. The battle scene on Scarif was nice. >Cons:>1. RO is only slightly better than TFA. The story is less contrived than in TFA. However, it was still rather ridiculous that our heroes need to travel to so many places and to go through so many hoops to get the jobs done. Some parts seemed drawn out. >2. Apart from Jyn, the other main characters were not developed sufficiently, in the rush to show the action scenes. >3. The actor playing Commander Krennic seemed to be over-acting, all the time. He was unnecessarily angry and devilish all of the time.>4. The CGI in this film has some significant flaws. The Star Destroyers look like Lego pieces when in front of a bright background, while the fully computer-generated Grand Moff Tarkin looked... computer-generated. The eyes! You have to sort out the problem with the static eyes!  The production had $200m and these problems were not solved?>5. I thought the destruction of Alderaan in ANH was the first time the Death Star fired its main laser and destroyed a planet? In ANH, Grand Moff Tarkin said, \u201cPrincess Leia, before your execution, I\u2019d like you to join me for a ceremony that will make this battle station operational\u2026 In a way, you have determined the choice of the planet that is to be destroyed FIRST. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan.\u201d Furthermore, Obi-Wan only felt the pain from the destruction of Alderaan and not from any moon or planet before that. The firing of the main laser in RO was not mere a test. Has this film created a continuity error? >6. The new musical score was a strange and horrible choice. The score rises to a crescendo in a haphazard way and then abruptly drops and goes all over the place. Which inexperienced composer was hired to do this? A Golden Raspberry Award is coming up.> 7. There was no need to show Leia at the end of RO. (It is not a spoiler that she's coming up next in ANH.) The CGI was inadequate and the scene should have been left out.>How would the different age groups rate it?Children: ExcellentTeenagers: ExcellentYoung adults: ExcellentMedium age adults: GoodOld adults: Average.My rating: 4/5 (no half scores).

The characters are ok, but not great. This is both a plus and a minus to the movie. Part of the reason I did not like TFA is that the characters were overly dominant to the movie. If you didn't like Finn or Rey the movie was hard to watch. None of the Rogue One characters stand out either way. No one really bothered me, but I also didn't care about any of them in any significant way. The movie is almost a paint by numbers remake of a half dozen WWII movies. I however liked this to a certain degree. I left thinking the movie did its job. It told a one off story that was engaging but not over the top.

No, it's not as good as The Force Awakens - its characters are kind of flat and it's nowhere near as fun. But after giving it a second viewing, Rogue One is honestly pretty good to me now. It's far from perfect, but it's a decent enough Star Wars experience with very strong visuals, great action scenes and a dark tone. What it lacks, unfortunately, is the colourful spark and charm that TFA provided. Too many scenes from Rogue One feel like a soap opera and it can come across as miserable and boring at times.

The slow start just allows the movie to climb to infinite heights. Great acting all around from both the Rebel and Empire core cast. most people complain about the CGI Peter Cushing, but I honestly thought he was still alive cause the CGI was so convincing overall (Leia...maybe not so much, slightly more noticeable). The action was dirty, yet strategic, like the space battles back in Return of the Jedi or The Battle of Hoth in Empire Strikes Back. Made it feel just like a classic star wars movie, even more so than The Force Awakens did. Though the first act may chug a little on first viewing, it has a much less severe effect on second viewing.

It delves straight into a frantic affair rather than the slow crawl of subtext that appear throughout the series.There is a lack of screen wipes during scene changes, this might sound like a small detail, but in the grand scheme of Star Wars movies, this has always been a staple that felt extremely jarring for a first time viewing.It\u2019s these small details that don\u2019t feel familiar which will have people annoyed or at least scratching their heads.Also Darth Vader makes a pun. No, that should never happen again.That being said, I appreciate the movie nonetheless.This movie is not afraid to take risks and I greatly respect that.While the previous filming  decisions seem a bit jarring, many of the other changes to the Star Wars formula feel like a welcome addition to the universe.The Rebel Alliance is shown to be something other than an angelic being to rid the galaxy of the big bad guys.They make deals with extremists, fight guerrilla wars and hide within civilian populations. I love the expansion of ideals and it even warrants the idea that some were even content or happy with the empire in comparison.The agents and main characters aren\u2019t necessarily the good guys, they are just fighting for what they believe in. Many of them even fight for what the viewer may perceive as the wrong reasons, but the right cause.There is so much in this movie that makes the conflict and galaxy feel more real than the main series.Especially the third act, which is hands down the best part of the movie.The final battle was magnificent from beginning to end, it felt like watching the Vietnam War in space. That is about the best thing I could ever imagine.I could have had the entire movie be the story be about some random soldiers on this battlefield and it might have actually been a better film.Unfortunately because of the highs of the third act it makes the first two acts look weak in comparison.The film has some major pacing issues in the first act. Nothing quite seemed to flow properly and getting all the information before the film moved along to the next scene was challenging.It feels like first portions of the movie were solely there to get towards the final act. That inherently makes it less fun to experience.The film needed a couple more relaxed moments for the characters to build who they were for each other.\n\nThey never quite felt like they cared for each other which in a movie about a squad of characters is really needed.\n\nThe best comparison I can make is to Guardians of The Galaxy. The characters never had that moment of interaction that made them bond together through exploits which Guardians of The Galaxy pulled off with flying colors.\n\nThis movie needed that to really put the exclamation point on the third act.\n\nIn summary, I enjoyed the hell out of Rogue One despite some pacing issues and lack of character empathy.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t enjoy The Force Awakens because it felt like a retread of the original film, this will likely be a much more enjoyable affair.\n\nAs a movie, it feels like a fresh take on the Star Wars universe. While that doesn\u2019t always work the way intended, it sets up the ability for other directors and filmmakers in the future to do the same. I greatly respect that idea and look forward to see what is next.\n\nView the video version of this review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGi71YjuxQA",
