            "content": "After watching this film and seeing both sides of the argument. I was left (again) on the fence but a little bit to the good side. A pretty interesting purge parody movie, about a family moving to Beverly Hills during the purge and then getting ransacked.Obviously people will argue that this film is \"racist\", as per usual, and to some extent it kind of is, and obviously during the purge, everyone wants to kill them. But because its a comedy film, we should take everything as satire with a pinch of salt. From my point of view, its a funny comedy that made me laugh quite a lot, and i see no downside apart from the alleged \"racism\". This means, its not for everyone.But at the end of the day, my words to you are: If your easily offended, don't watch it. If your not, then why not give it a shot?",

Parody movies are literally designed to not be a good movie. The only thing it's for is to make you laugh. Everyone knows this so why every time a new one is made people expect more? Honestly these type of movies are for people who like to laugh and usually don't care how it turns out. I understand some of you may feel if it's a theatrical release then it should be at least worth the money but it's very hard to please everyone when it comes to music and art and it has always come down to a preference thing. I am giving this a 10 out of 10 because it made me laugh the whole time and that's all these movies are made for. I expected nothing else from it and I got nothing else from it.There was no great story line or amazing actors just good Ole parody humor.",

            "content": "So Meet the blacks is a parody of film, the Purge. Most of the comedy that I'm seeing comes from the fact that they are giving the same message as the Purge only being a lot more up front about it. The Blacks stumbled upon some money and moved from the ghettos of Chi-Town to a luxurious space in Beverly Hills, where they thought they made it to a social status that made them immune form the annual purge, but of course when it begins, guess who all the purgers on the block come after. In all fairness, the neighborhood's dislike of the new family lowering their property value is the least of the Blacks' worries. It's works as a look on social commentary the same way the Purge did. It also works better if you think of it as a series of sketches on a comedy show. Not every sketch is good but I got some laughs from George Lopez who played president La Bama ( a Mexican parody of President Obama). The great Charlie Murphy who plays the gangster the blacks stole money from to movie to Beverly Hills, and Mike Tyson who does not need to try hard to be funny. Also like to give a shout out to the the gorgeous Latina they got to play Step-MILF Mrs. Black. From the moment she came on the screen her only job was to be eye candy and she did the job well and excelled. I'm taking the movie for what it is. It's not Scary movie it's Scary movie 5 (which also features Iron Mike). It's not going to win any awards or gain an critical acclaim, but it made me laugh. Job well done.",

You know the ones; they were about one day a year, any crime is legal for 12 hours. Mike plays a Chicagoan that comes into some money and decides to move his family out to Beverly Hills, thinking it will be safer among rich people. I know, it's a really thin plot device. The Purge is everywhere, right? Zulay, who is rather gorgeous in a Sofia Vergara way, plays Mike's wife. George plays the President, I think his name was something like El Bama- Hilarious, right? Charlie plays a guy from Chicago that follows Mike to get his hands on some of the money that Mike had come into. Most of the jokes are just dumb, unfunny or even stereotypical put downs of all types of races-they were equal opportunity insulters. There are a few cameos. I remember seeing Mike Tyson and Snoop Dogg. Overall, it's just not very good. It's rated \"R\" for language, violence, drug use and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes. I would not buy this on DVD. I would not rent it either. If you really think you want to see it, I would wait until it comes on cable.",

It is a really fun movie to unwind after a hard days work, i recommend it truly, especially to age 16-35, older folks would smirk at it, but they love to watch films like Mission impossible or James Bond. This is great movie in all. Made me smile. Now, in saying that, having seen movies like the purge, resident evil, saw movies, meet the parents, walking dead, this movie indeed takes a lot from those , that's why this movie is semi- called a parody. Seems similar to scream 2, scream 3, pretty clever graphics for a crazy family horror comedy. Was at one point thinking it was set near sun, was filmed in a hot weather. In this age of politically correct movies and countless re-makes and dynasty franchise blockbusters this is a nice departure into the world of silliness and craziness , which is a lovely thing and we should rejoice about that fact.",

It's a great parody of the movie The Purge (which I also loved by the way). The story: Carl Black moves his family to Beverly Hills thinking there's no annual purge there (a night where anybody can get away with murder); Shout out to Mike Epps, Lil Duval and Bresh Webb who are shining in this film! I did not really know Lil Duval but his role is hilarious! A lot of comedy legends are also appearing: Charlie Murphy, Paul Mooney...even Snoop Dogg is in it!

            "content": "Every once in a while we have a movie that thinks its a comedy because we have a cast of characters being abhorrently racist to one another, because we all know, racism is hilarious!!! Especially when it's the same ethnicity doing it to one another....After obtaining a great deal of money, the patriarch of a black family decides they should move from Chicago to a posh neighbourhood in Beverly Hills. However, they are soon terrorised by home intruders who want them out of the affluent community.......Trying to be a spoof of The Purge movies, the film is one of the poorest films of the year, going back to the dark ages of British seventies sitcom by just throwing every racist joke and innuendo at the screen and hope that everyone gets a laugh, because it's self deprecating because we are doing it to one another.And it's totally rubbish, from the opening credits right until the promise of a sequel, nothing whatsoever raises more than eyebrows in disbelief.Epps plays your Atypical stereotype by shouting really loud, swearing every second, and saying a racial slur about every minute. Epps, you should be ashamed of yourself, this stuff was getting old when Bob Hoskins had a problem having Denzel Washingtons Heart in Heart Condition (and that's 26 years ago).Otherwise, it's just an incoherent mess, we have different people arrive into the house every five minutes trying to kill the titular family because the patriarch is nothing more than a poisonous thief, who has basically ripped off everyone he has ever met.And he's our protagonist!!When a film is struggling, they have to reference a topical film series, and with everything that is happening in the world at the minute, The Purge films are prime rib. So the one homage we have of the original Purge isn't effective, nor funny, and guess what, it ends with a racist slur!!!It's this sort of film that pulls cinema back ten years, Snoop Dogg should stay away from films. Yes, he was mildly diverting in Starsky & Hutch, but this is worse than Soul Plane.Avoid like the plague.It's racist filth and should never have seen the light of day.",

The writing might be the worst I've ever encountered. In fact, it almost seemed like there was no writing, that the actors just made lines up as they went along in every scene.

            "review_title": "A Half-Baked \"Purge\" Parody",
            "content": "Freshman scenarist Nicole DeMasi and \"Supremacy\" director Deon Taylor do an adequate job of sending up the vigilante franchise of \"The Purge\" movies with their parody \"Meet the Blacks,\" starring Mike Epps, Mike Tyson, and George Lopez. Mike Epps plays Carl Black, a wiring installation expert from Chicago, who steals an African-American gangsta's cash and stash and then moves his family out to live in a mansion in Beverly Hills. Clearly, Demasi and Taylor must have been thinking of vintage CBS-TV series \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" when they came up with his adaptation. It seems that Carl was in a gangsta's house when the police raided and arrested Key Flo (Charlie Murphy of \"Norbit\") and he got away not only undetected but also with Flo's dough. Initially, the black security guard refuses to let Carl drive onto the premises, but he relents when Carl threatens him. Carl has moved to Los Angeles with his new Latino wife Lorena (Zulay Henao of \"Takers\"), his teenage daughter Allie (Bresha Webb of \"Ride Along 2\"), his son Carl Junior (Alex Henderson of \"Creed\"), and former prison inmate Cronut (Li Duval of \"Scary Movie 5\"). What none of Carl's family know is that Carl stole the cash from Key Flo. Furthermore, just about everybody that Carl cheated in Chicago has migrated to Los Angeles to exact what he owes them. The punchline of \"Meet the Blacks\" is Carl gets off scot-free because when they break into his mansion, they do it on Purge night. Mind you, Carl has no idea what The Purge is all about despite what he learns from his family so he believes that he is safely tucked away in Beverly Hills and nobody will find him. Mike Epps is at his hilarious best as Carl Black, but legendary heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson looks and sounds like a buffoon. This lowest common denominator comedy has a few laughs, and you can count them on one hand. Nevertheless, the set-up and the execution is adequately done. The Nicole DeMasi & Deon Taylor screenplay will keep you smiling with its clich\u00e9s about African-Americans in Beverly Hills and traditional slang-riddled dialogue. George Lopez has a clever cameo as a Hispanic U.S. President with the punny name El Bama. Of course, \"Meet the Blacks\" could have been far funnier, but it isn't too embarrassing as knock-offs go.",

He and him family movie into a huge mansion in a gated community in Beverly Hills. They are just settling in when the thing they most feared arrives. The Purge exists in the richest city in the country, and they are the only black family around. Things can only go bad. This is a strange movie. This is not really a spoof in the usual sense. This is really more of a remake of The Purge movie done as a comedy instead of a horror. Unlike the Scary Movie series it doesn't take from all other movies. There are some funny parts in this but it did seem to drag a little. The two biggest problems with this movie however were the over used clich\u00e9 racist jokes. We get it, your black so even when crime is illegal you will get caught...very funny. The biggest problem with the movie though is that the actors didn't look like the wanted to be in this. That really hurt the comedy due to the fact that you almost felt sorry for them. Overall, Some people will enjoy this but as for me the movie was only funny in some parts, and only because I saw the original Purge. I give this a C.",

There were a few short laughs; The biggest laugh by far was Mike Tyson's brief role. He had me rolling. The rest of the comedy was based on \"stuck in the 1930's\" style racist humor.White people are represented as universally villainous and overtly racist; Which is supposed to be a joke, but the lines just seem so unnatural that there is no way it could sound authentic. Its like someone went through the film in post production and tried to ad-lib some racist white people from books written a century ago.I was mostly disappointed in the comedy, bored by the action, and even a great scene with Charlie Murphy couldn't raise the bar on this film. The kids were annoying, the family was deranged, and Mike Epps himself seems too old for the sh*t-head gangsta roles he always seems to get. Casually dropping the N-bomb while looking disinterested and lanky was his main appeal in most films and I think the amusement of that character has run it's course.Mike, you can play roles where the character has an IQ over 70, I promise!

He picks up and moves his family to the Hills. Little do they know that an annual purge is happening on that day. Now, the family must not only defend themselves from the gangsters out to retrieve their money, but also from their rich well to do neighbors.Mike Epps is a really funny guy, in contexts. Here he does an average job of amusing the audience, but it's darn sure he knows how to take the lead place in a film. Everything seems to surround him, and it also gives me the feeling of the \"Friday\" character all grown up and independent from his uncle. The family aspects are there, but do not seem to shine as much as the purge plot. I wish this movie had more normal interactions with the neighbors, so we could see the difference between the rich and poor, and Epps could use his humor in that context. All in all, it was a pretty bad movie.The movie relies a lot on horror. It gets dark really quickly, and we are left there wanting to bring the humor back. It doesn't come back.2 stars",

            "review_title": "\"Meet the Blacks\" is a semi-humorous, half-way decent parody.",
            "content": "Just since the beginning of this century, filmmakers have asked us to meet the Parents, the Fockers, the Spartans, the Robinsons, the Browns, the Patels, and, every Sunday morning on network TV\u0085 the Press. Personally, I have taken part in most of those \"meets\" \u2013 and generally enjoyed them, to varying degrees. Next, we are encouraged to \"Meet the Blacks\" (R, 1:30). Like most of those other examples, this meeting is intended to be comedic in nature and, like the example of \"Meet the Spartans\" (2008), this meeting is a parody of an earlier cinematic encounter. You see, \"Meet the Browns\" is also known as \"The Black Purge\". You can think of the movie this way: What if the 2013 film \"The Purge\" were re-staged with a black family? We're talking the first of the Purge movies \u2013 as in taking place in an upscale neighborhood, but where a single family of color lives. Get the picture? The next question is, will you \"get\" the movie? Carl Black (Mike Epps) has suddenly, uh\u0085 come into some money. He (VERY) quickly moves his family from Chicago to a mansion in Beverly Hills. His new wife, Lorena (Zulay Henao, a Columbian actress, playing a sexy Mexican woman and looking like a younger, less-Latina Sofia Vergara), his self-centered teenage daughter, Allie (Bresha Webb), his nerdy young son, Carl Jr. (Alex Henderson) and Carl's ex-con, sex-obsessed cousin Cronut (Lil Duvall) are enjoying their new home \u2013 and wondering how and why they ended up here. Lorena is struggling to get Carl's kids to accept her as part of the family, Carl Jr. keeps to himself wearing a vampire costume and sending his remote-controlled toys around the house from a secret hideaway in his closet, Allie is secretly meeting with her boyfriend, Freezee (Andrew Bachelor), who rode a bus from Chicago to surprise her, and Cronut is busy \"fixing\" Carl's new SUV, sexually harassing Lorena and breaking into Carl's safe, helping himself to Carl's secret stash of cash and weed. Carl gets the family out of the house to walk down their street and meet some of their new neighbors (including Phil Austin, Kate Enggren and Perez Hilton), but Carl's timing leaves something to be desired.The Blacks have moved into their new mansion just in time for the annual national Purge \u2013 a night of terror during which citizens are free to release aggression, right wrongs and get rid of \"undesirables\". All crime is legal for 12 hours \u2013 including murder. Even as President El Bama (George Lopez) announces the beginning of the Purge in a televised address to the nation, Carl assures his family that people don't purge in nice neighborhoods like theirs. He's trippin'. Just as in the film \"The Purge\", even rich people aren't safe from others who are purging, and the family home is soon invaded by criminals, masked strangers and even their own neighbors. But remember, \"Meet the Blacks\" is a parody of that film\u0085 focused on a black family in an otherwise white neighborhood \u2013 and Snoop Dogg is involved in the production. So, instead of a family having to fend off jealous neighbors and other anonymous purgers, the Blacks have to contend with people like a drug dealer, a creditor (Mike Tyson), a repo man, a process server, an unhappy president of the homeowner's association and some racist neighbors.\"Meet the Blacks\" is a semi-humorous, half-way decent parody. The mixture of the plot from \"The Purge\" and the fish-out-of-water / racially-oriented comedy is full of possibilities, but not very successfully exploited by up-and-coming director Deon Taylor and the writing team of Mr. Taylor and Nicole DeMasi. What is exploited are racial stereotypes of several different kinds and common racial epithets. If you're not offended by those kinds of terms or sources of humor, you may well enjoy this film. Personally, I found it sometimes funny, sometimes offensive and mostly just mildly amusing. \"C+\"",

I understand, that parody movies satire the events of the real world, in a comedic way, but the execution isn't successfully done. Anyway, of course some jokes were funny, but there weren't many joke to laugh for. By the way, I don't think that movie deserved a sequel (because I think they have already released a second film).",

Though I found the film sporadically funny, I thought it wasn't really trying at all and instead tried to see how hard it could spoof \"Scary Movie.\" The humor is scatological and is embedded in puerile, inane humor that is so dumb and pointless it actually becomes somewhat funny. The script is laughable at best and features some of the cheesiest lines I've seen. It does everything that a horror comedy is supposed to do except have believable acting, realistic humor, and a halfway decent plot.Source: http://www.huludb.com/movies/1562977-meet-the-blacks",

I like Mike Epps as an actor; he's got a certain bit of charm in his performances, even though he never landed himself a role that pushed him to true leading man status. \u00a0He also knows how to improvise, and while this movie suffers when it is being obtuse and racially offensive, it does work with offhanded comments that you can tell was made up on the spot. \u00a0I did get some laughs out of this, and they almost all came from mutterings dished out underneath the breath of Mike Epps. \u00a0It is kind of bizarre to see this, just because I don't know who out there would have thought that this was a good idea. \u00a0There just isn't a demand for it, and I am surprised that anybody ended up seeing this at all, which is probably why it popped up on Netflix streaming so quickly.  This isn't the bottom of the barrel, but it certainly isn't good. \u00a0It's actually way funnier at the beginning when it does play in the humor that is based on stereotypes. \u00a0Meet the Blacks does nothing but lose steam as it goes on, and it really gets bad when it just turns into the movie that it's parodying. \u00a0I don't know how much you remember about the 2013 film, but it has some truly awful lighting; you can hardly get scared because you can't tell what is going on. \u00a0The same can be said with Meet the Blacks, except there are cynical jokes thrown into the mix. \u00a0Add in some pretty random C-list cameos and you have a movie that flounders more than entertains.",

            "content": "Look, I know I've said this before, and will continue to say this as long as spoof films are being made, but this genre has been dead since the 90s after the last Naked Gun movie was released.  But I'm not even talking about the Naked Gun types, that made fun of old school cop show tropes and cliches.  I'm talking about the more specific type of spoofs, where they go after a specific movie or various movies.  I don't think there has been a spoof of this type in YEARS that has actually been good.  I guess you could say Black Dynamite is the only one, but again, that spoofs the blaxploitation film genre as a whole and not a specific movie.  To me, the best spoofs work because there's a level of respect for the material that you are poking fun at.  Like, as I just mentioned, Black Dynamite or Young Frankenstein.  Both of those films, while poking fun at the silliness of their chosen target to spoof, are also very much loving tributes to the films that inspired them to make the spoof in the first place.  And I think that's definitely something to that that needs to be said.  The best spoofs are those that make fun, but also find a way to show their love and appreciation.  I think that's part of why I find the Seltzer/Friedberg spoofs (Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet the Spartans) are some of the worst spoofs in existence.  Hell, they're not just the worst spoofs in existence, they're some of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The point of those flicks is to be as dumb as humanly possible without actually putting in any effort into actual decent comedy.  Which brings us to Meet the Blacks.  I can honestly understand the way that this movie approached its parodying of the Purge film series.  Unlike Young Frankenstein or even Black Dynamite, the fact of the matter is that the Purge aren't classic movies.  The first one wasn't that good to begin with, but the last two were actually fun genre movies.  So I can understand the film not being a loving tribute to the Purge movies, because those movie just aren't classics.  Particularly not so close to the film actually being released.  But, honestly, this is a terrible movie no matter how you look at it.  When the best thing about it is how great Zulay Henao looks, then you know that the movie doesn't offer much in the way of quality.  Don't get me wrong, though, there's some good ideas here.  I like the fact that everyone that Carl fucked over before he left Chicago is now attempting to purge him.  From his ex, to people he owes money to, to the president of the Home Owners' Association that sold him the house without knowing that he was a black man, yes, to the drug dealer that he stole money and weed from, even the KKK shows up.  Fucking everybody comes after Carl and I liked that concept.  I liked the concept because it pretty much allows the movie to throw just about everything they can out there, no matter how ridiculous or absurd.  So I applaud the film's attempts at absurdity, to keep things from ever getting too stale.  The problems the film has certainly aren't related to the fact that it's a dull movie.  It's anything but.  The problems come in the fact that the jokes in the movie are just no fucking good whatsoever.  The jokes are so fucking bad.  Not to say there aren't some scenes that made me chuckle, but, by and large, 8 out of 10 jokes are misses.  And the 2 that are hits aren't even that good anyway.  Part of the problem is the fact that Mike Epps is a terrible actor.  Just fucking terrible.  I have no idea how he is a stand-up comic, but he almost has to be better, but let's just say that he hasn't made the transition as smoothly as others like Kevin Hart or even Hannibal Buress, albeit in smaller roles.  The fact that we're asked to believe Mike Epps can believably carry a movie on his own, even one as this that's all about the absurdities and not necessarily about actual acting talent, is more difficult to believe than the fact that this universe got to a point where crime was legal for just one night.  That's how bad Mike Epps is in this movie.  Either that or he just didn't give a fuck and he was just doing this movie for the paycheck, which is also very possible.  Nobody in the cast is really that good to begin with, but Mike Epps is on another level of bad.  Like I said, there's some good ideas here and there, but the movie just wastes them with some of the worst jokes you will see all year.  Now that I really think about it, this might actually be one of the worst movies I've seen all year.  It's really that fucking bad.  Not recommended at all.",

The movie parodies \"The Purge\" but has almost no correlation to it, literally the only thing connecting is the fact that there is a purge in the movie, and trying to be its own movie was a terrible mistake. Almost all the jokes in this movie just centre around the fact that the family is black, which make the jokes extremely dry as the movie goes on. \"Meet The Blacks\" is a very cheap, poorly done wanna-be parody, that isn't worth wasting anyones time.",

In the past they had hits such as Don't Be A Menace and the Scary Movie franchise (at least the first few films) but with films like Meet The Blacks being released it becomes very clear that this genre needs to completely die for quite some time.\n\nFollowing Carl Black and his family after moving out of Chicago into a nice part of Beverly Hills in a attempt to be safer just so happens to fall on the night of the annual purge, where all crime is legal for 12 hours, Carl soon finds out that old enemies as well as new ones are coming to settle everything little thing in his life.\n\nNow basing a entire film off the premise of the first Purge movie (where they are stuck in the house, not the more open world ones) is a tough call, let alone making a good story and in the case of a spoof making sure it's comical. Now Meet The Blacks does none of this right. Towards the end I felt they were just adding side stories and sub plots on top of sub plots as some sort of cruel joke to the viewer. For a story that from the start was already a entirely disengaging one that left me not caring about it in the slightest by the end I was just glad to not have to think about it anymore.\n\nYou'd hope at least the film would be humorous in some aspects. From nonstop pop culture references, name dropping just to name drop, horrible cameos, and the large amount of racist and profanity laced jokes I honestly can say I didn't find myself laughing once. Coming from someone as well that is very lenient on comedy and can laugh at most was almost a award onto itself. As if they comedy aspects weren't bad enough they even try to throw in small portions of what they assume a horror film would have that is just a insult to even the worst horror films.\n\nThe cast couldn't even help as between the actors, characters, and their performances. All the characters are incredibly unlikable, rude, generally mean, and not relateable at all. You have a list of more well known names do cameos that more so just insult themselves and further add into the list of negitives this film has.\n\nIf Mel Brooks saw this movie he would want the spoof genre dead and gone and after seeing Meet The Blacks I agree. Not only will it be one of the worst films released in 2016 but should go down as one of the most painfully unfunny comedies of all time, worst of all is that they actually tried to make it funny too. Don't even bother watching the trailer for this. Just avoid it.\n\n\nScore :\n\n\n0.5/10\n\nhttps://apocalypticdemise.com/2016/07/29/meet-the-blacks-review/",
