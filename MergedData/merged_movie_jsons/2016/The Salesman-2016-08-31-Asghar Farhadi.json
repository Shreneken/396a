            "content": "In The Salesman the actors starring in an Iranian stage production of Death of a Salesman live parallel tragedies on and off stage. The first shot is of a rumpled marriage bed, the setting for intimacy and sexual drama. Those values adhere even when the situation is a theatre set. The narrative unwinds from a reported sexual scene, where the heroine is somehow violated by a stranger in her shower. Using an American classical play sets off an immediate contrast between the Iranian and American cultures. The Arthur Miller play anatomizes the shallowness and materialism of American capitalism. It establishes a struggling low-born salesman \u2014 Willy Loman \u2014 in the function of the traditionally high-born tragic hero. An Iranian production of the American classic would be expected to emphasize the superiority of the Iranian culture. Hence the gaudy summary of the US in the set's neon Casino and Bowling signs. But the choice of a Miller play pays respect to the freedom that political theatre enjoys in America. Hero Emad is delayed that fateful night when he has to stay to deal with the state censors who want to make three cuts in the script. As a literature teacher he's again frustrated when the school rejects his three texts as inappropriate for his teenage boys class. Despite that puritanism the Iranian society is also riven with sexual temptation. Emad explains that the woman who objected to sitting beside him in the taxi had probably been discomfited, perhaps even molested, by another man on another shared taxi ride. The pictures Emad finds on a pupil's cell phone are probably like the raunchy stuff on American boys' phones. At the other extreme the pathetic old man is tempted to sin by the sight of the showering Rana.That schoolboy's not having a father sets a pattern of missing or questioned manhood. The supporting actress has a little son but is separated from her husband. The little boy's obtrusive glasses suggest a preternatural vision, lending weight to his line: \"If my father phones say I'm not in. I like Mommy more.\" The boy lives his mother's life so completely that he not only attends her rehearsals but joins the curtain call onstage. The central issue is how Emad and Rana deal with her violation. If Willy Loman's downfall is his seduction by the American myth of popularity, Emad's is for the Iranian myth of male honour. Because the man is held dishonoured by his wife's shame Rana is more traumatized by the old man's appearance in her shower than an American wife would be. Not till the end do we realize that she was not raped and only injured herself by falling through the glass shower door. To avoid further shame Rana determines not to go to the police. She remains traumatized by the experience, too ashamed to return to her professional activity of being watched onstage by men. With his honour pre-eminently at stake, Emad resolves upon revenge. He tracks down and traps the villain. When Rana sees him, she determines to prevent Emad's plan to shame him before his wife of 35 years, his daughter and her fianc\u00e9. \"If you tell them we are finished.\" Emad seems to accept her decision. A largely decent man himself, when he sees the old man and his family he relents and seems ready to let him leave. But he has another score to settle. He gives him back the money he left behind, then slaps him. That last action pushes the ill geezer over the edge. With his death, Rana's love for Emad is finished too. His insensitivity to her trauma was bad enough \u2014 It's a guy thing \u2014 but his insistence upon revenge, a fatal excess, is to her unforgivable. Like Rana's shame, Emad's revenge is based on the Iranian principle that a woman serves her man's honour. After her initial trauma Emad seems to feel more violated than his wife. After she labours over a special dinner Emad refuses to eat it because it was bought with the intruder's money. At the heart of Emad's characterization is his exchange with a student over a story: \"How does a man turn into a cow?\" \"Very gradually.\" Determined not to be a cow, a wus, Emad plunges bullheaded toward a revenge that costs a man's life and Emad his marriage. Against the current of both Iranian and American culture, this film emphasizes the woman's merit as a civilizing, humanizing force.The first Miller scene we see is where his son catches Willy in a hotel room with a local floozy. That costs Willy son Biff's respect forever. Emad's vengeful plan is to similarly expose the old man before his wife and daughter. It's as If Emad took his strategy from the play instead of from his wife's better sense. The omission of Death from the film's title points to another key difference. We see Emad as Willy, dead, in his coffin, while wife Linda grieves at the paradox that she has just paid off their mortgage: \"We are free!\" But the film ends on Emad staring stolidly, vacantly, as his makeup is peeled off. The character is dead but the actor is alive. But his marriage is dead and so Emad is no longer quite alive. He's an image of death in life, literally alive but emotionally dead. His revenge killed him along with his enemy. In Death of a Salesman we see the themes and events through to Willy's death. In The Salesman the death is omitted because at the most superficial level the hero remains \u2014 however emptily \u2014 alive.",

            "content": "After having just moved into their new home Emad (Shahab Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti), a couple of fellow actors find themselves in a difficult home life situation after a violation of their home. S they go through the performances at the local theater of Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesman' their relationship takes a left turn from which it might not ever go back.I tried to keep the synopsis as vague as possible so not to spoil the film, since, as in most of Farhadi's films, the inciting incident comes in later in the film and the drama ultimately does not develop until the third act, something that this director likes to do and at which he excels, always giving priority to the space in which characters develop and live their everyday lives.And those are exactly the reasons why \"The Salesman\" is a fantastically subtle and morally complex revenge tale masked as a home drama, which has some of the best work by actors I have seen in 2016, even though this might be too slightly of a familiar territory from Farhadi.It is no coincidence that Shahab Hosseini won the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival, if there is one reason why this film succeeds it is him. This performance is raw and authentic in its own unique way, he manages to guide us through every one of the stages of degradation his character goes through and he manages to do so without us noticing. On a surface level the character arch he goes through would be hard to believe, there are some changes that wouldn't appear natural when spelled out. Yet, Hosseini manages to sell us on this person and all of the turbulence he has to go through, he manages to enhance little moments that I can't imagine working on paper. He fits right into the world that Farhadi builds and comes out giving a powerhouse of a performance that guides the audience through the whole narrative.Certainly, Farhadi deserves to share some of the credit for the performance too, for many reasons. Firstly, just as in all of his film, the performances across the board are just flawless, he directs actors to perfection and he doesn't even give you a chance to realize this. The way in which he uniquely manages to capture everyday life is profoundly stunning. From the camera-work to every detail of the blocking of actors right down to every word they say, the fabric of ordinariness he succeeds in putting on screen is flawless. I have no idea if this is all meticulously thought out or if it is left to brilliant improvisation and I don't want to know, what is clear to me is that as a director his methods work excellently and the results he manages to produce on screen are remarkable.Then, when it comes to building the drama, Farhadi is just as masterful. The evolution of it is natural and doesn't ever feel forced upon the characters, the parallels traced with theater might be a little too on the nose, but they are stunningly relevant and used to an incredible cinematic effect. He manages to build and build the drama and make it culminate in a riveting finale where all of the themes and the moral questions the film asks flow out naturally from it and leave you hanging at just the right moment. He also manages to build a complex web of visual cues and use them effectively to complement the characters and the story, once again here the visual parallels with the theater are a joy to see unfold.It has to be said that this is very familiar territory for Farhadi, the contrast of personal justice versus institutionalized justice is very relevant is his past film \"A Separation\" and so is the outlook on revenge, the degrading and the toll it takes on the individual and the destructive results of it. Sometimes it even feels like he is retracing his steps and for someone who has seen his film this might result in a slightly predictable outcome, even though the self contained drama in the film never looses its relevance to the characters, ultimately resulting in a constantly fascinating watch that challenges the viewer and defies traditional cinematic beats and expectations",

A customer of the old tenant makes a visit to the apartment that makes the couples life upside down.The husband is searching for the visitor for a revenge, but ends up in a sweet revenge story, or so called.I was so impressed by the movie that I have no words to explain or describe it.

Even though Farhadi's 'A Separation' is even better, this is a great display of storytelling and psychological understanding of the director. There are three elements that ought to be highlighted. 1) Without gimmicks and hyperboles it shows how a common man, with his natural strengths and flaws, gets his own moral code defied by the violence that exists in all societies but that in this case, touched his family. 2) The visual language. Again, it's subtle and straightforward, but its always at the right distance of the characters. 3) The counterpointing of Miller's play is marvelous! What happens to them in real life always affects the development of the play and the tensions backstage have a richness that takes the audience to a new level. A must-watch!!!",

            "content": "Masterfully shot in Teheran, the film follows the ill fortunes of a theatrical married couple who, while rehearsing Miller's play Death of a Salesman, find themselves having to abandon their crumbling apartment and to seek alternative accommodation. The film is openly an allegory about social, urban and marital decay. But way beyond it, it is about the costs of masculine pride. By far more than a very good 'Iranian film', this is a superb statement about the unbearable consequences of trying to live up to codes of honour that centre on the female body. In my opinion, actress Taraneh Alidoosti is the hero of the film, both in her performance and in the role she occupies in the script. In contrast to appearances, she is the mover of everything that takes place in this fantastic film. A cinematic poem and a masterpiece in unfolding the twists of human psychology.",

            "content": "Gradually (highly recommended to read these two plays before watching this movie 1.Cow by Gholam Hossein Saedi and 2.Death of a Salesman by Arthur Miller) The salesman is really breathtaking and it has all the familiar factor of Farhadi's movies with a big difference that there is not any sign of those open ends anymore and you associate with the main character of movie more than any time. The story is about a young couple (Emad and Rana) who are performing at Arthur Miller's play Death of a salesman. They have to move to another apartment because their apartment is going to collapse. This moving cause a serious issue in their life because of the old tenant. In the beginning of the film when Emad_ with brilliant performance by Shahab Hosseini_ and his students was reading Saedi's play Cow, one of his student asked him \"Sir,How does a man become cow?\" Emad answered: \"gradually\". This question and Emad's answer are the main theme of this movie. Farhadi has used some part of the play Death of a Salesman in his movie masterfully and he has chosen Emad for the Willy's role in order to show and emphasize how Emad gradually got far away from his family or even his wife just like willy. The last twenty minutes of film are really breathtaking and the spectators associate with Emad more than anytime and I think they regularly ask themselves \"if I were him, what would I do?\" The salesman is a story about revenge or with accurate express is a story about the motivation of revenge. This story like another Fahadi's movies occurs in a family and effects family members. After A separation and now with the salesman Farhadi can be considered as a great master in directing suspenseful family drama like Hitchcock.",

The first half of this movie was compelling...what happened to the wife, and will they find the person who attacked her? But then when the \"explanation\" is given, it doesn't really make any sense, and the question really isn't answered. Why do I say that? Because the guy accused of attacking the wife doesn't seem like he'd be able to do it. So what is the explanation for that? There is no explanation. Oh well.So then I decide to watch the extra on the DVD, where the director explains what he was trying to accomplish. This will surely help me understand this picture better! But it didn't. Apparently, to really \"get\" this film, you have to be well-versed in the play \"Death of a Salesman,\" (which I read in high school, by the way), which is also being performed by an acting troupe in this movie. Seriously! So I guess I just wasn't smart enough to appreciate this film. I guess all the critics who loved it and the Academy who gave it the Best Foreign Film Oscar are much smarter and hipper than me.",

            "content": "Mixing Hitchcock for suspense and Ibsen for realism, writer/director Asghar Farhadi takes his own spin on those masters to create a psychological thriller that is as much about domestic unrest as it is about who broke into the home and brutalized Emad's ( Shahab Hosseini) wife, Rana (Taraneh Aldoosti).Although Emad is obsessed with finding the intruder, Rana seems to be ambivalent and uncertain how to proceed given the many subtle ramifications around truth. The story, mesmerizing in its little twists and turns, eventually turns on discovery and the tyranny of revenge (ask Othello about that one).Yet the pace is deadly slow:Student: \"How do people turn to cows?\" Emad: \"Gradually!\" Unobtrusive direction is the key to this Foreign Language Oscar winner, whose slow distribution and character revelation could go on without those reveals. But not Emad, who pursues truth like a Greek tragedian, slowly realizing his steps are jeopardizing everyone involved, even the perp. The infamous Iranian spirit of honor is present in a barely hidden form.Even Farhadi's sets are as tight as his frames, suggesting imprisonment when liberation would seem to be the goal. Farhadi has also framed the story with the husband and wife performing in Death of a Salesman with why Willy is Emad becoming clear at the end.The Salesman is rich in simple but powerful story, first-rate directing, and allegory waiting to be found. Although it seems Iran's social unrest could be the subject, the broader humanity of going where one should not go and forgiving when it is not obvious why are also prominent. Add to those the figurative trope of leaving well enough alone when exploring someone close, like a wife, rings true for those who have discovered, truth may not set them free.\"Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift / As meditation or the thoughts of love, / May sweep to my revenge\" (Hamlet,1.5.29-31).",

            "content": "There is no one to be judged except us, who are now watching the movie in around the world and in different countries with different cultures. As you see, no wall is seen between the rooms in the \"Death of a salesman\" play by Arthur Miller. The director, clearly states how good it would be, if you try to think about the least s in your life as they're the reason for most of the problems you may be encountered with. You as the watcher feel no wall around the personal life of Rana and Emad as there is no in Arthur Miller's, \"Death of a salesman\". Even the camera tries to convince you how to find your way, while in most of the vital situations of the movie, it makes you to think by having a look at those Hitchcock's brilliantly used elements in a form of close up. Like Farhadi's previous movies we are going to see a vast of classes in a society; How they act when they face with a problem and how good or bad they are at understanding the situation. The movie starts with a medium close up of Linda and Willy Luman's bed, continues through the first scene which is the problem they have with their flat and ends up with another close up of those meaningful cracks on the window and the bulldozer which ruins the house next door in order to make a new one. Farhadi considers the flat as the society, cracks as a result of forgetting morality and bulldozer as a symbol of forgetting plumbs. Rana feels no love for Emad and so does Emad. We understand this when we see their bed, the way they act, the way Emad most of the times argues with Rana and etc. Even when Rana prepares their bed before taking a shower, the way she throws Emad's pillow on the bed, proves this. They want to give their relation another chance by having a baby as it seems from Emad's joke while he is talking to Babak on their first visit of their new place. However, in the dinner scene, Sadra, who is a 4 or 5-year-old boy, shows that having a baby is not a key to their success in saving their relation as, Emad even forget to consider her wife's feelings and doesn't consider her kind behavior and efforts on preparing such a simple but lovely supper and just follow on his own traditional thoughts with regard to the problem they both are challenging with. Farhadi shows how bad it would be if you judge someone without experiencing the situation the people are in by showing the scene in which Emad is checking Ahoo's answering machine, reaches to the Ahoo's daughter's message which shows how responsible her mom is and what a beautiful love is between them just like a normal mom and daughter in a normal family or by showing the child's painting on the wall, shows a daughter with two moms on her right side, proves she likes her mom who has just become a slut because of her terrible situation. After the rape scene, Rana has become depressed not because of that event but because of this fact that she chooses to have her husband's attention by misusing her condition. Emad also has started a journey to corruption while he chooses revenge as a way to show her wife that he is still in love with her. He forgets everything and doesn't consider that he has gradually turned to a cow just to save his wife. In Saedi's story which we see during the high school scene we have the same segment in which the farmer has turned to a cow just because of the love he feels toward his cow. Emad misuses of his situation and ruins his life while, Rana acts like a bulldozer and ruins their love by her misunderstanding from the word, Love. Willy has also done the same thing with his child, Biff while, he tells him lie, forget morality and sticks on finding another way to solve the problem rather than telling him the truth about his unlawful relation with that slut in his room's bathroom. The movie reminds us that forgetting morality is the worst possible thing when it shows an old experienced man who has done such a bizarre act with Rana. You may ask yourself how it could be possible for an old man like him to do something like that and escape that fast but in my opinion it was a taunt by Farhadi shows even Rana and Emads' neighbors have forgotten their ethics while they didn't help Rana in time and by telling lies to Emad want to define themselves as folk heroes. Those bloody footprints close to each other, proves my word that the intruder had the required time to escape and no one has even tried to stop him on his way. The neighbors by not being committed to their responsibilities toward Rana and Emad have also made the situation worse. They also have forgotten their moralities. Farhadi reminds us how bad it would be if we forget morality, start judging others and forget ourselves. \"The Salesman\", proves that we all may gradually turn to cows if we forget who we really are!Faithfully yours,Amin Ghanbari October 30, 2016",

Action or events as a device to look at our natures, choices, motives, drives and dreams. And let's not stop there. How about actors acting theater scenes, and throw in a play within a play to boot, for good measure.I know I sound somewhat critical above, and under less skilled hands, such criticism would be warranted. But not here. THE SALESMAN is compelling from beginning to end. And using Arthur Miller's iconic play, THE DEATH OF A SALESMAN, works so well to comment on these character's dreams, failings, nobility and humanity. A dream -- or rather dreams -- shattered by a single, accidental, innocent incident. At the end of the journey, of our own Odyssey, whether we arise as a hero or a victim depends on our choices, our attitudes, our sheer willfulness for goodness or our tendency for self-destruction. To me, this movie raised these issues, and more. I loved it. Compelling through and through, and from a most-gifted, cinematically articulate director.Scoring the different elements of the film objectively, 1 to 4:Script/Story: 4, loved it. And all this set against a backdrop of a crackling, fall building; a house of cards, if you will.Cinematography/Visual Effects: 3.5. Well shot. Close shots heightened the tension.Editing: 3.5. Well edited; kept the pacing of a natural thriller, but lacked the cheesiness of one.Sound Effects: 3, competent sound mixingMusical Score: 3; frankly do not recall any musical score underscoring the film. This is sad as I should have noticed. Was there one?Performances: 4, extremely strong performances. Great ensemble work, and standout work by the two leads, and the old man, too. I was particularly touched by the scene between the two men when the lead told the old man to take off his shoes. This scene was so effectively shot. Slow pacing of the camera capturing every quiver of both performances. Wow.Production Design: Sets, Locations, Costumes, etc.: 2.5; my complaint here deals with the shots from the theater itself where DEATH OF A SALESMAN was being performed. Needed something more here. Would you recommend this movie to a friend? Absolutely; a fine work of cinema. And extremely provocative. Well written; well shot; well delivered. Most highly recommended.

            "content": "I'm sure the play Death of a Salesman has something to do with the rest of this story, but aside from them both having a woman (in this film's story, off-screen) who has male 'customers', I still don't know yet. While The Salesman didn't hit the same emotional peak that A Separation did, this was drawn out in a gut-wrenching sort of way like that film does, where things are so realistic and yet at the same time there's always harsh and sorrowful pathos going on that we can be hooked into the furthering plight of these characters. It's in a way a crime film too, only it's a personal one.Farhadi's storytelling is close to a blend at its most pure of a kind of neo-realism and a film-noir, to draw out the old-time film comparisons; it's about seemingly every-day people who try to lead and good and productive lives (the main couple here are actors and the man is also a schoolteacher, while the other characters that come in the second half of the story are working class as well), and one terrible damn incident brings the world crashing down.As in A Separation the performances are particularly strong, but what I've noticed in these two films is how much Farhadi pays attention to the emotional lives of his women; Hosseini gets his dramatic moments, but he is mostly reacting to things, and tries to be tough and a MAN about things, while Alidoosti's Rana has to internalize this experience, and she is the one who really goes through a full, devastating arc through the film where, by near the end, she's become more of the grown-up and trying to see some reason and let sleeping dogs lie and such, though she's still scarred as well. Perhaps, in thinking it now, the Salesman story is significant as well in that that story is about a man and woman being torn apart by the man being so stuck in his ways, unable to see any other way to go about how to live his life. Hosseini's character wants to do what's right (for a few reasons the cops cant be called after this attack on his love happens as the critical turning point), but his idea for revenge or payback is spurred further by his anger and frustration. Or, to put it more simply: what happens when a family is torn apart by the truth - this, by the way, becomes what may or may not end up being the climax of this film.This is a heavy film, but rewarding because the actors are living so strongly in these moments, and we can empathize with them as well (which is the provocative part, as if Farhadi may be challenging us or himself or both to wonder) as a key character in the third act of the story, where it reaches its resolution - not to mention back where the story began, in an apartment that is unihabitable due to a man-made destruction - and because Farhadi is so vigorous in making practically every scene count. It's a painfully human tragedy (with maybe one or two minor laughs, almost like brief respites) that is able to be interesting, occasionally extremely and uncomfortably thrilling, and naturalistic at the same time, which is difficult to pull off. I may not rush to see The Salesman again, but I'm glad Farhadi continues to make films, and I'm more hopeful it'll win at the Oscars precisely because it is *not* political (except, of course, for how intensely it *is* a feminist story, simply in the sense that it's an Iranian film that feels deep compassion for its female co-protagonist).",

After occupying their new apartment, Rana is attacked in the bathroom by an intruder. The assault leaves her traumatized. Emad takes it upon himself to track down the assailant, which he does by improbable means.SPOILER FOLLOWS: It turns out that the intruder was an elderly man with severe heart problems, who visited the apartment believing that it was occupied by the previous resident, who was a prostitute. It is not clear entirely what transpired in the bathroom, but the confrontation of the old man and Rana resulted in a bloodied head that necessitated a trip to the hospital. The vague excuse offered by the old man was that he experienced \"temptation.\" So much for realism and credibility! The film also includes a framing device in which Emad and Rana are acting in a theatre production of Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\" But there is no thematic connection of Miller's play to the main narrative of Emad and Rana. The filmmakers do not even understand Miller's play in which the focus is on the relationship of a salesman, Willy Loman, and his son Biff. The son was estranged from his father when he caught his father in an affair. The father is a failed salesman and dreamer who, according to the son, \"never knew who he was.\" But the film suggests the play is primarily about Willy and his wife Linda, as apparent in the staged curtain call at the end.The ostensible goal of the film was to explore how the traumatized Rana eventually comes to forgive her assailant. But the placid Emad turns into a virtual monster seeking revenge, which was never believable. Indeed neither character development was very likable or realistic.All in all, \"The Salesman\" is no more than an amateur a film effort, just like the amateur theatrical production of \"Death of a Salesman\" presented in the film. Both the film and the play-within-the-film were stinkers!",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Iranian writer/director Asghar Farhadi won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar for his 2011 A Separation, and with his latest (also Oscar nominated), he proves yet again that his unique approach to family/domestic dramas might best be described as simmering suspense artistry. He certainly knows how to tell a story and structure a film for maximum impact.Shahab Hosseini (A Separation) and Taraneh Alidoosti (About Elly) star as Emad and Rana, a normal and seemingly happily married couple. One morning, some heavy equipment jeopardizes the stability of their apartment building and they escape to the streets. Husband and wife are both performing in a community theatre production of Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\" and at that evening's rehearsal, one of their castmates, Babak (Babak Karimi) offers the couple the use of a rooftop apartment \u0085 he has recently evicted the tenant.Of course, this bit of luck comes with some baggage \u0085 specifically, the baggage and belongings of the previous tenant who (unseen to viewers) keeps telling Babak she will return for her stuff. Meanwhile, the neighbors inform Emad and Rana that the previous tenant and her \"many acquaintances\" (paying clients, if you get my drift) will not be missed. This history comes into play when one evening a home invasion leaves Rana dazed, injured and being treated at a local hospital. This sets off the cultural commentary about the roles and power of Iranian men vs women, as well as a psychological study of wounded pride, a need for revenge, and a scarred psyche who wishes to be neither alone nor coddled.The strained marital relationship has some interesting parallels with the scenes depicted in the Miller play, and there are also a few key moments in the build-up \u0085 moments of subtlety for the discerning viewer. Foreshadowing occurs in a seemingly humorous moment when one of Emad's students asks during class, \"How does a man become a cow?\", and Emad answers \"Gradually.\" A throwaway line is never really that in a Farhadi script.Most of the film centers on how Emad and Rana react to the traumatic event, and for the first two-thirds, it's Emad's movements that we follow. However, during the extraordinary final act, Rana becomes the focus and there is a tremendous performance from Farid Sajjadi Hosseini as an older gent in a key role. So much raw human nature is on display here \u2013 pride, revenge, forgiveness, trust, weakness, etc. It's the type of film that has much going on even during the parts that might seem slow on the surface. Farhadi is an exceptional filmmaker, and evidently, he will just continue to prove it so.",

            "content": "Asghar Farhadi's films A Separation (also Oscar gold) and About Elly (not Oscar-recognized, but pretty good nevertheless) were shocking films. Not just for their stories- Farhadi does excel in intense and gripping drama with a touch of mystery to them- but for the face they put on Iran, very different from what many viewers go in expecting. Where are the cries for jihad? The outcry against Great Satan? The plots to wipe Israel off the map? The burning people in the street? Why are they living in apartments and homes and not caves? Farhadi certainly does give us more of that here. Early on, we hear a cell phone go off with a very familiar ringtone, and the protagonists are performing Death of a Salesman. You might think the US is banning these people for a reason, but Farhadi's films show us that, apart from a big difference in government, Iranians themselves are like people anywhere. Substitute \"Muhammad\" for \"Jesus\" and \"Koran\" for \"Bible\" and his films could be set in Kansas or Mississippi.As for the \"intense and gripping drama with a touch of mystery\" part, The Salesman also delivers once again. This touches on the issue of violence against women, with the protagonist trying to uncover who assaulted his wife. But the film also deals, in a very human way, with the trauma his wife lives with in the aftermath. There is intensity in the climax- is there going to be revenge? The Salesman is no tasteless rape-and-revenge movie; it's a finely crafted drama that can be different things at once.",

The film begins with this couple having to evacuate their apartment due to excavations happening next door. They're forced to look for a new apartment and they managed to do so through their friend played by Babak Karimi...and that's all you need to know about the plot because I feel like giving away more would diminish what this film is trying to achieve.I feel like The Salesman follows a similar formula to About Elly . It's expertly written and it managed to hook me from the very first scene all the way to the last. The viewer is not presented with the central issue of the film from the get-go (unlike a Separation), but rather the film follows normal day-to-day life of the characters and that creates a sense of anticipation in the viewer. That feeling of anticipation in About Elly made it so special for me and Farhadi follows the same formula here again.I was never a huge fan of A Separation and I've always considered the massively underrated About Elly as Farhadi's best film , but If you've seen and enjoyed either of those films, then The Salesman is for you.This is probably the most mature and well crafted Film from Farhadi so far. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.Oh and It's probably worth noting that the film received a standing ovation at my theater.",

            "content": "Emad Etesami (Shahab Hosseini, \"About Elly\") and his wife Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti, \"Atomic Heart\"), a childless married couple in their early thirties, are amateur actors playing the lead roles in a local production of Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman,\" a play in which a good man's virtue turns to hypocrisy and his marriage crumbles. Like Willy and Linda in Miller's play, the husband and wife in Asghar Farhadi's (\"A Separation\") Oscar-nominated film The Salesman talk to each other, but it is always seemingly behind a veil until unforeseen events uncover buried aspects of each one's character that blurs the dividing line between the theater and real life.As well as being an actor, Emad is a high school literature teacher respected by his students who is first seen in a classroom discussion about the short story \"The Cow\" by Gholem-Hossein Sa'edi, an Iranian writer and political activist. When one of the students asks Emad, \"How does a man become a cow?\" Emad replies, \"Gradually,\" little realizing that his answer would become prophetic. The scene then suddenly shifts to a suburban apartment where Emad and Rana are seen running with other residents to escape the building's crumbling facade. In a politically-sounding exchange that somehow eluded the censors, Emad says, \"We ought to take a bulldozer, knock this whole thing down and start over,\" whereas a neighbor tells him, \"We already did that and this is what we got.\" Fortunately, stage manager Babak (Babak Karimi, \"The Past\") helps the young couple find a vacant two-bedroom apartment on the top floor of a building but fails to tell them that the previous occupant, who has left most of her belongings behind, was a prostitute, described euphemistically in the film as \"a woman of many acquaintances.\" When Emad is out one night, Rana lets a stranger into their apartment thinking it's her husband, and is assaulted in the shower.The incident takes place off-camera and the exact nature of the attack is never made clear. The event, however, puts a strain on their marriage. Like Willy Loman who is unable to give his wife and family the good things in life, Emad wonders why he was unable to protect his wife from assault and becomes irritated with her fear of being alone, a situation that disrupts his teaching schedule and, in one instance when she agrees to perform, causes him to cancel a performance of the play in the middle because of her breakdown. Speculating that his wife was attacked by a former client of the previous tenant, Emad does not report the incident to the police but takes it upon himself to track down the perpetrator using such clues as a cell phone, set of keys, and a pickup truck which the attacker carelessly left on their street. Determined to seek revenge and unwilling to see events from Rana's perspective, he berates her for letting a stranger into their apartment. When her feelings are marginalized, the film becomes more about the treatment of women than about what happened or who committed the crime, revealing how a man's anger, bruised ego, and disdain for his wife's feelings threaten the very thing he is striving to protect.To Farhadi, the key to understanding the film is empathy. He says, \"When you try to make your movie as close as possible to real life, you give the audience the opportunity to watch it from different aspects. I'm always working towards empathy,\" he says, \"even with the characters that do wrong. The films where characters are heroic and do lots of great things are satisfying and comfortable to audiences. But I want audiences to put themselves in the shoes of characters who have done something wrong.\" Regardless of whose point of view you ultimately sympathize with, The Salesman is a powerful and brilliantly executed film about revenge and its consequences that enhances Farhadi's reputation as one of the most important filmmakers of our time.",

One worthy of the classy Palme D'or apparently. Not as intricate and open-ended as his previous ones, but in the same neighborhood.******* SPOILERS AHEAD **********Emud and Raana are in a rush to evacuate their collapsing house and move to a new flat which was, unbeknownst to them, formerly inhabited by a prostitute. Raana gets assaulted by an intruder one night, who seems to be a client of the previous lady. Emud, filled with rage, seeks for his revenge of course. Raana, on the flip side, prefers everything to be forgotten. Contrasts evolve between the two as we move further, to the extent that they begin to reconsider their relationship.What triggered Farhadi to make his new title back in his hometown, in my opinion, was the need for a serious heads-up towards where the society is going. \"The Salesman\" is a social criticism in its core and thus more bound to Iranian context and culture. Although the plot's conflicts and themes appear not to be uniquely Iranian but certain references are quite foreign for an outsider audience. The couple lives in a society where everything is misplaced. Law and security systems have basically lost their functionality. Peace and pleasure is sought outside the family and words of truth are spoken not in the real life, but on a theater stage while playing roles. Raana decides (out of her shame) that there's no need for police to get involved. Emud begins his own investigations and at the end both debate on how to punish the guilty guy, to top it all.So when the victim turns into a detective and ends up as his own judge, all by himself, there's one thing for sure; The society has failed to its furthest extent.",

            "content": "\"Forushande\" or \"The Salesman\" is an Iranian movie that premiered last year. It runs for slightly over two hours and was written and directed by Ashgar Farhadi, who has been among Iran's finest filmmakers for a long time now, even if it took until his Oscar win for the world to finally really pay him attention/tribute. For me, it's between him and Panahi who is the top filmmaker from this troubled country right now. As for the cast here, I cannot say I am familiar with anybody, but this is certainly my loss as they are all doing a pretty good job and interestingly enough, the probably biggest supporting actor in here is somebody who worked as an editor for a long time until he finally started acting in film. But the best performance here comes from Shahab Hosseini of course and if he wasn't already, he now is a definite part of the Iranian acting elite. Lets take a look at the story. A couple of artists move to a new apartment where a prostitute (interesting how they avoid using this word) lived in before and the result of a tragic coincidence is that a man suggests she still lives there and forces her to have sex with him. The money he left there afterward certainly implies that rape was never an intentional factor. So it is a crime where really nobody can be blamed. The open door, the previous tenant's background, the client's harshness, it all played together in a wrong-place wrong-time kind of scenario.Rape sure is an important subject at the Academy Awards this year as Isabelle Huppert is a nominee and possible dark horse for the win for her performance as a rape victim in \"Elle\". And this Iranian movie here is in a similar position at the Best Foreign Language Film category at the Oscars. It is not the front runner, but there is definitely the option that it may cause an upset to the German entry as Huppert may cause to Stone. Now back to this one here: Shahab Hosseini is the heart and soul of the film and he is in basically every scene of these 120 minutes. He does a magnificent job and I hope this somehow gets him parts in Hollywood movies. If he wants to, that is. There is no denying he brings the talent to (co-)star in blockbuster films. As for the film itself, I think it was a good watch throughout, but it may get slightly overrated as a whole because of how impressive the last 30 minutes were, especially the first scene between Hosseini and Karimi, which was absolute edge-of-seat material. Sadly, there was an occasional length in the first 90 minutes, which is why I would describe this movie \"only\" as a good film overall, not a great film. I still believe it is more Oscar-worthy than Toni Erdmann, another good film that did not have the great moments this one here does.Finally some more words on \"The Salesman\". I have not seen \"Death of a Salesman\" and I must say the theater parts did the least for me, maybe because these take away from the pure moments of interaction between the two protagonists, or maybe also because I had no idea why Farhadi chose \"Death of a Salesman\" as the play here. Maybe you need to have seen it to understand all the references in this film's plot. But even if you have not like myself, it is still a very tense, enjoyable (sounds not like the right word to be honest) watch in its entirety and Farhadi once again proves that he is a real master of family dramas right now, as good as it gets in depicting life and the way it changes when drastic events may destroy the harmony and everyday life. Highly recommended, for Hosseini's performance alone. And Farhadi's background also takes us into a country where we know very little about, so this insight into society and communities is informative on a level where you actually learn new aspects every scene.",

Forced out of their apartment due to an impending collapse, they move into an apartment secured by a fellow actor.

This is one movie that's all about subtlety. I highly recommend it.

As the movie opens, Emad and Rana are forces to leave their building as the walls are close to collapse (due to nearby construction). An acquaintance in the theater group is able to get them a new apartment on little to no notice, but doesn't mention the previous tenant was known as a \"woman with may acquaintances\". Then one day, when Rana is home alone, someone rings the bell. Rana, thinking it's her husband, lets the person come up and in the apartment. The person assaults Rana in the shower. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.This is the latest movie from Iranian writer-director Asghar Farhadi, whose previous work includes the outstanding \"A Separation\" (which won Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar) and \"The Past\", just to name those. Here Farhadi examines the consequences of an assault on the marriage of a young couple. Keep in mind the movie is set in Tehran, where even with its more progressive leanings in certain circles (like those \"in the culture\"), the shame of a sexual assault cannot be overestimated. The question is of course, who did this heinous crime? and will the person be brought to justice? I am biting my tongue and shan't reveal any further. Just be aware that the second hour of the movie is like a human psychological action movie for the mind. The lead performances are outstanding: Shahab Hosseini as Emad (he won Best Actor at last year's Cannes Film Festival), and Taraneh Alidoosli as Rana. This movie has won major acclaim after acclaim since its premiere at Cannes, and is rightfully nominated for this year's Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar. Here's hoping it wins. As a complete aside, there is only the slightest hint of the (supposedly) oppressing religious culture in Iran: the people portrayed in the movie are quite \"normal\" by Western standards. Is it really so in today's Iran? I haven't the faintest idea, as I've never visited Iran myself.\"The Salesman\" finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely, but by no means anywhere close to a sell-out. I can only hope that as positive word-of-mouth gets around, more and more people will want to check it out. If you've seen \"A Separation\", in spirit very similar to \"The Salesman\", or if you are simply in the mood for a top notch human psychological drama that happens to come from Iran, don' hesitate and check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. \"The Salesman\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

            "content": "The draw of director Asghar Farhadi oeuvre at times feels very political. The widening cultural, religious and diplomatic gap between the United States and Iran has thus far been stabilized by chilly detente of necessity. Yet if we take our current political climate seriously, such distanced estrangement wont likely last past the New Year.Still film artists like Farhadi, Mohsen Makhmalbaf and the late Abbas Kiarostami have been at the forefront of this complex sandbox of truces and tough talk, making films about Iranian society that easily find reception among America's leftist intelligentsia. Their work, while often critical of Iranian society, nevertheless channels some powerful messaging. They often feel like cries for temperance and peace in a world that becomes ever more belligerent with each passing moment.The Salesman doesn't break that continuity, once again garnering a cultural exchange while engaging its audience with an innately human story. The film begins abruptly with a young couple, Rana (Alidoosti) and Emad Etesami (Hosseini) being forced out of their apartment in the middle of the night along with their neighbors. Their building has become unstable after an earthquake and they are desperate to find a place to stay. Babak (Karimi), a fellow player in the couple's production of \"Death of a Salesman,\" suggests they replace one of his tenants who has been struggling to pay her rent.To explain more would ruin the discovery of one of the most morally complex and painfully human stories since A Separation (2011) to come across the screen. All of the character choices seem genuine and perfectly understandable given the circumstances yet the buildup from those decisions come back in interesting and often devastating ways.Emad, a schoolteacher, approaches most of his problems through an amalgam of analysis and judgment yet the implications of the script trap him in a doleful dilemma he simply can't shake. So too does the script trap the sensitive Rana, who at a pivotal moment becomes fractured like the windows of the couple's slowly collapsing apartment. She suffers through sullen drifts and withdrawals, angry outbursts and bouts of pity; and does so through a filter of feminine devoir.As our female lead, and really, our emotional interpreter, Taraneh Alidoosti's is frightfully on point. Her continual work with Farhadi over the years seems to have given her the ability to really take chances with this role. Her every gaze feels like a provocation and her character's improbable honor wells with a sense of sad power thanks largely to her expressive face.The fact that The Salesman features Arthur Miller's ode to the common man is very appropriate indeed. While the play within the movie balances themes of justice, trust and the abstraction of political violence, the film takes those same themes and filters them through the emptiness of personal revenge. How appropriate then that Emad, plays Willy Loman, a character who's powerlessness leads to his ruination.Much like About Elly (2009) however, The Salesman has a habit of reaching its moral conclusion far before reaching its actual, physical conclusion. The third act, while strong and refreshingly classic in its humanism, can't help but feel like it's dawdling; leaving its human frailties exposed like bleaching bones. Additionally, in today's political climate, Farhadi's chase for universality can't help but look like he's purposely pandering to his western audience. Don't get me wrong, the film is still very much a depiction of modern Iran in microcosm, but now there's a lens of compromised diplomacy.That said, The Salesman is still a strong work of social commentary that approaches the staid, workmanlike zenith of Farhadi's best works. Shahab Hosseini and especially Taraneh Alidoosti are pitch perfect as a young, childless couple that struggle with tough moral dilemmas and the feckless invisible structures that force them to plow through them.",

It almost apears Awards might now be given out to sell a trendy moviemaker or a 'product'. 'Salesman' is a vague, dreary movie in almost every sense - now this can be a good component if used to its full value but, this work is centred around an incident that happens in a very scant time - so scant, that all the elements that make up the largest percentage of the story are left wanting, as in, hardly believable or full of obviously undeveloped character motivation and situations (we also never truly find out 'precisely' what happened) Seems this could be all award-winning works now need...a grim situation, overblown to look stronger than the writing actually sets up - this appears especially so if there's also a 'politicised' slant.Add to this a plot background reference to a literary classic (\"Death of a Salesman\") to suggest this work must also be intelligent by association but, that 'association' can equally be seen as a highly questionable metaphor. The situations that make up the sum of this movies scenario are somewhat pretentious and far from worthy of such high praise (as many other worldwide viewers have clearly noted) Performances are routinely good but the material is just too thin to last the dismal 2 Hr distance. If you're inclined to think Awards must automatically represent high quality you may be satisfied - conversely, if you see the awards as 30% quality, 35% promotion and 35% 'political' - you just might find yourself joining others among the disappointed.",

            "content": "The Iranian film Forushande was shown in the United States with the title The Salesman (2016). It was written and directed by Asghar Farhadi. The movie stars Taraneh Alidoosti as Rana Etessami, and Shahab Hosseini as her husband, Emad Etesami.Emad is a teacher, and he's also an actor who is co-starring, with his wife, in Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman. (That's why the title of the movie is The Salesman.) They appear to be a happy, loving couple until things start to go wrong. The movie opens with a potential disaster--their apartment building is collapsing. They're able to get out safely, but they need to find another apartment. A fellow cast member offers them an apartment, which he owns as a rental property. The problem is that the former tenant hasn't cleared her belongings out of the apartment, and, although she's never on screen, she is an ominous presence throughout the film.Things start to go wrong, and they ultimately spiral out of control. People have to make choices, and often they make the wrong choice. The film is superb--great direction, great acting, great cinematography. However, you won't leave the theater whistling a happy tune.We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It's really an interpersonal drama, so it should work well on the small screen. The Salesman won an Oscar for Best Foreign Film. I haven't seen all the other films that were nominated, but I think this film was the best foreign film I saw in 2016. Try to see it--it's truly a brilliant movie.",

            "content": "Let's start with the fact that I like 'About Elly' from Farhadi and believe it still is his finest to date. Unfortunately, 'The Salesman' is a Felix Baumgartner-ish free- fall. Farhadi writes the dark side of the society. His works often depict the cynical side of human nature. And, his prose is usually honest. BUT:Regarding The Salesman:1- There is utterly limited characterization. Farhadi fails to build the main characters. Prior to the incident (first twenty minutes or so), we do not get a sense of who these people indeed are. Thus, after the incident, we cannot connect to the couple, even considering the nature of such an inhumane episode. There is no frame of reference, no baseline. 2- Characters are floppy and sense-less. I know that it would be difficult to 'talk' about such an incident and that's where Farhadi intends to go, BUT who COULD make spaghetti and listen to music 48 hours later? does not make sense. I have not seen more apathetic characters and I certainly do not see the 'destruction' of the family. Where is the inner conflict? show me! A perfect example would be the couple from Rabbit Hole (2010). I live with them. 3- The aforementioned destruction could be 'shown' in the house, instead of the set of The Salesman. Borrowing from Miller's play is futile, in my opinion.3- 'Mannerism' kills the script. Farhadi brutally eradicates the script by cutting the scene, 'make a statement' about the society, and proceeding to next one. These unnecessarily statements do not rise from the characters, but the director. Examples: Classroom or the roof. 4- There is no tension. Farhadi provides little regarding the incident, other than the aftermath of a bloody floor. I understand Farhadi ultimately favors linear narrative. But perhaps for this specific case, a chronological narrative weakens tension. 5- I was hoping to be impressed, at least, by the encounter of Taraneh (Rana) and the old man, but truthfully that is one clumsy barren scene. Everything - all the feelings - should be revealed on the old man's / Rana's look, but we get a disappointing shot and a sense-less \"sorry\". Just compare the look on Mads Mikkelssen in Jagten (2012 - Church scene) or even the looks on Gosling and Stone (La La Land - final scene) and the non-existent one here. Case in point.6- The plot is haphazard with several holes. It's not even remotely Cannes material, let alone winning the prize. I expected more with all the hype around the film, but am left with a confused chaotic film which leads us nowhere. Looking forward to Farhadi's next one.",

            "content": "Films are one good media for taking the pulse of a society at a certain moment in time, for surfacing explicitly or implicitly its problems, for making it known beyond borders of countries or cultures. Iran is a country little and badly known in the world. We may read or listen a lot about its politicians and external conflicts, we know very little about the day-to-day life in the country, about the problems, feelings and dreams of its people. This is why films coming from Iran raise interest and those coming from a fine film-maker as Ashgar Farhadi are among the best.Watching a film like The Salesman is an exercise not too different than the one we experience(d) when we are (were) watching in the 60s, 70s, 80s films coming from the Soviet Union, Poland, or other countries under Communist rule. It is important to watch what you see on screen to its most minuscule detail that can hide hints or symbols. It is even more important to think about what you cannot see on screen, which you know could not be said because of censorship, or maybe it was said and fell on the floor because of different types of pressure. This film is the story of a family drama triggered by the brutal attack on a married woman. She and her husband (both middle class intellectuals, amateur actors playing 'Death of a Salesman' in the evenings') do not go to the police to put a complain because they know the system is corrupt and biased against the woman, rather then protecting her and trying to find and punish the criminal. We are in the Middle East however, and honor plays an important role, so the husband engages in a personal vendetta which has as a goal not necessarily vengeance but recovering the honor of the victim and exposing the attacker to the blame of his own family. The subtle insertion of theater in film hints to many other aspects that are rather implicit than explicit - the attraction to the Western culture, the cosmetic changes brought to the play, actors, costumes in order to make it acceptable to the Islamic religious norms.There is another comparison to be made with another film that was a candidate this year at the Best Foreign Language Award at the Academy (which The Salesman won) - Paul Verhoeven's Elle. In both films we deal with aftermaths of brutal attacks on women - but what a difference between the attitude of the two women - and the reasons are clearly psychological and cultural.The film-making style looks familiar to viewers who have been exposed to Middle East cinema. The story telling, some of the dialogues, the relations between the characters reminded me dome of the Israeli 'burekas' movies, with families and neighbors interaction, with the mix of comedy and melodrama. Director Asghar Farhadi develops this approach much beyond its limits, aiming to reach a more international audience with the relation to Arthur Miller's play. He is helped by the splendid acting of his two lead actors Taraneh Alidoosti and Shahab Hosseini who both give expressive and discrete performances, full of controlled passion and dignity, which make the tough situations described on screen more easy to follow. I was less impressed by the final solution where life seems to follow its own rule and the characters lose voice in face of stronger forces. This sounded a little anti-climax and undecided. I will not say however more, in order to avoid telling too much about a film I do recommend to all viewers.",

It's a fabulous screenplay that revolves around one particular incident that ends up showing us the darker and deeper layers of these character and their relationships. It's a film that needs to have actors who are able to carry most of their emotions in the quiet moments and through their faces, and they do just that.

This film quietly unfolds, taking its time. Not having any notion of the plot going in allowed me to sink into Farhadi's rhythms and sense of place and allowed his turns of story to take me by surprise.

            "content": "'Crime and punishment' is a book by Dostoyevsky, but it could just as well haven been the title of Asghar Farhadi's recent film. It shows how a thirty-something couple copes with the aftermath of a violent crime. Rana is attacked by a stranger who entered the house while her husband, Emad was absent. The attacker escapes and Rana is taken to the hospital by the neighbours. Afterwards, she wants to turn the page as soon as possible and refuses to report the crime to the police. But her husband, Emad, can't bear the thought that the intruder gets away with it so easily.The film shows how Emad searches for the attacker, finds him eventually and ultimately confronts him. Farhadi shows how anger and the urge for revenge almost make him lose control. It's Rana who manages to prevent things from spinning out of control.As usual, Farhadi is a master in showing understated emotions. A clever gimmick is the way how the events influence their professional life: they are stage actors and play husband and wife in Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesman'. The play seems to serve as a theatrical mirror, reflecting the events and emotions dominating their private lives.Farhadi also weaves some nice observations into the story about the position of women in modern-day Iran. Rana doesn't want to go to the police, because she is not comfortable with having to go into detail about the sexual attack. The man who attacked her turns out to have been visiting a prostitute. One of their colleagues in the theatre company has to bring her young son to the rehearsals, because she is divorced. But to be clear: this is not a film about Iran. It could just as well have been set in any other country. It is about two people, about a crime, and about punishment.",

After that, the actress playing the victim does a great job to portray how traumatised her character is. Little by little, her character regains both physical and mental strength. Initially, I thought the wife blames herself for the incident, because of gender inequality in that country.

            "content": "I enjoyed this movie as I was watching it, with my admiration growing and reaching a crescendo up until about 10 minutes from the end, at which point things headed seriously south. But as the credits rolled and the distractions of the brilliance of the acting and execution disappeared a whole wave of questions came crashing down which pretty much destroyed the underpinning logic of the whole story and undoing any redeeming features it may have hadIf you look at the \"story\" scene by scene there is very little that stacks up as being logical or natural and the whole thing is exposed as a rickety structure stuck together by bits of string and sealing wax by the director/writer to make some point. While this lack of logic might be forgivable if the point was worth the deception, personally I fail to see what exactly that point is, let alone what it might be worth. Speaking of rickety structures, let's talk about the collapsing building first. Surely this must be the most ridiculously outrageous and unlikely scenario ever concocted to provide the relatively simple premise of someone having to find a new flat. Is the art of building in Tehran so basic that this sort of thing happens on a regular basis? Was that quick cut to a piece of digging equipment supposed to imply that this was the cause of this disaster? Really? And what on earth is the whole point of \"The death of a salesman\" side issue? If this is supposed to be the classic \"play within a play\" conceit, a la Saura's Carmen, then I must have missed something, for while indeed in the film's coda a (shirt) \"salesman\" may indeed have died, if there is any similarity beyond that it went right over my head. And the whole crucial set up of why Rana left the door open is totally tenuous to say the least. As for the culprit rushing off leaving his keys, his phone and his pick-up truck? Ridiculous. And just how did that glass get on the stairs and why did the culprit not have his shoes off? And while his socks were found, where were his shoes? And how come the pick-up truck, apparently a crucial part of at least 2 businesses, was allowed to remain at the flat for a number of days without any of said businesses missing it? And what is all the nonsense with the previous tenant leaving all her belongings at the flat, something that is entirely irrelevant to the story. And how did Ehmad suddenly end up at the Hospital and why is he so unmoved by his wife's plight? What exactly did happen to Rana we never find out - it is ridiculous to think the old man hurt her so we can only presume she slipped and hurt her head. Why was it not possible to find out more information on the man's phone, even if it was \"cancelled\"? Why was the pick-up truck not examined in detail? What was the point of that episode with Ehmad in the car and a lady wanting to change seats? Why would Ehmad think that the driver of the pick-up truck was the culprit when clearly it is a commual vehicle? Why did he not confront the suspect on the spot instead of making up some hare brain story about wanting to move some things? Why would the suspect actually agree to this, and why when he couldn't come in person would he send his future father in law who is half dead and lucky to make it up the stairs? Who is stupid enough to lock a half dead man in a closet for hours?This, then, is the house of cards that forms the backdrop to the \"story\". So what is the actual \"story\"? Basically it can be summarised in a very few simple sentences. A woman is \"assaulted\", although we never find out if this is because she was startled by a peeping tom and slipped, or whether she was bashed over the head. Said woman has PTSD, well fair enough. Woman's husband is not angry but resentful of woman's subsequent behaviour. Husband identifies the \"culprit\" and threatens to expose him to his family. His wife gives an ultimatum that if he does so she will leave him. For a moment all seems well and the culprit's family start to take him away. Then, for reasons only known to the husband he reneges at the last minute and exposes the culprit to his family. An ambulance arrives the culprit may or may not be dead and the wife walks out the door.If anyone can tell me the meaning of all this they are a better man/woman than I am. If the movie had stopped before Ehmad exposed the culprit it could at least have ended on a poignant note of redemption and forgiveness, a cliche perhaps, but at least a good one and one that would have redeemed the movie despite its many flaws. By allowing Ahmed to expose him the director destroyed any possible payout for the audience and all we are left with is a bunch of question marks set against an artificial world and involving people we really don't care too much about.In conclusion all I can do is echo what I have already said in my review of another movie by this director (\"About Elly\"), which is that this movie seems largely an academic exercise pretending to be something deeper than what it actually is.",

            "content": "Without it yet being an actual problem, watching this felt like Farhadi has become a bit too self-aware, dangerously close to falling into the black hole of his own creativity. A tad too stylized, a lashing too structured, The Salesman is still a profoundly personal movie, anthropocentric to almost a fault without ever crossing that line; a fine balance the filmmaker has proved to be masterful at keeping.The story is simple, held elegantly against the backdrop of Miller's Death of a Salesman; a play in which our heroes are portraying the main characters as a recreational activity. The protagonists' plight is being juxtaposed with that of Willy's and Linda's, elevating the sudden darkness befalling their happiness to an allegory pertaining the small; those innocuous details that can either support or break a union in the aftermath of a domestic crisis.Much like Willy's burden of mediocrity, Emad is being defined by his own perceived inability to successfully tend to his wife, Rana, in the aftershock of an attack that quickly adorns their skin with wrinkles of instability. Cracks appear, on their walls of their home, the build of their marriage, the very foundation of his mental equilibrium and in the process of his wife's healing, the tables are slowly being turned.Rana lifts her chin in subtle pride as she dusts the burden of self-pity off her bruised shoulders and ventures to reestablish herself in a state of weightless normalcy. All the while, Emad seems to be caving under the pressure of his own contradicting duality -- a man who desperately seeks to regain control of a suddenly derailed life, a husband needing to protect, shield and amend in vengeful anger while, simultaneously, mending in kindness, fear, and worry. Two people journeying through life side by side are now being torn to opposite poles in a way subepidermal enough to have you fearing for their relationship without even realizing at what point exactly you reached that emotional status.Farhadi's signature move, it would seem.My personal gripe. The Salesman cuts deep without pushing -- a beautiful movie featuring some stellar acting by almost everyone involved, no argument there. However, and much to my disappointment, I found it falling short during the third act.Emad's inner turmoil leads to many spasmodic, irrational reactions from the beginning of the tale but during the last part of the film, the character becomes unrealistic, like the final scene had been already filmed and Farhadi needed to mold something out of nothing to just get us there.Underwhelming finish aside, the overall outcome is still worth of tremendous praise, even if, for some of you who might end up sharing my views, it finishes not in thunderous applause but a thoughtful sigh of contentment.",

            "content": "Emad and Rana are a middle class couple living in an apartment building in Iran, which, for some unexplained reason, is being demolished without evacuating the tenants first. I guess the building codes in the Middle East are not as strict as here in America. The brooding husband and wife are forced to move to another place which had a mysterious previous occupant. Apparently, the woman who lived there was a prostitute with an extensive clientele. Emad is on his way home to the new domicile when his wife suffers a vicious, violent attack. Apparently, she has been mistaken for the last tenant. The couple are an actor and actress who are performing the very American play by Arthur Miller, \"Death of a Salesman.\" They are working at a small theater which, I guess, is the Iranian equivalent to off Broadway here in New York. Emad also works as a school teacher to pay their living expenses. The film moves back and forth between the stage play and Emad's obsession with catching his wife's attacker. This is a thoroughly depressing journey, and although the lead actors are excellent, I was totally drained emotionally by the not so happy ending. The Salesman is nominated for best Foreign film at the Oscar's, but personally I would pick \"A Man Called Ove\" as a better choice.",

            "content": "This review of The Salesman is spoiler free**** (4/5)WRITER-DIRECTOR ASGHAR Farhadi, has formed his career based on three main points that are: simplicity, originality and beauty and after his Oscar winning feature A Separation, he has become a household name all around Iran, this of course is no exception with his excellent latest The Salesman. A rape/revenge tale that comes natural with Farhadi's excellent storytelling which is formed over the simplest ideas and it's wonderful. Set in Tehran which looks stunning thanks to a brightly coloured aesthetic, we open with Emad (Hosseini) and his young wife Rana (Alidoosti) who are forced to move out of their home after being damaged from building collapse only to find that their new home was formerly owned by a prostitute. Taraneh Alidoosti is excellent as Rana, her performance after being horrifically attacked is clingy and stand-off-ish but being the strong-willed woman that she is - just goes with it and wants to let it go, she doesn't report it. Shabab Hosseini is also flawless as Emad - he doesn't like the fact that Rana wants to let it go, worried for her safety he is tied up in an endless investigation, but it turns out that this once popular school teacher is now tempted by simple yet brutal revenge, and is caught in an amateurish investigation trying to tackle evidence around the unknown assailant.Farhadi handles this beautifully - he's become the director that even Hitchcock would want to have by his side. As much as being stunning on screen it's sometimes difficult to watch as Rana tries hard to deal with this traumatized state. Farhadi makes us wait giving us information when it's precisely necessary, and there is a moment when it does come more than necessary. In a drastically long-stretched climax the information given from the perpetrator is needed as Emad with no weapon - except for a threat from a mobile phone call - making it more straight forward than most thrillers. Though longer than it needs to be this is an excellently pulled off moment. Typically given, it ends the overbearing shadow of the slow burn. Though seemingly hard to show it Rana takes this as a difficulty to keep going with the stage redo of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman (which is popular in Iran), Farhadi clueless, to its material. And not only that Emad's dwelt of Rana's trauma reigns it's strength over the film, Farhadi seems to be only focused on his attitude instead of hers. Which initially it should be the other way around; this could have flown much higher if Farhadi took that ability to present Rana's trauma instead of Emad's. But it still delivers.VERDICT: Farhadi's meticulous construction matches flawless performances and beautiful cinematography with solid participation into ordinary incidents and packs them into rich storytelling filled with resonant ideas.",

            "content": "The Salesman\" has a lot going for it, and I understand why the Academy voters felt good about honoring it with an Oscar. The drama is tense, and the morality is surely correct. Revenge is a blunter of other, more civilized emotions. I can't buy the whole package, however, because it doesn't fulfill its promise of matching the trauma within a contemporary urban marriage to the framing medium of Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\" I would have been content to follow the Iranian couple's drama alone, without the \"clever\" adjunct of the American classic, but since writer-director Farhadi draws such attention to Miller's play, I found myself constantly distracted by his misunderstanding of certain primary facets of that play.I realize several major critics, including A.O. Scott of the NY Times, have lauded how Farhadi uses \"Death of a Salesman\" to illuminate his tale of a modern rape and revenge--most of them laying stress on the \"sales\" aspect of one or more of the movie's characters who present a false facade to the world. Frankly, that's a very generalized reading, one idea plucked from the many themes at work in \"The Salesman.\" To me, the only scene in Miller's play that connects with \"The Salesman\" is in Willy Loman's hotel room, when his son Biff learns that his dad has a hooker in the bathroom. To his credit, Farhadi shows that exact scene for a time, but this focus, while apt as far as it goes, overlooks the deeper side of Willy, that his entire life is devoted to a false idol, an illusion, the \"American dream\" of every salesman, of making one's way in the world \"on a smile and a shoeshine.\" To Willy Loman, the only thing that matters on this earth is \"to be well liked.\" Where does this factor into \"The Salesman\"? None of the characters exemplifies that jovial spirit, verbosity, and fake good humor that characterize the salesman type. I kept wondering why Farhadi kept referencing Miller's play while leaving this out. But then he doesn't seem to have studied the play, or he wouldn't have cast such a youthful \"healthy\" leading man to play Willy. Nor would any theater director have permitted Shahab Hosseini to play a 1940s American traveling salesman with that beard! (A more believable Willy might be the elderly rapist who appears later in the film, but we never learn much about him, and he's not playing the part for the theater troupe.)Both of the Lomans are miscast. They are nearly 30 years too young, a serious matter for characters with a lifelong devotion to the capitalist creed and a nearly paid-off mortgage. The makeup artists have to work overtime to try (unsuccessfully) to age them, drawing attention to another strange detail. Do Iranian actors not do their own makeup? I'm not speaking of pampered film stars, but of so-called \"legit\" actors. Western actors take it for granted that, except for highly unusual cosmetic effects, the actor is responsible for his/her own makeup. I wondered if this was a movie director's wrong assumption about stage practice.None of this absolutely ruins what is strong in this film. It is certainly worth our time to witness city life in contemporary Iran, even if it is a glum vision overall. The tautness of the one-on-one encounters is mesmerizing. You can't look away. In the interaction of husband and wife, one can see all the glaring omissions and missteps that doom the couple--and may save viewers many hours of marriage counseling.",

            "content": "This won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 2017. Its director and script writer Asghar Farhadi is celebrated throughout the world as a great talent. I can see why. He's original and he gets great performances from his actors. Nonetheless I had to force myself to stay with this. It was so depressing in a most annoying way. The fear and the nearly all-consuming self-loathing that Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti) experiences after being assaulted in her own bathroom is in part culturally based, as is the plot of her husband Emad (Shahab Hosseini) for a secretive revenge.Rana's fear is real because she doesn't know who assaulted her, and part of her shame is understandable since she carelessly opened her door of their apartment without knowing for sure who was coming up. But a significant part of her shame is because the more conservative interpretations of Islam (and other tribal religions as well, by the way) blame the woman if she is raped. This complexity of emotions is part of what no doubt fascinated many viewers.But I stayed with the movie, or actually I returned to it the next day. I was surprised at the resolution; I was surprised at Emad's sense of guilt. Yes, a man should be there to protect his wife, and perhaps if had been quicker at the market nothing would have happened. And perhaps there is guilt because he didn't investigate the circumstances of the apartment rental more thoroughly. (Apparently the previous tenant was a prostitute.) So in a sense they moved into a house of prostitution, as it were. And it is not beside the point to realize that Emad is playing Willie Lohman in a small theatre production of Arthur Miller's acclaimed play, \"The Death of a Salesman,\" a character who is ashamed because he sees himself as a failure.Again we can see the complexities that Farhadi insists upon.Okay here are my problems with the movie. First though I should say that viewers who are not Iranian and not Muslim including myself may very well miss some of the subtleties and preconceptions of the action.1. Why the ambiguity about the rape? Or maybe it was clear and I wasn't able to discern that.2. Why is the guilty party a character who almost certainly could not commit the rape? (He could barely get up the stairs.)3. We know why Emad and Rana don't go to the police. (Only shame will result possibly without ever catching the perp.) However Emad's revenge plan of humiliating the assailant seems elaborate and slow to action. After all Emad has overwhelming evidence as to who did it. He just has to find him.4. The culprit's truck just sits there and then they move it. Is would seem that best strategy would be to report the truck as being parked illegally (do that yourself if necessary since you have the keys), call the police and see who shows up.But again I don't live in Tehran so I really don't know what would have been the best way to proceed. What I do know is that Farhadi might have guided the general viewer less opaquely.Bottom line: definitely worth seeing, but I suspect Farhadi's \"A Separation\" (2011) which I haven't seen is a better film.--Dennis Littrell, author of the movie review book, \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote\"",

            "content": "\"The Salesman\" is a pre-bad (worse than bad) movie; a nugatory one. It neither sells anything nor buy. It is unable to sell and buy and incapable of dealing or discussing at all.It's a not-yet-made, confused and passive movie to which the action happens- from the outside-. It doesn't have any sort of action of its own, let alone character. It's a movie with no story, script, directing, camera-work, or editing.The movie doesn't even have an acceptable \"what\" due to a hollow script to which anything enters and from which anything exits. The script lacks many necessary things but contains lots of useless ones, instead. Of course, nothing has been aesthetically removed from the script, for nothing is there in the first place. Thus the writer doesn't have anything at all to remove.The movie is incomplete, unfinished and \"open\". The director doesn't know that an \"open\" phenomenon is not a phenomenon yet. It can be open only after it is able to be closed and after it is completely finished.Our director, as if he knows that his \"The Salesman\" needs a lot of effort yet to be a movie, attends lots of interviews and attaches himself to his dumb movie. He pretends to be oppressed, spark controversy about himself, and soothe himself by making a \"modern\" pretension to be intellectual and relativist. Thus, he pleases himself for \"causing the audience to have a mental challenge\" and \"that the audience is full of questions while coming out of the theatre is of worth\" for him.One should remind him that it is not worthy at all if the audience come out of the theatre being confused by lots of unanswered questions. It is not worthy at all if all of those questions are about the \"what\" of the story but not \"how\" it is told. it is not worthy at all if the origin of the questions is the audience not facing a specific and finished story by which he can reach the \"how\" and experience.He (the director) has left us no other choice but to remind him that cinema is neither a horn nor a riddle. A work of art is a live experience, not a proposition or the answer to several questions. Art is not a statement, but the way of stating. The audience's challenge with a good work of art is intuitive and emotional, then intellectual. The intellectual who doesn't have the slightest idea of feelings, is one of the concept-oriented people who can never understand art.The audience's main question about this vague and passive movie is the following: \"Is someone raped or just attacked?\" In order to pretend that the movie is important, the director decisively says, in one of the interviews, that \"no one is raped.\" Nevertheless, the movie implies the opposite. Not in its mise en scene- which isn't actually there-, but by two dialogues; one is of the wretched violator's (\"I was tempted.\") and the other one is of the doleful victim's (\"I wish I were dead.\"). In another interview, with a Hitchcock sense of humor- which doesn't fit him at all- the director mentions that he hasn't been in the bathroom, so he doesn't know what has happened.",

It is a French-Iranian co-production, but selected and won the Academy Awards for Iran. From the well know filmmaker of that region whose film had already won the same award in the not so past. I'm not just addicted to Hollywood. I'm a film fanatic because I give equal preference to films of the whole world. So I have seen as many as this year's submission for the Oscars in the category of the Foreign Language Films. And there are lots better films than this, that even did not make into the final five. From my perspective, this is an okay film, even comparing with the rest of the fellow nominees, including that I thought that would win, 'Under Sandet'. The mess is all because of Trump effect, as same reason 'Moonlight' to win the main trophy.At least it was not an average film like 'A Separation', though not a masterpiece like 'The Past' that did not even nominated for the Oscars. It stands between them. The title name is not exactly relevant to the story. But it helped to extend the plot for an extra 20-30 minutes. An unnecessary subplot, which really were the boring parts. Or you can say, just to attract the western audience with their ingredient and that worked out as planned for the filmmakers. Except those theatre portions, the rest of the film and its storyline looked like I was watching a French thriller.It is about a young couple who are forced to relocate to another house after their apartment building was declared not safe anymore for some kind of construction taking place in the nieghbourhood which is affecting it. The man is managing his job at a school as a teacher and the remaining time as a theatre artist along with his wife. The life was as usual, till one day something bad happens to his wife at home in his absence. Now he's raged to find the culprit, but once if he did what happens and how the story ends was the another twist.\u275dIt's obvious you're not the one who found your wife the other day, otherwise you wouldn't say that.\u275eIt was a very slow start. I mean the opening scene was like racy. And then following, it slowed to build the momentum. That does not mean the characters were developed so well. It only moves forward with constructing what are all needed for later parts. Once it enters the third act, the scenario changes. It looked like another film, another genre. Too tense moment and tight plot for the grand finale. Yep, that is the part makes this film to forget everything you saw in the earlier.Whatever happened in that part, I felt it was right, though I think culturally it differs the outcome. I mean, that's not philosophically the Iran we know or the religion they worship. You can say the western films badly portrayed them in their films, but if you look at their history, the film ending was shocking. So I thought, the end chaos was for among themselves. If the outsiders (westerners) were involved, it would have been a differently dealt.Very good performances. But not perfectly written screenplay as I pointed out a few things in the earlier paragraphs. And another thing was, the character, particularly the mysterious one, I was not satisfied how it had been developed. He enters the frame only at the last moment. The narration was very suspense and a bit thriller, but then all the sudden everything comes crumbling down since the end was very near to cease the procession. My point is, how that X man was netted does not make sense in reality. Being a film, it has no problem at all.So, it was a good film, but not as good as it was praised or won the Oscars. Yeah, definitely worth a watch. The setting was very good, except the ending, as the opinion differs from people to people and the amount of damage on how to deal with such situation. Overall, a little good message at the end, but not exactly a moral message as it brings more destruction towards the GOOD over the BAD which always win with a strong sentimental grip, no matter whoever involved in it.6.5/10",

And, for a non-expert viewer like myself, the \"Iranian world\" is more or less terra incognita, which, considering all the political turmoil and notions of religious radicalism surrounding the country, makes one expect Iran to be something like what Argo showed us: a place where ruthless brutes are ready to kill and destroy everything that doesn't conform with their views of the ideals of the Islamic Revolution.Per se, such dense atmosphere may be a rich ground on which art with the great cultural suspense could grow. And The Salesman clearly draws some of its power from our expectations of inadequate reaction on its premise. A theater production based on some Western author's play that involves hookers and implies the actress being undressed - we can clearly sense the tension around the topic. Especially since the word \"censorship\" has been uttered.But, despite all the strong hints from the film, it is not about government repressions and torch-light processions. It's about a particular crime against a particular person - and the way the person and those close to her choose to react. The film clearly tries to capitalize on the stark contrast between the Western ways of dealing with such things and the Iranian ways. I guess we were supposed to be perplexed by the complexity of the social traditions and prejudices that make things we see as simple and straightforward so contrived in Iran. And if that was the case, I think the movie would have deserved the praise it had received.Yet, instead of clearly showing us the hard dilemmas that the Iranian people face when dealing with certain crimes, The Salesman tries to get away with simply piling up a bunch of self-contradictory behavior from the female protagonist. So, instead of learning _why_ she's so reluctant to oppose the issue that befell her, we have to guess what's so wrong with her head if she constantly blames others for her problems and pushes them around while actively obstructing their attempts to find a proper solution. And even the final showdown, that might clear the matters once and for all, obscures them even more instead.It might be the case that the behavioral schizophrenia expressed by the movie characters is an accurate reflection of a latent mass psychosis taking place in the Iranian society, oppressed so much that they prefer to quietly lose their mind instead of venting their frustration. In that case this film, however inconsequential and bizarre, is a cultural enigma giving us an insight of how people live in totalitarian societies. However, with the directing so vague and inconcrete, the film might bear a different message entirely, in that case being just yet another example how people are affected by Stockholm syndrome or crumble under their own sense of victimness. Whichever interpretation is true is not for me to decide, but trying to sit on two totally different and unrelated chairs at the same, and doing that so clumsily, is clearly not what I call good cinema.",

Juxtaposed to these scenes are ones showing him perform in an Iranian production of \"Death of a Salesman,\" the ultimate male mid-life crisis story. Like watching a car accident in slow motion, we see him move closer and closer to his goal even as his wife wants him to quit and we gain some sympathy, however slight, for the attacker.

            "content": "Iranian moral dramatist Asghar Farhadi's seventh feature THE SALESMAN wins him a second Oscar in the BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURE bloodbath amid a political fracas, which in my humble opinion irrevocably influences the end result. The titular salesman refers to our protagonist Emad (Cannes' BEST ACTOR recipient Hosseini), however he is not a salesman by vocation, but a high school teacher presently headlining a play of Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN, in which his wife Rana (Alidoosti) also stars. In the movie's opening, they are evacuating from a collapse-prone building where they live, and among all the ruckus, Farhadi smartly bookends it with two cracks on a windowpane before showing us an excavator working on the ground outside, a brilliant visual pointer to adumbrate what comes next: Emad and Rana's bonhomous relationship is going to crumble after an incident, and the rest of the film will sure-footedly take us to comb through their ordeal and elicit what is the crux. The incident occurs in the new apartment where the pair just moves in, although Farhadi opts to keep the happening off the screen, when someone buzzes their door, Rana takes its as given that it is Emad and leaves the door open without asking who it is (a plot devise looks implausible falling upon a Muslim woman who is alone at home, in the buff, though Farhadi furnishes the couple with a more Westernized predisposition), and later is assaulted by a man when she is in the bath, blood is spattered but she survives. Few details are revealed by a traumatized Rana, to an extend it, purposefully, hinders viewers' final verdict on this atrocity, it seems like the old chestnut of leaving audience to formulate their own judgement, but in this case, it recoils on our perception of the story after its lachrymose climax, during which Farhadi makes great play of his compassion manipulation excesses. But which side should we take is precisely predicated upon the missing pieces, otherwise, the entire drama degrades into a moot point. We can side with a perturbed Emad, who takes it on himself to track down the assaulter and implement his eye-for-an-eye revenge even impelled by Rana to keep the truth under wraps from the assaulter's family, or conversely, we should feel disposed towards Rana's magnanimous gesture, even a sordid soul deserves some sympathy, or, more deleteriously, is there a sideswipe on her too, because she should be partially responsible for what happened to her and should her relenting smack of an atonement for her own slip-up? Farhadi takes chances of complicating the central mind game out of artistic license, but the catch is that, regarding the situation's nature, this is not a case of splitting the difference, there are ambiguity residing in this imperfect patriarchal society where shame/humiliation often linked with a putrid waft of machismo, but if we look it through a more matter-of-fact angle, Rana is the victim here, both physically and mentally, why on earth she cannot have the final say on the subject matter? Maybe this is what Farhadi contends, but it doesn't pack an epiphanic punch as his previous works have done. Be that as it may, THE SALESMAN has its incontrovertible mastery in the vein, the paralleled three- act play-in-a-movie aptly mirrors Emad and Rana's fix in the real world (disillusion is the commonality) and the film's tension building-and-retaining process is par excellence in today's cinema-scape. The leading roles are entrusted to two Farhadi's frequent collaborators with arresting outcome, in particular, Shahab Hosseini amazingly holds sway as a reluctant terrorizer in the play off with a humbled Farid Sajjadi Hosseini, not the usual suspect of a sex offender, and not to mince words, Farhadi's dramaturgy still rocks, but a fly in the ointment is that his hand-picked moral tale needs some tweaking.",

            "content": "Ashgar Farhadi's \"The Salesman\" opens in a rather startling manner when residents are forced to evacuate their apartment before the building collapses. It wasn't an earthquake or some explosion but in the chaos driven by life-and-death emergency, we have no time to figure out the causes, only the effects matter, and the fact that Emad (Shoheib Hosseini) and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti) live together, andthat it's in Iran means they're married, and wherever they lived won't be their living anymore. It's the unwelcome beginning of a new life and playing mind games with Farhadi, we might even suspect a foreshadowing parallel between the collapsing of a home and the destruction of a marriage, or at the very least its foundations.Farhadi isn't exactly known for his uplifting and cheerful spirit and so even the prospects of looking for a new apartment, something rather usual, gets as eerie and suspicious, as in \"Rosemary's Baby\". The couple visits a house that belongs to a woman known by one of their acquaintances and partners on stage Babak (Babak Karimi) she locked her belongings in a little room, not room 237 as the stuff there is rather mundane: clothes, some skimpy ones, kids' toys... anything indicating a rather dissolute life (on the scale of Iranian society). The couple does the best to keep the stuff in good state but the woman never comes to retrieve them and Babak is so evasive about her that our instinct tells us the woman will be trouble and with such a title as \"The Client\", one can guess the services the woman used to perform and make two and two together.But it's interesting that the film was titled \"The Client\" in France rather than \"The Salesman\", which I guess refers to Emad, interpreting Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\" (a play or film I wish I could see before that one so I could draw some parallels). But the French adaptation chose an interesting angle for the client is an ambiguous term whose dramatic connotations can only be gathered after the pivotal event occurs, the real \"building collapse' so to speak. Emad's wife is victim of a sexual assault when she mistakes a stranger for her husband. The event is treated through an ellipse leaving unclears whether it was Farhadi censoring himself or a deliberate choice to maintain a shadow of mystery. She's taken to a hospital, she's traumatized and Emad feels guilty for having let that happen. Only traces of blood in the stairs and a delivery van left in the garace serve as clues... while it's disconcerting that there's no real investigation, we either presume the police botched the case or the couple wanted to keep it silent. This is a society where people would rather lynch a criminal than play CSI to catch him and maybe there's a possibility that the crime could bring such disgrace to Rana, although everyone in the neighborhood is empathizing with the couple.Farhadi toys with ellipses so many times that I was never quite certain whether they were narrative choices or necessities, and there's a middle section in the film destined to highlight Emad's impotency and question his own masculinity, his leniency with Babak who seems to have brought all the trouble, his apathy during an incident with a female cab passenger and his relative coolness with the students that end up backfiring on him. Emad, a man working on plays, on narratives and characters' arcs is totally disarmed by the anticlimactic randomness of life and the arbitrariness of his predicament. Why did he have to be his wife? He might as well ask himself why the building had to collapse?But the toll is too much for Emad who can see the hopelessness in his wife's spirit and the inevitable impact it has on their personal and professional life.. and it gets worse when he realizes the mysterious woman had many lovers (including Babak) and finds money in the drawer suggesting that the assaulter paid his wife like a prostitute, adding insult to injury. The realization about the money is masterfully played in a scene where they have a spaghetti dinner with one of their friends' boy and can't even finish the meal when they understand it was bought with the dirty money. The symbolism is powerful in the way the trauma has been materialized in something as mundane as a simple meal, getting right on their plates. That last straw finally prompts Emad to pull himself together and find the assaulter himself.Then comes my problem with the film: the resolution is way too long, once the so-called Client is found, there's a desire of humiliating the man that is so fierce in Emad's mind that it turns him into a vengeful predator. It doesn't help that the man is played by Farid Sajadhosseini who looks genuinely remorseful and frightened once he's cornered. Of course having the crime in mind might help us to empathize with Emad but this is the point where Farhadi's choice of ellipses backfires. We never see the man attacking Rana but we do see Emad harassing, locking, blackmailing with the man and causing such a stressful situation it's a miracle his weak heart was still holding. Rana's reaction seems more humane and understanding, and that she could confront her assaulter might certainly help her to recover... but as if Farhadi got carried away by the tense atmosphere, he didn't want his characters to get off too easy from their ordeal and he wanted one last act from Emad to ruin everything again.Maybe some people just don't have the dispositions to act mercifully once maybe Emad found himself as cruel and vengeful as a lynching mob, maybe he had too much to prove to himself or maybe Farhadi didn't just want to grant us a bittersweet ending... if people's got to learn a lesson, it's got to be the hard way!",

I didn't really understand the choice of title for the movie (is the play-within-the-film really so important to the film as a whole?) and its opening half is slow, painful but not particularly enjoyable to watch. The second half is much stronger: instead of a typical stupid Hollywood \"revenge\" plot, we actually have a delicate (though suspenseful) drama that centres of the importance to us of how we are perceived by others.

Sharply lensed as are all Iranian films these days and earnestly if unconvincingly acted, this is a tedious story about a young married couple involved in a small theater production in Teheran of Arthur Millers Death of a Salesman -- whence the original title. They have to move into a makeshift apartment when the building where they originally lived in is threatened with collapse at the beginning of the picture. The apartment they temporarily take over formerly belonged to a prostitute, it turns out, who received her clientele there. One night a regular client of hers not realizing she has moved comes up for some fun and games but is so peeved to find the innocent actress wife there instead of the professional hooker he desires that he clubs her over the head from behind and sends her to the hospital. (whether he did anything else is not made clear but perhaps vaguely hinted at as a collateral damage possibility). She is now in a state of shock and constant fear because she didn't actually see her assailant, is too ashamed to make a police report, and fears he may return. The rest of the picture is devoted to the devoted husband's tracking down of the unknown man who perturbed his wife to the point where she is a now a nervous wreck. However, Dirty Harry he is not and his vengeance when he finds his man will get very lumpy to say the least. This is the kind of picture that gets more and more boring as it trudges along for two hours to a dippy conclusion but keeps you from walking out only because you want to find out who this mysterious attacker will turn out to be -- and then it leads to a lengthy lethargic letdown, the point perhaps being vaguely hinted at that vengeance isn't always worth the effort it takes to achieve. Mushy muddled morality at best. Well, even monkeys sometimes fall from trees.Ps: Monday morning. At the closing ceremony on Sunday night the pitiful script of \"Forushande\" was incompr\u00e9hensibly awarded the Best Scenario prize and Lead actor Shahab Hosseini received the \"Masculine Interpretation\" award for his sincere effort in a losing cause.

Not among his best, but still very good But hey, the guy won his second Oscar for it, after the one for A Separation in 2011. And that don't happen too often in the Best Foreign Film category.

            "content": "Because their own home has become uninhabitable, a young couple (Emad and Rana) temporarily moves into an apartment that has been recommended by a colleague. The previous occupant turns out to be a prositute, and a client of this prostitute harrases the woman by accident (not knowing that the prostitute has moved away). Emad tries to track down this client. During the movie this becomes an obsession for him.The film begins rather confusing with images of a bed on a theater stage (Emad and Rana are members of a theater-company that is performing \"Death of a salesman\" by Arthur Miller) and the evacuation of a flat that threatens to collapse. Both have only an indirect link to the main story. In Iranian cinema the \"play in the play\" concept is not unknown. Look for example to \"Through the olives trees\" (1994, Abbas Kiarostami). But Asghar Farhadi does not belong to the generation of filmmakers who was responsible for the Iranian new wave in the beginning of the '90. I do not see a direct link between the \"Death of a salesman\" play and the main story of the movie. Links suggested in other reviews seem far fetched to me.The movies of Farhadi are most of the time relational movies in which he pays tribute to a writer as Tennessee Williams and a directer as Elia Kazan. The collapse of the building in the beginning of the movie is not only the introduction to the main story (the couple needs a new home) but has also symbolic significance. The cracks in the wall symbolise the cracks in the marriage that will arise later in the movie. The strongest point in the movie is how it evolves from a thriller (who donnit) to a relation drama. In this drama questions arise such as:\nIs Emad protecting his wife or his own ego?\nIs Emad protecting or destroying his marriage?\nHow is it possible that in a modern man like Emad the old fashioned value patterns take the upper hand so quickly?\nAs befits a good movie, it only pioses the questions and does not answer them.After the Iranian movie \"A seperation\" (2011) Farhadi made the more international movie \"The past\" (2013). \"The salesmen\" (2016) is again typical Iranian. In movies in which previous occupants have an influence, the previous occupants most of the time have a psychological defect (compare \"Le locataire\" (1976, Roman Polanski)). In this case the previous occupant is a prostitude and the neigbours refer to her in the vaguest of terms (the woman who often had male visitors).",

This leaves the viewer in the position of judge rather than witness as we can only surmise events from what others have told. The movie's first half is good though relatively plain. But, as the viewer learns later, it is a build-up to an unforgettable second half. This is a wonderful contrast to the many films where the opposite is true. When a movie's second half is the better one, the viewer is given an unofficial extension of the movie as its impact continues well after the ending.Director/writer Asghar Farhadi brings to \"The Salesman\" similar themes (and greatness) as he did with \"A Separation\" (2011) and \"The Past\" (2013). Among the various characters, we in the audience can understand why some would hate others but, by the end, we have compassion for every single one of them especially after we learn more information about the \"villain\". In this way, Farhadi is not just a great storyteller but a fine humanitarian as well. By giving all viewpoints sincerely, he challenges viewers to not only do reconsider anger in our personal lives but possibly in how we look at the world as well. This is noble considering the current state of our world.Hosseini and Alidoosti are quite good in their performances but the standout performance comes from Farid Sajjadi Hosseini as a character who enters the picture only in the second half and leaves the most impact in the movie.Like \"A Separation\" and \"The Past\", \"The Salesman\" is food for the soul and it confirms Farhadi as one of the best movie-makers in the 2010s.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Screenplay by Asghar Farhadi",

            "content": "\"...how beautifully fragile are we that so many things can take but a moment to alter who we are for forever?\"\nSamuel Decker ThomsonAs we open to the stage being set through the moving facades and focused dim-lights of a half-furnished empty theatre (the dress-rehearsal of Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\" by the protagonists and friends), we soon cut towards the cacophony of evacuating a building - with its fa\u00e7ade collapsing. Through such irony and chaos, we are introduced to Emad (Shahab Hosseini, \"A Separation\") and Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti, \"About Elly\") - a married couple in their 30s harbouring those collective dreams, who were picking up their household and securing a new apartment.Little did they know that moving houses shall cost them a home. The new apartment had a shady history - the last dweller being an escort woman, who hurriedly left without her belongings citing issues with her clients. Then one ominous day, Rana alone in the new apartment is mistaken for her previous tenant and assaulted by an intruder. Though only physically hurt, she struggles terribly with her mental trauma which also got the better of Emad.\nAgain, as they try picking up their lives while goofing up their parts in the play, they both knew that it would take time - but, only if time healed all wounds, esp. the ones given by the 'times' itself.So, as Rana sets her foot down to avoid a revenge (and subsequent guilt) with the intruder (an old, rattled carpet-seller) Emad painfully complies by letting the man go with just a slap. Soon enough, they find him passing-out with a heart-attack surrounded by the unaware family of his own.\nMuch like the Salesman who courted failures of his profession and personal life, Emad and Rana tried their hardest to reinstate the tranquillity of their marriage. In the aftermath, as the drained out couple sits for another pre-run make-up session, their eyes draw a blank semblance of ghosts of their shared grief.The film carries \"story-within-a-story\" format (Miller's \"...Salesman\" and Farhadi's Emad and Rana) sharing the theme of the \"abomination of living\". Asghar Farhadi's treatment towards his pivotal middle-class Iranian life (familiarized in his first Academy Award-winning - \"A Separation\") retrospect through one's own misgivings and vulnerabilities is surprisingly inspiring.Nevertheless, writer-director Asghar Farhadi builds up an innocent-seeming ambience and then, almost mercilessly, smashing it to smithereens. Still, this film isn't a usual tragedy; neither a completely unusual one. It does portray genuine apathy but doesn't drop to any deliberate pathos. Without overselling anything, \"the Salesman\", evokes some reassurance even while fighting a losing war.This well-shot (Cinematography by Hossein Jafarian \"About Elly\") work is masterfully merged with one of the best screenplays of previous years, winning dual Cannes Awards (\"Best Screenwriting\" for Farhadi and \"Best Actor\" for Hosseini) and further acclaim by a second Oscar for \"Best Foreign Language Film\".\nIn a sensitive global-political environment, it is a slight nod to the times that we live in where we may have to not just protect but nurture our families with utmost care for crafting a better future.Heartbreaking and Remarkable! An 8.5/10.",

I've been meaning to check it out at some point, and finally had the opportunity to watch it on an airplane during a flight. I've heard of A Separation but never watched it. Going in pretty blind into this film, I was very pleased with the end product. I read Death of a Salesman in high school and was able to spot some parallels.The film is about a husband and wife who work in theatre (on a production of Death of a Salesman). One night their apartment starts collapsing so they move into a new apartment. Soon the wife gets attacked in the shower while waiting for her husband. The husband becomes consumed with finding out who attacked his wife and attempts to pursue the culprit even as relationships around him start falling apart.A lot of people didn't find this to be as good as A Separation, or so I've heard. I thought the script for the film was quite sharp. Like Billy Loman in Death of a Salesman , Emad's relationship is on the rocks. He must also try to avoid the humiliation of what occurred within his family and must wrong the right. While the film is a bit of a slow burn on finding out who committed the act, the clues leading up to the reveal and the ride is very fun to be a part of.I found the last 30 minutes or so of the film to be powerful and it also helps to ascend the film to a higher rating. Its gripping and hard to keep your eyes off of what happens next. Its suspenseful but yet innocuous You know there's no immediate danger to the lead but wow its a joy to watch what transpires. I will have to eventually check out A Separation, especially if its more acclaimed than this.8/10",

When one couple move to a new flat, the wife (Taraneh Alidoosti), an actress, alleges she has been sexually assaulted by a stranger who has entered the home causing a strain in the marriage to her husband (Shahab Hosseini).Once again director Asghar Farhadi strikes drama gold with a drama about how an upsetting event can rupture a loving family unit and the domestic setting. He did it previously with such films as A SEPARATION (2011) and THE PAST (2013). This time he has expanded out somewhat in making the couple actors who are attempting to stage a production of Arthur Miller's 'Death of a Salesman' with a plot that invites comparison.

I also found the descriptions of Iranian society to be interesting. The couple doesn't want to go to the police, which leaves them with few options.The couple's relationship begins to fray and we witness what happens to the assailant. Interspersed are scenes from Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\" Most obviously, the scenes parallel each other. I haven't read or seen Miller's play in 30 years, though, and I think reading or viewing it before seeing this film would make the film make more sense.I'm not sure if there was a main moral \"point\" here but what I interpreted, through my own lens, is that it could be saying that regardless of culture or time period, men are the same. You could see it as a feminist film if you wanted to.",

Putting yourself in the shoes of Rana (the victim of a rape) and Emad (your loved one is the victim) you can imagine yourself having the same reaction after the accident happens to you. The scene on the roof (also exists in the trailer) when Emad comes to look for Rana and Rana seems to be scared a bit even when Emad calls her was among my favorite scenes of the movie. I loved how this movie shows the psychological and emotional effects on the assault victim and how it is even so difficult for Rana to describe the event to police.

            "content": "I have become a bone fide fan of Asghar Farhadi's work through the films A Separation & now, The Salesman. His brand of real, authentic, drama guarantees a riveting watch, as his film's subjects are everyday people & his conflicts are grounded. In the end, the output is always relatable, elevating the suspense further as audiences are able to imagine themselves in the perilous situations faced by Asgar's characters.In the Salesman, we follow the couple Emad & Rana, whose lives are turned upside down when an unwelcome visit tears down their solitary existence. As the couple cope with its aftermath, we see Emad seized with impotent anger & Shahab Hosseini portrays this to perfection. His confused reactions & measured inner rage, were transparent & absorbing, without the need for over dramatization. Taraneh Alidoosti was just as exemplary, successfully conveying the trauma coming from Rana's unimaginable ordeal.Apart from the acting, Asgar's screenplay also deserves praise. He is able to create unnerving tension, fueled by slow burning resentment between the couple. He veers away from the customary revenge plot as well, delivering a memorable ending that is quite powerful.The film's only drawback, is its lengthy runtime. Despite the effectiveness of its brooding pace, a few scenes could've been left out with little impact to the film's overall suspense.Overall, although the Salesman is a tad less mesmerizing than A Separation, it remains quite an achievement and is still a solid entry in Asgar's filmography of sincere & grounded stories. It is hands down, beautifully acted and exquisitely written, with an engrossing tension filled pace & an ending, that will leave you breathless. I strongly recommended this film for those who appreciate substance over flare.",

But I'm not a fan of his pacing or how he plays out the drama. I had low expectations as \"A Separation\" lost me due to the unrelenting yelling between its characters. \"The Salesman\" was more lively and allowed its characters to have more emotions. But two things ultimately distracted me: the first was the uneven pacing. The movie would pick up but then drag, and the worst part being the final act; just as the dialogue, drama, and suspense were at its best, and Farhadi has you feeling empathy for everyone, he does not know when to quit, and gives us almost 20 minutes of people crying.The second one was: I realized that he was just making an Argentine film. If you've seen Argentine cinema, that you'll notice that, aside from the occasional dark comedy, they're mostly slow-paced melodrama about relationships between family members and the communities, where people go from being numb to an ultimate eruption of emotions. Even their thrillers play out this way. Shahab Hosseini looked and acted like Ricardo Darin, down to the body language and linguistic pacing. Thus, I felt like I had seen this movie a dozen times before.It is no surprise to me that Farhadi's next film is set in Argentina and involves Darin.",

As the try to restrain the emotions that are left to simmer and grumble beneath the surface, they do their best to reclaim the normality in their lives. Mr Farhadi virtually took the same elements that had been engaging and successful in his 2011 child-custody drama, A Separation, but this time, he shuffled those elements a bit, used a way more darker color palette in detailing life in contemporary Iran and added a theatrical play in the equation. Having seen only two of his films so far, I can't assume that this is a recurring style in his body of work, infusing that element of mystery in a domestic drama setting where the audience gets to observe the protagonists collect clues and hints that they eventually then assemble like a pieces of jigsaw puzzle only to discover a grotesque image of some uncomfortable truths. And these are the spectacles I always enjoy witnessing. I would definitely look forward into checking out some of his previous works and anticipating his future ones because what these sorts of films do to me is the same thing that the actress' kid did in this film when Rana (the wife), out of boredom, borrowed and took him home with her, added some curious and insightful doodles into the graffiti and scribbles already present in the walls of my mind. My rating: A-plus",

He crafted a simple yet thoughtful script that kept me on edge the hile film.This film talks about how problems come to us when we don't expect them nor we don't expect them from a certain person. And also talk about human right that we are always trying to get by our hands even if it's wrong, and talks about desires that come to any person at any age.Things are better to be forgotten in life, and if something bad happens but it didn't hurt us to death (meaning we are still alive), it's means to leave it to God, and he do everything by his way.Is an old man forgiven of everything because he is at his last steps in his life? Or human rules will apply to everyone? When revenge will stop? Is it right to revenge? What is right? And what is wrong? Is those to words created and we living by this two words philosophy? Is our life like a theatre stage and we are all acting? And when the show end means that life end? When we act dead in theatre or film, does we feel it, or are we all dead?",

In this movie, I am not talking about whole Iranian cinema because I could not know, as I realized that character Babak(who was having affair) and the older guy with heart problems (who caused main character to be wounded on the head) are Azerbaijani Turks. Taking out a group of one ethnicity and turning them into negative symbol of everything that I talked about is very dangerous. It should be eliminated as soon as possible. May be that was not the issue at all and that was a coincidence but I felt that way. I like these kind of movies which is about normal life events not surreal and Utopias, lies etc..",

The subject matter makes it hard not to vilify the antagonist but Farhadi manages to do so by shedding light on their layered character and motives. Just as in real life, the people who do evil are not pure evil themselves.The realistic portrayal of the movie also makes watching the movie a self-exploration journey. You can't help but put yourself into the shoes of the characters and think what you would have done differently.",

            "content": "First of all let me tell you that don't mix up yourself trying to find clues between the story of this movie and the original Arthur Miller's play because the plot has another layer inside and that is The Cow (1969) which you can see to grasp it. Of course that film is among 1001 films you must see list by itself. Only remember that this is an Asghar Farhadi's film so you have to expect something like A Separation or even the better About Elly. Secondly unlike what some are saying the Academy did a good job by choosing this movie over others just like what happened in Cannes film festival when The Salesman won two prizes for best screen play and best actor while for example Toni Erdmann didn't win anything at all. What critics are saying is proving that too. They said about Toni Erdmann for example that it is a dull prolonged version of The Birdman (2014). One critic was saying that when finished watching it he felt just like watched the Birdman once again and of course a much more prolonged and dulled version. On the other hand Variety is praising The Salesman and it's director Asghar Farhadi as he is a very smart director. Also The Salesman grossed more than the other nominees in it's world wide screening and even with fewer theaters comparing to the others and also IMDb users' higher ratings all are proving that the Academy did a great job.One signal which i can give you why Variety is praising Farhadi is when in the movie for the first time the protagonist Emad meets the old man who is the antagonist. There you can see that Emad doesn't know the old man at all and is not aware a bit that this is the man who attacked his wife. But in the continue how the truth is unfold and how everything reveals to him is what proves that Farhadi is not an ordinary director and that he really deserved his second Oscar and all the praising by Variety and others. If he was an ordinary director something by accident for example was to happen to reveal the story but it's not. And from this point the horror and suspense is beginning and that's what Farhadi is master in. You just remember that Farhadi is the Hichcock of Asia and you never will say about his films ordinary again. At the end of the movie when the old man is trapped by the now monstrous Emad there you can see all the horror and suspense which you can not see in any other movie but only in a Hichcock's perhaps.",

The story in between is quite, sublime unfolding of disaster.Rana and Emad are a modern day couple living in Tehran , who are performing together in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\".Their house collapses , they move to a new house and something very bad happens.the redemption and the revenge form the crux of the story.The movie is slow , but unlike in more popular movies that is its strong point.It dwells slowly in the unfolding of human emotion through a series of devastating events. Asghar Farhadi's biggest strength is ambiguity.Throughout the story he leaves the viewers in a blur where they have to to make their own assumptions to move forward.The final act like those in his other movies is deeply moving and slowly devastating. Farhadi gives us a very universal interpretation of the emotion of men and women, where the man wants revenge and women wants to forgive and forget. He also uses the character of Emad as a metaphor for 'The Salesman\" in Miller's play and intricately shows his gentle yet urgent desperation.",

Great Storytelling: The basic element for every movie to be successful is obviously entertainment, and we're not talking about cheap emotional Hollywood manipulation here, no no; this is not like Fast and Furious or Transformers crap. This is a very good example that shows that good cinema has not necessarily to be boring, we know movies are about emotion and excitement to; so this fine film takes us on a riveting ride that any viewer will suffer and enjoy at the same time.2. Flawless Cinematography crafting: It has also, a very neat craft in all technical aspects: Script, Directing, Performances, Photography, etc. You can feel since the beginning that you're seeing a very well crafted movie and surprisingly it makes justice AGAIN! To their director's reputation as if it were not already enough with his other 4 previous movies. This is a real talent (Asghar Farhadi) you have to recognize here.3. Political and Social Pertinence Critique: Real art has to be self-aware of his power to influence people and change society, so art-house movies have a very political subtext development. There's so many crucial subject matters and comments on this movie: Ethical and Moral limits, Revenge and Forgiveness, Women situation on Iranian society, Family Values, and so on. So this piece has a big background behind as always.If you're not convinced yet to give it a chance, then it means you haven't read well, do it again if necessary.",
