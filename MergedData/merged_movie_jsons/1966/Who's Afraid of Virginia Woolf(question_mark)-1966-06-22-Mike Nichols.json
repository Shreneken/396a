            "content": "An undisputed classic that chronicles every appalling moment of a drunken night in hell as middle-aged George and Martha tear each other, and their guest, to pieces.Elizabeth Taylor proves categorically that she was a truly great actress. Her Oscar-winning performance as the psychologically tormented Martha is one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema. Taylor's imperceptible shifting from sadism to tenderness, from bullying condescension to exhausted vulnerability, is a masterclass in character building. Martha is a truly monstrous character, and yet Taylor is able to imbue her with sympathy, allowing you brief glimpses of the warm and lovable woman she could have been.Richard Burton is equally magnificent as George; an ageing, failing college professor whose initial meekness gives way to a raging torment all of his own. His verbal sparring with Taylor, like two pit-bulls in the ring of an endless and bloody dogfight, has become legendary. Every word drips with malice and contempt, every sentence is designed to cut the deepest wound. At times, it becomes painful to watch, but like true train-wreck television, you cannot drag yourself away from the inevitably terrible conclusion.Quite possibly, this is as close to perfect as movies can get; beautifully written dialogue, deeply complex characters, an evolving and suspenseful storyline, beautiful photography, and a wonderfully understated score by Alex North. Nominated for 13 Academy Awards in 1967, but lost out to A Man for All Seasons and Born Free to win only 5.\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" \"I am.\"",

            "content": "Ailing couple George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor) invite a young couple over for a late-night drink - much to quiet and repressed George's annoyance - and what starts off as a twisted game by sultry Martha to annoy her husband and get her way with young stud Nick (George Segal) ends up in a horrific duel of wits.Adapted from the play and boasting very few locations, \"Virginia Woolf\" is notable for many unsuspected reasons. Designed for the stage, the film makes the story uniquely cinematic and tense, amped up by stunning photography (in Black and White, a daring choice in 1966). The younger leads are superb, but Burton and Taylor still manage to walk away with film, giving stunning renditions of the world's most demented couple. They make the surreal dialogue hurt and touch in ways never thought possible.Though there are countless reasons to recommend this jewel of a film, there are also reasons why one would wish to avoid it. This is the kind of film that makes you feel like having a showing (or a very concentrated drink) to wash away the grit and human evil and pain absorbed. You'll feel dirty, but in a way you'll also feel enlightened: that a small character film can carry more punch than any explosion-packed blockbuster out there is a thing of beauty indeed!",

            "content": "Edward Albee's award winning play, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ran for 664 performances on Broadway and just closed down when this film version made its debut in 1966. The Broadway play was set entirely in the living room of George and Martha's home and starred Uta Hagen, Arthur Hill, Melinda Dillon, and George Grizzard. All eminently respectable players, but none of them exactly movie box office.This film was destined to make money when the most publicized couple of the decade, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, chose it as a star vehicle for themselves. Of course what was not clear was how well a one stage play would adapt to film.It adapted very well and went quite beyond one stage. The action of the film moved effortlessly to an all night diner at one point with some stops along the way. You'd hardly know the story as originally told only had one setting.There's no real plot to it. For reasons I can't fathom this middle aged and bitter couple George and Martha have a younger couple, Nick and Honey, over to their house at two in the morning. I don't know about you, but I'm usually not my best at that time. Also they had just come from a party at Martha's father's house. Martha's dad is the president of a college and George teaches there. Nick and Honey are a newly hired professor and his wife.The late night and the liquor bring out the worst in everybody. A whole lot of ugly truths get told.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf was the summit of the professional team of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Playing against type, Elizabeth Taylor got her second Oscar the one she felt she earned. She always disparaged the one received for Butterfield 8 as it came on the heels of her well publicized pneumonia bout.In fact all four members of the cast were nominated with Sandy Dennis winning Best Supporting Actress. Ironically Richard Burton didn't win, losing to Paul Scofield for A Man for All Seasons. I guess the Academy voters figured Burton would get another shot. He never brought home the big prize though.George Segal usually gets overlooked. This film and Ship of Fools was the start of his long career, but no Oscar for him either.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is quite the indictment against marriage, especially after the love has died. It's far from the whole story of marriage. There are many who stay married longer than George and Martha and happily. But it wasn't in Edward Albee's life experience to draw from. But this should be seen to see Liz and Dick at their very best.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf leaves no scabs or stones unturned with the characters. George and Martha are a couple who have a marriage that is truly love-hate. They can never be called too unemotional, though to say whether or not they're being truthful at all in the 'games' they play with married Nick and Honey is a little trickier. Martha invited them- at her father's insistence (he IS the chairman of the university where George and Nick are professors)- at two in the morning for a quick drink. Or rather, make that many drinks, like chain drinking, if one could call it that, where George and Martha prove themselves as pros in that area, with bitter slinging of enraged bouts of bile at one or the other. This goes on the rest of the night, also leading to a roadhouse on the way to drive a flustered Nick and hammered Honey home, and then it starts all over again, with Nick and Honey picking up the tortured and, as well, fractured personalities of this middle-aged couple. Bitter, enraptured, hateful, and, in a way, also sort of filling a void, George and Martha become two of the most powerful characters in modern drama.Edward Albee's play is full of the kind of stinging dialog that made it controversial in the 1960s, and today it still retains its potential for hitting its characters on to the audience in a shockingly overwrought and, in connection with this, very funny manner. How can one not cringe and give a laugh of relief/perplexity when George goes to get a shotgun after getting p-o'd by Martha and then opening it up to everyone's shock as... an umbrella! There's a dementia to these characters, but it's one that makes for the kind of drama that is lacerating and, as off-putting as the guessing game that the son element becomes in the equation (dead or not dead?), it somehow works. This was before most dramas of today, which are made with that big colossal twist that suddenly jolts the characters into perspective. Here, it just makes them more human and fallible and deconstructed. As Mike Nichols directs it, he doesn't shy from getting personal with his angles, close and intrinsic as, in a weird way comparable with, Bergman's Persona, also released that year.What Nichols and Albee present for audiences is a logical next step following other plays from before them that broke ground from the likes of Miller, Beckett and, especially, Williams- it's more adult, or rather more for mature audiences (the first quasi rated R movie ever released), and it hits to a cynical nerve that was further gestating by this time in America, that everything would not be alright in the American marriage, that something, as Martha says, will \"SNAP!\" It should also be mentioned, acting here is classic, fearless. Burton and Taylor have rarely been as good as they are at digging so deep into these characters that, especially with Burton, we can't imagine these people being anyone else. It takes a little to get used to Segal and Sandy Dennis (the latter because her character isn't quite as \"deep\" as the others), but then again their characters are the uncomfortable outsiders, \"us\" as one might say (however, as the play peels the layers away from the characters they're all rotten and ultimately very vulnerable instead of just \"normal\").It packs a punch, it jiggles its little glass full of bourbon or brandy or gin, and as a first feature from its director it could only get better from here. It's a dangerously fun, dangerously emotionally violent picture. Will look forward to seeing it next time it's on TV",

The film is brilliantly directed by Mike Nichols, who successfully manages to prevent the characters fall into caricature. The acting drives the movie, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton both give I feel career-best performances and exude a great chemistry.

            "content": "It's hard for me to accept a film as perfect. This is partly because of IMDb \u0096 the movie ranked highest on the Top 250 list ('The Godfather') has a mere 9.0, meaning there is ten points worth of things wrong with even the best film ever made. What IMDb voters fail to realize is that if a movie has an intention \u0096 a purpose \u0096 and it serves that purpose effortlessly and hits every note that it's supposed to hit without even the remotest hint of an off key, it is perfect by its own right, and therefore worthy of a ten out of ten. 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' is one of those movies.The plot is ecstatically simple: a troubled married couple (Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton) has a younger and \u0096 we assume \u0096 happier couple (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) over late at night for quick drinks. The reason for the get together is that Martha's (Taylor) father runs the university where George (Burton) and Nick (Segal) work, and the father told them to 'be nice' to the younger couple, so Martha invited them over for a late party. Like I said, the plot is simple, but the characters are so deep and complex it'd take a whole lot more than 1,000 words to describe them correctly (but I'll try with what I got).The film starts with George and Martha coming home from a late party. Both are drunk (Martha is a loud and obnoxious drunk but George just has a headache) and Martha constantly berates George when he fails to come up with the name of the Bette Davis movie she's thinking of (and dozens other reasons). It's early in the movie so we don't know if her insults are for real or if they're just a way of being playful with her husband. George acts to stone faced that we can't tell if he's being hurt or played with.It's when Nick and Honey (Sandy Dennis) come over that we get to really see how George feels. Martha insults him, calls him names, yells at him while Nick and Sandy look on, baffled as to whether they should laugh or not. As the insults keep on coming George's anger and hurt grow, and the tensions reach a high when he takes a rifle from the closet, points it at Martha and fires. But surprise! It's just a toy with an umbrella that shoots out of the barrel.As the movie goes on the characters get drunker, angrier and some painful secrets are revealed, and the actors never lose focus. Burton is sort of disintegrating in front of our eyes, both physically and emotionally, from the drink and his wife. He starts off rigid and unbreakable but soon turns cruel and sadistic, while still keeping his sort of suave, charming personality.Taylor won an Oscar for playing Martha, and it was an Oscar well deserved. At the beginning she looks like the most vile, unlikable character, but as thick layers are torn away we get to see the hurt and pain her character feels from years of berating George. She loves him, she says, but she doesn't deserve him because of how horrible she is. She doesn't want to be happy, but she does at the same time. We feel for this woman because she is a person, not a caricature of a drunken wife. From when we first see him we know that there is more to Nick than meets the eye. He seems, in a way, sort of ashamed and embarrassed of his goofy wife, and doesn't put up much of a fight when Martha makes advances on him \u0096 right in front of Honey's eyes. Of course, he's not just the clich\u00e9d hotshot character of so many movies either. He has an agenda he feels he needs to use to further his career, but he doesn't like using it. He says early that he doesn't like to get involved in other's problems, and gets increasingly awkward and uncomfortable as the movie progresses. Nick also thinks he's the only sane one in the whole house, even insulting his own wife.Sandy Dennis' Honey seems like the smallest character of the film, but her work is in the background. Watch the movie twice, and focus only on her the second time. She reacts; she is always the character who's reacting, never in control. And she has the hard task of acting like a drunken moron for the majority of the film, a task that she excels at. But she only appears as an idiot, she knows what's going on around her but she denies it and tries to act like a playful child to rid herself of the horribleness that's happening. None of this is spoken, of course, but we see it in her face. She won her Oscar for the movie too, and deserved it.This is a horrifying film of the dangers of the lies we tell ourselves (with other themes, too, like alcoholism and marriage). It is a perfect film. Few have reached this equality of tragedy, drama, suspense and dark comedy. A recommendation to all, no one could turn away this film.10/10.",

            "content": "This is one of those special movies that manages to be good but unwatchable at the same time. In other words, while the script may be an accurate of the most unpleasant couple in history as they spend an evening entertaining some annoying guests, some (like me) might wonder why anyone would want to see this! For example, they could film a brilliantly executed heart transplant or the removal of giant parasitical worms from someone, but why watch it? To me, the film was just too painful to endure.Liz Taylor and Richard Burton play a couple of drunks who are married and spend all their time destroying each other. Now, according to the film it's because of the death of their son but they would have been terrible people regardless--they truly despise each other and themselves. Then, as if an afterthought, some guests arrive and actually stay and watch as this couple destroy each other right in front of them. And so, the newcomers get drunk and the drunks get drunker. Wow...now THAT'S fun! Then, tongues loosen some more and a lot of unpleasantness results.Sure, having worked with alcoholics I understand that Taylor and Burton did an excellent job here. But for a two-hour plus film it's an endurance contest I don't wish to do again. So the overall verdict is that it's well made but thoroughly awful. If you can endure and appreciate this, fine. But if you can't, don't feel like you must. Just because it's rated so highly on IMDb does not mean it's a \"must-see\"--especially because this film may well leave you feeling depressed and in need of a drink!",

            "content": "For a play with only four characters and basically one setting, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" covers a lot of ground. It mostly depends on the performances and the acidic dialog because, when you get right down to it, the Big Reveal isn't too big although it's plenty bizarre.George (Burton) is an associate professor of history at a small college. He doesn't have much in the way of ambition, we gather, because his shrewish and vulgar wife Martha (Taylor) keeps twitting him about it. Taylor is magnificently slatternly. She'd played Cleopatra a few years earlier but age cannot wither nor custom stale her infinite vulgarity.George and Martha have two late-night guests, a newly arrived professor of biology (Segal) and his naive wife (Dennis). The evening begins with the four of them sitting around the living room with nothing special to say. But the booze flows like Niagara and they all loosen up -- not that Martha requires much loosening.Albee's dialog is cynical, bitter, and exploitative. Cutting insults keep the viewer awake as do the sometimes embarrassing revelations, like Sandy Dennis's hysterical pregnancies and frequent vomiting. When Albee latches on to what he feels is a good turn of phrase, it gets repeated until it becomes laughable per se. \"It's good that you're a biologist,\" Taylor tells Segal, \"because you're right in the MEAT of things.\" She comes up with this again and again until Burton cuts her off with the observation that she's obsessed with the phrase and that it's vulgar.The comparison of Taylor's father, who is president of the college, to a big white mouse is repeated as well. And Taylor refers to her husband as, variously, a swamp, a bog, and a fen.Insults fly in all directions. One person may reveal a secret to another, who then runs over and trumpets the information to the others. They play what Burton calls \"games\", such as Humiliate the Host and Hump the Hostess. People make things up as they go along or present fantasies as historical fact. At one point, Segal knocks Burton to the floor. The exception to most of this verbal and physical violence is Sandy Dennis, who is too dumb to know what's going on much of the time.The party lasts all night and peters out at dawn, with Segal and Dennis leaving the house in a state of shock, and Burton and Taylor exhausted by their strenuous conflict.It's directed in a straightforward manner by Mike Nichols who doesn't pull any stylistic tricks. No flashbacks, no slow motion, no wobbling camera. That kind of razzle dazzle isn't really needed. How can you possibly pep up a volcano? I rather enjoy it. I get a kick out of its malice. Albee is gay and perhaps it takes a gay man or a straight woman to coax ignominy into such polished form. Maybe not. I don't know. I just know I like it when Burton accuses Taylor of \"braying\" and there follows a sharp argument over whether she \"brays\" or not, with Taylor sounding exactly like a mule.",

Though some of the epithets are obviously softening much stronger words, the language is frank and brutal, Martha's bludgeoning body-blows balanced by George's icepick thrusts. Edward Lehman's respectful screenplay gently opens up Edward Albee's one-set play while keeping a certain claustrophobic atmosphere. Mike Nichols' first directing effort is stunning in its lack of artifice; rarely do you feel that the director has done much more than turn on the camera and watch four actors, all at the top of their game, tear into their roles. George Segal's work in this movie is criminally underrated, but his reactive work as studly, ultimately disappointing Nick should be mandatory study by all young actors. Sandy Dennis' fluttery turn as mousy, wifey Honey is powerful also; a lot more is going on than you might think. Richard Burton is staggering as George (\"Georgie Porgie Put-upon Pie\"), and his performance demonstrates the magic that he could bring to a worthy role. Elizabeth Taylor's work here still astounds. The physical transformation she undertook to become aging harpy Martha is amazing enough, but her performance seems to channel a hurricane's force and fury. By turns hilarious, maddening and then, at the end, exhausted and defeated yet again, Taylor demonstrates acting, particularly film acting, at its best. The film is by no means easy or \"Hollywood\" in feel-- the audience is as exhausted as the characters at the end. But this was a bracing, necessary antidote to the impossible ideal of marriage usually portrayed in the movies. A towering film.",

Then, too, why didn't Nick and Honey simply leave, rather than stick around for the \"full treatment\"?  Can it be that \"like attracts like,\" so much so that they couldn't leave? The final denouement suggests that a new day may be in the offing for poor Martha and George, after the latter has \"killed off the 'little bugger.' \" Although Martha's admittedly still fearful, she clings firmly to George's hand.  Perhaps there's some hope, anyway, for this emotionally spent couple.Edward Albee, taking no small degree of awareness from Tennessee Williams and Harold Pinter, crafted a play that certainly communicated to a goodly number of people.  Personally recalling sitting in its Broadway run, watching Uta Hagen and cast go through their paces, I remember being as impressed with the riotous audience laughter as with the play itself.  The raw lines coming from up-to-then very respectable status characters, namely  college prof and wife, seemed to provide some kind of early 60s liberation from the staid and repressive 50s.  By the time the film was released in '66, the public was ready for its no-holds-barred dialogue.  It ushered in an new era of social upheaval, of which we're still feeling the effects today.   The \"boozy battle\" between the hosts, hosts and guests, and guests and guests, paralleled the cultural \"steam\" being released during that politically \"hot\" period.  The American home drastically changed as a nation experienced more domestic squabbles, separations, divorces, custody battles, and family breakdowns--the last including a noted demise of the traditional \"family meal.\" In Albee's \"long night's journey into morning,\" the audience must endure two hours of fighting, bickering, insulting, and lamenting before any ray of hope is introduced (during its last five minutes).  A long time to wait, but there it is: a glimmer that there may be something better ahead.  But we're not sure; after all, \"Is this fact or fiction, Martha?\"In an extensive GM Quarterly interview, Director Mike Nichols revealed that this was a very troubled production that almost didn't get finished--with a leading cast boozing and pill-dosing even during lunch breaks--stretching the very limits of professionalism.Yet in the end, Nichols, Cinematographer Haskell Wexler, and Composer Alex North all got what they wanted.  A question is, \"was it all worth the effort?\"  That's something only the individual viewer can answer: is this  a case of \"nothing from nothing leaves nothing?\" or \"a cathartic and emotionally moving experience?\"",

            "review_title": "That's what comes from too much alcohol and too few mutual respect",
            "content": "'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' tells the story of two couples that are quite different at first sight - one used to each other for years, the other one rather freshly wed in comparison. Actually it doesn't tell their story, but it displays their relationships. The film begins on a Sunday morning at 2 o'clock, right after a party, and ends just after the sun rises. In these few hours we get to know these four people better then we might possibly want. George and Martha are the older couple. He is a history professor, she is the daughter of the head of the university. Their relationship seems to be from hell, full of mutual disgust and humiliation. Their guests are Nick and Honey. He is the new, ambitious biology professor, she is his naive young wive. As all these four characters are more or less drunk throughout the entire film, alcohol works as a catalyst, and we quickly see the different kind of character traits they have: George is a cynic, Martha loves to torment her husband, Nick is an opportunist and Honey is very much a stupid blonde. The two relationships deserve closer examination: We wonder why Martha and George married in the first place. They keep swearing at each other. Martha can't stop humiliating George, when they are alone as well as when Nick and Honey are there. Maybe there is still a rest of love in them, but there mutual respect has vanished completely. And then there is the strange story of their son, who is supposed to visit on his birthday. They way George and Martha talk about him make us feel that there is something peculiar about him. At the end we get to know more about him, and we can only guess how important the son is for their relationship. Nick and Honey, on the other hand, seem to be quite the opposite. But, being used as weapons by the older couple, we see that their relationship isn't as perfect as it seems to be, either. Nick didn't marry Honey because he loved her, but because he thought she was pregnant and because of her money. And when Martha tries to seduce him to tease George, he plays the game with her, always in mind that this woman's father is the head of the university. Honey, on the other hand, is much more emotional than her husband, but she also is the most passive character, and the one most affected by the alcohol. Mike Nichols assembled an outstanding cast for his film. Casting Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Martha and George is a stroke of genius - not only are they terrific actors, but it also heats the imagination of the viewer how much their real-life-marriage resembled the relationship they had in this film. Elizabeth Taylor outshines her co-stars a little. Never was she any better than in this one; although her character is the meanest in the film, she manages that we still feel compassion for her at the end. But Richard Burton, George Segal and especially Sandy Dennis deliver memorable performances, too. 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf' succeeds at something rather difficult: It makes us care for characters we wouldn't want to have anything to do with in real life. And although it actually consist of nothing but four people talking for two hours, it never bored us for a second.",

Liz Taylor and Richard Burton give the performances of their lives. Sandy Dennis also shines in an early-ish role. It's a dramatic film, but the wicked humour that permeates the film is absolutely devastating, and I mean that in the best possible way. Many moments in the film I find myself laughing only to think, \"Should I be laughing at this.\" Certainly the film is loaded with uncomfortable moments, enhanced by the camerawork replete with uneasy close-ups. Most of all, this film shows how a lot can be accomplished with just a little: a cast of four and minimal scenery changes. \"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf\" has become an absolute icon of American cinema. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?",

Near as dammit, the perfect film, Mike Nichols excels in his firm and intelligent direction while Sandy Dennis gives her best screen performance, Richard Burton, one of his best and Elizabeth Taylor makes me purr with pleasure, she is so good, even when she is being bad. Edward Albee must take much of the credit because the writing is sensationally good, witty asides, horrifying undertones and devastating use of language. Even the opening up of the stage play is successful, with marvellous b/w shots of trees and blown leaves plus the wonderful garden scene with the swing that is one of my favourites. Engaging from the very start and amusing too as Martha declares, 'What a dump!' and has us all racking our brains to try to recall the cinematic derivation. Humour remains a large feature but there is much darker stuff lurking and even when, after repeated viewings, we must know what is coming it still causes a chill or is that a thrill (?) as it all comes tumbling out. The real, the not so real and the made up, that may be even more real. The open and honest realities of the real Virginia Woolf are not for everyone, but surely this film is. Sensational and just a notch better than my other Taylor favourite, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.",

A dangerous double game becomes more intense and urgency with environmental changes. Simply, we are going through an intimate experience, which is seasoned with an excellent acting. The problem occurs in the moment, when we realize, how much is this experience, as a matter of fact, sincere and painful.George, an associate history professor at a small New England college, and Martha, the daughter of the university president, live in an unstable and violent marriage. After they return home drunk from a party, Martha reveals she has invited a young married couple, whom she'd met at the party, for a drink. Their guests are Nick, a biology professor, and his wife, Honey. The hosts are engaged in a cruel verbal duel. The younger couple is first embarrassed and later enmeshed. After an evening of a sadistic, perversely hilarious and dangerous \u0084clashes\", a painful truth comes to the light.Mr. Nichols keeping his camera close, so that, violent emotions, defeats and cramps on the faces of the actors come to the fore. The direction is excellent, because it is very difficult to draw the line between passion borders and boundaries of a nervous breakdown. The characters are lost in a futile and desperate struggle, which celebrates a kind of demonic love in an attempt to save a bad marriage.The characterization is excellent and fully corresponds with sharp dialogues and gloomy atmosphere.Elizabeth Taylor as Martha is definitely a major figure in this film with her acceptance of gray hair and her use of profanity. It is difficult to accept that such a beautiful face hides a violent and so crazed but again, fragile and deeply wounded character. Richard Burton as George is worthy as a her counterweight. He is not a victim, he is the husband who is tired of everything, while he tries to put all the things in the right place. The couple has offered an excellent performance.George Segal as Nick is a young man who moves between confusion, arrogance and dominance in their relations. Sandy Dennis as Honey is his bland wife. She is not up to this unscrupulous game.This is a brutal clash between unhappy spouses who move the boundaries of inhumanity, while they skillfully flee from the truth.",

Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor make your blood freeze as couple George and Martha, who use their guests (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) as conduits to vent their hostility towards each other.

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) *** (out of 4) Technically brilliant but oh so ugly tale of an aging married couple (Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton) who invite a young couple (George Segal, Sandy Dennis) to their house for drinks and soon the bitterness of their lives are pouring out through rage and alcohol. If there was ever a case of a three-star film being called a masterpiece then this here would be the perfect example because there's so much brilliance in this movie that it's impossible not to pay close attention and really admire everything going on. At the same time there's no question that these four characters are such ugly, vile and repulsive that the 129-minute running time feels twice as long because it's simply not very pleasant spending that much time with such characters. WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? contains some of the greatest acting I've seen in my life, the direction is marvelous and the B&W cinematography is also among the greatest I've ever seen. Saying all of that you'd think this was a movie I'd want to rush back and watch again but that's hardly the case. This is a rather hard film to judge because on one hand I'm happy that the filmmakers were brave enough to show these ugly characters as they are but on the other hand it really prevents one from \"enjoying\" the movie. That might sound like a dumb contradiction but when \"The End\" finally came up on the screen I was happy and I'd also say that I wish the movie was thirty-minutes shorter because it was driving me mad having to listen to these people and their sick games that they were playing. I think my dislike of the characters could also be viewed as another major plus for the filmmakers because it takes a great deal of talent to make a viewer feel this way. The performances by Taylor, who won an Oscar, and Burton are two of the greatest I've ever seen. It's rather remarkable just to sit and watch the two greats do their thing. The movie is filmed in what seems like real-time to give the movie an almost documentary like style. By doing this it really aids the performances because you can see the anger and rage quietly and at times quickly building up before the explosion finally happens. Just watch as the two slowly pick at one another, know which buttons to push and then out of no where this demented rage comes flowing through them. I'm not sure if Taylor and Burton were simply brilliant actors at being able to bring this out of each other or if their real-life relationship helped build this up. Either way, the two of them are simply marvelous here and both rank as some of the greatest performances I've seen. Segal and Oscar-winner Dennis are also very good, although at some points I felt Dennis was a tad bit over-the-top. The cinematography by Haskell Wexler is some of the greatest you'll see as well. It really makes the film seem like a Gothic horror movie or a film noir from the 40s. This dark look really helps capture the ugliness of the characters as well as bring out the dark tone. Nichols direction is flawless as he has no troubles with the material even though I might say he was too good at what he was doing. This was an extremely difficult film to sit through with the ugly characters and frank subject matter. Normally I wouldn't recommend a film like this but the performances are just so grand that it's impossible not to take notice.",

A film you keep waiting to begin until you realize it's not going to. You won't be the only ones asking if you can go now by the time this film ends. I guess the director/writer deserves some recognition for the indirect, internal reference to itself as a flop.The title connection to the story is either extremely limited and painfully unimaginative or the writer/director assumes a great deal. One of the many things that will leave you asking, \"Was that all there was to it?\" For future filmmakers, a film should not need to be explained. It is the nature of a film, or a play as this is based on, that being enclosed from the rest of the world and uninterrupted that it should explain and give context to itself. Woolf massively fails this most basic aspect. It partially makes up for it in other ways, like deep relationship, marriage, and family insights, which is why I'm not rating it a 1.The score is exceptional and simple, but the soundtrack music is, at best, less annoying than the story.Compared to another film that, like this, is essentially composed of a room full of people less than happy with each other, it reinforces how great 12 Angry Men is, despite being done a decade before Woolf. A recent film, Compliance (2012), does it much better and also works with hard to believe dumb/naive characters.",

I feel that trying to analyze drunken behavior in a movie is a pointless endeavor that, for some reason, actors and directors think is a life affirming philosophic inquiry......or something. I would compare this to trying to pass a driving test while drunk. It doesn't work.Burton does his usual Shakespearean speechifying. Taylor is a caricature of whatever she is supposed to be.

The entire movie takes place during a single unbearable evening in which a new young teacher and his wife visit an unhappy, unsuccessful, drunken, obnoxious middle-aged couple of a college history department. As liquor flows the elder couple proceeds to tell the young couple the boring story of their miserable discontented personal lives, including dirty laundry, in a lengthy vulgar drunken loud argument. No plot, no moral, no endearing qualities. One descriptive adverb for this film is \"over\"; over-dramatic, over-acted, and mostly over-irritating; another word that comes to mind is \"dumb\", and another is \"vulgar\". The dialog of this movie is just a stream of vulgar sarcasm spewed by gloomy characters. Not my cup of tea.

            "content": "In 1966, Mike Nichols, in his directorial debut, joined together Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis in the film adaptation of the Edward Albee stage production of the same name. Two couples are brought together, one set with clear and obvious deep-seated issues, the other set with seemingly no problems in their relationship. Early one morning, the couples meet and many issues come to light and the four people realize there are more to each other than meets the eye. A deeply emotional, personally revealing film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a character-driven story charged with emotion and an incredible debut from the noted director, Mike Nichols.Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) is the daughter of the President of a New Carthage university where her husband George (Richard Burton) is an associate professor. The couple has been married for quite some time, most of their years together seeming to be unhappy. By the time the audience meets them, it is revealed that they spend the majority of their nights engaging in drunken verbal assault against each other. Despite their marriage that seems to be based on convenience and career advancement for George, the audience can also sense there is a deep emotional dependence of each upon the other. At 2:00 in the morning, after a faculty mixer, Martha reveals that she has invited Nick (George Segal) a young charismatic biology professor, new to the university, and his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) over to their home for drinks. As the evening wears on, and more drinks are poured, Nick and Honey learn more about George and Martha's relationship as they witness the back and forth verbal assaults grow with intensity the more liquor is consumed. Unexpectedly, however, George and Martha also uncover a great deal of insight into the relationship between Nick and Honey when it is revealed that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.Of course, Burton and Taylor rule the screen each scene in which they inhabit it. The audience, captivated by the pair's brilliant performances, is left wondering just how much of the film is autobiographical of their off-screen tumultuous relationship. In the many years that I had wanted to see Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, I had always assumed that Burton and Taylor made up the primary couple, and Segal and Dennis, the secondary couple. After finally seeing the film, however, it is clear that the more revelatory experience takes place through the on-screen performances of George Segal and Sandy Dennis. It is the Nick and Honey couple that is far more interesting to dissect. George and Martha put all of their issues with each other on display for any interested parties to witness. Nick and Honey, on the other hand, live in denial that their relationship is anything but perfect, and have repressed many issues they have had in hopes that projecting the image of a perfect relationship would create one in actuality. I found myself surprisingly captivated by the inner workings of Nick and Honey's subtly strained marriage more so than the visibly tumultuous marriage of Martha and George. What was also intriguing was the unrealized desire to flesh out the issues that are revealed to have plagued Nick and Honey's relationship since before their marriage. If I walked into a couple's home, who had no qualms about fighting openly with each other while plying me with alcohol within minuted of my entering the door, I would make any excuse necessary to leave. Nick and Honey, however, decide to stay even when the conversation turns uncomfortable as a sort of impromptu therapy session. Knowing they have several issues within their marriage that lie below the surface, their relationship is actually the one that needs more work than George and Martha's. Granted, George and Martha don't have the best coping mechanism in place to deal with their issues, but open discourse about their problems is far better than the denial and fake-it-till-you-make-it tactic that Nick and Honey have employed since before they were married. An incredible look at the overwhelming difficulties of cohabitation and merging of souls that marriage brings, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a film that will not quickly be forgotten by any who see it.",

The four have drinks, go out for bowling, and return to the house to keep drinking, but it's far from a pleasant dinner party. From the get-go, the main couple is at each other's throats, yelling, threatening, and hurling hurtful quips at lightning speed. While Liz won an Oscar in 1967, her partner obviously didn't. Richard Burton's performance was the performance of a lifetime, and it was one of the greatest tragedies of Oscar history. While Taylor shouted and shocked audiences with her dumpy appearance, Burton seethed and stifled, giving a multi-layered performance that many people might not even be able to appreciate.The film is painful and upsetting, but that's to be expected since it's an adaptation of a very heavy play, but it's worth it to see Richard Burton's performance. Obviously, if you're a Liz Taylor fan, you're going to want to watch this one, but it's her husband who shines. It takes a very sensitive woman to announce, after winning an award, that her heart is broken because her co-star didn't win one.

But in a bold, head-on attack directed at fake, 1950s family idealism, \"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?\" shatters myths, gleefully stomps on our 1960s rose-colored glasses, and refocuses our vision on a legal institution that too often resembles a pit of fire and brimstone.Husband George and wife Martha, harshly antagonistic to each other, hurl insults, dish out verbal abuse, spew hatred to a degree almost certainly never expressed in films prior to 1966. Their venom even extends to a married couple that drops by George and Martha's house for a friendly visit. Soon, all four adults are in the throes of a verbal Armageddon.The main characters here are terribly damaged people, irrevocably injured, emotionally crippled for the rest of their lives. At one point Martha screams out: \"I'm loud and I'm vulgar, and I wear the pants in the house because somebody's got to\". George fires back: \"You're a spoiled, self-indulgent, willful, dirty-minded, liquor-ridden ...\". A couple of minutes later after more back and forth insults, Martha asks: \"Is that a threat, George?\" He responds: \"That's a threat Martha.\" She screams angrily: \"You're going to get it baby\". To which George retaliates: \"Be careful, Martha, I'll rip you to pieces\". Martha explodes: \"You're not man enough; you haven't the guts\". Nice couple. One wonders why they were attracted to each other in the first place.Although the film's B&W lighting, the sets, and other elements are fine, it's the script and the acting that propel this production. I must say, I did not like Martha or George. I didn't like any of the four main characters. They're all unsympathetic, boring, pathetic, and loquacious. The story is such a talk-fest, the script must have weighed forty pounds. The back and forth arguing is relentless. It never stops. A little bit of these dreadful people goes a long way.On the other hand, I appreciate the film's willingness to buck traditional cinematic views of marriage and family. And the acting really is quite good. I think Taylor probably dominates the film. But Burton is good too in his own way.\"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?\" is a 1960s avant-garde film with a story that is dramatically dense.

If you don't take this film's stinking bull at face value, then having to endure watching the blowzy, lard-assed Elizabeth Taylor verbally duking it out with the loud, obnoxious Richard Burton can quickly become quite humorous, almost cartoonish in nature.I mean, can you just imagine (for over 2 frickin' hours) having to tolerate that porkette Taylor and that pricko Burton (a couple of real grotesque clowns, indeed) tearing away at each other's throats and chewing up the scenery (especially Taylor), non-stop? Back in its day, this film was considered groundbreaking (and, I guess, that it was) for its high level of profanity and sexual implications. This was the first film to use the word \"bugger\", and the phrase \"screw you\" in its dialogue. And it was also the first to be given the MPAA tag - \"No one under 18 will be admitted unless accompanied by his parent.\" Personally, I've always hated this film's title, which really has nothing, in the least bit, to do with the story. And, believe me, no one will ever, ever convince me that that bloated bag, Elizabeth Taylor, was at all deserving of the Oscar she won for her portrayal of Martha.",

I didn't particularly love it and at time found the dialog to go on and on, but I couldn't stop watching and wondering just what was going on. For a movie that only takes place in about four different places there house outside the house, the bar, and outside the bar, there was a lot going on. There was this awkward couple with tons of problems and a younger couple, they seem to playing with as a sort of game.This film had this dark creepy aspect to it, without ever really showing to many creepy parts except when George pulls out the fake gun and pretend to shoot Martha with they all find hilarious which just add to the whole creepy factor this film has going for it. I found this all interesting and wanted to found out more but I just didn't find it entertaining which I feel is the main job a movie has. I though Martha and George both were great and very convinces actors but at time Martha was just a little to over the top with her drunken antics. I have no idea why anyone who had couldn't have a child would accuse each other of killing it. Not the mention why wasn't George just as intoxicated as the rest, I found many inconstancy's in the whole drunk aspect, at certain points it seemed as they would just snap out of being drunk then go back into it. I think the fact it only involved four characters and I have no idea why anyone who had couldn't have a child would accuse each other of killing it played into why I wasn't entertained by this film, but I though it was well done maybe just not my taste",

The marital relationship between these two extremely damaged individuals is falling apart, it's in complete shreds, all they do all the time is verbally abuse one another and find ways to insult the other in deep painful ways. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton both absolutely BLEW me away with their volcanic performances! Especially Taylor, she is just absolutely scathing, she will tear George down with one sentence and not even think twice about it. And Burton brings this deeply wounded, distant and washed up quality to his character, and it all works so well. The supporting actors do well too, course they are overshadowed by Taylor and Burton, but that's expected. The script is powerful and RAW. Oh my goodness this is by far one of the rawest films I've ever seen. The writing leaves no stone unturned when it shows the relationship these spouses have. All the hostility and deep rooted pain is out in the open for any and all to see. This movie is a superb example of perfect acting, masterful writing and the talent for showing a stripped down, completely raw/transparent relationship between characters. 9/10.",

There was no clarity from the truth or lies the characters told, until the end where some of the lies were revealed to be a part of a game or alternate reality they created within their marriage. The only thing I could interpret was the toxic love that George and Martha shared for one another, as well as their need to bring others down to their level. Although, I use the word love genuinely unsure of if they actually had any love for one another or just a mutual love of bringing emotional pain to others. They were both horrifyingly unstable and forced others to endure their insanity, making the couple with them believe they were opening up and just an older couple who truly couldn't stand each other. This made those around them open up in ways they never would have, giving George and Martha the negative insight into Nick and Honey's marriage. They fed off of each others and outsiders fear and pain in a way that was almost sadistic because it was clear they did it to bring themselves enjoyment because they may not get it from their own lives. This film felt so toxic and like you were being forced to watch a couple fight for 2 hours, it was incredibly uncomfortable to watch.",

The major downfall to this film is that some of the conversation drags out, and I would begin to feel myself wondering off. The acting is good. The camera is always focused on the actors there not much going on in the back ground. The film is shot in low-key lighting which makes sense since it's a dark film in a way.

            "review_title": "One of the more stunning feature directorial debuts in film history . . .",
            "content": "Legendary director Mike Nichols certainly started with a \"bang.\" Thank God he didn't end up like so many others - with one \"firecracker\" followed by a long, sad series of fizzles. But to understand what an achievement WAOVW is, one must keep in mind the context. Firstly, you have arguably the two most famous (infamous?) people on Earth, who were demanding and receiving unheard of (for the time) remuneration and treatment for their efforts - and living the lifestyle said remuneration provided (they lunched with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor during production) - as the stars. Elizabeth didn't have to be on set until 10 a.m., and her aging makeup took 2.5 hours. By the time that was finished, it was lunchtime, so filming didn't begin until 1 or 2 p.m. most days. I heard Mike NIchols say in an interview once, \"What are you going to do? Your stars are so big, they're dining with royalty. That's not the sort of person you can pull aside and chastise for being late like Lindsay Lohan or someone.\" Also, Burton's lifestyle was catching up with him, and his health was not the greatest (he couldn't work every day), not to mention the quasi-Victorian \"code\" movies of the time were expected to follow, and you have a recipe for what could have been a disaster. This film is often called a \"landmark\" for its frank depiction of theretofore taboo subjects like serious alcoholism, spousal abuse, mental illness, abortion, adultery, infertility, overt sexuality, etc. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, this was the first film to carry an age limit \"rating,\" and was also provided the genesis of what would become the MPAA and its rating system. How this got past the studio's \"guardians of decency\" in 1966, I'll never know. Luckily, Elizabeth really wanted this to work, and held their end together long enough for them to deliver what was their finest hour together. The first time I saw this, I was shocked by Liz's performance (among other things). She is on record as having said, \"I never had an acting lesson in my life; everything I've done, I've just created on the spot.\" I don't know what was in that \"spot,\" but it certainly served her well here. I won't go into the story arc, as I'm sure everyone here knows it by now, but let's just say that the 32 year-old (!) Liz shed ALL vanity to play 50 year-old floozy Martha (when Nichols first told her what weight she needed to be, she said, \"Thank God . . . I don't have to diet\"). And it worked. Right from the start. My favorite line comes early in the film, as she's describing the Bette Davis picture she's quoting from . . . \"What a dumPPPP!\" and in the middle of her description, she pauses perfectly, puts her hand on her hip, looks at mousy Burton, and says, \"She's discontent.\" Pretty much \"set the scene\" for what follows right there. There has been some criticism that George Segal was not the best choice for Nick, but apparently all the \"big\" actors turned down the role because of its nature: 2.5 hours of humiliation and torture at the hands of George - which the ambitious Nick feels he has no choice but to sit there and take. By today's standards, it might be a bit extreme, but as I said, you have to keep context in mind (and apparently, there are still people who play these types of \"parlor games,\" BION). Bottom line: if you've not seen this, do so immediately. Once you've recovered from the first viewing, watch it again, and you'll be amazed at the subtle but stinging wit throughout. Honey to George: \"They dance like they've danced before.\" George: \"It's a common dance, monkey nipples . . . they're both very familiar with it.\" Honey: \"I don't know what you mean.\" George looks at her with disbelief, opens his mouth to say something, and then you can see his brain thinking, \"Oh, what's the use?\" so he closes his mouth and turns his head. All in all, there are enough layers and meat here for many viewings and discussions.",

When you think that just two years before she had been chosen, not unreasonably, to play one of the legendary beauties of history, Cleopatra, you have to marvel at her willingness to play a woman 20 years older than herself who was by no means beautiful.But that's just the beginning of it. In the two-plus hours of this movie, we watch on her face and hear in her voice as George rips her apart, leaving her a quivering - but never defeated - mass of anguish.

The plot has been mentioned in almost every post and it's simplicity is almost frightening.  George and Martha are a anything but happily married couple who seem to thrive on insulting each other in the most hurtful possible ways.  From the opening scene, they are arguing about that name of a Bette Davis film and Martha is drinking the booze like it is water.  We then learn that a young couple are on their way over for an evening of drinks and \"getting to know each other\" chat.  Nothing could compare them for the psychological nightmare that awaits. Elizabeth Taylor as Martha gives one of the most powerfully ferocious performances EVER caught on films.  She is absolutely volcanic in her non-stop verbal daggers and her scene in the dance hall parking lot remains the best piece of acting I have ever witnessed.  She earned every centimeter of the Oscar that she won.  Matching her almost every step of the way is Richard Burton, who is almost equally as ruthless in his attempts and his \"get the guest\" game is painful to watch. How he didn't win the Oscar is beyond me.  George Segal as Nick, one of the ill-fated guests is adequate and I was impressed my his restraint and reactions to each situation.  Now on to Sandy Dennis as Honey, the mousey wife of Nick.  WOW!!!  For me, she made this movie, stealing every scene she was in, even from Liz!!  Her performance is so layered and her drunken babblings are phenomenal.  Her reaction to George's \"get the guest\" game is heartbreaking and I felt SO SO sorry for her.  That is, until the end of the film, when we realize she isn't the innocent ditz that we were led to believe.  Like Ms. Taylor, she earned EVERY bit of the Oscar she won for this.  This movie is twisted and in the end, nothing is really resolved; it is up the the viewer to decipher George & Martha's madness.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates good drama and outstanding acting; George and Martha's marriage makes both Matt & Ruth Fowler's (In the Bedroom) and Lester and Carolyn Burnham's (American Beauty) look like the American ideal.  10 out of 10.",

            "content": "Like Grace Kelly in \"The Country Girl,\" one New York critic said that Miss Kelly's performance pleased only those who HADN'T seen the great Uta Hagen create the role on Broadway. Likewise, Elizabeth Taylor's performance as Martha was inept to say the least. Her timing, reactions, line delivery and facial expressions were all wrong for this part. Miss Hagen's notices were glowing, some of the best reviews bestowed on any actress in the history of the theater.I studied acting at the HB Studio in New York and spent several years acting on the NY stage. I feel that I can judge a so-so acting job from a great one. I saw the stage version, not with Miss Hagen, but with the marvelous Nancy Kelly as Martha. She had been Miss Hagen's understudy and also toured the USA in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" I also purchased the original Broadway cast album with Miss Hagen and Arthur Hill as \"George,\" so I knew the dialog verbatim.As I sat in the movie theater watching Taylor and Burton, I was appalled. Both were unable to bring the utter FIRE that had dominated the original. Hagen is considered one of the first ladies of the American Theatre, and for GOOD REASON. She is among the Julie Harris, Eva LeGalliene, Helen Hayes, Gloria Foster, Rosemary Harris, Geraldine Page caliber actresses.Taylor gave a sneering, \"movie acting\" job as Martha, while Uta Hagen SAILED THE HEIGHTS OF GREAT ACTING (she easily won the Tony Award as best actress in a dramatic play). That part was the role of a lifetime, but, as usual, all Hollywood could think about was box office, not take the advantage to film the ORIGINAL CAST for posterity. This was the trend then as it is now. Think: Rosalind Russell in \"Gypsy\" instead of the milestone original performance by Miss Ethel Merman; Audrey Hepburn in \"My Fair Lady\" instead of Julie Andrews; Mitzi Gaynor in \"South Pacific\" instead of Mary Martin (Doris Day was slated to do the film role, but the studio felt her salary request was too high, so they settled for Gaynor). It seems the only really smart transition from stage to film was Doris Day in \"The Pajama Game,\" instead of the original, Janis Paige.To those reviewers here who praised Miss Taylor and Mr. Burton...if you can get your hands on the Columbia Records' Original Broadway Cast album, do. It's so incredible, you'll then KNOW you are witnessing the REAL \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\". Hagen and the rest of the original were THAT great. Sorry, Miss Taylor didn't have the acting chops to interpret such a powerful role as \"Martha\" and Richard Burton (usually a marvelous actor) was saddled with mediocre Taylor. Perhaps he might have pulled \"George\" off playing opposite a more competent actress. Taylor didn't do any better than the no-talent Kim Novak would have done.",

Nick is a young professor with a lot of hang-ups, and Honey is the daughter of a wealthy minister who is perpetually introverted!! These four re pro bates commence at George and Martha's house for a night of dipsomaniacal pursuits and debauchery!! Now propagates a myriad of psychotic encumbrances!!! The joke of the night being \"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf, Virginia Woolf, Virginia Woolf, who's afraid of Virginia Woolf, so early in the morning?\" This was the twisted doggerel that managed to perplex everyone!! George gives a callous pontification to everyone's diatribes and stupors of lamentation!! He uses these vulnerabilities as prey for his psychological defense strategy...It appears as though everyone is playing a game of academic genocide...It is quite evident this little gathering has created an aggregate vitiation of rational thought, and that this entire evening which consists of abhorrent inebriation, thus evoked a horrifying state of vulgarity!!The acting in this movie simply astounds you!! Elizabeth Taylor won an Oscar for best actress (as boisterous Martha, she gained weight for this role!!) George Segal won for best supporting actor (youth and talent, very unbeatable!!) Sandra Dennis won for best supporting actress (late 1960's early 1970's queen of serious roles!!) Richard Burton however, did not win for best actor, yet I felt his performance in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" was better than anybody else's!! Richard Burton brilliantly culminates intelligence with incredible dramatic acting ability!! Director, Mike Nichols,(The Graduate and so many other great movies), makes it look easy to expedite the depraved intricacies of negative human nature!! Last but not least, Edward Albee is utterly spellbinding with this script, as he compounds pejorative emotional inundation with cerebral torment. The end result as always the case with Edward Albee, is that he is without a doubt one of the greatest modern writers in American theater and film!! \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" exudes the genre of compelling misgivings about truth and illusion!! The camera angles depicting the emotional ugliness of the characters in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" puts this film in a category all by itself!! Hostile bantering of this detailed nature is so well illustrated that it easily supersedes the technological gimmickry and creative violence of mainstream Hollywood!!!The Title \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" correlates to the anguish and instability the famous author Virginia Woolf was plagued with!!!The overall turbulence which afflicts all of the major characters in this movie is unbelievably creative!! These disgruntled spawns of academia are perennially thwarted!!! The black and white depiction of these people intensifies the desperation these people are burdened with, and makes intransigence with reality dreadfully contagious!! This film is remarkable in it's originality by way of requiring conversation to have a combat initiative!!! In the final analysis, the question and riddle of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? ultimately gets relegated to the despondent retort by Martha \"I am George, I am\"",

            "content": "Having heard about this alleged \"classic\" ever since it debuted when I was a child, I finally got around to seeing it on DVD, and I was very disappointed! I checked the *contains spoiler* box just in case but I won't go into the plot in detail here. First of all, IMHO Albee's story was what it was and that's inescapable (on its merits I would give it a five of ten stars having never read it--I think the film dialogue is quite clunky at times): if I was a Hollywood director (long a dream of mine) no way in hell would I have chosen to make a film of the play of THAT book/story!So what is all the hype about?? Same old studio b.s. I think. It's just that with so many talents in one film, the multiple Oscar nominations (but thirteen?? Geez, no way!) were probably inevitable. As you can see, I would only rate it two out of ten stars (or one out of four). Here's why: Both Taylor and Burton are highly accomplished, skilled actors at the top of their form in this era. But I think they both overreached and overacted in this film. The script was really awful IMHO. I didn't like it enough to recall the many awkward lines, but there are plenty of them (the writing might have fit public taste in the 50s, but certainly doesn't hold up now). This opinion has nothing to do with so-called \"decency\" or mores--I'm a die-hard liberal.Again, I'd have never chosen to film the play of the book, so that's strike one. Strike two for me was the direction... the pacing is poor: it has almost no plot momentum and is filled with awkward silences (which I realize were probably intentional and part of the story/Nichols's choice to dramatize the heavily slanted relationships he was trying to portray). Each character seems to stand in contrast to the other, as if the director said, \"you just get into your part and don't have chemistry with the other actors as in an ensemble piece (which is apparently how it was intended to happen on stage).\" When I read on the DVD that they spent 20 weeks filming this on the Warner lot, it dawned on me: here was Hollywood's top acting power couple screwing off for five months and getting paid handsomely. Well good for them (but that doesn't mean I have to love it). I feel sorry for Mike Nichols being so \"successful\" his first time out; it probably means his standards were that much lower (and although I'm a total nobody in Hollywood, they're far below mine; if I had five months on sound stages to do this film, I could have done it a lot better!).On the positive side, I think the b&w cinematography was excellent (as in all of Haskell Wexler's work!) and the editing, too. But they couldn't compensate for lame direction and overwrought acting performances borne of ignorant, selfish, quirky readings of the original work. Taylor's Oscar may have (in context of the year's other mostly not memorable fare) been somewhat deserved: she is a great American actress... but that in itself doesn't hold the rest of the parts of this film together for me.The only reason I give it any stars is that there are a few dramatic moments (and the cinematography and editing), like the first gun surprise, that were done quite well. But I'm just sure that it must have worked far better on stage. Burton's expansive gestures and incredible dramatic voice would have been far better utilized in a film of Macbeth or other Shakespeare play, not this! I think my intuition about this was right: I could've waited another forty years to see it.",

Can you imagine yourself awkwardly avoiding eye contact with them, trying to talk about something else with the person next to you, but getting drowned by the sheer volume of the fight ensuing on the other side of the table? Imagine a two hour film of nothing but that.That's essentially Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in a nutshell. Yet it's also not. It is about a middle-aged couple. A university professor (Richard Burton) and his wife (Elizabeth Taylor). Burton's character is something of a failure in life, at least career-wise, while Taylor's character is the daughter of the university president. Their fights practically write themselves. One night they end up inviting a younger couple (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) over for drinks. And the film is nothing more than that one horribly long and awkward night.And the first third of this film is difficult because of that. Because it is awkward. It is difficult to sit through and there are a million other things you'd rather do. But at some point the film turns. It becomes so embroiled in the misery, in the Fremdscham to borrow a word, that it ceases to be awkward. It becomes a drama, which allows you to detach yourself from the situation and start enjoying it. And that helps. It helps a lot.This film is not for everyone. The acting is superb, the final third is enjoyably juicy and overall I can definitely see why people have stuck with it, but it's also one of those film that take their toll on you.

The ultimate emotional roller-coaster movie experience.There are a few movies that, should they come on television just as you're preparing to go to bed, you'll forego a good night's sleep to watch. This is one of them. It's the pinnacle of a 'car wreck' movie, gluing you to the screen in the same way people stare at bad car wrecks.Some have questioned why Honey and Nick didn't simply leave as they continued to be abused by their 'hosts' and the answer is quite simply the same as the audience: they can't turn away. Until the very end, they are the most sympathetic characters because much of the audience identifies with them as if they were in the same situation. That's the real purpose of Honey and Nick in this movie and the other thing that keeps people watching through what amounts to mutual psychological abuse. Just like a great, live sporting or a horrific news event, you have to stick around just to see what's going to happen next. This is also the source of the title. Virginia Woolf was known for her 'stream of consciousness' style of writing and is brought home by Taylor in one of the most poignantly touching final lines ever uttered in a movie.The most powerfully dramatic moments are when Burton smashes a liquor bottle on a fireplace mantle (to which Taylor torments, \"I hope that was an empty bottle, George. You can't afford to waste good liquor on an associate professor's salary\"), his great monologue with Nick about his childhood, the exchange between Burton and Taylor when she says with such restrained fury, \"What did you just say to me?\", to which Burton responds with a deliberate, \"I...ate...it...\" and she spits in his face, and, of course, the soft, yet powerful, ending which explains everything.The only flaws (and they are minor) are essentially the same as with most great plays that are transferred to film, i.e., when the movie's setting leaves the 'stage'. Here, it's when the cast moves from the living room to the bar/dance floor and then also drags a bit when Taylor returns to the house. Even here, there is some brilliant cinematography in the bar parking lot. Check out the lighting behind Taylor as she berates Burton. This alone makes the setting change worth it. It was also a little unbelievable that Martha and Nick would then be later having sex upstairs while Honey and George waited for them downstairs. But I suppose it was necessary as a plot contrivance to force George into his final 'game'.But that's it. Everything else is so superbly done that these things are mere quibbles and crop up only after many viewings. Compared with other greats such as Citizen Kane, Casablanca and The Godfather, this one has the absolute lowest 'error' factor (and we're talking about some real subtle nuance flaws here) and the highest rating as far as emotional audience effect.It is simply a 'must-see' for anyone serious about movies concerning in-depth, intricate character interaction on a level which involves the viewer in an intimate way.",

Albee counts on the fact that the audience will be so involved with the wit and energy of his dialog and the alcohol-fueled insults and savage humor that they won't have the time to stop and think too much about the peculiarity of George and Martha's shared neurosis. The movie audience, too, is asked to relate to the gradual realization of the two guests as to the older couple's delusion.

Is the story of a lot of unhappy marriages. Period. Sure, its over the top, but this is also the way people argue and fight, just like kids. If you don't believe it, you have been living a very sheltered life. In short, a marriage of inconvenience. Granted, it's dark comedy, but all rings so true in a haphazard sort of way. Richard Burton and Liz Taylor have never been better because you either grow to feel sorry for one or the other or you just can't stand them, also because they are SO convincing. More over, Burton and Taylor's personal life was always a mess and it truly can be said that a little bit of both of them was woven into their characters. A standout film, basically a stage play, hence the one dimensional, dismal sets that kind of remind you of an old noir flick. I always thought of this as an update of DETOUR, at least as far as the snarling between the two leads, who also did not like each other in real life. Knock, knock at the door and enter a much younger and impressionable couple (who are fed a lot of booze) and, almost like a Twilight Zone-ish episode, begin to realize they are looking at themselves in about ten or twenty years! Compelling, if not chilling stuff. I will say this, after 50 plus years of viewing this classic, even as a teenager, watch IF you are having a 'good' day, because if you're not, VIRGINIA WOOLF, or the BIG BAD WOOLF, will stay with you for a long time.

            "content": "Edward Albee's play is a spectacular adventure. Intriguing, disturbing, extremely funny, it can sometimes be interpreted very abstractly--being associated more with philosophy and the theatre of the absurd. Stage versions often capture the intensity and wildness of the verbal warfare and abstract games that can be so thrilling to experience. But what can be missing sometimes is the heart and soul of these people in such pain--trying to simply get through their lives. The movie is a revelation. No longer purely theatrically intense, what comes through with absolutely riveting clarity is the tremendous depth of human feelings and emotions buried deep within each of the characters welling up suddenly and unexpectedly with heartbreaking intensity. Elizabeth Taylor's Martha is simply inspired. She is still an alcoholic harridan, but her 3rd act soliloquy which reveals that beneath her cruelty and callousness is an incomprehensible but enduring love for George is astonishing in its impact, heartbreaking in its poignancy. Richard Burton's George is a perfect complement to Martha. He of course has his own subtle brand of cruelty--but the final denouement, and his gentle caressing of Martha shows his own buried love and affection. In the 1960's this film introduced most of the moving-going audience to both George Segal and Sandy Dennis. Distinctive, strong, funny characters--but not caricatures--they were a perfect foil for George and Martha. Special mention should be made of Mike Nichol's direction. He zeroes in on the characters--on their faces--he engages the audience making us feel like we are right there next to each of them, fighting with them, hurting along with them, ultimately caring so intensely for them. The impact is amazing. In the 1960's when the movie first came out--so much of the press and word of mouth seemed to focus on the cursing and fighting in the film. Life magazine even counted exactly how many of each swear word was heard in the film! What they neglected too often to mention was that beneath the then-tremendously shocking dialogue and intensity was heart--pure heart of these painfully pathetic but very real human beings. Our own hearts were open to George and Martha and Nick and Honey with understanding and forgiveness.",

When a line like \"You make me puke\" delivered by Elizabeth Taylor's Martha turns out to be one of the milder exchanges between herself and husband George (real life husband Richard Burton), you know you've got to be in the middle of one of the premier dysfunctional screen marriages of all time. Not to be outdone by the real one of course, but that's another story for the Hollywood tabloids.I've always given credit to \"The Maltese Falcon\" for containing the wittiest one-liners in all of filmdom, but the dialog offered here by playwright Edward Albee and screenwriter Ernest Lehman have to top the charts as the most savage. When George and Martha are slinging their arrows of misfortune, even the viewer has to duck for cover. The only way I figured that George wasn't really going to shoot his wife was that the story at that point was only about twenty minutes in, so what were they going to do to fill the rest of the two plus hours.You know what had me doing a quick rewind? In the early scene when Nick (George Segal) sits down next to Martha in the living room, and the older couple continue to fire their missiles at each other, Martha tosses George the bird. She deftly places her forefinger next to the middle finger, but it's definitely the gesture we've come to understand for it's notoriously universal meaning. Go back and check it out.There's no question the principals are at the top of their game here. Even Sandy Dennis, who one can dismiss as a lightweight among the players, is actually walking a fine line between sanity and depravity herself once the basis for her character's marriage to Nick is confronted in another round of the George and Martha parlor game. However I did get squeamish over her repeated rendition of \"I dance like the wind\" at the roadhouse saloon. You think she might have really been looped for that performance?After initially missing out on the American Film Institute's Top One Hundred Film List in 1997, the picture managed to make it on the second round a decade later. I think that was a worthy correction, certainly validated by it's thirteen Oscar nominations, and wins for Taylor and Dennis in their respective categories.

She seems to have control but ultimately it's George he's seemingly a doormat but he's verbally her equal even superior when he chooses. Martha even admits only one man doesn't bore her and it's her husband. It the mental and verbal games that is basically sex to them .

When I was in a high school acting class, my teacher told us he wanted us to see an example of really great acting and he introduced me to VIRGINIA WOOLF for the first time and I must agree. This scathing 1966 drama follows a drunken night between two college professors, one young and one not so, and their wives and the secrets, lies, and revelations that come out during their drunken encounter. Elizabeth Taylor won her second Oscar for her performance as Martha, a character who redefines the term \"shrew\", the older professor's wife and the daughter of the president of the college(a character who we never meet but is mentioned throughout). Taylor pulled out all the stops for this performance...she put on twenty pounds, wore extra padding, grayed her hair, wore false teeth, and pitched her voice extreme low and buried her English accent for the most part to deliver the most electrifying performance of her career. Some found it over the top, but I find the performance continually fascinating and treasure the little nuances I discover in Martha upon repeated viewings. Richard Burton was robbed of a Best Actor Oscar for his performance as George, Martha's emasculated husband who does his best to learn the rules of Martha's little games as fast as she can change them. Burton is just as funny as he is heartbreaking and beautifully underplays in order to allow Taylor to shine. George Segal and Sandy Dennis (in her Oscar winning film debut)provide solid support to the Burtons as the new young professor and his wife, who fall victim to the twisted machinations of George and Martha. This film was considered quite controversial in 1966. It seems quite tamer now but still packs an emotional wallop and is not for the faint of heart. Mike Nichols' intense direction and loving attention to Albee's script are a big plus here and help to make WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? a shattering and haunting film experience that stays with you long after the final fadeout.",

            "review_title": "Late Night Brawl A Classic",
            "content": "This is a brilliant movie with acting, script, and characters that will entertain and enrage you. The repartee is very clever and one can sense the madness that grips people when they descend into drunken debauchery. It is brutally honest and shows how a marriage can suffer severe damage over time because of resentments, jealousness, and lost dreams. There are glimpses of affection but these are short-lived and seem to magnify the bottomless pit that one couple named George and Martha have fallen into. The repartee and the acting draw us into one scene after another where Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor, and George, Richard Burton, tear each other apart with their words. The movie involves a late night party with a younger couple who, almost against their will, get dragged into the humiliation that George and Martha inflict on each other. Not content with directing their insults at one another, George and Martha find weak spots in the two guests, who leave feeling as if their souls have been laid bare as well. The other couple are Sandy Dennis as Honey, and George Segal as Nick, a youthful biology teacher. Both are outstanding as well. The four people play out their drama on a small college campus where Martha's father is a hidden character who runs the campus. One can imagine that this would be a complicating factor for most couples and George and Martha have made the worst of it. The other character is a son, who is a bit of a riddle, since he never appears either. A roadhouse manager and server also appear. I found it mildly amusing to see the elderly server walk through a door and place the drinks on the table as the others sit in stunned silence wondering what she must be thinking of the warring couples who have stopped by for yet another drink during their evening binge. There are a number of very effective close-up shots that bring you almost face to face with the characters. There is also a stunt in the midst of the ongoing brawl that will take you by surprise and leave you laughing with relief. This has to be one of the most important movies of the 1960's and possibly of all time. It seems very daring for the mid-sixties and neatly combines the best of cinema and stage. It has stood the test of time and by that standard is a classic.",

            "content": "I saw this opening day in NYC in 1966. There was no \"Damn you\" that day when the guests arrived! This had an enormous impact on me at that time and I thought it was truly great. I still do, though I view the content differently. I even had the double record set of the oral soundtrack! I lost it somewhere along the way, which is a shame as it would probably be worth a small fortune now. The success of this is remarkable given that it was made by a first time film director, Mike Nichols, and starred the two biggest movie stars that existed at that time and the most famous one, Elizabeth Taylor, was way too young for the role. Looking at it today, despite the black & white and the makeup and wigs, she is indeed way too young to be paying a 54 year old, but she is absolutely fascinating to watch. Could someone else closer to the right age (Patricia Neal, Bette Davis?!) have played it better? Probably, but I don't think anyone could have played it with such entertaining flair and there are some scenes that I'm not sure could be bettered. She is a hoot in the first hour. Taylor was never a great actress, but she was a great screen presence who Katharine Hepburn called the last movie star. And she was the last of the kind of movie stars that existed from that era and earlier. Larger than life as they used to say. Her performance here is not perfect, but there are long scenes with no cuts and lots of dialogue that she is near perfection in. Never in her long career has she ever been near this good as an actress. She, and her role, are so dominant here that Richard Burton can be overlooked, but he shouldn't be. This acclaimed actor of the stage, which he gave up when he met her, gave a number of very good screen performances, but I think he too was never better than here. It's a flawless performance. Sandy Dennis, a darling of the stage world prior to this, is good, but the weak link is George Segal as her husband, Nick. He's not bad, but he's not all that interesting and drama was never really his forte. My biggest regret about this film is that Robert Redford turned down this role, a surprise given his enormous success with Nichols on Broadway in Barefoot In the Park. Such a missed opportunity. When I recently re-watched this for the first time in years, I kept picturing how better he would have been for the role. This film is so famous for so many reasons, but probably the biggest was that it broke the foul language barrier. While it's nothing today, we'd never heard some of the words uttered here ever before in Hollywood filmmaking. It is a unique and great piece of filmmaking that Nichols and Burton should have won Oscars for along with best picture. All three of those awards went to A Man for All Seasons, which is a fine stately forgettable film, but Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Was way ahead of its time and way too much for a much more conservative Hollywood that existed then. Virginia Woolf wins the ultimate prize though. It's historic.",

In addition, the director uses camera to zoom in her face and switch back to the shot of shooting. Furthermore, almost every scene is photographed in the building, so the director uses medium long shot and medium close-up shot to run the movie more smooth. In the dancing scene, the audience also sees the example of Dutch-angle shot. Finally, the scene that she left her husband; the director put the next shot(flashback) by using face out and face in the previous shot that increases the continuity between two shots.",

Mike Nichol's film version is still today the yardstick by which all productions of this harrowing play are based. I was privileged to see Estelle Parsons and George Noble as George and Martha at Buffalo's Arena Stage many years ago. They were fantastic. Film or play, it's the kind of thing that needs to be seen with an audience to absorb its true power.George and Martha (Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) are a drunken, miserable couple who have to entertain a new college teacher, Nick, (George Segal) and his mousy wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) one very late night after a party. Martha's father heads up the college where George and Nick teach.Despite their obvious sniping at one another, there's a method to George's and Martha's madness -- they survive by playing games that put them into a fantasy world. And therein lies the reason for their bitterness, and the line, \"We couldn't\" spoken to Nick toward the end of the film tells us why, underneath all of it, this is a real love story.This film was a tour de force for Taylor and Burton, who are simply fabulous in their roles. Taylor is bitchy, funny, vulnerable, and sad, and Burton is perfect as the beaten down George who nevertheless plays the game very well indeed.Nick and Honey are young; Nick is ambitious and somewhat manipulative, but not as manipulative as his frail wife, who has some deep-seated problems. In vino veritas, as the night becomes day, and the emotionally exhausting party finally breaks up.Taylor in real life had a fun, trashy side to her, and she uses it well here. Nichols' direction is very sound, and despite the length of the film, it goes very quickly.What is truth, what is illusion, what is a lie -- like Nick, you'll be confused at times, but it's worth the ride.",

Taylor is stunning. A star performance that justly won Liz the Oscar. Bravo!Richard Burton also nominated is superb as are George Segal and Sandy Dennis (who won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actress.Connie Stevens a WB star circulated a petition all around Hollywood requesting a screen-test for the role of Honey.

The movie starts out with Martha and George getting on each other about guests coming over. The movie overall showcases the relationship. It starts with nagging and complaints. As the guests come over and alcohol is involved things get a lot more animated. It is shown that while George and Martha do get on each other's nerves there is a method to their madness. Into the night George and Martha begin to manipulate information out of their guests by playing games with them. Sandy, Nick's wife, is an innocent but willing guest until the games go too far. Nick thinks he is ahead of the curve until George and Martha's tricks blur the lines of truth and illusion into insanity.Who is afraid of Virginia Woolf is a black and white film. The shots are a fair mix of full shots, mid shots, and closeups. Most of the film takes place inside George and Martha's house.I really enjoyed this film.

And even though this movie does feel very stagy, it still is one of those movies that work out really well.It's not an enjoyable movie to watch and even one that is quite hard to get through at times but it ultimately is a very rewarding viewing experience. The acting, the characters, the directing, the story and its progress, it all ensures that \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is an unique and powerful movie experience.This movie foremost is a real character driven one. It's mostly set at the same locations and all that the movie basically involves is the characters speaking back and forth to each other. They do this in a very snappy way and love to get on each others backs. In order for this to all work out as well as it did, the movie needed to have some great actors in it. And with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton the movie of course has some great leading actors, as well as a legendary screen couple. They appeared in countless movies together and were married twice to each other in real life.It's no big secret that their relationship and marriage was far from perfect and peachy. In that regard they are perfectly cast in this movie. It's imaginable that they put some of their relationship into this movie. They are bickering constantly and calling each other out, all fueled by far too much alcohol and the presence of a younger visiting couple, played by George Segal and Sandy Dennis.I of course have no illusions, this is often how married life is like. Of course maybe not as extreme and in the same fashion as portrayed in this movie but overall it still feels like a fair and plausible relationship, between two middle aged persons, who are more or less stuck together and to each other. The movie and some of its situations should be very recognizable to some long time married couples.But it also is really the way the story gets told by the director Mike Nichols that make this movie and its story work out so well. It's story has a slow buildup but the movie itself is actually never a slow one and also doesn't feel that way. Quite an accomplishment for a movie that is being over 2 hours long, is mostly set at the same location and only features 4 characters in it. This actually was Mike Nichols' directorial debut, believe it or not. But judging by this movie, he probably already had some theatrical experience, prior to shooting this movie.The movie got also loaded with praise and also was one of the front runners at that year's Academy Awards. As a matter of fact, it got nominated in every category it was eligible for and it's also one of three movies with only 4 credited actors in it, who all got nominated for an Oscar as well. The movie eventually took home 5 of the awards but lost out on all the most important ones, such as the ones for best picture, writing and directing. It did won an Oscar for its cinematography though, which pleases me, seeing how much this movie deserved that win. It's the camera-work, together with its editing, that often really adds to the movie its pace. Besides, it's great to see they didn't took a static approach, which was perhaps the safest and more common approach to take to a movie of this kind. The movie does really has some special shot sequences in it, that are great to look at and definitely really adds something to the movie.A great movie and not just because of its acting!9/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Open on Broadway, and even more difficult to realize that three years later, in 1966, this cinematic version, with a screenplay by Ernest Lehman and directed brilliantly by Mike Nichols brought to the public's attention the special gifts of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as the alcoholic couple. It is a remarkable film and one that seems equally fine when we return to the DVD version so many years later.George and Martha are a middle aged married couple, whose charged relationship is defined by vitriolic verbal battles, which underlies what seems like an emotional dependence upon each other. This verbal abuse is fueled by an excessive consumption of alcohol. George being an associate History professor in a New Carthage university where Martha's father is the President adds an extra dimension to their relationship. Late one Saturday evening after a faculty mixer, Martha invites Nick and Honey, an ambitious young Biology professor new to the university and his mousy wife, over for a nightcap. As the evening progresses, Nick and Honey, plied with more alcohol, get caught up in George and Martha's games of needing to hurt each other and everyone around them. The ultimate abuse comes in the form of talk of George and Martha's unseen sixteen year old son, whose birthday is the following day. That final moment, captured by Haskell Wexler's bracing black and white cinematography and underlined by Alex North's musical scoring, when the title of the play is asked by George in question from to the devastated Martha and she answers 'I am' is a moment of cinematic history that deserves celebrating.Times change and films change and the public seems more interested in massive superhero explosive 3D extravaganzas to avoid the doings of the time. But films such as this remind us how powerful small ensemble screen acting can be. This is not an escapist outing, this is an examination of how people act to influence, enhance and destroy each other. It demands we think as well as react. Grady Harp",

In the first act, \"Fun and games\", coming back from a faculty party at her father's house at 2 in the morning, Martha invites another young couple, Nick, and Honey (George Seagal and Sandy Dennis), over to their house for a quick drink. During this scene, to annoy her husband, Martha broke one of their rules and mentions their imaginary son. This changed the whole dynamic of the night as the couple started going off at each other, swearing, exchanging spiteful and loathsome words. Martha kept humiliating George. The situation got progressively worse because they were also excessively drinking. Nick and Honey who thought they were just going to have a nice time, became an audience to their dispute and was also drawn into the drama. At the end of the night, a painful and ugly truth was revealed by George.Martha is very direct, uses violent language, and always tries to torment her husband. George on the other hand has a more cynic and soft character that makes it easy for his wife to make fun of him. Looking into the younger couple's relationship, Nick is the dominant one and Honey is just bland. We can also see that between all of them, Honey is the one most affected by the alcohol as she kept throwing up.The actors were a well-put-together cast and delivered incredible performances. Elizabeth and Burton's chemistry was unmatched and excellent. Their on-screen chemistry was not surprising to me at all, considering the intensity of their real-life relationship. I think that all the yelling and screaming is their coping mechanism. There are a lot of emotions going through the film. One moment it seems hilarious, then it turns into chaos and madness, and at the end Martha and George were defeated. To watch a movie with only four actors to turn into such a success is incredible.

To understand what the hell \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is really about, you need to see it, probably twice. I'm still exhausted from seeing it the first time.Richard Burton is history professor George, living on campus with his brash wife, Martha, played expertly by Elizabeth Taylor. (But more on her later.) The film opens with the two stumbling home from a party, late at night, only to then have guests Nick and Honey (George Segal and Sandy Dennis), a new biology professor and his wife, stop by for a visit, as invited by the couple, though George can't remember that ever happening. From there, drinks are passed around, conversations begin, and personalities come out. And secrets. And a whole long line of character twists that, in the end, destroys each character in their own little ways. That's the best I could do for explaining this plot, and it's weak, at best.Oh, what a movie this is. What a movie, carried solely by almost constant dialogue and interaction between the characters. No real action (well, in the visceral, shoot-em-up sense), but the movie is action-packed, and as many would agree, exhausting. Martha seems to love a good argument, while George is quietly passive. Martha eggs him on, pushes him further and further, dragging their seemingly innocent guests into what ends up being a night of very calculated games and trickery and lies, to the point where you don't know who's telling the truth.While the film is engaging from the start, it takes some time before you are truly sucked in, trapped in this nightmare. I'd say it takes until after the scenes at the bar until you are not just the viewer, but are in the movie, observing very closely, and held tight until the very end. To say this film is \"delirious\" is an understatement; the movie itself is insane. And it isn't until those haunting scenes once the film returns to George and Martha's house, after the trip to the bar, until you realize how insane this all really is. To say there are any stand-out scenes in the movie would be leaving out the great scene before the stand-out scene, and the one after. This whole film is one great, memorable scene after another. Mike Nichols appeared on \"Inside the Actors Studio,\" in one of those excellent interviews with James Lipton, who noted the director as being known to do memorable scenes. As far as this whole film is concerned--the scenes aren't memorable, they're haunting. Whether they're funny or scary or tense or dramatic...you'll never forget them. My favorite moments in the movie mostly involved Sandy Dennis. I was enthralled with her entire performance, and as another reviewer noted, there is more going on with her than it seems at first. Notice when she's coming downstairs, and George and Nick are talking about her. She pauses, listening, almost contemplating how she would reappear, then puts on the whole ditzy, \"Oh, this house is beautiful!\" act, making it appear as if she were as naive as first believed. I also loved her \"interpretive dance\" at the bar (\"I dance like the wind!\") and her drunken giddiness is great. Then notice her performance closer to the end, particularly the scene between her and George outside. We know what's going on inside, and we see how George feels about it (though we don't fully understand it), but you have to pay close attention to how Honey reacts, and it's then that you really understand her character.Not to put down any of the other actors. Richard Burton is so amazing, you have to wonder why the heck he didn't win an Academy Award. He gives a brilliant performance, so brilliant it's hard to understand with only one viewing. George Segal's performance is almost entirely composed of reacting to the situation, and it's amazing. His performance should be used as a model for other actors, in playing a very straight, very average guy, thrown into absolute hysteria. While everyone else almost outshines him, he gives a performance so realistic, it's amazing. And then there's Elizabeth Taylor. What a great performance. She portrays and envokes every emotion possible. She's laugh-out-loud funny, in the way that a real person would be funny. I love when she's eating the chicken wing, asking George about the Bette Davis movie. And later, when she follows Nick as he answers the door, and starts singing and dancing towards him. It's sheer madness. But besides being funny, she's frightening, intimidating, powerful, weak, hopeless, intelligent, and perhaps one of the great characters ever portrayed in film.\nI think the women in this movie really carry the film. Segal and Burton are terrific, but for example, their scene together outside was sort of flat, while the eccentricities of their wives seem to always keep the film alive and exciting. I wish Honey didn't have to vomit so much, she seems to disappear at moments in the movie that need her.Overall, the movie is about four people getting wickedly drunk and going mad together, and it's insane and crazy and a lot of fun. Of course, it's so much deeper than that, and by the end of the movie, you're not only afraid to ever drink again, you're tired and shaking you head, wondering what the hell just happened. Then, it will haunt you, and over the next few days, you'll keep thinking about the movie, and you'll need to see it again, to understand the issues about George and Martha's son, as well as Nick and Honey's issues with having a child. I'm still a little confused, so I may try watching the ending again, to see if I missed anything.Mike Nichols is one of the greatest directors, up there with Hitchcock, in my opinion, and this is one of the best movies ever made. I sincerely recommend you \"experience\" this film (because it's not just about seeing it, it's about living through it) and perhaps going through the ordeal more than once. This is an example of film making, at it's finest and most timeless, and some of the best acting ever seen, anywhere.",

            "content": "The late Mike Nichols' acclaimed director debut, a four-character powerhouse play from Edward Albee and is adapted by Ernest Lehman. Starring Taylor and Burton in their most virulent aggressions, as Martha and George, a middle-aged couple, George is an associate history professor in a New England college and Martha is the daughter of the college president.It all happens in one night, after returning home from a party hosted by Martha's father, under the influence, they starts quibbling about a movie starring Betty Davis, but neither of them can remember the title (actually it is BEYOND THE FOREST 1949), it is vexatious but could happen to any couple who have been married for a sizable time, squabbles aside, Martha gets offensive when George refuses to kiss her. Although it is past midnight, they are still expecting company, Martha invited a young couple who they have just met in the party to come by. Apparently, they don't need anyone else to get under each other's skin, but when there is an audience, it will be more intense.So it begins, arrive Nick and Honey (Segal and Dennis), a handsome biology professor and his meek wife who are just newly in town. The tension is immediately kindled between the men through George's breezy teasing, and a clear shot of George noticing Martha's over-friendly caress of Nick's hand sets the strain in a highly tangible mode which implies a possibility of fornication. Martha strikes first, rails at George for his ineffectuality in his career, who is \"preoccupied with history\" and bogged down as an associative professor, while George is busy offering liqueur to both guests and hosts, retorts incessantly in the verbal abuse game.It is rather embarrassing for Nick and Honey, to watch a couple they barely know throwing harsh accusations towards each other, but their facade of politeness soon dissolves, after Honey mentions that Martha tells her, they have a son and the next day happens to be his sixteenth birthday, and George suddenly turns infuriated. Abetted by the steady intake of alcohol, the game of \"humiliating the host\" runs amok (a broken bottle and an unexpected gun scare), Honey is the first who cannot hold her liquor. During her vomit break, the onlooker becomes a participant, Nick removes the guard and divulges his own true feelings of marrying Honey after George tells him a disturbing story of a boy accidentally kills his both parents (in two separate cases), it will boomerang at the game of \"get the guests\" in a roadhouse and escalates the drama into \"hump the hostess\".Eventually, the exhausting cocktail of frustration, complaint, discontent, jealousy, self-contempt and self-destruction has been subsumed to the division between reality and pure illusion, it is something Nick finally realises, and it is the theme has been foreshadowed all along the film, ever since Martha breaks the rules of the game, George has been hell-bent to use the ace in the hole to win the final round, however, the end result is ever so futile, after a long and dragging night, truth is brought to the open, but after a sound sleep and the catalyst of alcohol, little will change for George and Martha and as for Nick and Honey, their ill-matched, lies-riddled young matrimony is destined for a sad ending, what a pessimistic take on modern marriage, yet the impetus is so thrilling and palpable.The quartet performers, the harridan, the doormat, the climber and the flaky, are marvellous to behold. Taylor inconceivably transmogrifies herself into an unglamorous shrew (she was only 33 then) with the campiest and most relentless verbal strafing, she is the devil of language, while Burton takes the soapbox to unreservedly exhibit George's more sophisticated inner feelings and bellows out his lines with soul-stirring cadence. Segal and Dennis, mirror a different specimen of incompatible personalities, are both at the top of their games. The film is nominated for 13 Oscars (with 5 wins, including for Taylor and Dennis) and is one of only two films to be nominated in every eligible category (the other one is CIMARRON 1931), a record cannot be exceeded by latecomers, it is rather absurd to image in today's weather, any theatre-based piece of work with the similar scale (Roman Polanski's CARNAGE 2011, is the latest cousin in my mind) can harvest all the top honours (especially outside the the acting branches) wholesale and that's the legacy behind this forcible masterpiece pitilessly scrutinising the most surreptitious human stains.",

            "content": "As this black and white film opens and the credits are rolling, we see a couple leaving a party and walking slowly back to their house. They're arm-in-arm and seemingly all is quiet and right with the world. The second the action starts, when Liz Taylor flicks on the light and we begin hearing her talk with Richard Burton, we know all is definitely not right. And thus begins 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'.The two play a college history professor and his wife, who is also the dean's daughter, and we quickly come to know that they are (a) very unhappy and frustrated with one another, (b) highly blunt and sarcastic in expressing this, and (c) functioning alcoholics. The first scene which lasts something like 50 minutes and has a younger professor and his wife (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) coming over to drinks is absolutely stunning. The script and Taylor and Burton's performances are outstanding. Humiliation, flirting with the opposite sex, telling stories and confusing \"truth and illusion\" to play mind games with the other are the order of the day, and the two serve it up again and again in ways which may make your jaw drop. The movie is minimalistic in the sense that it only has these four major characters, two extremely minor characters (who briefly appear when they visit a roadside bar), and it all takes place in a single night, mostly in their home. However, the performances are explosive and 'larger than life'. Taylor in particular really put herself out there, because let's face it, putting on weight and acting like a loud, cheap, bully is far more dangerous for a woman than it is for a man. Images of the SNL sketch from a decade later may come to your mind as she munches on a chicken leg and then carelessly tosses the bone back on the plate in the fridge. She is absolutely exceptional, and was worthy of the Academy Award she received. I was also reminded of the power in some of Jennifer Lawrence's recent performances as I watched her, but Taylor takes it to another level. Burton is also fantastic, trying to remain intellectual and appear above it all, but displaying a frustrated rage within and constantly needling all the three of the other characters. When he goes out for the rifle in the garage as Taylor is telling an embarrassing story about him and returns with it, we feel serious tension, and I thought first-time director Mike Nichols did a great job here and throughout the movie.It loses a teeny bit of momentum towards the middle, and I have to say, the story behind their child, whose apparent death seems to be an explanation for why they've gone a bit kooky, but who has been an imaginary child all along, does not ring true, at least in the emotions it evokes out of each of them. While it's a symbol of an unrealized dream they share, just as Burton's failure to advance in the hierarchy at the college is, to me this is a weakness in the original play. The ending, which as them tenderly resigned to one another despite all that bickering and fighting (and bottle breaking, and choking!), is powerful nonetheless. It's not exactly a feel-good movie, but it's one that will stir you.",

            "content": "To be frank, I didn't have a clue what the movie was about until I saw it. The title had me wondering if it might not be the life of the writer Virginia Woolf.  I didn't know what to expect from this movie.  But now that I've seen it and know what it's all about, I can't say I was too impressed by this movie.    The story basically centers around the life of an unhappy couple (Taylor and Burton) who invite another couple (Seagal and Dennis) one night very late after some party held by the school principal for whom Burton works for.  But as soon as you see the way Burton and Taylor act toward one another and the way Taylor radically changes moods, you already know what's probably going to happen: The guests are going to get to the house and witness a traumatizing scene between the unhappy couple.  The already predictable act happens and we learn a lot of things about Burton's personality (an apparent murder of his parents and a confusing apparent murder of his own son).   One of the reasons I didn't like this movie is because it was a character study that somewhat resembles \"A streetcar named Desire\" at some moments in the movie.  The movie was based on the play by Edward Albee and probably loses a lot since the play is designed for only four actors and three settings.  Overall, the movie isn't a turkey.  If you like Elizabeth Taylor, you should see it for it's probably one of her best performances ever.  All I'm stating is that I wasn't thrilled by this movie.  To put this simply, it's nothing like \"The godfather\".",

Watch again her reactions when the others have center stage. Her acting gives her underwritten character life and meaning and emotions beyond the script. But this is Elizabeth Taylor's film. There are three separate scenes (I'm sure you will be able to pick them) where her acting is so good that all acting students should be made to watch. If they don't appreciate the level she attains, throw them out of acting class. If they don't know what good acting is they can never be good actors. Watch this movie more than once.

Basically the relationship between middle aged married couple Martha (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Dame Elizabeth Taylor) and George (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Richard Burton) is charged and defined by excessive alcohol consumption and a tirade of verbal abuse on each other. George works in a New Carthage university as an associate History professor, and the President there is Martha's father, the relationship has an extra dimension added because of this, but even with their unashamed hatred for each other there is perhaps some dependence for one another. New and ambitious young university Biology professor Nick (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated George Segal) and his mousy wife Honey (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Sandy Dennis) have been invited by Martha for a night of drinking and festivities, and of course as the night goes on the couple are caught between the mind games trying to hurt each other and those around them. The biggest arguments between them comes from the mention of the unseen son they have, who celebrates his sixteenth birthday the following day, they get out of the room a little, but even then the antagonistic behaviour and profanities continue. In the end Nick and Honey leave quietly as the next day begins, it had been revealed that their son has been dead for some time, and left alone Martha and George speak quietly, in some form of reconciliation, and to the chanted question \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf\" (to the tune of \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf\"), Martha answers \"I am, George, I am.\" Taylor did deserve her Oscar for being constantly spiteful and vindictive towards her husband trying to make a career and not wanting to bring up bad memories, but he is equally compelling doing his best to counteract her emotional attacks and be just as nasty about her drinking problem and embarrassing herself, they were married in real life at the time which makes it all the more believable. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Alex North, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, it won BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Richard Burton number 70 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Burton was number 29 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Taylor was number 73 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, she was also number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, she was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and she was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women.

Before Nichols went through his ruts, his career's early explosion of greatness with films like The Graduate and Catch-22 began with this harrowingly confrontational conversation piece involving two couples, an elder one played by composed and elegant yet dark and methodical Richard Brooks and Liz Taylor, who is still as beautiful and emotional as ever, and a younger couple played by George Segal in possibly his best performance and Sandy Dennis surely in her best performance. The elder couple hosts the younger, playing games with them, which are savage verbal attacks against one or two of the others at the party.What is so very sad about this emotionally overwhelming story is that despite the clear indication of hatred, hostility, and vindictive precision combat between Brooks and Taylor, they love each other implicitly. How else could they have brought themselves through emotional tempests that would separate nearly all other couples to the point where their existence is so insulated and unbearable to the outside world? They live comfortably in each other's pain.The Virginia Woolf gimmick seems affected, especially when Richard Brooks unexpectedly dances in circles with Sandy Dennis. However, if one happens to know the subjective reason why Edward Albee gave his play the title and the recurring meter, the last line is incredibly powerful:\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" \"I am, George. I am.\"Though whether one understands this or not, Elizabeth Taylor radiates with such childlike emotion that it's difficult not to tear up.",

            "content": "Edward Albee's vituperative play about marital warfare, an acknowledged classic even during its first run, came to the screen with searing fervor by an unlikely combination of talents at that time - stage director Mike Nichols helming his first film, screenwriter Ernest Lehman coming off the big box office treacle of \"The Sound of Music\", and two mega-stars who were more famous as notorious tabloid-saturated lovers than as character actors. The highly successful 1966 adaptation of the Broadway hit was considered quite daring because of its frank portrayal of a sadomasochistic marriage and the frequent use of profanity throughout. The groundbreaking film also signaled the end of the Hayes Code, which held a censorship stranglehold over Hollywood productions since 1934. Now in a new 2006 two-disc DVD set, the movie seems marginally tamer now, but the lacerating wit of Albee's fearless dialogue and the powerful performances still make this a great picture albeit not a joyous one.The simple-sounding story focuses on the aptly named George and Martha, a middle-aged associate history professor and his older, shrewish wife. Staggering home after an alcohol-fueled faculty party, they trade their usual barbs and then are joined by Nick, a young assistant math professor, and his wife Honey, whom a drunken Martha had invited over for a late-night nightcap. Despite the late hour, Nick readily accepts the invitation since Martha's father is the university president. What ensues is a series of vitriolic cat-and-mouse scenes of tension and black comedy among the four principals. In fact, there is no one else in the movie other than a roadside caf\u00e9 owner and a waitress in the background. Delusions and deceptions contaminate the often nasty comments, and the conversations strip away the characters' self-protective veneers. With his debut film, Nichols manages to open up the story with scenes in the front yard and at the caf\u00e9, but he maintains the claustrophobic atmosphere necessary for the primal instincts to ignite and fester among the quartet.Haskell Wexler's textured black-and-white cinematography and Sam O'Steen's edgy editing add immeasurably to the often harrowing proceedings. However, what remains most memorable is the fine cast guided by Nichols. Even though Elizabeth Taylor is nearly two decades too young to play the 52-year old Martha, she throws herself into the harridan with abandon. Overweight with a gray wig and bosom-heaving outfits, Taylor makes Martha flamboyantly vulgar and sadly pitiable at the same time. It's her best movie work by miles. Richard Burton is more ideally cast as George, who begins as a despondent, beaten-upon husband but soon matches his wife's emotional blackmail ploys with cyclonic force. Out of a dozen professional attempts, this is the only time Taylor and Burton seem to justify the intrigue of their off-screen exploits. In her first major role, Sandy Dennis is impressive as the fragile Honey liberating herself with alcohol. Perhaps because Nick is the least developed role, George Segal comes off as the most pallid of the foursome.The print is clean and nicely presented in a letterbox format. The DVD extras start out strong with two alternate commentary tracks - the first a newly recorded one with Nichols and director Steven Soderbergh, the second with Wexler that was recorded for the Laserdisc release several years ago. Nichols and Wexler both provide invaluable insights into the production, while Soderbergh seems rather superfluous with his fan reactions to the movie. The second disc has two new featurettes - the twenty-minute \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: A Daring Work of Raw Excellence\", which discusses the production in retrospect, and the ten-minute \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?: Too Shocking for Its Time\" about the censorship problems around the film and how it kick-started the rating system still in use today.Also on the second disc are two archival pieces of lesser interest - an eight-minute 1966 interview with Nichols on NBC's \"Today Show\", which shows the filmmaker as less than illuminating at this point in his career, and a superficial 1975 TV special called \"Elizabeth Taylor: An Intimate Portrait\". Hosted by a meandering Peter Lawford, the latter program has interviews with Rock Hudson, directors Vincente Minnelli and Richard Brooks and even Taylor's American mother Sara but no involvement from Taylor herself, who is seen only in archival footage. Of more interest is footage from Dennis's screen test opposite Roddy McDowall, showing the actress already well prepared for her complex role. There are four trailers included for the films included in the newly released Taylor-Burton DVD set, of which \"Woolf\" is surprisingly the weakest. The others in the collection are 1963's \"The VIPs\", 1965's \"The Sandpiper\" and 1967's \"The Comedians\".",

Taylor shouts across the scream with a vengeance. Her depiction of the wife traumatized by the death of their only child is a remarkable one and she was awarded her second Oscar for it.Richard Burton received another losing Oscar nomination, this time as George, the college professor husband. He is vile and often tipsy. He cannot control the situation nor life either. George and Martha are really 2 bored individuals letting loose on life in general.George Segal and Sandy Dennis were both Oscar nominated for supporting awards for their performances as a young faculty member and his wife who realize their imperfections as well as they view George and Martha destroying each other. Definitely the best performance that Taylor gave in her long career. Dennis is amazing as a woman whose real problems surface once she hits the bottle. Taylor is dynamic as a screaming shrew Martha. Frustrated with life, she often comes across in a comic way as she torments George, the equally traumatized Richard Burton. All 4 leads received Oscar nominations. George Segal shows a depth that he earned the year before in \"Ship of Fools.\" He was certainly on a roll after this film. Is this picture trying to depict small town life in a college, with its politics and tragedies? Interestingly, we never see Taylor's father, the head of the institution. Instead, we are shown four very unhappy people living out their frustrations in great detail. This picture may be viewed as a lost weekend redemption.",

The film is an adaptation of Edward Albee's play about a university couple whose relationship is so complex, upon first look, it appears they cannot bear each other. But look closer - much closer. While they seem to have a horrible way of helping each other survive (and believe me, that is what, at least HALF of this is about) they indeed do each other a service by punishing each other for whatever it is each of them feel guilty about.But this is a psychological thriller at its best. The dialog is crisp, biting, caustic, strange, compelling, honest, brutal and thoroughly engrossing. It is disturbing and not for the faint-hearted but is a fascinating look in the dark recesses that make up some relationships. It also demands that you pay close attention to the dialog because this is where you truly find out exactly what this entails.The simple plot deals with two university couples, one young, one not-so-young, who \"entertain\" each other in the wee hours of the night after a university party. George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) invite a young couple over who just joined the university staff. While George and Martha are old hats at this \"banter\" they have developed, they draw the young couple into their psychological torture chamber resulting in a riveting but exhausting evening of fun and games. Even by today's standards, this is truly an intricate, disturbing, but thoroughly enjoyable look at what drives some relationships.Oscars went to the women but not the men! Hmmmmmmmmmmm. An even more interesting bit of trivia is that Bette Davis wanted to play this part badly but eventually lost out to Liz. One can only imagine what Martha would have been like in the hands of Bette Davis. And as much as I love Bette, she would have to have been off the chain to match Taylor's ferocity.Classic fare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

But this film was based on a play, and a play is probably what it should have remained. It's dialogue and little more -- the filming did nothing to enhance it beyond provide the story with a wider audience.

            "content": "I've heard many reports that the screen version of Edward Albee's Pulitzer-Prize-winning play greatly dilutes the content and language of the original text, blunting some of its emotional impact. Well, if this is the blunted version, I don't know if I'm prepared for the original.Richard Burton (who I've never really liked as an actor, but who I have to admit does brilliant work here) and Elizabeth Taylor (in the definitive performance of her career) go at each other like two inmates in a prison brawl, and the results are devastating. To see two people who obviously have a deep bond but who are so intent on deeply hurting each other is enough to make your skin crawl. At the root of their misery is a child, or rather the lack of one, and unable to deal with their own emotional crises, they instead turn their troubles into a grotesque game, where hurting each other becomes perversely the only thing that brings them comfort, because it's less scary than the prospect of facing the skeletons they've packed away in the closets. Burton's George is a loathsome character, a nasty yet beaten man who seems nearly inhuman in his ability to repress any show of true emotion. Taylor's Martha is one of the most fascinating female creations ever put on the stage or the screen, and Taylor tears into the role as if her life depended on it. Ultimately, it's her who will break your heart, this woman who has turned into something everyone detests in an attempt to wring from her husband a sign that she and their marriage still matter to him. I'll never forget the feeling of hollowed-out despair this movie left me with after my first viewing.George Segal and Sandy Dennis play the young couple who suffer the force of George and Martha's attack.

I think it is Albee's masterpiece (despite, or maybe because, it being so uncharacteristically realistic.)  Because I love the play so, my attitude toward the film may have been twisted somewhat.However, I have always been very unsatisfied with this version.  I believe that the Burtons were not the right people to play these parts -- at least not at the time they played them.  Both Richard and Liz were international superstars, jet set glitteratti.  Casting them then was like it would be casting J. Lo and Ben Affleck today.  Regardless of whether they are good actors, their off-screen personas step into the screen with them and take over.  You never really see Martha in this film without also seeing Elizabeth Taylor, and the same is true of Richard/George.  You try to read one relationship into the other and it detracts from both.Plus, I've always felt that this version lost a LOT of the humor in the play.  The lines are there, but the movie runs along at such a feverish pace that it's hard to enjoy the jokes.  In fact, the humor and the change of pace that humorous segments bring are critically important to how the screenplay or play work.  George and Martha are VERY scary people; not because they will really go after you but because in the battles at the center of their bizarre relationship they often set off explosions without regard to the collateral damage to others.The only thing that makes watching them do this tolerable is their intelligence and wit.  They are both very sharp very clever people with finely honed comic sense.  It is what keeps them sane.  It's what keeps Honey and her hubby from leaving.  It is what keeps George and Martha from being rejected entirely by the rest of the world.  Yet, in the film, George feels more mousy than smart and Martha is played at such a high, harridan-like pitch, that it is almost impossible to see any other qualities in her.  Moreover, \"opening up\" the play and sending them off to the bar always seemed a bad idea to me.  I think that shifting the locale shifts the mood; we all know that a bad evening will get at least a little better if you move the venue.  The play is carefully paced to build to the breaking point just before the end, when George and Martha confront a fiction they have lived for so many years.  Talking anything away from building up the head of steam needed for this moment makes it much less believable.It would be an interesting film to see done today with a different and less \"blockbuster\" cast.  I would love to see Susan Sarandon play Martha.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966)Back in 1966, when I was a teenager, I heard that Hollywood had produced a good movie, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", which became an instant success because the film was considered to be a major breakthrough in the world of movie-making. I did not know anything about the film, except the actors Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, who respectively played the role of Martha and George. I thought the movie was about the biography of the well-known British novelist and critic Virginia Woolf.I was wrong, as the film has nothing to do with the life of Ms Woolf. Last week I saw the DVD's special edition of the film. After watching it, I could not help but admire the film because the film, more than just \"very good\", turns out to be a cinematic tour de force.\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is based on Edward Albee's play of the same name. This realistic drama, aside from exploring the power struggles in society, also examines the love-hate relationship and cruelty in a marriage. All this is reflected in the married life of the childless, middle aged couple George and Martha. George is a history professor who has not made any achievement in many years as a lecturer in a New England college. His weakness and lack of ambition has made him the easy target of his wife's mockery. Martha, a heavy drinker, dominates her husband in almost every way. One night, after attending a college party, they invited a younger couple Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) to have a drink at their home. It is during this nightcap that the family drama begins to develop in full force. Angst, anguish, deceit,and infidelity follows one another as the night goes deeper and all this ends at daybreak as the weary older couple go to bed and the younger one walk to their home. Presenting such difficult psychological problems to wider audiences than those in the playhouse who usually comprise drama lovers, director Mike Nichols obviously needs the full backup of his team. The result indicates that Nichols did get what he needed and hence movie audiences can enjoy the superb acting of Miss Taylor and Mr. Burton. Good close-up takes showing Martha's hysterical grief after George has told her that their son, who in fact never exists, was killed in an accident attest to the cinematographer's outstanding achievement. And those sad gestures and facial expressions can only be performed by actresses of high caliber such as Miss Taylor. And again, the camera works well when it focuses on George's facial expressions, which clearly depict his agony and helplessness as he watches the shadows of his wife and Nick kissing in her bedroom. The repeated utterance of the then tabooed four-letter word, which is square by present standard, obviously shows how director Nichols has slogged his guts out for making a realistic movie. This, perhaps, is what that has made the public consider \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" a major breakthrough in movie-making..The film won five Academy Awards which went to Elizabeth Taylor for Best Actress; Sandy Dennis for Best Supporting Actress; while the other three for Black-and-White Art Direction, Costumes, and Cinematography. \u0096 Oei Eng Goan (enggoano@indosat.net.id), Jakarta, Indonesia",

Edward Albee wrote the play which was a sensation of it's time. Strong mature actresses like Uta Hagen and Constance Cummings have turned Martha into a sympathetic and likable character. Dame Elizabeth Taylor does the same here for Martha. She won her second Oscar for playing a complicated mature woman married to George. George and Martha's marriage unravels late in the night when they invite a young couple played by Oscar winner Sandy Dennis and George Segal to their home on a college campus after a late night party at her father's house. Martha's father is the college president. Throughout the two and half-hours, we get to know a lot about both couples, good and bad. In the end, you feel sorry for the games they play but marriage is a game in itself. George and Martha seem to thrive on an audience as they indulge in their serious games.",

And the more I think about how vulgar it is, the more I recognize it's brilliance.So why is it my favorite movie? Is it because of an entertaining story that compels you from the minute? No, because the movie itself is not supposed to be entertaining. Is it that the movie has a deep profound moral that leaves you thinking? Well, it does have a deep profound moral, but that isn't really the reason.The reason is because of character. Because the movie made you care about people that you would never really care about. The movie, in short, is about a vulgar elderly couple who return home drunk from a party and bring the guests that they invited over for a nightcap down to their level. The elderly couple, George and Martha, brilliantly portrayed by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, have an extreme love/hate relationship. Their constant bickering and yelling and loving make them the perfect opposite for Nick and Honey, portrayed by George Segal and Sandy Dennis, who seem to be the ideal American couple. But as the night progresses, and more alcohol is consumed, things seem to change, and not for the better...Throughout the movie, your either of George's side, or your on Martha's side. I was on George's side in the beginning, but at the end, I found myself on Martha's side. All the characters change, in one way or another, and your perception on them change as they do. Now, as I said, the movie is all about character. Because even though you think you know these characters, you never really do. All the twists and turns in their personalities lead you down a different path. That explains my summary heading. And it's true. A collective character analysis would probably be the size of a Harry Potter novel.By the end of the movie, you don't know what's real, what's a lie, and who is going to be the first to crack under the pressure of the other three. All of these things lead to a stunning end, where all is revealed. This is one the of few perfect movies. The best combination of acting, directing, writing, and moral that I've ever seen.

            "content": "As far as perfection is concerned, Mike Nichols' adaptation of Edgar Albee's sulfurous and successful play with the enigmatic title \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is one of these movies that strikes you with their absolute flawlessness. Yes indeed, every single element had to be at the top of the game to come up with such a thrilling psychological masterpiece at the end. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is a movie I wouldn't hesitate to use the epithetic 'perfect' to describe it, and with reasons.Let's start with the writing which explains why the movie is regarded as a milestone. The script flirts for the first time with profanity and, as said Jack Valenti, the late President of the MPAA and creator of the current rating system, \"Virginia Woolf\"'s screenplay is like the burnt arrow that set a giant fire in the remains of the Hayes Code. There would be a before and after. Sure, we could be surprised by the degree of shock that the script inspired, which such benign words as \"Goddam you\" \"Bull\" \"The hell with\" and many stuff I can write without fearing a censorship, but when you put them in the context of the film, it's revolutionary, and makes the interactions even more modern, realistic and authentic. On that department, the movie is full of one-liners giving a unique flavor to the eternal conflict relationship between George and Martha, which makes the perfect transition for the second aspect of the film's genius : the acting.Some say that the actors draw their inspiration in their past experience to find the right tone. Call it method acting or not, we can't be sure if this is true, and even if it was, it's not a guarantee for success. But for some reason, we're inclined to believe that in the case of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, a then married couple, it had to play a significant part in their portrayal of George and Martha. There is a strange complicity hidden in the animosity they display to each other, and vice versa, one would wonder why such a dysfunctional couple would stay together, but this is a mystery hidden in the heart of George and Martha, and only their behavior, their words, their teasing games trust our intelligence with subtle hints. As viewers, we're actually put in the same shoes as the two supporting characters, George Segal as Nick and Sandy Dennis as Honey. Nick and Honey will endure the collateral damages of the destructively epic night George and Martha will embark them on, a night that would ultimately reveal the misleading aspect of the young couple's apparent normality, a night full of shouts, noises, screams, laughs, games, deceptions, frustration on the rocks. \"Never mix, never worry\", they said. God knows how they will have to mix, and how sure they will have to worry.The display of feelings and emotions is breath-taking; every actor plays his and her part perfectly. Richard Burton is like the ringmaster of a burlesque tragicomedy, his delivery of lines in a Shakespearian realism is a delight, so is his apparent serenity contrasting with Martha's temper, and bestial noises. Martha, oh Martha, she's the heart of the film, she's the soul, she carries the whole movie with her presence. If one proof of Elizabeth Taylor's tremendous talent was needed, it'd be \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\". She gained almost 40 pounds, she deliberately made herself ugly when she was at the culmination of her beauty, one would hardly believe she was only 34 in this film, but this is what acting is about : dedication. And the range of emotions she showed was so wide it probably covers most of the acting displayed in others actresses' whole career. George Segal shines as the 'straight man' of the film, and manages to steal some scenes,which is quite impressive, considering his co-stars, but it's nothing like Sandy Dennis, the mousy wife, who made the portrayal of drunkenness so tragically hilarious, and right on, in its over the top note. Four great performances, four deserved Oscar nominations, and a shocking snub for Burton.It's hard to believe this was his first film, but Mike Nichols' direction is the key element as what got the best out of the actors, and the writing. You can adapt a play, but transcending it is another matter. Nichols created a sensation of chaos and tension through simple tricks handled at the right time, and the right moment. Take one moment, where Honey will mention the 'famous secret', we'll get the first close-up of George's spinning his head, and says 'What?', this is the first tense moment of the film, as the first mention of the enigma that would drive the whole narrative. It's an adaptation of a stage, but contrarily to a play, and to all the movies made before, people talk in the same time, and we manage to hear quite everything. This works because this is true to life, people talk in the same time, creating an even more uncomfortable feeling, noises and unexpected burst of violence, shouts and cries: at one point, George pushes Martha on a car so violently you can feel the impact. Mike Nichol's flawless direction is almost surpassed by the beautiful black and white cinematography that couldn't have made the night look more poetically sad and melancholic, with a smooth game of lights and shadows creating a haunting feeling embodied by the melancholic music of the film.But \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is more than a combination of elements, you still have to discover the poignant story of a couple with false illusions that reveal something deeper in their relationships, than the ugliness of their reality. So come to discover, to watch or re-watch one of the greatest American films ... if you're not afraid of Virginia Woolf",

It's easy to jump to conclusions shouting \"This is the best I've ever seen\" just after seeing one particular film. This one, however, is my fave movie, and I've seen a lot of both contemporary and old movies. Countless viewings after my initial, I still stand tall and proclaim this to be the best drama ever made.Martha's and George's relationship is that of a long married couple who have grown weary of each other. Yet they cannot leave each other, it's the only life they know. It's the only reality they've set for themselves and they dare not get out. The fights and arguments are, at the end of the day, worth the trouble of keeping your identity, your everyday life, your grasp of reality.The cast, all four of them, are meticulous in their performances. They complete each others presence, nurture the rivalry, fill the gaps and most importantly-delivers to the maximum of their potential.\nWatching this is more like seeing it performed on stage than in a theatre or on your TV in your home. Early on, you get the feeling all is not well between George & Martha, and as the guests arrive, the story is just aboutto begin. The presence of the characters adds to the overall authenticicty of the story and the parts they play. It's a clichee, but I know many plays of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" has been set up: none can match the original.If Citizen Kane is regarded as the best story ever told on the screen, this has to run very, very close.In a heart-beat, I will give this 10 out of 10. That is saying A LOT, because I am a ferociously discriminating b***ard when it comes to movies!",

            "content": "Absolutely relentless with its content, overflowing with charged emotions & sustaining its intensity from start to finish, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a tour-de-force of sublime direction, ingenious writing & explosive performances that takes hold of your attention with its armour-piercing dialogues & never lets go until the very end.The story concerns George & Martha; a middle-aged married couple, whose relationship over the years has turned very bitter & volatile. The plot covers one late evening in their lives when Martha invites a young couple for drinks but this new couple only find themselves caught in the verbal battle between Martha & George which escalates under the influence of alcohol as the night progresses.Directed by Mike Nichols, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is his directional debut & he really couldn't have asked for a better start. The screenplay by Ernest Lehman is arguably its finest aspect & its foul-mouthed script stays very true to the play it is adapted from. Cinematography makes terrific use of its black-n-white photography & uses its long takes or fluid movements quite effectively while editing never lets the drama lose its potency.Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal & Sandy Dennis and each one of them has delivered a performance that's as excellent as it is maddening. Still, the best amongst the four in my opinion was Taylor who was constantly challenged by Burton & the fierceness with which these two hurled insults at each other makes up for the film's most memorable moments.On an overall scale, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? begins as an unstable black comedy which felt like it will explode any moment but over the course of its runtime turns into an engrossing tragedy that ends on a devastating note. Also, make sure you sit through the exit music because once you're done with what's nothing less than an emotionally shattering ride, you're going to need it in order to return to normalcy.

            "content": "The New Hollywood Cinema is merely a year or so away when this film opens in 1966, and the freedom with language, controversial depiction of marriage, the 60s' notion of games people play, and so-called \"daring sexuality\" are precursors of a more mature and serious era in American filmmaking.Groundbreaking, not exactly, but it picks up many currents of actual thinking about film, and director Mike Nichols, while faithful to Edward Albee's explosive Broadway hit, tries to break the material out of its stage boundaries, The end result, sometimes unevenly, merges post-war realism in American theatre with the new consciousness of cinema.To some extent, adherence to stage origins works in its favour: the sparring foursome Taylor- Burton-Segal-Dennis play off one another in sharp and ferocious verbal combats, superbly performed by all four participants. George and Martha's marriage has itself become a kind of theatre - they play-act, pretend, tear away their public masks, act out fantasies about their private lives.Elizabeth Taylor has been justly recognized for her role as Martha, a second Oscar canceling out the sympathy vote for Butterfield 8 in 1960. Her intensely fluctuating, flamboyant Martha is the signature performance of her career. In some respects the \"game\" of the imaginary son seems a contrivance, but motherhood is essential to Martha's identity as a woman. Arguably, she is still the little girl trying to please her father. In the compelling final act, Liz really makes us believe in Martha's desperate need for \"illusions\".Nichols' flexible camera and editing style, along with Haskell Wexler's expressive photography and Alex North's furtive melodies, give the stage text an admirable cinematic dimension.Regrettably perhaps, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? marks the passing of black-and-white film. This film is the last recipient of Academy Awards in separate black-and-white categories - and also the only film to be nominated for Academy Awards in every category for which it is eligible.One of the more important, and bravely honest, American films of the 1960s.",

            "content": "The mix appears perfect, Albee's play charting the fall of Western values and the myth of the American Dream epitomised through a foul mouthed couple and imaginary son, with its principle characters to be played by Burton and Taylor, a couple whose own marriage was fast deteriorating. Indeed it does result in extraordinary performances from both Taylor, who switches perfectly from dominating, tormenting and fierce, to frightened and fragile, and Burton who seems to bring his own frustrated ambitions into the role resulting in a superb performance.However all the other things I loved about the play were lacking from the film. The play is set in the one room of the house which makes it very claustrophobic, as an audience you simply cannot escape the tension that builds to increasing climaxes every act. The script is a monster which also means this tension is stretched until it is almost unbearable, but also enthralling. By moving away from just the one room the film becomes less intense, and rather than adding variety, the extra scenes in the car and at the bar seem pointless and tacked on, rather than giving the audience a break the film merely loses the audiences focus which remains intense in the play.Naturally the film had to cut the script in order to make it palatal, however by doing so it lost a key element of the play. I remember seeing the play just after 9/11 and seeing the effect the words along the lines of \"and dogged by crippling alliances the West inevitably must fall\". This whole idea of the West hindered by tradition (History, George) falling behind the waves of the future in the East (Nick) fascinated me. However this wasn't brought out by the film, and many of the key exchanges between Nick and George such as the discussions about genetics were omitted.Nevertheless it is still fantastic to watch these two great actors battling it out in two larger than life roles, in a play that brings out the tensions of their real life marriage.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a movie that serves to remind us that nobody's perfect. Directed by Mike Nichols, it follows (what is supposed to be) a friendly meeting between two colleagues (George, played by Richard Burton and Nick, played by George Segal) and their wives (Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor and Honey, played by Sandy Dennis). However, as the night goes on and drinks become more abundant, stranger and more bizarre incidents begin to occur as bitter anger, jealousy, and truthfulness come into play. What, in the beginning, appeared to be two normal couples is ultimately revealed to be two couples that, while distinctly different, are both experiencing personal and marital woes.\nThe casting choices of Taylor and Burton should be praised. Despite being known as one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood of the time, Taylor takes her role seriously and does her best to put on weight and appear frumpy, pulling it off dramatically. Tension and chemistry between the two actors is palpable and it's hard to distinguish how much of the movie is purely acting and how much the two may be taking out on each other. Despite increasingly bizarre incidents between George and Martha (George pretending to shoot Martha, Martha calling George out in the death of his parents, and the ultimate death of their 'son') there is no reason to believe there is any acting at all going on. Instead, viewers are transported to a strange, old, and bitter couples' odd reality. The noir-esque black and white style further adds to the tense ambiance and makes every scene even more believable and, perhaps, stressed and uncomfortable (yet oddly captivating as well).\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is possibly one of the biggest pioneers influencing what we know as Hollywood today. The script, based on the play of the same name, was originally deemed to mature for audiences, was fussed over by executives at Warner Bros to ensure the movie did not receive backlash for the amount of profanity in it. Ultimately, the word 'screw' was cut from the script altogether with the condition that the phrase 'hump the hostess' could be kept. Given a \"For Mature Audiences\" rating, the movie ultimately dominated the box office, ushering in the productions of future mature rated movies.\nAs a pioneer in future films and an attest to perfect casting, this movie is a must see. Prepare for the drama of a lifetime and a story that gets more increasingly odd at the minute. With the help of Nichols, Burton and Taylor are at their best, revealing what it's like to shed the fa\u00e7ade of normalcy. 10/10",

Taylor reaches the zenith of her career as Martha, a 50-ish, slovenly, overweight, foul-mouthed alcoholic shrew married to withdrawn, repressed, reticent and languid history professor George (incomparably portrayed by Burton). One late night, after a faculty get-together at the college (where Martha's father happens to be the dean), Martha invites newly appointed biology professor Nick and his wife Honey (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) over to their house for a few drinks. Little do the naive young couple know that they are about to fall prey to the ensnaring and belittling tactics of their hosts. Martha regards George as being nothing more than a gutless failure, while George accuses her of being too flirtatious, indecent and disgusting. Each couple has secrets that they hope to shield the other one from knowing. Since Martha could never conceive, her and George fabricated a \"child\" of their own, with blond hair and green eyes, to serve as an entity of hope and happiness in their fading marriage. Nick married Honey because he impregnated her and because her father, a con man who posed as a preacher, left her a generous sum of money. The winsome, child-like Honey, ever fearful of being hurt, aborted the child and carries a facade of young effervescent vitality, which actually masks the deeply repressed angst (illustrated by Dennis' interpretive \"dance\" at the roadside bar) inside of her. No one scene in this movie tops the other one. The way the characters play on each other's strengths and weaknesses, IS what great acting is all about, immaculately performed here by the four-person cast. Out of its 13 nominations, 5 well-deserved Oscars went to Taylor, Dennis, Art Director Richard Sylbert, Costume Designer Irene Sharaff, and Cinematographer Haskell Wexler. Five other awards that the film truly merited but missed were Best Picture, Best Actor (Burton), Dramatic Score (Alex North), Editing (Sam O'Steen) and Best Director (Debuting Mike Nichols, who would win for his next film, \"The Graduate\"). A classic bombshell of a film that broke through all the Hollywood taboos of its day and emerged as a triumphant bouquet of unforgettable acting. **** of ****.fliratflirtatious and",

It's a movie that's easy to discuss and have opinions about after watching it. It's good.But all of the above would also be true of a stage version of the same play. The adapting of the play, in itself, is not that interesting. It actually feels a bit all over the place, like the director wanted to demonstrate how this is a movie and not a play. This leads to some awkward close ups, some shaky scenes where the camera moves around a bit too much, and some scenes filmed with an nauseating angle (most likely on purpose). This adds very little to the movie, and often it removes you more from the experience than it adds to it. There are some great shots, though, but it feels like strikes of luck in the chaos, and they do not salvage the movie-aspect of this.Despite my harsh words here, it's still a very good movie, and it works really well despite itself.",

In the film, she gives everything she has and convinces.Star Richard Burton is also good. With a more frugal acting, he makes as strong an effort as the hissing, screaming and bushy Taylor. It is his character that gives some kind of warmth to this otherwise very icy story. While the younger couple seems to lack real love for each other, George reminds us that the older couple still has - or at least has existed - something deeper that has kept them together all these years, despite the obvious contempt for each other.\"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" shows the duality when it is at its ugliest. The realistic and black drama tells the sad story of two lovers that become each other's mortal enemies. For the film's two couples, the promised paradise of marriage has become hell. Should they be tormented there until the day of death separates them?Debut film director Mike Nichols also had his background on Broadway - where he had a good reputation thanks to his innovative sets and his ability to attract the best from his actors. Nevertheless, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" avoids feeling like a filmed play. It is never experienced as static - but is constantly in motion. Nichols places the story in several environments and uses live camera guidance to amplify the events.Unfortunately, the film havent aged well at all, due to the film's awfully long runtime and mediocre concept.

The movie is in stark Black and white and is the story is of a middle aged married couple, George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) who decide to spend the evening with their neighbors Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis). Burton plays a boisterous, frustrated and angry professor and Taylor plays an equally angry, aging overweight, hen-pecking wife. Using what seems to be their home and subsequent neighborhood, the bickering pair are joined by their neighbors Nick and Honey, a young delusional and often confrontational couple, as they peruse the backyard stage. What has since been described as a nocturnal 'talk-a-thon' the four dissect observations on life, sex and personal opinions. The splendid cast make for interesting viewing and not without merit. Burton is superb using his dramatic stage style, wit and cynicism to make his point, while Taylor parries with vocal fluctuations and commentary. Segal and Dennis are seen as overwhelmed by the couple's attack, but emerge triumphant as superior characters. A good film if you're patient enough to endure the marathon movie. ****",

With a cast of four firing on all cylinders - Elizabeth Taylor superb as Martha, drunken fantasist and all-round loudmouth; Richard Burton (a great role for him sadly overlooked by the Academy Awards) as her - on the surface - long-suffering husband George; Sandy Dennis (impressive) as the neurotic Honey; and George Segal as Nick, the ambitious new blood professor.Honey and Nick are, of course, Martha and George a lifetime ago, and look what's in store for them.  Secrets, lies and true feelings on all sides come spilling out during the night the young couple visit the older couple's place.  It isn't all top-note, there are quiet moments, too - the script is superb.  This is certainly Burton-Taylor's best collaboration and proves both were great actors in their time.",

            "content": "\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is an American black-and-white movie from 1966, so this one is already over half a century old and for that year, it was one of the big players during the awards season. We'll get a bit into detail on that later. Director Mike Nichols, who died not too long ago, was still pretty young when he made this movie and it brought him his first Oscar nomination. He won the year after. His writer Ernest Lehman was already more renowned, but never managed to win an Oscar. However, the two (only) female actors you find in this film, Liz Taylor and Sandy Dennis, won their respective categories. For Taylor, a true Hollywood legend, it was her second Oscar and final nomination, a bit surprising probably because she was only in her mid30s here and lived on for many decades afterwards. For Sandy Dennis, it was her only Oscar nomination and maybe also a bit surprising that she won because she (just like Taylor) did not triumph at the Golden Globes. I have read very different perceptions of Dennis' performance. Some think she is amazing and one of the best supporting actress wins ever, others think she is really cringeworthy and did not even deserve the nomination. Your choice to make, but it is kinda nice to see opinions differ so much, isn't it? As for the two guys: Burton and Segal (the only one still alive as of 2019 and still a prolific actor on The Goldbergs and other stuff) were both nominated too. I would not agree with Segal's nomination. Then again, he shared most of his scenes with Burton and that is not an easy task for any actor to avoid looking inferior in such a scenario. Burton, however, was amazing and many people say he is the one actor who never won a competitive Oscar and should have (next to O'Toole perhaps). And I myself would have been perfectly fine with him winning for his portrayal here. He was really, really good, for me the cast's MVP, also above Taylor still. And of course above the other two. And all this despite really not having the showiest and awards-baity (in contrast to Taylor) material. A bit of a pity he did not get the Oscar with this film clearly being up the Academy's alley probably not too far away from a Best Picture win with three other wins besides the two actresses' triumphs.Okay, now a few words on the movie itself: Not really that common anymore by mid 1960s to be black-and-white, but also not that much of a surprise. This is the story of a long-married couple that keeps playing games of power all the time in order to stand up against each other. For example Taylor's character keep talking how she is dissatisfied with her man's lack of professional success. Well, he is successful , but not head of the department as she hoped he would be and that's what she keeps telling him clearly provoking him. Wait till he gets the gun. Now that scene was really memorable, the most memorable for me and it's all Burton again, the only one I also remembered from when I watched the film years ago for the first time. Now I got the chance to see it again on the big screen and even if I was not really blown away, I am glad I took it. It was a good movie, very dialogue-driven of course, but sadly also with some lengths in the second half. The ending is genuinely moving though, but I won't go much into detail here to avoid spoilers. All I want to say is that it is about the child of the protagonists. There are references earlier on already about a book which includes a car accident and more from the past, but there I was not entirely impressed and it felt a bit shoddy to make the connection between all of these. Or maybe a rewatch is needed. But I don't think the film was good enough for me to give it one, at least not in the next couple years. But it was the cast that kept me interested. Burton was amazing, Taylor was good too, Dennis brought in some okay comedy with getting more and more drunk and with what she was babbling. You could say she gave in to the situation very quickly for sure. Segal had probably the toughest challenge with not too great material, but still succeeded on some occasions with standing up to Burton and I think he was okay.Of course, this is also a film with its small cast and not too many locations that makes for a really good choice to be adapted into a stage play and I think it was many times. I would watch that. And if these modern adaptations make sure the old movie gets a solid amount of attention again and some people maybe even looking into it that have never heard of it before, then I am all for it. All in all, this was a good watch with a great moment here and there and of course Burton's mesmerizing performance. Sadly, these really good moments were just not too frequent, not enough for a film considerably over two hours for me to say that this was one of the best movies of 1966. But it is definitely good enough for a thumbs-up and positive recommendation. I am just not sure if I like the title enough or think it is important enough for the film to be named after that song. Maybe with the final scene yes. So yeah, I think you should go watch it. But it is definitely more of a drama, maybe even thriller, than a comedy movie. You will smile at times and be glad you are not one of these people, but laugh-out-loud moments there certainly aren't.",

            "content": "Playwright Edward Albee once noticed a message on a men's room wall in a bar and decided to make it the title of what may be his most commercially successful play. If you ever read Ms. Woolf's works, you will observe how she succeeds at stripping away the superficial layers of appearances, as if she were peeling an onion, until she finally arrives at the heart of the matter, usually lying somewhere deep within our consciousness. The disclosure of the truth that lurks beneath the surface may reveal very dark and disturbing revelations.George teaches history at New Carthage University where the father of his wife, Martha, happens to serve as President. The name of this institution, bucolic only in its outward facade, suggests a once great civilization that suffered annihilation and was later resurrected by the Romans before finally fading away from the modern world. To my ear, it also sounds like \"carnage\", which means \"slaughter\" or \"massacre\". By their constant exchange of verbal attacks, intensified by the substantial consumption of alcohol, George and Martha attempt to annihilate each other each and every day. Through the use of abusive language, they repeatedly cut each other to pieces and seem to enjoy the activity as if it were a sport.Enter Nick and Honey, brand new members of the academic community, who agree to drop by for a nightcap following a faculty gathering that ends after 2:00 in the morning. As another user reviewer warns us, \"don't expect anything good to happen after 2 am\". In this case, Nick and Honey have ample opportunity to escape from the deadly clutches of their hosts, but they elect to stay...and stay...and stay. Didn't you leave something burning on the stove, Honey? Don't you have to check on your sick Aunt Matilda in Madawaska, or are you actually drawn to the bizarre behavior of this nutty couple? Nobody keeps Nick and Honey imprisoned by George and Martha but themselves.The idyllic New England college campus is the perfect setting for a theme that contrasts a constant state of pretense and denial against a very disturbing sense of reality. Director Mike Nichols (\"The Graduate\", \"Catch 22\", \" Silkwood\"), along with his editor Sam O'Steen, took great pains to get everything right, including the most meticulous lighting details, and the persistence and hard work truly paid off with Nichols' huge success as a first-time film director.The one problem with the film, like so many others, is that it opens with a half hour or so of very explosive dialogue that is almost impossible to sustain in its brutal intensity. If the action doesn't begin to drag seriously somewhere in the middle, I would rate it higher.In spite of the human pain that dwells beneath her words, Elizabeth Taylor is hilarious as she delivers a constant bombardment of verbal assaults, mostly aimed at her disappointed, disillusioned husband, played by her twice divorced, real-life spouse, Richard Burton. George Segal and Sandy Dennis have no problem keeping up with the powerful team of Taylor and Burton, who perform at their very best here. I agree with Ms. Taylor that Mr. Burton should have received at least one Oscar for so many outstanding film performances, including this one. While Martha (Taylor) delivers the sharpest zingers, George (Burton) inflicts even more toxic venom upon his victims through his subtle attacks on their weakest vulnerabilities. His understated insults are often even deadlier than Martha's loud, vulgar vitriol. George is even more determined than his wife to make everyone around them as miserable as they are.Although the script could have been tighter and while the film should have been cut to a sufficient ninety minutes, the dramatic talent of Taylor and Burton kept me intrigued, if not disturbed, by their self-destructive relationship.",

At times it is a bit overdone but it is used well to deliver the state and perspective of the characters, eventually the motives and what tragic history led to the night's events. The acting by everyone in this is out of this world and brilliantly executed. There's an umbrella scene in this that is magnificent. I did feel the friends should have left a million times but then it becomes apparent why they didn't...which is very well done.

            "content": "Despite the title, this film is not about the celebrated Bloomsbury novelist. According to legend, Edward Albee, the author of the original play, saw the graffito \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"- a play on the song \"Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Wolf\"- in a men's lavatory and liked it so much that he decided to use it as the title for his next play. When the play first came out in 1962 it was widely regarded as unfilmable; Albee's strong language and adult themes had been regarded as shocking even on Broadway, traditionally more liberal about such matters than Hollywood, and it was felt that the rigours of the Production Code would make a film version impossible. But this was the sixties, the times they were a'changing, and the moral climate was a'changing with them. In the event the film followed only four years later, without any serious opposition.The action takes place in the home of George, a lecturer in history at an American university, and his wife Martha. (Albee allegedly named his characters after George and Martha Washington). Their marriage is a turbulent one, and both have an alcohol problem. The film narrates the events of a night after George and Martha return home, having invited Nick, a young biology lecturer at the same university and his wife, Honey, back for drinks. Both George and Martha are the worse for drink, and they begin to insult one another in front of their guests. Nick and Honey are at first embarrassed, but are later drawn into the circle of mutual recrimination, which ends with several startling revelations about both marriages. (\"Nick\" and \"Honey\" are the names which appear in the cast list, but Nick is never referred to by name throughout the film. He does call his wife \"Honey\", but I assumed this was a term of endearment rather than her actual name).Albee envisaged George and Martha as being in their mid to late fifties, and it was originally intended that they should be played by James Mason and Bette Davis, both around that age. The roles, however, eventually went to Hollywood's favourite married couple, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Gossip at the time suggested that their real-life relationship was just as stormy as that of George and Martha, and they were often cast as feuding couples. The following year, for example, they were to play Petruchio and Katherina in Zeffirelli's \"The Taming of the Shrew\".Although both, especially Taylor, were considerably younger than Mason and Davis, the decision to use them paid off; they made the roles their own to such an extent that I cannot imagine any other actors playing them. Burton had one thing in common with Mason; both were (along with the likes of Kirk Douglas and Cary Grant) candidates for the title of \"greatest actor never to win an Oscar\". I think that Burton never came closer to an Oscar win than he did here; he was nominated, and probably would have won in many other years, but in 1966 it would have been difficult indeed to have bettered Paul Scofield's magisterial performance in \"A Man for All Seasons\", the film which took that year's \"Best Picture\" award. As for Taylor, the film provided her with her second \"Best Actress\" Oscar, an award much more richly deserved than her first, which had come for her contribution to that mediocre drama \"Butterfield 8\". George Segal and Sandy Dennis were also nominated for \"Best Supporting Actor\" and \"Best Supporting Actress\" for their roles as Nick and Honey, making this the first time in history that a film's entire credited cast was nominated. (Dennis also won in her category).Segal and Dennis are certainly good, but what gives the film its force and energy is the way in which Burton and Taylor combine together to give what can be regarded as a joint performance, greater than either of their individual contributions. Despite all the histrionics, this is not just a flashy surface performance. We are always, especially at the end, conscious of the truth which underlies the marriage of George and Martha. They can be- and often are- selfish, spiteful, cynical and bitter. They can rage against one another with a passion. Yet they need each other because, in their way, they still love another (something one cannot necessarily say about Nick and Honey).The film was directed by Mike Nichols. In 1966 he was already an established, and highly successful, theatrical director, but this was his first experience of directing a film. With \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" he joined that select list of directors, dating back to Welles with \"Citizen Kane\", who made a masterpiece on his film debut. He was to make an even greater one with his second, \"The Graduate\". 9/10.",

It is an extraordinary, towering performance. One of the scenes in which the previous statement is justified is the one in the dance hall/diner. That scene is worth watching over and over. The speech he gives to Nick underneath the tree is the definition of good acting. Every scene he has you want to see twice. His sarcastic remarks are delivered with such joy you start to enjoy them.

When she her husband and the guests leave the dance hall and she proclaims \"I am not a monster\" is mesmerizing. That whole scene is mesmerizing, especially when she gets pushed against the car.

That scene where she describes her son's \"birth\" and \"life\" is delivered so convincingly its no wonder why she won the Best Actress Oscar that year by acclamation.Sandy Dennis makes a lasting impression as Honey the other professors wife.

            "content": "They sure don't make 'em like this anymore. Released in 1966, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is a film adaptation of the Edward Albee play, which debuted four years earlier, about a sadistic, wickedly humorous married couple, George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), who draw a younger husband and wife (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) into their twisted dynamic throughout a very late night. Once considered so shocking because of its language and themes, which was relatively profane and outrageous for the time, it's now jarring to see a film explore the dynamics of human relationships with such well-observed intelligence, wit, candor, and complexity. It's sheer perfection and one of my all-time favorite films.Directed by then first-timer Mike Nichols, and adapted by Ernest Lehman, it stays wonderfully faithful to the play, even though some minor things are cut and added for the film medium and length. Albee sees people with an x-ray vision and gives George and Marta this ruthless sense of honesty. Not only do they strip the people around them bare, but they can turn the same fierce insight back on themselves. It has a devastating effect, like a car crash you have to watch, but it can also turn a dime and be absolutely funny.It's a highly dialogue-driven affair, with lots of long takes. You've got to be able to pay attention to get into this movie. And unlike some contemporary and rather self-indulgent dialogue-heavy writers like Tarantino or Sorkin, the dialogue never seems arch or self-conscious or unnecessary. Every conversation is very natural and has a deeper meaning, especially when you dive further into the film and discover just how self-constructed George and Martha's lives are. Their lies, fantasies, and fictions are ironic considering how brutally truthful they are in other moments. But, it goes to show just how honest and how dishonest people can be, at the same time. Even the most straightforward people lie to themselves and to others, at times, to be protected from the harsh reality of frustrations, doubts, failures, or unhappiness. And when this all emerges during the climax, it's totally heartbreaking.The writing is genius but the performances are really what seal the deal. In my opinion, there's not a link weak in the bunch. Everyone adds something different and distinctive to the film.Elizabeth Taylor rightfully won an Oscar for Best Actress for her hurricane of a performance as Martha. It might seem a bit overplayed, at moments, but that element completely works when you consider how overplayed Martha is, as a person. She is intentionally loud, obnoxious, rude, and vulgar. But, Taylor adds such soul, heartbreak and humanity to her that you can't help but feel for her and even see some of yourself or someone you know in her mean-spirited streak.Her then husband Richard Burton has, in some ways, the less showy role. George holds back quite a bit in the first act, seeming simply like Martha's sharp-witted yet castrated husband. But, when he lets loose, watch out. The passivity drops and he is totally ferocious. You see the anger that's been brewing inside of him for years with Martha, as well as the disappointment and emptiness. He should've won the Oscar.George Segal has the most thankless role of the quartet, having to basically be the \"sane\" one throughout the film. But, he also acts as our moral compass. You can relate to Nick's horror and discomfort at everything that's happening, as well as the way he's eventually roped into all of the games and how that's even more horrifying to him.Sandy Dennis gives an Oscar-winning performance full of unusual yet spot-on choices. She plays dumb very well, especially since Honey is playing dumb herself. She's just so awkward and out-of-place in the midst of everything that she has to act stupid and oblivious, as well as getting hysterically drunk, just to survive.This is a true acting masterclass and one of the most moving, layered, and truthful films I've ever seen.",

This kind of thing seems to be typical among the battling couple with them making up almost as soon has hostilities commence. Having young 28 year-old biology teacher Nick,George Segal,and his 26 year old mosey looking and neurotic wife Honey,Sandy Dennis come over for a nightcap the drinking and feuding continues all throughout the evening with Honey, who can't keep up with rest of the party goers, getting sick from all the booze she consumed.George who takes every kind of insult that his wife Martha throws at him is later really ticked off when Honey asks him about his son that a drunken Martha blurted, or belched, out about when she was talking things over with her in private. This somehow set something off in George's head who suddenly started to go after Martha like a bull at the sight of a red flag! The meek and quite George now turns the tables on Martha in her bringing up the taboo subject, the couples son and what happened to him, that she and him promised each other to never talk about in private and especially, by Martha telling Honey about it, in public!The film and the drinking goes on non-stop with a rude and uncivil George also getting the info from a drunk as a skunk Nick the circumstances behind his and Honey's relationship before they got married. Tearing into Honey about her fear of having children has an outraged Nick, who was a middleweight boxing champion in collage, almost belt George but he's either too drunk or too civilized, he's a good 15 years younger then George, to do it!***SPOILERS*** It's later in the movie that we and Nick find out that George was using psychological warfare on Martha to get her over her hangup about their son who in fact was killed in a car accident some time ago when he was in his teens. Never telling Martha that her and his son was dead was the only way for George to keep her sanity but what it did was have the poor and mentally unstable woman hit the bottle big time. With George in him trying to placate her hitting the bottle along with her! It's in her coming to terms with the fact that her son is no longer here that had Martha finally overcome her psychosis as well as her drinking problem. And it was in Martha's unconsciously bringing up her and George's son to Honey that in fact brought that all about.The gorgeous and shapely Elizabeth Taylor, who won and Academy Award as Martha, really went into the part she had in the film by gaining some 30 pounds and looking at least 15 years older to make herself believable in it. Miss Taylor seemed to get older and heavier, looking like a sack of Idaho potatoes, as the film went on. This was the same drop dead gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor who made hearts melt and heads turn just a scant few years ago in movies like \"Suddendly last Summer\" \"Butterfield 8\" and \"Cleopartra\" when she was considered to be the most beautiful and sexist woman in the world.",

My thoughts on it are still scrambling around in my head. All I can say is, I have seen some truly hateful and despicable behavior in film before, but never this much. The emotions and anger boiling here really become hard to watch as the film goes on, and I rarely call a film hard-to-watch even in the grimmest of subject matters. The ensemble cast leads it, and truly an amazing achievement. Taylor is the driving force behind the anger, and this is the first time I have seen her in anything. Truly amazing performance, but it's also good to note the more quiet, the more steady approach by Richard Burton. In fact, this tends to be more a film about him, as we see it mostly through his eyes and we are sitting front and center with him throughout. George Segal is also fantastic here, his tones wavering from the different actions taking place. Sandy Dennis is good at times, and at other times comes off as really inexperienced and lousy. Honestly, how she won an Oscar is beyond me.Overall, I want to let the film settle more to be able to talk about it's actual content, but as it stands, it's a powerful film on all fronts.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) :\nBrief Review -Mike Nichols gives full justice to Edward Albee's phenomenal stage play with a brilliant and engaging execution. I couldn't see Albee's play (naturally), but while watching the cinematic adaptation, I could feel it from the first scene itself. The film starts with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor's intensely dark romantic chat, but soon you realise that their relationship is completely contradictory. The conversion and the way it has been shot gave me feel of watching a stage-play and the execution was exactly similar too. The long shots, the pauses in the conversation, and the use of property; everything is just like watching the stage play on the big screen. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is not a regular drama, nor is it made for the people who like to watch them. It's pretty dark, vulgar, abusive, and loathsome, so you'd better know about it before watching it. Except for the sex scenes (thanks to the movie codes that were broken after 14-15 years), this Hollywood flick has everything that so many Spanish, French, Russian and German films showed in the post-50s era. The tension keeps building as you get to know more facts through highly engaging conversations, and it also unfolds many shades of the characters. That's all there is to it. There is nothing in the script to convince you, but the screenplay and the treatment given to it make it work for you. The second best thing about it is the performances of those four actors. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton both gave their career-best performances in the film. Burton surpassed \"The Robe\" and \"Hamlet\", while Taylor overtook \"A Place in the Sun\", \"Cat On a Hot Tin Roof\", \"Suddenly, Last Summer\" and \"Cleopatra.\" Sandy Dennis is outstanding with that accent and expressions, and George Segal is fantastic throughout the film. The super direction by Mike Nichols makes the film a must-watch, but yes, it hasn't got that universal appeal.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",

            "content": "'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' a famous and shocking black comedy, is based on Edward Albee's scandalous play of the same name. First performed in New York in October of 1962, it captured the New York Drama Critics Circle Award and the Tony Award for the 1962-63 season.A well-constructed piece of work, having philosophical significance in context of the drama of the absurd, it mingles the reality with fantasy to present a savagely satirical attack on spiritual sterility, conformity, hypocrisy and the deep feeling of the tragedy of alienation.We are introduced to George (Richard Burton), a middle-aged history professor, and his acerbic wife, Martha (Elizabeth Taylor).The movie presents an all-night drinking bout of the couple, joined by a vacuous biology professor, Nick (George Seagal), and his wife, Honey (Sandy Dennis).Through the verbal torturing of one another, George and Martha eventually achieve catharsis by exercising their fixation about a nonexistent son.George and Martha, the older couple, had created an imaginary son to sustain themselves. At first drawn together in their horror, Nick and Honey soon find themselves sucked into the spiral of buried resentments and unspoken rage.Yet as the seemingly perfect marriage of Nick and Honey begins to reveal its many flaws, George and Martha find their own twisted bond within the mutual rancor\u0085 Nominated for 13 Categories,the movie won 5 Oscars.(Best Actress in a Leading Role\u0097Elizabeth Taylor, Best Actress in a Supporting Role\u0097Sandy Dennis, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration\u0097 Richard Sylbert, George James Hopkins, Best Cinematography\u0097 Haskell Wexler, Best Costume Design\u0097Irene Sharaff). The performances are brilliant. The on screen chemistry between former real-life couple Taylor and Burton adds sparks to Ernest Lehman's tight script. Haskell Wexler's phenomenal black-and-white cinematography only heightens the emotions on this non-stop two-hour roller coaster. The title of the play was taken from a one-time popular song, 'Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Wolf?' An exploration of the myth of the American Dream, it impresses us as an exquisite piece, illustrating the significant place of illusion in modern American life. The personal failures of the characters represent the failure of a culture, and the unborn son is symbolic of the American dream of the fulfillment and happiness.The metaphor certainly reaches beyond the immediate to the American scene in general, and the film successfully communicates the ethos of artificiality.The technical dexterity of organizing incidents into a close-knit fabric of emotion and action is superb, and that's what makes this one a gem in American theater.",

There are only a few and they tend to be very confined, even when outside with the camera almost always sticking close to characters. But just like in \"12 Angry Men\" it is precisely that which makes the film riveting. In such a little space Mike Nichols moves the camera in almost every possible way making for a very cinematic presentation which is only matched by the fiery performances. With just four characters the cast puts in enough subtlety and detail into each one that there is enough room for 10 characters from most other films. Elizabeth Taylor steals practically the whole movie in her Oscar winning performance and it is darkly amusing to see such a pretty leading lady turn into a monster right before your very eyes and then down into a weeping and vulnerable woman as the \"psychological war\" takes its toll on all those involved.

Profanity and sex were becoming more common in the film industry, and this is one of the first films to break the barrier and defy the censors. Based on Edward Albee's hit play, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? centers on George and Martha(Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor), a college professor and his bickering wife. George has his moments, but all-in-all he's a pretty laid back fellow. Martha, however, isn't quite as submissive, and finds an argument in even the most trivial circumstances. The film takes place during one very long evening at George and Martha's house with all sorts of verbal spouts which degenerates into more serious business as the night passes on. The touchy subject that causes the most conflict between the couple is their sixteen-year-old who no one ever sees. These unpleasant events are witnessed by a naive, younger couple(George Segal, Sandy Dennis) who have been invited to the house for the evening, and their visit to the place subsequently threatens to jeopardize their own marriage. The fact that very little has been changed from the original play is great, and the actors(all Oscar-nominated) are terrific. With this film, Elizabeth Taylor fearlessly betrayed her glamorous Hollywood image and took on what still stands as the most challenging role of her career. She also took home the Best Actress Academy Award for 1966. Co-star Sandy Dennis, as the blonde, befuddled Honey, also won an Oscar for her scene-stealing supporting role.

Filming \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" marks a whole other level of challenge, especially in the hands of a rookie director as Mike Nichols was at the time. But on the shoulders of stars and real life husband and wife Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, \"Virginia Woolf\" commands attention amid all its source material's unpleasantness.Edward Albee's play is a sickening portrait of American suburbia, of people feeling compelled to create illusions of themselves in the public domain because of a childish inability to cope with their faults or private disgraces. After a party, George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor) are one such couple who decide to trade jabs at each other after Martha invites a younger couple from the party over for a nightcap. Little do Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) know that they're to be an audience and then some for George and Martha's perverse \"games.\"George and Martha are downright nasty, exposing each other's secrets, assaulting each other verbally and physically and coming off as absolutely detestable to the audience. Amazing, however, how that doesn't injure Taylor and Burton's performances. They're so impeccably good at being awful people. Taylor is something else as the childish and brash Martha. At first it's George we feel bad for because she's so immature, but then George begins to insult the guests and has a knack for exacting his revenge on Martha with verbal cunning.All four actors earned Academy Award nominations (two won) and unarguably, this does deserve to be one of the only films of all time to have its entire cast nominated. The mousy (as George accurate calls her) Dennis stands out in particular as the brandy-guzzling Honey, the innocent character who more or less gets spat on during the film.Nichols chooses a heck of a debut picture. Starting his career and a master comedian improviser, he started directing for the stage and clearly found no trouble adapting to film. He uses a very Hitchcockian approach to the film, carefully choosing very wide above shots and getting very close and even zooming in more tense moments. He certainly understood that capturing these performances and highlight the cast's strengths was priority number one.\"Virginia Woolf\" has and will continue to rub first-timers the wrong way. It's a tough story to enjoy even with the moments of levity, but Nichols and the cast do Albee's work great justice and effectively pull off the mask for the audience as the playwright initially intended.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",

Taylor's work in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is some of the finest acting by a major star ever captured on film. In fact, I would say that Miss Taylor's performance is the best ever given by an actress in a motion picture.Elizabeth Taylor has often been called The Most Beautiful Woman In The World, as well as the most glamorous, and I agree completely. But Miss Taylor has always had much more to rely on than her stunning good looks. She is also one of the most gifted actresses to ever grace the Hollywood screen. Oh yes, she definitely has the beauty and glamour, but she also has the talent to match. Taylor won her second Academy Award for WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, as well as the New York Film Critics, National Board Of Review, and British Film Academy Best Actress Awards.I would like to personally wish Miss Elizabeth Taylor a very healthy and HAPPY BIRTHDAY today. Elizabeth, you truly are THE GREATEST STAR OF ALL TIME! Chad Edwards",

The film is so chaotic that even when I thought it won't give any new surprises, poof, it does somethinf unexpected again. Acting was amazing, all four actors gave phenomenal performances.

I did not go into shock but I was surprised. Patricia Neal, Roz Russell along with Ms. Davis were the often cited choices for the great role of Martha.I might have selected Susan Hayward. In hindsight Warner and Nichols made an inspired choice as Ms. Taylor is nothing short of magnificent dominating the movie from start to finish and justly won the Academy Award for her performance, surely the finest of her career and one of the finest of all time. Bravo Elizabeth!Richard Burton is cast as George, again against type, as Burton in real life was a commanding Man. Before the film was shot James Mason was favored for George. George Segal is fine as the Young Professor, my only criticism and I fear I am alone is Sandy Dennis who was Nominated and won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.

The film is of course full of priceless one-liners such as \"What a dump\", \"You make me puke\" and of course \"If you existed, I'd divorce you\".

            "content": "Screen adaptations of stage plays have always had a rather unique character. Cinema is typically a visual medium, and story is conveyed as much through images and actions as anything else. Theatre on the other hand is a verbal medium, composed almost entirely of spoken words which must be convey all manner of other things. And yet this does not make them incompatible. Both can be recall the natural and familiar \u2013 just as real life is full of long wordless moments, so is reality filled with intense periods of continuous verbal interaction, as in the party-of-sorts depicted in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? And both can be entertaining \u2013 just as action and powerful imagery can engage us, so too can emotive language and clever wordplay.The original Edward Albee play was an acclaimed yet controversial success thanks to its profanity and fairly blunt sexual references, and its transfer to the screen (a more conservative medium) was no less fraught. However what really makes it stand out to me as modern and edgy for its time is its frank depiction of the private lives of educated folks. We never see the academy function that the characters have just departed, but we can imagine its tense decorum. The play shows us what such characters do and say in more liberated (not to mention booze-sodden) circumstances, and it is very true to life; a married couple grown overly familiar with the years, playing with words to get at each other, disguising their true affection under layers of overt contempt. The dialogue masterfully trots the line between raw realism and bizarre wit. These are all perfect building blocks for the poignant conclusion.For this cinematic adaptation we have a real masterstroke in casting, with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor playing the two leads. The original choices were James Mason and Bette Davis, who would no doubt have been very good, but they were the obvious choices, safe and predictable. There is something unique and exciting about Burton and Taylor, aged-up and sexed-down to play cynical, middle-aged versions of themselves (that may not have been too far from reality). Both give absolutely monumental performances. Taylor, unrecognisably frumpy, completely surrenders her dignity to go through the gamut of emotions. The bit where she rhythmically taunts Burton about his novel is mesmerising. Burton shows a casual dryness as he delivers such witty lines as \"you'll need it as you get older\". He is also disturbingly unpredictable. When he goes to get the shotgun, we can absolutely believe he is going to commit murder (and what actually happens is so typical of the play's charming weirdness). Above all, Taylor and Burton have a fantastic rapport, especially in the final scene. Anyone would think they were married\u0085 ;) This was the debut picture of director Mike Nichols. This young sprout has a lot in common with a veteran director of the classic era, William Wyler, in that he takes extra special care in showing only who and what we need at any given time, even if results in some pretty odd-looking violations of cinematic grammar. To give you an example, there's a moment about fifteen minutes in where Burton and George Segal are discussing a painting. They are held in a long, static take, and instead of cutting to Taylor we hear her commenting and cackling offscreen. This stillness preserves the awkward intensity of the moment. When it's over we do then cut to a very effective head-on shot of Taylor. Every angle, every cut, and conversely every period without a cut, is there for a reason. Nichols is a child of his time and he is somewhat more stylised than his forebear Wyler, with some giddy close-ups and punchy zooms, but this never quite amounts to the showing off seen in the work of many youngsters of that era. In the previous year Wyler had received his last ever Best Director Oscar nomination, and for this picture Nichols received his first. It's nice to see that the techniques were being passed on from one generation to the next.The trouble often is with stage-to-screen adaptations that, with all that wordiness, they seem to move slowly and awkwardly. This is true for a lot of examples both ancient and modern. But Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is incredibly fast-moving, thanks to the snap and wit of the source material, the canny direction (honourable mention to the superb Haskell Wexler cinematography) and some powerful acting. This is theatre-as-cinema at its most dazzlingly effective. An evening of fun and games indeed",

Read the dialogue, and see how much love there IS beneath the hatred, and vice versa.  Read the dialogue, playing the parts, and you realize how whacked these two couples are, how much failed-potential plays in their relationships. \nYou also realize that Taylor, Burton, Segal, and Dennis, were PERFECT in their roles!

Surely this misses part of the point: the one-liners, ironic remarks, insults, comebacks and academic puns are nasty, to be sure, but they're also (let's be honest) very, very funny ... and even if you don't find them funny, there's a certain joy - that's right, joy - in watching the sheer skill with which George and Martha lob darts at the sensitive parts of each other's anatomy.  The film wouldn't be chilling if it WEREN'T entertaining.  If it were mere unrelenting, stupid misery, then (a) nobody would get past the first reel, and (b) George and Martha would be like members of an alien species; if there were no aesthetic merit, so to speak, in George's insults, we wouldn't know why he uttered them.The audience I saw it with were, in fact, chortling relentlessly most of the way, and I'm sure THEY missed part of the point, too.  It's funny, but not funny in that way.  An audience alive to the drama will wait to see where the latest witticism will lead rather than laugh immediately.  (By the way: people who, at ANY point during ANY movie, laugh uproariously and then sigh and say \"Oh, dear\", as THREE members of the audience within earshot of me did, oughtn't be allowed to watch movies at all; at least, not in public.) I won't say where it leads in the end, partly because I'm still not sure. The moments preceding the ending require active deciphering, before we even begin to attend to the more interesting question of what comes next, or even whether or not we are being held out any hope.To the extent that the film IS hard to sit through (perhaps it is, a tiny little bit, here and there) it's not because of the cruelty or suffering, but because it's been adapted from a play - not just any play, but one set in real time, with four characters verbally assaulting one another in a confined space.  Such plays are likely to come across on screen as nothing more than dense thickets of words.  Mike Nichols has done a good job of preventing this.  There's rich black cinematography and a score by Alex North (sounding vaguely like one of those 1960s combinations of jazz and Bach) which manages to sound relaxed and alert at the same time, but mostly it's Nichols's versatility with the camera: among the many effective touches is his habit of suddenly breaking what appears to be naturalistic, unforced middle-distance framing to dart in for a telling ultra-close-up.The couples are closely but asymmetrically matched (Martha has brazen natural force, George has verbal dexterity; thus, Elizabeth Taylor gives the richer and stronger performance, Richard Burton gets the best lines).

However, not only was Liz great in this film, but the entire cast made this film what it was.  Too bad Richard Burton didn't win.  He was one of the greatest actors of his time and he was constantly denied the biggest prize in his profession.However, this film is not for the faint at heart.

But in a nutshell.George,a university professor, and his wife Martha have a tense relationship and constantly play emotional mind games with one another. One night they invite a young couple over for a while. Who witness the maniacal evenings of the older couple and are soon dragged into George and Martha's private life, inner demons, and troubled past.Almost chosen as victims or witnesses to their vicious attacks, perhaps due to the similarities between them.The story might seem rather simple from an initial view but it's one of the deepest you'll find in any movie. It also hits you with a couple of surprising twists as well.The exchanges between George and Martha are witty,deep,sharp and funny;as each one takes turns throwing barbs at the other. The entire film almost plays out like a close boxing match. With different rounds first Martha taking the upperhand and then George and back and forth through the entire film. Until George finally throws everything he's got the KO,the coup de gras ending their terrific match...possibly permanently.Elizabeth Taylor is the most electrifying thing in this film with a performance that most deeply displayed her range as one of the all time great actresses. And Richard Burton is just as great as he always is, delivering a superb performance. Its pointless to argue who's better than who; they're both simply terrific and each completes the other and makes them better.George Segal is surprisingly good,though his role is no where near as interesting as the previous, he most certainly makes the most of it and Sandy Dennis earned all of her own respective accolation.The film was directed by Mike Nichols who really established his reputation the coming year with The Graduate. However, his first mark of brilliance was here. You can see the intention in very shot, frame or movement and brings this great piece of writing alive on the screen adding his own contribution in the process. He does an outstanding job on this picture and was nominated for an Academy Award.

The film pushed the envelope with its profanity and sexual implication, thus helping to pave the way for the MPAA ratings system.The story concerns aging couple George & Martha (Richard Burton & Elizabeth Taylor) whose relentless bitterness makes for an eventful night in the company of young couple Nick & Honey (George Segal & Sandy Dennis).While the film's language is pretty tame by today's standards the dialogue still retains its bite. Ernest Lehman's interpretation of Edward Albee's play is rife with cutting remarks, all the more devastating for being fashioned with utmost erudition. The screenplay deservedly received one of the film's thirteen Oscar nominations.However, the script wouldn't have seemed so impressive if it hadn't been placed in such capable hands. It's quite likely that the performances of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor represent the best work of their careers. Taylor won an Oscar for her efforts while Burton had to content himself with a mere nomination. In the supporting roles, George Segal and Sandy Dennis were both Oscar nominated, with the latter taking home the award. With these plaudits, it's fully justifiable to state that every performance in the film is outstanding.Considering that this was Mike Nichols' debut behind the camera I'd say that he turned in an exceptional job, one that was rightly rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Of course, the Oscar-winning cinematography of Haskell Wexler also has a lot to do with the film's visual appeal. Meanwhile, Alex North's moody score, while sparingly used, represents another key contribution.In the end, the film's vitriol may become a bit tiring over the course of 131 minutes but, other than that, it's difficult to find much fault with the film. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is a one of a kind film whose edge has been dulled a little by time but not enough to seriously diminish its overall impact.",

            "content": "1966's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a searing film based off Edward Albee's controversial 1962 play of the same name. The movie, which was Mike Nichol's (The Graduate) directorial debut, broke many boundaries in the world of cinema. Never before have audiences seen a movie with provocative language and sexual tendencies displayed here. Despite extreme pressure, the film was released to rave reviews from critics and audience alike. The film only has four main characters and really only one location, but the searing, angry dialogue grabs you and keeps you hooked. Modern audiences may think of Aaron Sorkin when taking in every bit of the dialogue. This was also a box office success thanks to the powerful combination of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, perhaps the most publicized couple of the 1960's.Edward Albee's play had a successful Broadway run, but people believed it could not be adapted to the big screen because of the strict Production Code. If you studied film, you would know that the 1960's heralded a sweeping change in cinema. The Production Code was abolished, and the rating system was created in 1968. This film helped begin that rating system. Ernest Lehman, who also wrote The Sound of Music, decided to keep the dialogue intact the way it was in the play. The MPAA and the Catholic Division strongly advised against that, but they eventually gave in. Lehman's screenplay is still the angry indictment against marriage that Albee's play was. The screenplay is a roaring ball of flame that was enlarged by the excellent cast.It is really hard to give an exact description of the plot. It is after two in the morning. George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) are just coming home from a party. The married couple are bitter people, especially towards each other. Martha is bossy and overpowering while people could classify George as a wimp. Without George knowing, Martha invited a younger couple from the party over to the house. Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis). The older couple uses these two unsuspecting people and plenty of alcohol to emotionally abuse each other. It is about to be a wild night.On first glimpse, people think this film is a two-hour drama of an angry couple yelling at each other. In a sense, it is. It got overbearing in the beginning, but you are won over when you realize the direction the film is headed. Burton and Taylor are absolutely fantastic, and they sell you very well the emotional games they play. Elizabeth Taylor was considered the most beautiful woman in the world, so it was surprising she added thirty pounds in weight for the role. She nailed it and absolutely deserves her Best Actress win. George Segal and Sandy Dennis likewise knocked it out of the park. Especially Sandy Dennis. Her extremely drunk portrayal is very realistic.What a way to begin a film career, huh? Mike Nichols, who would later on direct classics like The Graduate and The Birdcage, immediately made a name for himself in Hollywood. Nothing like working with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton for you very first film. He directed the film like an expert. He also took advantage of the technical side of things. The cinematography is excellent. Haskell Wexler is a great cameraman and both he and Nichols worked very well to come up with some unforgettable camera shots. By this time, black-and-white cinematography was not popular anymore, so it was risky not using color. It definitely worked! Alex North composed a very nice score for the movie as well.Overall, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a fiery, searing work of art. The dialogue is angry and bitter. There are some words of hope and optimism but do not go expecting a whole lot of that. In terms of some marriage, this film could be seen as very real. This is a film that shocked audiences when released. No one thought this could ever be seen on the movie screen the way it was. Even to modern audiences, it still is shocking. After a slow start, I was mesmerized myself with this character-driven piece. This is Elizabeth Taylor's best role, and nothing else compares.My Grade: A-",

            "content": "This is by far the ultimate for Burton/Taylor fans.The film is an adaptation of Edward Albee's play about a university couple whose relationship is so complex, upon first look, it appears they cannot bear each other. But look closer - much closer. While they seem to have a horrible way of helping each other survive (and believe me, that is what, at least HALF of this is about) they indeed do each other a service by punishing each other for whatever it is each of them feel guilty about.But this is a psychological thriller at its best. The dialog is crisp, biting, caustic, strange, compelling, honest, brutal and thoroughly engrossing. It is disturbing and not for the faint-hearted but is a fascinating look in the dark recesses that make up some relationships. It also demands that you pay close attention to the dialog because this is where you truly find out exactly what this entails.The simple plot deals with two university couples, one young, one not-so-young, who \"entertain\" each other in the wee hours of the night after a university party. George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) invite a young couple over who just joined the university staff. While George and Martha are old hats at this \"banter\" they have developed, they draw the young couple into their psychological torture chamber resulting in a riveting but exhausting evening of fun and games. Even by today's standards, this is truly an intricate, disturbing, but thoroughly enjoyable look at what drives some relationships.Oscars went to the women but not the men! Hmmmmmmmmmmm. An even more interesting bit of trivia is that Bette Davis wanted to play this part badly but eventually lost out to Liz. One can only imagine what Martha would have been like in the hands of Bette Davis. And as much as I love Bette, she would have to have been off the chain to match Taylor's ferocity.Classic fate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

The mechanics of marriage (of 2 marriages, in fact) are dissected mercilessly, but not without a tang of bitter and dark humour. The transition from stage to screen seems well achieved, and not being an Elizabeth Taylor devout fan, I have to say she is superlatively good in this one. The score helps. The stunning black&white photography perfectly suits the intricate moods. Edward Albee must have been proud. I'm sure Mike Nichols was. Sandy Dennis and George Segall are more than up to the challenge, and I for one think all 4 players thoroughly deserved the Academy Award. Still, 2 out of 4 ain't bad - and all in all the film got 5 oscars, so... Go see it!",

I get that RB and ET were great actors and I guess their acting was ok but the material was so boring. They kept repeating lines and saying stuff that made absolutely no sense. They were adults yet they acted like little children the entire movie.I will say that whomever did ET's makeup was head and shoulders above today's artists because ET was a stunner in her heyday. Her intentional weight gain for the role coupled with her skilled makeup artist really did make her look as if she was really in her 50's without looking obviously fake like today's artists. They didn't use any prosthetics back then for this movie and yet it worked.This story was too boring to hold attention. I had to watch it in segments because I thought I was gonna lose my mind if I watched it straight through.There is no way anyone could drink as much as they did without having to be hospitalized from alcohol poisoning or straight up passing out. The fact that they continually drank all night (not beer - hard liquor) without passing out is just not believable.I know back in the day many people just stayed together rather than divorcing but who would want to stay in that awful toxic marriage? She slept with a man thirty years or so younger than her right in front of her husband and they still stayed together??!! Also who would stay at a house with those two once they figured out what was going on? George and Martha didn't have guns to their heads yet they kept staying there long after they should've left.Maybe this was revolutionary for the time but viewing it from today's lens I just don't see how it is a movie everyone should watch. It was an interminable, boring, slow, insufferable miserable watch with no redemption in the end. There was no takeaway, no lesson learned. All they did was destroy each other and the couple who unwittingly joined them for what they thought was a seemingly innocent evening together.",

To be sure the film is not easy viewing but it is fascinating to watch how loss, frustrated ambition, aging, insecurity, and alcoholism all contribute to the wear and tear of a marriage that has become more or less a perpetual sparring match with only the briefest of truces.

The intricacy of its writing and complex symbolism make it one of the most intriguing dramas ever written. To start, the roles in the movie could not have been cast better. Elizabeth Taylor delivers one of the strongest performances ever captured on screen; she definitely deserved the Oscar she won for it. Richard Burton's portrayal of George is excellent in every way. His performance is almost haunting. The two supporting characters are excellent as well. However, the most amazing thing about Virginia Woolf is the drama itself. Edward Albee explores some of the most fascinating topics with his symbolism in it by questioning the American dream. Through his words, Albee showcases the corruption of the American dream through his four characters, each representing a certain aspect of American society. Beyond the obvious story line, there is so much more to be seen. If it is viewed as a play existing only in the context of George and Martha's life, it is very poignant and wonderful. But if it is viewed as an allegory, a new, amazing dimension is added, bringing so much more meaning to the words being spoken. Albee also explores human emotions and the things that motivate us to take actions. The themes of illusion versus reality, loneliness, corruption, the sanctity of life, and the American dream are made all too real in this fascinating drama. The issue of abortion is even touched upon through Nick's wife. As a master of the absurd and real, Albee creates the best that American drama has to offer. Explore the terrifying world of George and Martha in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.\" It is a world not too unfamiliar to us, even if we do not realize it.",

In the ensuing years I have watched it, written papers about it, discussed it in classes . . . and it STILL confuses the crap out of me. Do George and Martha love or hate each other? Why don't Nick and Honey make a polite excuse and run like hell? What's up with the kid they keep talking about? No one in this movie acts like a rational human being, but that's the point . . . there's no such thing as a rational human being. People are cruel, petty, manipulative liars, and the only thing worse than having to live with another person is having to live alone. It's not an uplifting movie, but it is viciously honest and ultimately quite moving. John Waters has said that if you remain dry-eyed during the finale of this film, you have no heart. I agree with him.The plot of this film is so simple, it barely qualifies as such: a middle-aged academic couple invites a young academic couple over for drinks. They spend the night drinking and arguing. Bam. That's it. I couldn't understand what was at stake when I first saw this flick. Then again, the concept of sado-masochism had yet to penetrate my prepubescent world. Martha is a drunken, middle-aged shrew who enjoys tormenting George, her wimpy husband. Why does he put up with it? The funhouse-mirror image of George and Martha are Nick, a handsome, brilliant Biology professor, and Honey, his mousy, slightly dim wife. What is this stud doing with this frump? We learn the answers to these questions, and they're horrifying. Well, they're horrifying if you assume the characters are telling the truth. I've never been sure. Whatever, it's even more fun to watch than it is to discuss. This was director Mike Nichols' first film, and his theatrical roots are pretty obvious -- with a few notable exceptions, like that wrenching last shot, the entire story (such as it is) is told through dialog. But it's some of the best dialog ever written, so you can be glad Nichols didn't distract from it with a bunch of cinematic techniques like the ones he would use in \"The Graduate\" a year later. Since the focus is so mercilessly on the actors and their words, this is one of the few films in which hammy overacting is not only forgivable, it's absolutely necessary, and this cast is up to the challenge.Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton didn't always pick films that wisely (\"Boom,\" anyone?), but here they are to be applauded for using their clout to bring Edward Albee's Broadway sensation (alas no Pulitzer) to the big screen. And for once in the history of their long, often painful collaboration, they're both brilliant. George and Martha are ugly people, inside and out, and Hollywood's most glittering couple manages to capture all of that delicious hideousness. Gorgeous actresses often frump themselves up on screen so they can get Oscars (\"The Hours,\" anyone?), but Liz earned this statuette. Martha is, in the words of her loving husband, a \"Satanic bitch,\" but her hatefulness masks a lot of pain, and Liz lets us know that. Burton, Taylor's husband at the time (fourth of seven, I believe), was a macho blowhard whose histrionics ruined a lot of movies (\"The Night of the Iguana,\" anyone?), but here he makes the bold choice of playing George as an impotent but bitter whipping boy, a wimp with a will to power. Notice the smug satisfaction he takes in needling poor, stupid Honey, the only creature on Earth more defenseless than himself. Maybe Nichols explained the role to him, or maybe Burton was smart enough to figure out the gay subtext that so many critics have read into the play and movie, but for once Dick actually lives up to the \"great actor\" reputation that mystifies anyone who has ever seen \"Exorcist II: The Heretic.\" (Caveat: he was also good in \"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.\") George Segal, never known for his dramatic intensity, is fine as creepy Nick and Sandy Dennis is flat-out brilliant as pathetic little Honey. From her screechy, overeager first line (\"oh, he's a WONDERFUL man\") through her weird drunken dance right up to her meek assist in Martha's ghastly final comeuppance (\"like a good boy!\"), Dennis hits every wrong note and is just as deserving of Oscar gold as the film's formidable leading lady. Dennis had an erratic career, and it sounds like she didn't have the greatest life, but here she displayed some serious star potential. Or at least she did in 1960s Hollywood, which still had room for homely, quirky stars (Streisand, anyone?) and serious films without explosions and trite moral lessons. I'm trying to imagine Tom Cruise and Katie Homes doing this movie, and the idea is sickening. We live in an era of plastic, self-congratulatory celebrity \"actors\" who couldn't hold Liz Taylor's girdle. Sigh.",

Not only it is one of the best films that I have seen based on plays, but it is also one of the absolute best directorial debuts I have seen.

Sandy Dennis played Honey, and George Segal played Nick. All of the film's actors were nominated for Academy Awards. Elizabeth Taylor won the Oscar for Best Actress and Sandy Dennis won for Best Supporting Actress. The film also won for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Costume Design. It was nominated for Best Actor, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Picture, Best Sound, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Mike Nichols didn't win the Oscar but he did with his next movie, The Graduate.The movie had a resounding success and I think this is all the play's merit.Lehman relocated some scenes, he also added some lines,and cut some of the dialog. This is the major mistake of the movie and it upset Albee. The play was an enormous commercial success. Many audience members and critics named it as revolutionary and as marking a new era in American drama. But many found its language, strong sexual content, interest in \"taboo\" subjects and criticism of the American dream as shocking and was the \"reason\" why the did not receive the Pulitzer award although it was voted for it.I'm not gonna say a single word about the movie action and i advise you to read the book or to see the play because you miss very much of it's symbols and meanings, especially the political ones (\"I will not give up Berlin!\")",

The best I can do for a synopsis is it's about a couple who invites another couple over for an evening's entertainment but instead of playing pictionary, they subject the couple and each other to a series of twisted psychological games. Why the younger couple voluntarily staying through these twisted psychological games for the duration of the evening was clearly the screenwriter/playwright's biggest challenge and he partially succeeds in setting things up so that the couple is partially captive to the situation. I'm willing to excuse the screenwriter for this because it's such a fascinating piece.The dialogue is stylized to the point that it has virtually no frame of reference in reality. I say virtually because if you came from a household that dysfunctional, you probably would have committed suicide by now, but if you haven't and you saw this film you would relate but for the rest of us, it's more of an abstraction. Aside from the quality of the dialogue the reason to watch this film, is the way these four actors take such nonsensical words and actions and make it come to life. Sandy Dennis and Elizabeth Taylor won Oscars for their roles and George Segal (Just Shoot Me) and Richard Burton were nominated and every one of them deserved the praise.

Forty-some odd years later, the depth of the characters absolutely drew me in. This is an intense look at perhaps 12 hours in the life of a marvelously dysfunctional relationship, which the viewer is drawn into in horrifying detail, and finally, a glimpse of the real reasons for the dysfunction. The revelation is Elizabeth Taylor's performance. I had always thought of her as a bit of Hollywood fluff with no real talent, but she really proved me wrong here. Her performance is one of the best I've ever seen, and the other three main characters are equally compelling. Everything about this film is superb, the acting, the pacing, the stunning black and white cinematography and the use of camera angles. This should be required viewing for all film students.",

            "content": "\"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?\" is a drama directed by Mike Nichols starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. This movie isn't only already the sixth chapter of my \"To Read & Review\" series, but it also happens to be my one-hundredth review this year, and it was indeed a fittingly marvellous way to celebrate this occasion properly. All I can say about Edward Albee's play of the same name is, that it is probably one of the most powerful and well built up productions that have ever hit the theatres. What starts out as a harmless conversation after a terrific party ends up as a total disaster and utter chaos, and it is the way Albee gradually makes his four characters go round the bend what makes it so outstandingly entertaining. While reading it, I had a lot of fun, for it was extraordinarily well conceptualised, the characters were lifelike, and I also realized what dramatic power it had in its dialogue, hence I knew that it is legendary for a reason. As previously mentioned, it wasn't some piece of literature you just read, it is a stage play in the first place that develops its full potential when it is performed by actors on stage and directed by a director who is capable of realizing the dramatic vehemence that underlies every single line of it. I have had no qualms that this adaptation here was going to perfectly capture everything what makes it so intriguing in the first place. Aside from the fact that this film here is the directorial debut of visionary filmmaker Mike Nichols, who one year later would go on to direct Dustin Hoffman in the essential New Hollywood masterpiece \"The Graduate\", the film also features two of the greatest superstars of the old school as the leading couple: Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, who were in fact married to each other at that time, don't simply play George and Martha, no, they literally make them come to life. Despite them being a littler younger than their literary counterparts, they embody everything that defines them perfectly, and it is obvious that both being husband and wife in reality contributes a large portion to the breath-taking authenticity and genuine way they deal with each other, especially since their marriage wasn't always rosy and a permanent topic of the tabloid press. The performances of Segal and Dennis, who play Nick and Honey respectively, are also anything but terrible and basically delivering superb performances, but in direct comparison to the powerhouse performances of Burton and Taylor, they are sadly overshadowed by them. Yes, the masterclass acting defines this heavy drama, but also the themes it deals with make it so hypnotizing as well. This film is a prime example of a relentless psychogram and slowly unravels the emotional life of its characters and especially the spiritual abysses of everyone involved. Aside from its powerful leads who make this insane transition look like the most natural thing in the world, the screenplay by Ernest Lehman derives a benefit from no longer being bound to a small stage and brings in a lot of dynamic by relocating some of the scenes to exterior settings. What you get with this film is everything marriage defines; love, hate and sadness in its rawest forms, and the more booze the protagonists consume, the more radical the actions become. Against their own will, bystanders Honey and Nick, who resemble the new love and the future generations, are dragged into the marital dispute of their veteran colleagues and have to witness how the both fight, mock and caterwaul at each other. The whole film is dominated by this dazzling feeling of emotional intensity and spares no-one - not even the viewer. By the prominent use of closeups and a cinematography that is mainly focussed on the characters, a certain kind of inevitable intimacy is created. As part of the audience, I admittedly had no chance to shirk from this undertow of a dramatic force. Next to the minimalistic yet unsettling score, I also love how the film even features some subliminally dark scenes that make it appear like some psychological horror film - even though it never becomes actually graphic. It is a masterstroke how it manages to channel such vibes without losing its seriousness as a drama (the shotgun umbrella, for instance). It is also noticeable why this motion picture even counts as a forerunner of the legendary New Hollywood era. Even if the Hays Code was still effective at the time, the film didn't hesitate to depict the most delicate elements of its devious source material. Aside from the extreme consumption of alcohol, sexual innuendos, dark jokes and coarse language in general, the film also doesn't hesitate to imply neither the swinging element mentioned on several occasions, nor delusional metaphor of the imaginary son that embodies everything that goes wrong between George and Martha. While the original play ends with a more ambiguous scene where the future of the fighting married couple eventually remains unknown, the Hollywood adaptation made it more of a happy ending and let in end in a more positive, romantic manner. All in all, this dark drama is a prime example of combining magnificent and eclectic writing with masterclass acting. While it has some undertones of dark humour and even experiments by balancing on the border of psychological horror, the film never loses its strict, serious tone and remains intriguing to the end. Burton is terrific in here, but Taylor redefines the term \"force of nature\" with her breathtaking performance and was utterly hypnotizing with it. It broke several taboos, is masterfully crafted and remains extremely true to the source material, despite making some slight changes in terms of location. All of the changes are for the better, though. This film is a drama par excellence and realised the full potential of its outstanding source material. If you are looking for the epitome of endless talent and aspire to become a stage actor yourself, you have come to the right place. Boy, I have the feeling that it will even receive a perfect score upon a rewatch. Definitely a piece of art and a fine way to celebrate the 100th review on my blog.",

            "review_title": "The Sick Pleasure of Marriage",
            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is one of many films that takes great pleasure in deconstructing the idea of a happy marriage; it's less a romantic comedy and more of a black pit of emotional abuse and manipulation, willingly doled out by a husband and wife who are more than happy to be miserable together.Like the notorious The Mountain Goats' song 'No Children', George and Martha waltz hand-in-unlovable-hand through the film's claustrophobic household set, terrorizing their young guests and joining a tradition of romantic dysfunction established in part by films such as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), Goodbye Again (1961), and 1967's The Graduate.This film isn't about extolling the virtues of married life; supportive gestures, shared jokes, fond memories, but the vices; there is not a weakness or hang-up that George and Martha are not willing to find and press down on, hard, just to see the other squirm or explode in front of the disturbed onlookers, Nick and Honey.Lehman's writing shines in the hyper-realistic (as dated as some of the insults and speech patterns might sound to modern viewers) dialogue tossed like poison darts between the constantly sparring and goading husband and wife. It functions to make the viewer feel as though they are literally trapped in between the venomous pair, and it also builds up the world of the film to an immersive degree, making one feel as though this is an actual marriage with actual history, not a game of pretend between two strangers.The obvious chemistry and personal feelings between Taylor and Burton at the time go a long way to helping the film flow so well; with more inexperienced or less talented actors, the film might have come across as too over-the-top and hysterical, as opposed to insidiously compelling. We really believe Martha takes genuine sadistic glee in telling the tale of how she once humiliated George with a pair of boxing gloves in front of her domineering father, and we really believe George's barely restrained fury when he stands, brooding, in the closet, reaching for his trick gun and illuminated by the unhinged swings of the light overhead.The cinematography, too, puts us in the mindset of the trapped and unnerved Nick and Honey, with close-ups on their increasingly uncomfortable expressions, and limiting angles that display this household's dysfunction through their eyes as they step deeper and deeper into the labyrinth of the relationship unfurled before them. The camera hovers behind shoulders, catches the back of heads, and cuts from Martha's forced smiles to George's deceptive little smirks and scowls.The lack of a real soundtrack during most of the film only lends to the uneasy air; at some point, the bickering between Martha and George ceases to become amusing in even a black comedy sense, and just functions as a means of tormenting the audience, who are now as locked into this nightcap as Nick and Honey are. With only the diegetic sounds of the household, and the scratchy raised voices, slamming of doors, and shrieks of laughter from Martha, the emotional intensity of the acting is heightened and drawn out to excruciating levels of realism.Martha and George don't react for maximum comedic effect or to wink at the audience with an 'aren't we so funny and toxic' the way many modern films do; they react as the people they are, and the people they are have few redeeming qualities between them. The climax of the film, with the reveal that the son they have been referencing is fictitious and a shared expression of grief and rage over their inability to have children of their own, hits certain darkly familiar emotional beats that it's rare to see on-screen nowadays without being neatly tied up afterwards.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a much-lauded classic for this reason; we're taken through a full range of human emotion and the breakdown of Martha and George's sick games is not a matter of their companions turning the tables on them or a sudden attack of conscience, but a shaky halt that leaves us feeling, above all, pity, along with a better sense of what makes their unhinged marriage tick. Many other films since then have reached for this same catharsis, but few have managed to actually reach it in such a human manner, both contemptible and sympathetic at the same time.",

Score 10 out of 10 for Liz's performance and 9/10 for all three other actors. I want to say something like \"a truly wonderful film\" but really, it sure aint for everybody.

Freud, a discredited complication artist, seems to loom large in this film, which seems to imply that there are dark recesses to the human mind that need to be cleansed and ventilated. Not so.

(1966) As usual, she co-stars with Burton, but this time Liz has lost her glamour, by purposely gaining weight and dying her hair gray to appear ten years older. It works, as does the biting story.Basically the action occurs over the course of an evening. Martha (Liz) and her professorial husband George (Richard Burton) have invited a younger teacher George Segal) and his wife (Sandy Dennis) to their home for cocktails,. That's when the fun, or rather the fights, begin. Burton and Taylor badger and bait one another with a ferocity that has rarely been shown between a filmdom couple. Purportedly, the films onscreen battles helped facilitate the deterioration of their own off-screen romance.The Taylor in this movie is transformed. Never before or since have we seen Taylor the actress push herself so hard. She snarls, she hisses, she teases. She scares the hell out of you. She showed the world that behind that gorgeous face and body, that she could, if she chose to,hold her own with the best of em.

I've seen this premise before (can't remember where) and it was always fascinating; now I see where everyone else has gotten it from.  I've seen a few Liz Taylor movies by now, and I could say without a doubt that this is her best performance ever.  She really transformed into that character.  WAOVW is a rare case in which the whole cast puts on powerhouse performances.  I would've liked to see Richard Burton get an Oscar for his efforts here as well, he definitely deserved it and was neck and neck with Liz Taylor for the whole movie.  I like what the makers were trying to accomplish with the story and all....but the whole thing just got annoying after a while; with all the yelling and fussing about nothings....it got tired pretty quickly and it just dragged on and on and on.  I couldn't help but wonder why the hell Nick and Honey didn't just leave after being constantly berated and forced to witness the constant arguing and insanity.  Also, I'm sure George & Martha weren't the only ones living on that block, I'm suprised no one called the cops for all the yelling and chaos going on there in the dead of night.  I somehow remember the play for this...and it seemed very weird that the characters left the house.  If my memory serves me correctly this isn't how the original story goes down.  The whole scene outside in the bar/on the street was very out of place and threw in a wrench in the pacing of the film.  After a while no one knew if anything being said was even true, and by that point I feel its best that everyone just shut up and go their separate ways.  I felt a great relief when the sun finally came up; as I knew the movie, and the torture of witnessing these terribly dysfunctional people go deeper and deeper into insanity, was finally going to end.  I like the concept of WAOVW and saw what they were trying to accomplish (ultimately they did accomplish it) but it was just too annoying and repetitive for me to hail it as great.*** out of **** stars.

Though some of the epithets are obviously softening much stronger words, the language is frank and brutal, Martha's bludgeoning body-blows balanced by George's icepick thrusts. Edward Lehman's respectful screenplay gently opens up Edward Albee's one-set play while keeping a certain claustrophobic atmosphere. Mike Nichols' first directing effort is stunning in its lack of artifice; rarely do you feel that the director has done much more than turn on the camera and watch four actors, all at the top of their game, tear into their roles. George Segal's work in this movie is criminally underrated, but his reactive work as studly, ultimately disappointing Nick should be mandatory study by all young actors. Sandy Dennis' fluttery turn as mousy, wifey Honey is powerful also; a lot more is going on than you might think. Richard Burton is staggering as George (\"Georgie Porgie Put-upon Pie\"), and his performance demonstrates the magic that he could bring to a worthy role. Elizabeth Taylor's work here still astounds. The physical transformation she undertook to become aging harpy Martha is amazing enough, but her performance seems to channel a hurricane's force and fury. By turns hilarious, maddening and then, at the end, exhausted and defeated yet again, Taylor demonstrates acting, particularly film acting, at its best. The film is by no means easy or \"Hollywood\" in feel-- the audience is as exhausted as the characters at the end. But this was a bracing, necessary antidote to the impossible ideal of marriage usually portrayed in the movies. A towering film",

            "content": "A double bill with this film and William Friedkin's THE BOYS IN THE BAND, made four years later, reveals the influence that Albee's play had on BOYS playwright Mart Crowley. Both are brilliant, hard-edged dramas involving secrets, psychological games, too much alcohol, and the mysterious and often explosive nature of human relationships.However, unlike BOYS, which was an ensemble piece with nine characters, VIRGINIA WOOLF provides a showcase for two great stars at the peak of their careers: Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, then married in real life. The primary focus is on George and Martha, an embattled middle-aged couple who drink too much and for whom bickering seems to have become a hobby; they are constantly at each other's throats, but every now and then we see that this is exactly how they want their marriage to play out.Elizabeth Taylor had already done a substantial amount of high quality work in Hollywood: she already had one Oscar, and had gained a reputation as a foremost interpreter of Tennessee Williams. Her stunning beauty never got in the way of her determination to do quality work.Here Taylor, who would pick up her second Oscar for Martha, is all but unrecognizable: a blowzy, middle-aged, slightly overweight woman who dresses a bit slutty and makes drunken advances to their male guest Nick (George Segal, solid and dependable as always), who along with his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis at her mousiest; Dennis would win an Oscar for this film as well) have come over for drinks after some faculty party at the university where George and Nick are professors and Martha's father (talked about but never seen) is the president.This is a strange and unsettling film. In BOYS IN THE BAND four years later, the characters' motives, while not always honorable, are usually clear enough to make educated guesses. VIRGINIA WOOLF, on the other hand, raises more questions with each revelation, and at the end, while everything is known, we are not given all the reasons, and a good deal is left to our imaginations.This is as it should be, I think. To reveal too much would spoil the effect that Albee was going for.Taylor is sensational in the greatest role she would ever play, and teaming her with Burton was a master stroke of casting. Burton should have won the Oscar for his work here as well; with all due respect to Paul Scofield, his role in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS was rather bland by comparison.George Segal, also Oscar nominated, is perfect as Nick; the role is not an especially demanding one but his portrait of a slightly sleazy and opportunistic \"nice guy\" on the make who is not above sleeping with the daughter of the college president to advance his career is disturbingly real. And Sandy Dennis as Honey is amazing: she puts on an outward fa\u00e7ade of ditsy blonde, but as the drinks get consumed and the layers get peeled we discover that there is both more and less to her than we think the first time we see her.This is not always a peasant experience, but in between the ugly moments there's a lot of comedy, and like BOYS four years later, the whole thing, even at its ugliest, is akin to passing an accident on the highway: you may wish you could look away, but you can't. Not even for a million dollars.Stunning directorial debut for Mike Nichols, who would go on to give us such iconic films as THE GRADUATE, CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, SILKWOOD, and THE BIRDCAGE.All in all, a film that every serious film buff must see at least once. And it rewards multiple viewings.",

(1966). In his first film, director Mike Nichols immediately announced himself as a major force to be reckoned with and as one of the most promising directors of the decade (and he would continue to make good on that promise throughout the decades). The film should be remembered not only as the taboo-shattering masterwork that it is, but also as one of the most taunt, biting, and intense dramas ever produced. Even forty years after its premiere, this film is certainly not light entertainment.Although her weight gain and garish make-up is not enough to disguise her natural beauty, Taylor is frighteningly effective in a career-best performance. Burton is even better in a disturbing portrayal of the emasculated male bent on revenge. The fit and gorgeous George Segal and loopy Sandy Dennis are perfectly cast as the mismatched couple who subject themselves to the reign of psychological terror unleashed by George and Martha. Both Taylor and Dennis deservedly won Oscars, and Burton and Segal were absolutely robbed of the awards for their sensational work. The film pushed the limits of the production code at the time, and (along with 1966's BLOW-UP) paved the way for the \"new\" rating system of \"G,\" \"PG,\" \"R,\" and \"X.\" The film deservedly won raves from critics, and was nominated for 13 Oscars (winning 5). The film was smash hit at the box office, coming in as the third-highest grosser of the year. This film has lost none of its gut-wrenching power over the years.",

The revelation is a particulary stunning. When watching this movie, you get to see why it became the first with all the cast members nominated.  You see why all should have won ( Taylor and Dennis did).  You witness what is easily one of the best debut films of all time. Do not watch it by yourself.

This film is brilliant - from the acting, to the direction, to the cinemetography, to even the hair & make-up, this film sings a morbid song of moral turpitude & psychological torture that can never be re-created or duplicated (at least not with this script). The performances are stunning - Taylor is ugly both inward & outward, Burton is intellectual & therefore more dangerous, Segal is youthful and strong but more easily used because of it, and Dennis is sweet and naive with a great pain inside her that represents the lost dreams and hopes of all of them. The direction is wonderful, even if the re-setting of half of the film is not true to the original play.  In a way, it does add to the manicness of the story when the battle leaves the parlour to go to the lawn or the roadhouse and then returns painfully to the house, but we almost suffer too much when we re-enter that confining space & that is true to the text so I can't kvetch about that. The choice of shooting the backs of heads during some scenes is wonderful & real, giving it a cinema verite quality that I was surprised to see.  And the editing is so good that I would almost believe that there were four or five cameras rolling simultaneously, the actors did the whole thing through top to bottom, and the editor had to just switch back & forth as the film went on.  This speaks to the actors' talents, but the editor can make it jerky & disjointed so that you notice his work - it takes a master to hide his talent. The entire production team was making the same movie every step of the way. You owe it to yourself to see this, if only to learn how a drama can be done to great success.  A good story (albeit sad) well told (even though it may leave you feeling tired).",

What is at stake here is too some headed confrontation of testing capacities and skilled capabilities in quite frustration before the young generation of teachers, whose behavior facing abuse of drinking is free of taxation... It seems too that the couple of actors whose interpretation is done here was also responsible for a kind of fake mirror between private lives and the standard of an infamous couple of teachers, who also were the main characters in this fiction adapted from a well known play. In which the British literature legendary woman, by no means is subject of some misinterpretation if out of her own time living likewise mainly just before the First War of twentieth Century, when the suffragists were fighting for more rights for the women as woman beings with similar wins for society and civilization. The sex appeal of this woman is a leitmotiv of the good for selling in the way of patronized standards of feelings from uncomforted to irritability as alternative to the male concurrent in affects from the others. In a so close society of such a kind of speak easy, from uncommitted way of talking about flesh attraction, as degenerated furniture of eroticism knowledge at domicile. Like this circuit of teachers in a dramatic way, where she plays the wife of somebody whose main interest is charming the female that he has before him as aim of refraction of his self love affair and not his wife which he prefers not more less than such of the other married couple, for both it seems with their more young fellow colleagues at the drawing room illuminated by a night encounter at home. They are all intellectuals discussing if such a woman is true in her performance with a perfume of private scandal doing her better for diminishing her husband qualities for showing the inverse that he really taught as dramatist lecturer to the new generation whose capacity for understanding that way of regulating a marriage row is quite impotent, because this converge for rivalries between woman's rights to smoke or not for instance or to wear or not paints or trousers like the men.

            "content": "I see the IMDb viewer rating for VIRGINIA WOOLF is over 8. I think this a tad high. All of these marathon-talk fest theatrical tour-de-forces have a built-in implausibility factor working against them. The more the characters drink throughout the night, the wittier and more ingeniously cutthroat their remarks and power-play games become (real life doesn't work like this). Plus, in this instance, in order to make the play \"cinematic,\" Mike Nichols' direction (typical for him)is too \"cute\" by half and the performances, with one sterling exception, are overrated. Taylor's stab at Martha is bravely, ballsy enough, but she's too limited, vocally, to give the part variety. Dennis is ridiculously mannered as the mousy wife and George Segal, as Nick, is, well, George Segal. But the one aspect that sets this film apart from all of Nichols' other pictures and gives it a kernel of authenticity is Richard Burton's scintillating dramatic turn as the \"ineffectual\" (ineffectual, my foot!) professor of the English department and husband of Martha, George. This is one of those hallowed instances in the cinema where the role fits the soul of the actor to such a T that you feel you're being granted access into the inner sanctum of what prompts his very being into action. EVEN BEFORE HE OPENS HIS MOUTH. For my money, the last three great acting jobs of the classic Hollywood period were: Bill Holden in THE WILD BUNCH (1969), Brando in REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE ('67) and Burton in this (1966). Pike Bishop granted Holden an authority he had never showed before; Major Pemberton afforded Brando's imagination to soar in a tightly enclosed, dream cast atmosphere, and George allowed Burton to dive beneath the surface mystique of his own voice to reveal its dramatic impetus. \"The only thing in life is language,\" the actor once confessed to an interviewer. \"Not love. Language. Not anything else.\"The quote could have come out of the mouth of Albee's bitter, self-loathing protagonist but was said by the \"singer\" himself in a marvelous, off-guarded moment. It is part and parcel of this peerless personification of words on paper into something approximating flesh and blood life.Rating guide: 6 for the picture10 for Burton Composite for Film: 7.5P.S. TCM showed the movie twice already in the past two weeks. Is VIRGINIA WOOLF in line to replace IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE as the nation's Yuletide, holiday season event?",

For the most part, it's the performances of the two females (Liz Taylor and Sandy Dennis) that really shine in this film.  They give phenomenal performances.  Those are two of the greatest female performances ever.  It's shocking to see Liz Taylor (who herself is a visual wonder) in this film as an out-of-control alcoholic wreck.  Sandy Dennis steals the show as George Segal's seemingly sweet wife who has one drink too many. As far as the movie itself goes...it's a really good movie--clever script, good story.  However, when the characters are not arguing which each other out of a drunken rage, the movie just drags on.  I was really bored by the scene where Burton and Segal go outside to talk.  I was annoyed by the black-and-white used for this film, although the cinematography is very good (creative use of camera angles, especially the closeups).  Nevertheless, the movie has many funny and unpredictable scenes.  I really liked Taylor's spoof of Bette Davis at the beginning of the movie.  This film is and will remain an unforgettable classic.",

Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in their only really great film they made together star as George and Martha, an embattled couple swapping endless cut-lows, throwing curse words back and forth and finally making a last grasp at what's left of their marriage. Burton is easily at his finest hour in this film as George, the dry-witted yet world-weary college professor and Taylor turns in an unusually powerful performance as the shrewish Martha. The supporting cast consists of basically two other players; George Segal and Sandy Dennis are the young couple Nick and Honey. Dennis plays Honey brilliantly and Segal is really likable as always as Nick. This is also the first film to contain profanity and it predates the rating system which places the film in a unique position in film history. Mike Nichols' directorial debut is phenomenal. You'd think that even though he's got noteworthy theater experience his first film would get no more than mediocre reviews. As with Sam Mendes in American BEAUTY, Nichols turned his first film into a brilliant piece. It's subject matter isn't always light but it still turns out to be an unabashed work of art.",

Yet, since one couple is comfortable (the elder couple), the younger couple seems to fall in place of the game. It is this game that the average viewer would not see. It is this game that keeps the elder couple together, keeps them thriving. And to any one who does not see this game, the elder couple will appear quite insane. It started as this... Martha tells their new friends embarrassing things, stories about George. This is the first hit in the game. It is after this that George gets his umbrella gun. This is the second hit. The third hit comes when Martha dances vulgarly with the other man. The fourth comes quickly after that when George makes light of the couples miscarriage. The last two hits I find are the best... The fifth hit comes when Martha sleeps with the other man, or at least attempts to (he seemed to be a houseboy). The sixth and last hit is when George wins the game by killing off their non-existent son. He wins himself a friend, the man who attempted to be with his wife but claimed, \"I think I understand this.\" in the end. (For he understood a game was being played.) And Martha loses the game, losing their false son and perhaps the chance to move on to a new couple to play games with. Her new friend in this is the young woman. The young woman that had the miscarriage. This woman does not understand the game or much of anything else. This is how George has 4 up on Martha.",

Like \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?\" and \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", we are not watching a movie; we are watching a play that has been filmed, nothing more. I would rather go and see a play on stage with live performances than watch something of this sort on a screen.

Dennis' facial expressions alone are worthy of her Oscar success for this film. The black and white photography is striking, and in addition to the fantastic acting, the dialogue is, of course, potent. The change of locale for a couple scenes (the front yard, diner, parking lot) doesn't take away anything from the claustrophobic feel of the film. Nichols' direction is right on the mark. The use of close-ups and angled camera shots contributes to this greatly, and Alex North's music also adds to the dreamy, night time atmosphere.Definitely one of the high points of 1960s cinema, and one of the best adaptations of a stage play to a film.

The play was pre-Civil Rights, but more broadly, any ideal may be unattainable (even Elizabeth Taylor gets old). The title is a punch line to a joke we never hear. Maybe analogous to life and its meaning. Ultimately, the joke's on us no matter who we are. Maybe the object of the game is to know that but laugh anyway (the interplay between Taylor and Burton is hilarious). And, like George and Martha, it's probably good to find someone else to laugh with. Almost like a spy story; you never know when the characters are pretending.",

The entire cast was nominated for Oscars, both actresses winning. Elizabeth Taylor is unbelievable as the drunken wife who constantly emasculates her husband. Richard Burton doesn't fit the physical description of a \"flop,\" but he's probably my favorite character.The strong writing is notable as well. There are so many quotes in this film that are witty and at times downright hilarious . Richard Burton has the best lines and they're delivered perfectly ('Why, Martha, your Sunday chapel dress! Oh, that's most attractive!'). As the film goes on, the comedy becomes less sarcastic and more personal.I found myself completely exhausted after these long two hours of drunken bickering. I really like the first half of the film, but the second half goes way too far. I do wish there was a different ending, but I can't really complain about how brilliantly everything is executed.For 1966, this had to have been one of the most profane and vulgar movies of its time. I wouldn't consider this a favorite, but this is most definitely my type of movie. It's full of lying, backstabbing, betrayal, and bitterness.

The only reason I have a copy of the film Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is because I lost my copy of the recorded play starring Ute Hagan. My main beef about the film is that martha is a 52 year old woman and George is 46. That very fact says volumes as to why these two people would treat each other this way and say the things that they say to one another. Elizabeth Taylor is just too young to play Martha and I've always found her performance over-reaching. Burton is of course always brilliant and could play George at any age and still make him believable. There is a scene where Burton does not have any dialog and all you see his the back of his sweater, but there is so much emotion in that scene that you know you are in the presence of great acting. Back to the age situation. George and Martha have been playing at this for years and with the diluting of the ages for the screen only makes the characters yelling at each other uncomfortable, and you wonder why would they stay with each other when both are young enough to find other mates. Anyway, Albee's dialog is worth the price of owing the movie. Now, if only some smart director would film the Kathleen Turner's stage version then we might have a Martha we could really cheer for. P.S. Elizabeth Taylor is one of my very favorite actress so I could never put her down completely. I just don't see her as Martha. Sad, sad, sad.",

Once you think this can't become any more uncomfortable Martha announces that she has invited another couple to join them. The young couple arrives just as Martha is screaming at George and sets the tone for the rest of the evening. What was most interesting to me was how George and Martha's brutal honesty allowed the other two characters to be honest as well, with themselves and others. The secrets about one another seemed to pour out of each character's mouth almost instantaneously. The use of black and white for the film when it could have very easily been made in color, was very interesting and drew me in a bit more, it gave an intimate feel to the film, as if you were in George and Martha's living as well.

I know that this was a small budget shooting, but I can't believe that this movie could became famous and also won 5 Oscars. Richard Burton should have won one, he deserved it.

The second is the dialogue. Most of us have had the misfortune of knowing a couple like this (a few have maybe even been IN a couple like this), but the dialogue in this movie makes these characters come alive.

George Segal and Sandy Dennis play their parts to a tee as well.  Personally, I rate this movie towards the top of my list.

            "review_title": "Best film in the world!",
            "content": "This is arguably the best Taylor-Burton collaboration from the history of their extensive joint movie careers. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is a profound and rip-roaringly precise examination of the human psyche. Although Taylor won the Oscar (deservedly), Burton is once again under-appreciated by the industry and some critics alike. In scenes such as George's soliloquy in the garden, Burton manages to portray an intelligent, deeply intellectual man who is oppressed and misunderstood completely, or perhaps understood too well by his overbearing wife. Burton actually uses his facial expressions and physical gestures rather than his trademark booming voice for effect in this film. This works splendidly, particularly when he is framed in between Sandy Dennis and George Segal. The idea was to focus attention on Burton's eyes without using a close up and it does work perfectly. A rather sad and nostalgic effect is achieved through the two younger characters facing him who have their entire lives before them, whilst George has struggled through his own mere existence. The resentment felt by George is so clear in Burton's eyes as they sparkle with tears and become dull with a feeling of complete uselessness for the character. As in other films, Burton does use his voice, only a little less frequently. His ability to change tone, volume and characteristic, vocally, are second to none. This is particularly evident in the scene where George destroys Martha's facade about their son. By using the malevolence of tone, fluctuating volume and harsh realism that Burton familiarised himself with through much of his early cinema, George ultimately deconstructs Martha's lies in the most devastating way he can. Burton conveys the absolute core of George, a broken man who has little use for his life, as though it really were himself. Taylor's performance is also outstanding. Whenever she gives a good performance, (which is more often than she is credited for) people are usually shocked. Perhaps this is because of her colourful personal life and the public need to chisel through it before her performance can actually be criticised. There is not a scene in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" where she is not memorable. From her exclamation of \"What a dump!\" - alluding to the Bette Davis' film \"Beyond the Forest\" - to her excruciatingly brilliant deliverance of the final speech about her son, Taylor is truly on top form. In the former scene she carries out the infamous chicken eating sequence and speaks to George in a fashion that resembles some form of perceived 'normality', yet for it's time it is the most unnatural behaviour of a stereotypical 1960's American couple.While Edward Albee is to be thanked for this, Burton & Taylor only compliment his work. The dialogue in the chicken-eating sequence is portrayed as though this tension and hatred of each other is the norm for the couple. Martha: \"We've got guests.\" George: \"Got what?\" Martha: \"Guests. Guests!\" George: \"Guests?\" Martha: \"Yeah, guests. People! We've got guests coming over.\" Martha's soliloquy about their son is one of the best delivered speeches in the film. The trembling voice, the tattered appearance - so unusual in a Taylor film - and the exhausted expression combined, make it a superb deliverance. Burton's satirical interruptions with passages from the Last Rites in Latin are also brilliant and add to the drama. Sandy Dennis and George Segal are excellently cast also, especially Dennis. Segal notably won that year for Best Actor, beating Burton oddly enough. Dennis sparkles with youth and naivete particularly in the last scene. Her innocence is perfect as she attempts to stop George from destroying Martha when he tells her about the death of their son. Dennis also won in 1966 for Best Supporting Actress for the film, deserving nothing less. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is possibly one of the most trying films to watch at times as it is terribly depressing and heavy, yet vividly relatable and tangible. Many have said that Burton finally found the serious role that he searched for all his life in his final film \"1984\", but this film is my personal favourite of his. It is another factor which makes the film depressing, that Richard Jenkins was once again robbed of the recognition he so richly deserved from one of the few great roles of his career.",

The tight-knit feel to it makes you realize focus in on the characters and doesn't leave you forgetting what's happening with who. Martha is arguably one of the best developed characters. Arguably, all 4-5 of them are. The cinematography of this film pushed the film even further. The score as well. Everything about this film makes you fall in love with characters that you never want to know in real life. One can ask themselves if they'll be able to withstand sitting through a movie of minimal characters talking constantly for two hours... to which I would recommend pouring yourself a drink and reaching for the remote.",

This dynamic is being established up until their guest.\\ Nick and Honey. As they're with their guest their banter and clashing personalities grows and grows. George eventually pulls out a fake gun and scares everyone. This happens while they're drinking continuously. Eventually the four goes dancing and Martha and Nick get really close while dancing. After George chokes her a little then tells a story about why nick and Honey got together which kills the disperses the group. Eventually the group find themselves back at Marthas house. George informs Martha that their son had died. She breaks down and after some explanations from George, Nick finds out that the couple is infertile.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is truly a roller coaster with questions. For the entire film I wondered why George and Martha were going at each other. At times in the movie it seems that either one of them may go over the edge which helps add suspense in the film. The character of Honey's entire demeanor is a big question mark throughout the film which added to the eeriness of the film especially as she got more intoxicated. This movie portrayed the a night that was eventually going to be a boiling point so for the entire movie it left you on the edge of your seat. Just for you to realize it was just a game to let the guest know they were infertile.",

Several aspects of the production (IMHO) single out this film as being above many others. The cast is exceptional, where each actor embodies the core of the roles they assay. All four standout, but Elizabeth Taylor's performance is her best and arguably the best delivered by an actress in a lead role. She strips away those mannerisms that were prominent in her earlier performances. Her performance here is illuminating and a marvel considering the complexity of the role. The arch of her character as captured in this very complex story is riveting as played by Elizabeth Taylor. Sandy Dennis is truly astounding, delivering a performance so real, its as if she appears to have been pulled from the street and asked to react to the proceedings. Truly one if the best examples of Method Acting recorded on film. I have watched this film and just watched Dennis, she's mesmerizing and so believable, she grounds the film. Both Richard Burton and George Segal add the male perspective to the proceedings. Their exchange (without the wives) is so laden with revelation and calculated cruelty it reveals the pathos that underlines the entire story. There's a lot to be covered in this play and at times there's an unreal quality to the true nature of the characters backstories. What I find makes the play work, is having actors realistically portray characters caught in a stylized unrealistic chain of events that brings them together and ultimately tears them asunder.",

Unless Ernest Lehman or Edward Albee wrote the dialogue, I doubt that anything Burton and Taylor said behind closed doors quite matches that of the movie. Deliciously filmed in black and white, this movie is pure adult entertainment with two of the greatest English-speaking actors of the 20th Century working at the peak of their powers. Liz won the Oscar, deservedly so, but with a lesser actor than Burton to bounce lines off, she would suffocate the film. As it is, she barely holds her own, taking a knife to a verbal gunfight. For reasons I can't explain, I find the movie entertaining upon repeated viewings, unlike \"A Streetcar Named Desire,\" which I could only endure one time. Watching mental cruelty, as dished out by George and Martha, somehow is much more perverse than watching sex acts depicted on screen. Other movies have pushed the envelope farther with regards to sex and language, but none in 35 years holds a candle to \"Virginia Woolf\" for guilty pleasure. As Martha said to George, \"A thousand years with you is quite enough.\"",

That does not damage the film and such changes are only very subtle.Some scenes have been modified and their location has been moved from the only set of the play, a living room, to external spots in order to increase the realism of the film and provide a freedom of expression and movement not possible for a stage production. In my opinion, anyone who watches the movie will be so captivated that any stage production of the play will seem somewhat inferior and restricted.Black and white cinematography was deliberately chosen to deminish and dissolve the beautiful characteristics of the actors, as Taylor's eyes would be a sgriking point of vividness in a setting of complete \"drabness\". Non-colour image makes the scenery more unnoticeable and enhances the actions of the actors. The external shots lend the film a breeze of late summer and early autumn melancholy and desolation.",

It was groundbreaking in terms of language and theme (It been released in 1966). It is one of the greatest masterpieces of the 60's and of cinema itself.It's director, Mike Nichols, was at that time directing stage plays and his debut film was this film, which I consider the greatest film ever made by Nichols.Ernest Lehman produced a fantastic screenplay, in my opinion, the best of his career. It keeps much of the dialogue of Edward Albee's play of the same title, which the film is based on. He also produced the film.But the best thing about this film is the acting. Elizabeth Taylor gives the best performance of her career as Martha, a spiteful, cruel charactered women who is married to George (Richard Burtan, again very effective), a history professor. Martha invites Honey (Sandy Dennis) and Nick (George Segal) over for a night of mental games.Nichols' paring of the most famous and tempestuous celebrities ever, Taylor and Burton, is what makes Who's afraid of Virginia Wolff so good. The energy and presence you feel from both of them is fantastic.The supporting cast are excellent also.Over all, this film is a masterpiece thats reflects the time it was been made.10/10",

Once they arrived, everybody starts to drink more, and more, so the emotions start to break out more leading to scenes that look like somebody is about to die. George and Martha always mentioned something that each of them didn't like without consulting first which led to fits of rage and mayhem. When George starts to do a little bit of verbal sparring with Taylor, it made each of them hurt more like a knife gently being stabbed into the back.This movie was incredible with how the dialogue was written out.

George, played by Richard Burton, is a professor who is married to the daughter of the school's president. The daughter named Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor, is a spoiled brat who is never satisfied. To makes matters worse, George is very witty with his words and can be very sarcastic, causing Martha to become frustrated and agitated. As the film developed, both couples become very intoxicated, leading to many further problems.I find that this film manly revolves around two themes. One, being that you should not stay in a toxic relationship, because negative energy only leads to n negative actions. The second theme was showing how alcohol can escalate situations. Other than the plot, I thought the cinemetagrophy was astounding. Man y of the close-up shots of the actors and actresses were very clear, especially for how dated this movie is. The acting is fantastic and exaggerated, whoever it did not feel cheesy. the over-the-top emotion in the dialogue was a result of the passive aggression and built up frustration.Overall, this film is original and a joy to watch.",

After a few drinks themselves, the couple loosens up and joins in on all the seemingly random nonsense taking place. The weird thing is, no matter how confused I was for the first 90% of the movie, I was incredibly intrigued. The couple's odd behavior is absolutely captivating, especially due to the superb acting by Richard Burton along with the other three characters. I just kept wondering 'what is wrong with this couple that they are acting like this?' By the end of the film, we do get an understanding into their background.

            "content": "\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" is an incredible film. By the end of it, you'll be totally exhausted and emotionally drained, but I've seen it a few times and I think the only way to even begin to understand it is by seeing at least twice. The setting is deceptively simple: a middle-aged couple, George (a history professor) and his wife Martha (who's father is head of the college George teaches at) invite Nick and Honey (a couple in their thirties who have just moved to the area because Nick has got a job teaching Biology at the college) round to their house for a drink after a party. What ensues is completely mind-boggling, as it turns out that George and Martha are locked into a distructive marriage, and the whole night turns into a war between the two. Almost from the word go, George and Martha (played brilliantly by Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) are flinging caustic insults at each other and although their words are shocking and brutal, I actually found some of their exchanges extremely funny. Richard Burton is especially masterful with his sarcastic comebacks to his wife's verbal body blows, and in my opinion he deserved the Oscar he was nominated for, but failed to win. As the film develops you are dragged deeper and deeper into the conflict, just as Nick and Honey are. George Segal as Nick and Sandy Dennis as Honey are excellent support for the mighty Burton and Taylor, who eventually turn on their guests and use them as pawns in their twisted mind-games. The end scene is where the 'truth' (if it is indeed the truth - for the viewer is never sure - like George and Martha - what is true and what isn't) comes out, and then the film ends with George and Martha seemingly making peace, with her clutching at his hand, probably because they've knocked every ounce of fight out of each other during the course of the movie. \"Truth and illusion, George, you don't know the difference,\" Martha tells her husband scornfully in one scene, and by the end of the movie, neither did I. The almost constant dialogue is so cleverly woven that you can never tell when George and Martha are being serious or not, and I think the whole point of the film is that the audience never really know the truth. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good drama, and although I admit it is a hard movie to watch simply because of the depths it reaches into, it is also compulsive viewing - I didn't move for the whole two hours the first time I watched it. The acting is superb, and Elizabeth Taylor gives the best performance of her entire career as the loud, embittered and yet somehow tragic character of Martha. This is a movie that definitely stays with you, and one of my many after-thoughts was this: I wonder how much of Burton and Taylor's real relationship came through when they were playing George and Martha. My guess is that their publicised verbal battles had nothing on those of George and Martha, although it certainly makes you wonder!",

At one moment you feel like liking the character, the next moment you hate him/her again and when there's a little break in the shout fight and the character tries to talk about feelings, you feel like liking the character again until the illusion is crushed in the next moment when the shouting goes on again. It takes a lot of talent from both the director and the actors to keep this furious feeling and the tension of the characters alive in every scene of the movie. Although 131 runtime for a movie like this feels a little bit too long but on the other hand it mirrors how long the never ending fighting goes on and how numb it makes both audience and the characters. It is no wonder Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is counted as such a classic. Rarely have Hollywood films and their love stories been as furious and cold as this one is. Even after decades, it is still as strong mockery of Romeo and Juliet as it was when it was released. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf really shows that the everlasting love is only an illusion and one single drunken night is enough to bring that illusion down. Snap.",

This film goes so deep into the human psyche and should be viewed with that understanding. Elizabeth Taylor plays her best role as Martha, the drunken wife. Richard Burton as the husband, George, is both scary and worn down by his pairing with Martha. Enter Sandy Dennis and George Segal as pawns in a chess game and there is the human drama in all its glorious pain. The turmoil and pain is within them. When they lash out at one another and their visitors, the viewer sees flashes and pieces of their very souls. A brilliant film for the camera work, the setting and of course the top notch acting for all four characters. Never be afraid of Virginia Woolf as she lives in all of us.",

Both of these aspects seemingly help their individual and collective performances.The anger, resentment, betrayal and sense of loss permeate the film throughout. Booze helps this throughout the picture. \"You stay at the meat of things\". This line by Taylor says a lot.A brilliant study in relationship, loss and comfort in a marriage.

            "review_title": "Mike Nichols was not afraid",
            "content": "On December 6 2014, Turner Classic Movies (TCM) is doing a retrospective of the late Mike Nichols film career. Its first offering: Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?Mike Nichols was special. Some say gifted, but I've never liked that word as it applies to accomplishment; it implies, to me anyway, an elitist privilege that further implies a nonpayment of appropriate dues. Mike Nichols was born to a Jewish family in Berlin Germany in 1931. In 1939 his father, a doctor, had the means and the foresight to escape the oncoming holocaust just before it was to begin in earnest. There is a hell of a story in there somewhere, but I have never heard it. My point being that escaping from the Nazi's is enough dues paying for a lifetime.Yeah, he was special, but what astonishes me in reviewing his life work, is how he was apparently able to immediately impress everybody else that he was special. His first directorial assignment was not off \u2013Broadway, not off-off Broadway, not dinner theater in Poughkeepsie, but on Broadway for established writer Neil Simon. The result was\" Barefoot in the Park\" for which Nichols would win a Tony award as best director. The play would become Simon's longest running play ever (around or above four years) and the 10th longest running non musical production in Broadway history! First at bat: grand slam home run.Sometime in the 1960's legendary producer Jack Warner (yes that Warner of Warner Bros. Studios or Time-Warner if you prefer) thought the eccentric writings of playwright Edward Albee in his play\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf\" might make a good movie. I don't know how he came to that conclusion, but conclude it he did, and he hired multiple Academy Award nominee Ernest Lehman to write the screen play, and then cast Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to play the leads.Just a few words about Liz and Dick; they were the Godmother and Godfather of celebrity pop culture. They weren't just big; they were the biggest\u0085by far. They would dominate the tabloid press and intrude into the real news for almost twenty years. To compare them to modern celebrity like the Kardasians is not only ludicrous but blasphemous. OK, who should direct this spicy hot m\u00e9lange? Why not someone who's never directed a movie before? Mike Nichols. Success on Broadway is not a guarantee of success in cinema. Bob Fosse's first foray was \"Sweet Charity\" which is a certifiable catastrophe. In stage craft everybody is always in full shot, in cinema you have to know when to push the camera in, when to pull it back, when to open the story up so it looks like a movie and not a photographed play. There is a certain grammar to cinema and it needs to be used correctly. It is essential in order to create and build the emotional tension that is so necessary for this film's success. In his first attempt, does Nichols succeed? Well, here's the stat line: 13 Academy Award nominations. It was only the second and last film to ever be nominated in all the categories for which it was eligible. It won five, including one for Ms Taylor, surprisingly not one for Mr. Burton, nor one for Mr. Nichols (although that would be remedied shortly.) And! It was a financial success being one of the top 10 grossing movies of 1966. Nichols first at bat for a different team: Grand slam home run.Pocket Review:If you didn't know who Virginia Woolf was before you see this movie, you will certainly be afraid of her by the end of it.George (Richard Burton) is a teacher at some unnamed small college and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) is the daughter of the college president. They are a middle aged married couple who are disappointed in how their lives have turned out, especially since their life together seemed to have started out with so much promise and advantage. Their coping mechanism is to blame each other for their failures both individually and as a couple, and this failure is complete, professional, emotional, and sexual. Oh, yeah, they also drink a lot, that's always helpful.In to this toxic alcoholic mix comes a young professor at the college Nick (George Segal) and his mousey wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) who Martha has invited over to their on campus house for \"a drink\". They will serve as audience surrogates as together we will watch as George and Martha's marriage explosively dissolves. As the drama demands, they will also become participants to the wreckage, but more than that, they get to walk through the looking glass and see what bleak future may be in store for them. It is through the interaction of this fabulous four, that we, the audience, discover that George and Martha have constructed a nest of lies in order to keep themselves at least one hash mark above the median of sanity, and it is through these lies that the deeper psychological truth is revealed.What does it mean? Why should we care? Honestly I don't know. I have always had trouble figuring this movie out, but I have watched it several times, always with avid fascination. I wouldn't call it one of the best movies ever, but I would certainly call it one of the most extraordinary. Mike Nichols film directorial debut. It was a doozy. Thanks Mike... I think. Nichols next offering goes beyond any baseball metaphor I could possibly come up with. It was certifiable, bone fide phenomenon. \"The Graduate\".",

I was guessing the whole film as to whether their son was real. I was wondering who wrote the script.

            "content": "Many attempts have been made, to transpose a theatrical play into a good movie and many have failed. This one succeeds gloriously, largely because the theatrical atmosphere - with stage rather than cinematic moods and setting - is rigorously sustained. After the initial scene, with what appears to be a harmonious couple walking across a campus (our first and last glimpse at the real world outside) the entire action, for the rest of the film is locked into sets as confined as a theatre stage.The agonies of George's and Martha's marriage unfold within those tatty, dusty sets, at a cracking pace and it is impossible not to be drawn into the action. Their dysfunctional relationship is made all the more painful when paraded in front of their injudiciously invited guests - a younger, more idealistic couple. As the booze flows, values shift, cracks widen, loyalties switch and, as a viewer, one feels increasingly uneasy about where to place one's sympathies.Edward Albee is a great playwright, easily in the top American three, along with Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, but that alone would not make a film. (Think how many awful Shakespeare films there are in the world!) What makes this film succeed is the impeccable casting. Taylor and Burton are better than in anything made, before or since. His shabby academic, and her frustrated, discontented university wife are totally convincing but the supporting roles by Segal and Dennis round off the acting to a tee.I first watched this film when living on an Ivy League campus, in the 1960s and was deeply moved by the experience. I have seen the play performed by amateurs and professionals - ironically, the best production was by a local amateur group in the UK - and recently re- watched the film on video. I still leave it as impressed as I was in the 60s. One of my top 100 movies for sure. Do not miss it.",

The real life couple, Richard Burton, and Liz Taylor delivers a story of epic sadness in Mike Nichols \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\". This Booze filled roller-coaster takes place late at night on the campus of a highly accredited New-England University. Middle aged couple George and Martha stumble home after partying late with some co-workers. As soon as they get home they start bantering playfully, and innocently. Slowly things start to get heated between the two, but we put it off, as they are both so passive, it seems natural. Tension only rises when Martha drops the fact that she invited a young couple for a nightcap. The night erupts into madness, when they arrive. Taylor and Burton deliver the meaning of absolute pain. They take marital issues to a new extreme, but do so incredibly. The shear energy of the old married couple whilst their troubled bantering creates such an uncomfortable tension, that it left me especially uncased.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, based on Edward Albee's play of the same name, was directed in 1966 by Mike Nichols and marks his directorial debut. Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay and produced the film, and Haskell Wexler worked on cinematography. The film was edited by Sam O'Steen and scored by Alex North. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf stars Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis - all of whom were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances. The film was nominated for a total of 13 Academy Awards, marking only the second time in cinematic history that a film was nominated for every category in which it was eligible. The film won five Academy Awards in total, with Elizabeth Taylor and Sandy Dennis both winning for their respective categories. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is set around a New England university (some shots were filmed at Smith College), and the events of the film transpire over the course of a single evening.The primary focal point of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is the explosive marriage between Martha and George, played by the real-life married duo Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Martha is the daughter of the university president, and George is a history professor who works at the university. The two host an alcohol laden late-night gathering for another couple, Nick (Segal) and Honey (Dennis), as Nick is a new professor on campus. Martha and George's hostile relationship is showcased in full force in front of their guests, as they engage in vicious verbal battles that escalate in their intensity over the course of the film. As the evening becomes progressively more unhinged, the audience witnesses the complexities of Martha and George's marriage unravel, culminating in the exposure of a devastating secret that has bonded the two together (which won't be discussed further due to MAJOR spoilers). Taylor and Burton's own tumultuous marriage aids in fueling the vitriolic and destructive dynamic that unfolds between their characters, informing both of their performances.It is notable that Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf was shot entirely in black and white, a deliberate choice by Nichols. His reasoning was based on the belief that this style would be more fitting to the overall dark intensity of the film, and would also help to conceal the extra makeup used to age Elizabeth Taylor (who was only 34 at the time of production). The camerawork in the film is also very interesting, and some shots utilize a handheld camera to specifically follow character movements. One instance of this is when George travels down a hallway to retrieve a shotgun, and this camera movement makes the scene even more unsettling. Additionally, that particular scene also makes use of a zoom lens, and focuses in on the reactions of the characters (who are even more startled than the audience, if possible). In another scene, the four characters stumble into a roadhouse and continue their party, as the night spirals further into chaos. This sense of disarray is amplified by the camera angles used in the scene - at one point while watching, I actually felt discombobulated watching the group's interaction from such an intense angle.Aside from the brilliant cinematography, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf features phenomenal performances by the entire cast, especially Taylor. She was absolutely incredible in her role as Martha, and I was riveted by her performance.I would definitely recommend Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, and truly enjoyed experiencing the film.",

Edward Albee went to the core of the American soul with this one, laying bare all life's traps and traumas dressed up in social issues. There are four characters in the play. George and Martha are the central characters. George is a professor at a New England college whose president is his father-in-law. His wife, Martha, married George, to enhance further her own social status, but fell far short of this because George was content to be \"in\" the History department, rather than \"run\" the History department.  This unhappy union produced a peculiar fantasy centered around their \"child\" in relation to which they play a particular game. There is one rule to this game: no one must know about it. Martha, in a drunken moment, slips, and reveals it to her guest, Honey, the wife of Nick, a new, young \"good looking\" professor who, as Martha would have it, is \"in the Math department or something\". A vicious, soul-cleansing game ensues for all. The fantasy lies in tatters at the end-or does it?  This play was turned into a superb film in 1966, starring Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor, Sandy Dennis, and George Segal. It received 13 Academy Award nominations, and won six of them, including a richly deserved Best Actress Oscar for Elizabeth.

It was directed by Mike Nichols. The film is about a middle-aged couple named Martha, starring Elizabeth Taylor, and George, played by Richard Burton, who invite a younger couple over from the party they just attended. Before the young couple comes over, Martha and George argue over many problems. Martha verbal abuses George and when he becomes sick of the abuse, George decides to break objects and can become violent towards Martha. They both drink to cope with the toxicity of the relationship. The young couple is named Honey, starring Sandy Dennis, and Nick, played by George Segal. Over the course of the movie, it displays one night consisting of drinking and chaos of Martha's and George's games to hurt one another.I thought the movie had a lot of intricate mind games going on between Martha and George. I felt that if I was also drinking, the movie would make more sense. The film was very real as if the conversation was made by actual drunk people. The actors describe the characters very well for how they would be drunk. Some of the characters got testy. Some got emotional. The conversation topics between characters bounced around quite a lot. The movie was somewhat hard to follow because I didn't know what character was telling the truth and which one was sputtering nonsense. Either they were telling the truth, or they were telling nonstop lies. I think that was the interesting part of the movie was everything was going very fast. The characters felt very realistic with middle-aged couple arguing and true intentions of the young couple.Even though the movie can be hard to follow when sober, it's an interesting intriguing movie that shows the realism of a toxic marriage. It shows how verbal abuse can also be used by a woman towards a man which abuse is more commonly related to a male.

            "content": "\"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?\" was certainly a daring film to make for Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Being that they both had already had a very public volatile relationship, you can imagine how hard it must've been to be to basically be facing the truth about each other in this story. And the strength of the film very much lies in it's frank look at marital problems and how NOT to solve them.It is an emotionally draining film as another reviewer said in the sense, that as this one night evolves, we hear some conversations that are so life like in their strangeness and off beat construction, that we might have preferred not to have heard, but it really does show us something about people and relationships(romantic or otherwise) that we might not have initially faced otherwise. Certainly a lot of that credit goes to playwright Edward Albee and screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who deserve all the money they've made off this movie.Everyone knows the story here, so I won't cover it too much, but for those few who don't, I'll just say it's unforgettable. Throughout the movie, Martha and George(Taylor, and Burton) split up to have discussions sometimes between each other, sometimes with the young couple who has visited(Honey and Nick, played by Sandy Dennis and George Segal respectively), in what leads to some the strongest manipulation between a married couple in a movie you'll ever see. It's strange, but the movie oddly enough also works effectively as a psychological thriller. The odds and ends of these characters unravel in an incredibly suspenseful and intriguing way that is unforgettable.But most of all, the acting is what makes this movie work. Richard Burton especially is hypnotic in his obsessive devotion to whatever pops into his mind, and he has a few speeches in here that he performs so well, it's a shame he didn't win an Oscar for it. However, Taylor is extremely good as well, humorous but not hilarious and entirely convincing. Admittedly, the young couple aren't as big a part of the movie, but nevertheless perform well and are still interesting characters.So if you haven't already seen it, check it out. It'll certainly leave you thinking much in the same way Mike Nichols' similarly good, but more uneven film \"The Graduate\". It's a film you shan't soon forget, and for all you actors out there, take notes.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a film directed by Mike Nichols and released in 1966. The storyline follows a middle-aged couple (Elizabeth Taylor as Martha and Richard Burton as George) one evening after a dinner party. George is a history professor and Martha is the daughter of the head of the university. Martha invites a new faculty member and his wife (Nick, played by George Segal, and Honey, played by Sandy Dennis) for a few drinks at their home. But, Martha forgets to tell George about the invitation until they arrive at their home. This revelation, along with an already alcohol fueled evening, unleashes a night of unbridled tension between Martha and George for which Nick and Honey are completely unprepared.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf relies on the viewer having a similar uncomfortable experience as Nick and Honey. Many people can relate to being in the company of a feuding couple whose disdain for each other is only thinly veiled. It is an awkward experience. This movie is an equally awkward experience for the viewer as one hopes that George and Martha will simply stop the verbal abuse, quasi-jokes, and drinking and allow the guests to go home.The central theme of the screenplay is how Martha and George have handled lost dreams and disappointment in their lives and relationship. Rather than work and talk through their problems, they have become bitter. This bitterness has now defined their relationship and has transcended any love they once had for each other. The story also reveals how the seeds of bitterness are planted in Nick and Honey's marriage. They may grow into the couple that Martha and George have become if they don't choose a different path.Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is an interesting character study of relationships. Its theme holds up well over time and modern viewers will certainly grasp the context of the film. It is long and repetitive at points and some of the acting (especially Taylor's) can be over the top. However, it does succeed in making the viewer examine how to deal with hard times in their relationships and life.",

            "content": "Review for ART 1145 American Cinema - Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Directed by Mike Nichols, screenplay and produced by\nErnest Lehman is a drama film based on Edward Albee's 1962 play with the same name. This film stars Elizabeth Taylor (Martha), Richard Burton (George), George Segal (Nick), and Sandy Dennis (Honey). We follow the late-night encounters of Martha and George, a couple that is the personification of a toxic love-hate relationship, and their guests Nick and Honey, a couple who had just relocated to town for Nick to work at the university where George is a professor. Throughout the night, we the viewer's experience very uncomfortable and hostile moments as we see Martha and George grow more antagonistic and mean-spirited to each other. All the while Nick and Honey become victims entangled in their indecent and bitter fights. With an excessive amount of alcohol being consumed and harsh and vulgar words being thrown, Martha and George's destructive relationship degrades rapidly. By the climax of the movie, dark secrets emerge, leaving the end of the film and Martha and George's relationship depressive and discontent. The acting in this film is like no other. When I saw that the film only had four people for the entirety of the movie, I thought it was going to be boring and monotone. However, every single actor and actress proved me wrong. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton played their roles excellently, portraying the emotions and qualities of an unstable and unhappy couple going through a downward spiraling marriage. George Segal and Sandy Dennis also did marvelous playing the disturbed and unsettled younger couple, captured in the web of aggression and resentment that Martha and George made. I can see why this film was nominated for 13 Academy Awards, and every actor and actress were nominated for their respective roles (Elizabeth Taylor and Sandy Dennis winning Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress).Overall, this film was phenomenal. It captures the difficulties of a middle-aged couple's marriage and their feelings of love and hate, happiness, and resentment, and leaves a bittersweet feeling of hope yet despair for Martha and George.",

Richard Burton is excellent as always and George Segal was quite a surprise for me, the same as Sandy Dennis. What impresses me most is the economy of elements, the film owes its success mainly to the dialogue, there are only four characters and the setting is very sober, it is obviously not a very expensive film to make.This makes me wonder why does the film industry today spend millions in the production of films which have no interest whatsoever when you can have a masterpiece for much less. The film explores the \"dark side\" of the soul, the bitterness, frustration and consequent anger bursts out all through the film, which develops in real time (quite a challenge)black humor is specially delicious and enables you to bear the sadness constrained in the story.

I have to say that it was phenomenal. I just remember the movie being a lot of screaming. The play had a lot more sarcastic phrasing than screaming and the lead actor playing George was extraordinary.But what leads me to compose this review is to try to counter the criticisms of this movie about how difficult it is to watch. I have also read some reviews discussing how \"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf\" is word play on \"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf\" and dragging in a \"Three little pigs\" interpretation. I would humbly suggest that the play/film is a little bit more witty than that.Let's start off by saying that the characters of Nick and Honey are not real. (Again I delve into a Magical Realism interpretation of the \"action.\")At the beginning of the movie, George and Martha have just returned home from a faculty mixer. It is two o'clock in the morning and apparently, instead of going to bed, they have to entertain a new faculty member and his wife at the behest of Martha's father, the College President. This seems pretty unusual.But lets look at it a different way.Suppose Martha's father had instead asked them to examine their marriage and their life together. Perhaps Nick and Honey are just metaphors for the worst things that they fear in their marriage. Maybe they are themselves soon after their marriage. Martha and George's interaction with Nick and Honey is merely Martha and George confronting their worst fears, or reconciling their earlier expectations of what their life might be like together.Their interactions with Nick and Honey allow then to \"discuss\" their marriage. This nocturnal engagement between them, this most civilized exchange of ideas about their marriage, is subsequently portrayed with the most raw and vulgar emotional patter one could think of. It is this self engagement, this self denial, this self confrontation that drives the emotional denouement, not the three little pig-pig-piggies.But the moon, ahhh, the moon. When George goes out in the moonlight to pick snapdragons, Martha accuses him of lying - the moon had already set so there could be no moon now. George emphatically denies her logic, reissuing the claim that the moon had come back up. But why so much emotion about such a prosaic astronomical event? Well, aye there she blows, for the moon rising a second time is full well hope of a second chance and a marriage that will last a lifetime.So ponder and re-ponder, for the lives of Nick and Honey exist solely in the willies of our beloved George and Martha. Hey, I remember reading a few books about George and Martha, to my daughter, a few years back. They were hippopotamuses and exceedingly polite ....",

Unfortunately we had to wait a few days to see her because President Kennedy was assassinated. When it was announced that Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton was to do a film version of this wonderful play needless to say we were a little disappointed. Sure, the Burton's were the most glamourous and bankable stars at that time but we wondered if Ms Taylor could play the part of a 50 year old woman. Later, we found that her character was suppose to be a younger woman and that started us thinking that Hollywood was going to tinker with one of our favorite plays. We went to the movie with a lot of misgivings and was pleasantly surprised at how close the screenplay was to it's original source, even to using some of the salty language. Richard Burton's approach was just right for the screen, he knew he had to save himself for the final third act. Ms Taylor did her best and deserved her Oscar for her performance, but I've always thought that the play demanded an older couple,for balance. After all, the contrast of Martha putting the make on that young man had a real meaning in the play while George's half hearted attempt at flirting with Honey worked on the stage. I have a copy of the movie but that's only because I love the dialog and as I said the film does retain some of the flavor of the great play. Richard Burton lost his Oscar bid to Paul Schofield who starred in the movie The Man for All Seasons but my vote really went to Mr Burton, he was the most believable character in the movie. All in all, I give the movie a six.",

It is without a doubt Elizabeth Taylor's Tour de Force. This was Richard Burton's best and most complex role as well. He was playing totally against type, seemingly, but the evolution of his character, from henpecked to irritated, to aggressive, to angry, and finally to vindictive, was played to perfection, and crafted in a way only English actors of the old school can do. I think he knew that Elizabeth was giving the performance of a lifetime and he plays off of that. He is giving her the canvas on which she paints Martha. I understand this was painful for her emotionally and physically. She put her heart, soul and body out there for us to see what Albee envisioned and Richard Burton enabled. But she achieved it.What makes the film extraordinary and ultimately satisfying is that despite the seeming hatred, jealousy, boredom, disrespect, disconnection - everything that can go wrong with a relationship - there remains this desperate need, if not love, for each other. But maybe it is love. Love is need - Need is love - two ends of a spectrum. This desperation ultimately explains the relationship. Love and desperation become one. It was never about the child. George and Martha are two lost children themselves who will never find their way out. But the circle is unbroken - they end up where they started. As do we all.Beautifully adapted from a sterling stage play. Magnificently photographed in glorious Black and White. And of course you were waiting for me to mention Sandy Dennis and George Segal. A younger counterpoint to George and Martha. But they will avoid that fate. Won't they? Will the circle be unbroken?",

The main characters reside as Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor, George (her husband), played by Richard Burton, Nick by George Segal, and Honey, by Sandy Dennis. Directed by Mike Nichols, it's a very up and down film in my opinion. Side note: Mike also had balls for shooting his first film as a play, even though he brought on some of the best actors there are. Martha and George don't have the best relationship. Martha is a loud character with very expressed emotions, while George is a little quieter.  Marthas a bitter and hopeless alcoholic, and George is a failed history professor at the college that Marthas father runs. The combination for a couple is just horrible. It deteriorates so easily and the two can never get along. The production is done by Ernest Lehman, and I believe him and Nichols did a great job portraying the intensity of the film and the relationship between Martha and George. The camera angles and zooms at certain points keep the audience waiting for what comes next in terms of emotions. Whether Martha is going to blow up as always, or she's going to hold back and just make a sour comment. George is a very meticulous person in the way that every comment he makes has a meaning to it, usually in a bad way. They're both very frightening people, they're manipulative towards each other. George and Martha also have an imaginary son. It's madness. The whole night with Nick and Honey they're talking about their \"little bugger\" coming home. When's he gonna come home? No one knows if he's real or not. \n\nMy favorite point however to make about this movie is that Mike Nichols was insanely smart for getting Elizabeth Burton and Richard Taylor to play these roles. The couple wasn't always the best. They had both been divorced as least twice, marrying each other after. But they were up and down as well. They weren't always so steady, which helped them act out their roles in the film. In my opinion, some of the anger from Martha and some of the comments from George seemed so real, like they had already been said before in real life. It was a miraculous job by Nichols to pair them up for the part. \n\n6/10. I wasn't a huge fan of the movie.

The film centers on a middle-aged couple in a very unhappy marriage that draw their young guests, a new faculty member and his wife (Segal, Dennis) into an evening of cruel manipulation and games (Burton and Taylor are married in real life at this time).  Elizabeth Taylor as Martha, who is the daughter of a university president married to George, a faculty member is a brash and seductive character that can be both cruel one minute and a loving wife the next.  Burton as George initially appears as a harried and abused husband, however, his subtle and vicious remarks ultimately put him in charge of the dark game the couple plays.  The fact that both characters appear to be alcoholics in the film contributes to their dark and rancorous communication with each other.  Despite the obvious deterioration of their marriage though, there appears to be an unhealthy need for each other.  Nick and Honey (Segal and Dennis) despite their initial inclination to leave the situation, allow themselves to be caught up in the menacing drama.\n\nThe film is shot in black and white, which perfectly compliments the dark mood of the film.  The set of the couple's home, which looks run down and shabby also reflects the couple's deteriorating marriage.  These two artistic approaches really helped to convey the downward spiral that the relationship is taking.  Ernest Lehman's adaptive screenplay impressively captures the brooding nature of Edward Albee's original Broadway play.\n\nI highly recommend this film as there is a tremendous amount of talent on display here.  Taylor and Burton are at their best in this film, perhaps drawing from their tumultuous marriage in real life. Segal and Dennis as the young couple also give notable performances.  Lehman has written a brilliant screenplay based on Edward Albee's dark Broadway play, and Haskell Wexler does a brilliant job with the black and white cinematography in bringing out the darkness of the film's subject matter. Even the music presents a gloomy atmosphere of foreboding.",

The movie won the award for best actress in a leading role and was a well-liked film post-release. \n\nThe film begins with the couple coming home from one of her father's get-togethers, and the very first thing she notes when she looks around their house is, \"What a dump.\" Martha is an unrefined woman who speaks her mind any chance she gets, occasionally getting her into hiccups throughout the film. Martha is also an alcoholic, and her drinking leads to impaired decision-making. Her husband, George, attempts to constrain her explosive personality. The couple has an imaginary child who is about to turn 16, and George is unsure if the child belongs to him, creating tension between the couple. They talk about their kid to their friends, and George dislikes the topic of their son. At one point in the film, George shares a story with Nick about a kid he grew up with who accidentally killed both his parents and ended up in an asylum. After confessing to Nick that he sees him as a threat when it comes to Martha. The couple stops at a barroom to dance, and Nick dances suggestively with Martha bringing this threat to life. A fight erupts, and Martha leaves with Nick and Honey and takes Nick up to the bedroom to engage in sexual activity. This leads to George saying he received a telegram saying their son had died using the same story he previously told nick about the boy who killed his own parents. Obviously, this was all made up in an attempt to get back at Martha, which works. The movie ends with the other couple leaving Martha and George alone at their house as the day breaks.\n\nI would say that the filming of this movie and some of the camera techniques used were ahead of their time. I think the story was really good and developed well. I don't have any major criticisms of this movie and would recommend it to plenty of people. I think this movie is suitable for any of age audience and is a good reflection of life and dealing with struggles through different coping mechanisms.",

            "content": "Mike Nichols' Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf embraces the task of translating a theatrical production to a mainstream film. The source material does not lend itself into creating an action-packed film with traditional or trendy story aspects, but it is rather a deep character study focused on its two main leads. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are more than up to the task and give incredible performances, showcasing their extraordinary chemistry. The script is tight and held nothing back in fear of criticism or censorship, which was a controversial choice for the time. Technical aspects all embrace that the story is now in film and has room to explore with how viewers will perceive each scene and shot.\n\nThe story centers around George, a history professor at a private college in New England, and his wife, Martha, whose father is the president of the school. The runtime glimpses into one night of the couple's life, as they return home from a faculty party and have a younger couple over as guests. As the couples drink more, the conversation becomes increasingly hostile, abrasive, and uncomfortable. It's interesting how the spectacle of the matter is not so much the hatred and turmoil we see between Martha and George, but instead that they choose to put it on full display in front of company. As the night goes on, the two only become more outwardly disdainful, but we're offered brief glimpses into underlying feelings that aren't so negative perhaps.\n\nWhile the performances were incredibly strong and the writing sharp, I personally found that I didn't really enjoy this film. The concept works in any format I believe, but due to my own preferences I'd rather read it as a screenplay to have more time with the words or see it in a live theatrical production with more atmosphere and less distractions. Viewing it at home felt more like a chore to peer in at over two hours focused on just one night in the characters' lives. I just prefer that type of storytelling in other formats and perhaps think the runtime could have been shaved down to make the film more easily digestible for film audiences or perhaps more added stylization to really distinguish it from its stage counterpart.",

Their secret was their fictitious son, which kept their marriage together. \n\nThe young woman's remark of the bell alerted George that their kid had passed away just before daybreak. His son's passing was announced. He decided the death of his son. An equally fictional telegram was sent to the son's \"parents,\" his cerebral acerbity, but his inauthentic \"parents,\" informing them that he had passed away. The son had been \"living\" for 16 years. \n\nThis middle-aged couple on a college campus has attempted to conceal the gaps in their life through a variety of means. Before the dawn could rise, however, they were forced to awaken to the discovery of their secret. There are shadows everywhere beneath the sun, and this waking is just the beginning of another more terrible one. \n\nThe narrative of the second part of the evening raised the question of whether life is based in fact or in fiction.

The couple invites over a younger couple named Nick and Honey. Nick is a professor of biology who recently started teaching at the same college as George. The events of the movie take place in one evening with the couples' banter turns from subvert passive aggressive behavior towards their respective spouses into full overt arguments and vicious behavior towards every member of the group.

The movie ends with the already fractured marriage, in broken pieces of disillusion as they have to face reality once again. This film explores many themes, one of them being the deviation of what domestic couples were portrayed as in films. At the onset, it seems as though both couples are normal individuals, but as the night goes on, we see the illusion unravel as all members of the party reveal aspects of dysfunction that the audience can resonate with. The movie makes the audience wonder whether illusions that bond are better than a reality that tears apart.",

It is directed by Mike Nichols and adapted from the stage play.\n\"Marriage later consists of women's wishful thinking and men's indifference.\" There are only four actors in this film, two couples, one middle-aged and one newly married. The whole film is the drunken truth of these four people. Martha and George's marriage is full of holes. From the hole, we can see endless hatred and few and weak love. Martha's noble family background makes her form a self-centered personality, making trouble for her husband everywhere. George's low family background and lack of fertility make him live in the shadow of his wife, but he wants to be respected by men. All these laid the foundation for their contradiction. Like the shotgun that can pop an umbrella, the end of hatred can only be an embarrassing end. When they uncover their scars, they need to support each other to get out of the real pain and continue to hurt each other next time, which is a very sad situation. What is sadder is that all the clues in the film also show that the young couple will go on the same road of hatred as them in the future.\nFor the same script as the stage play, the version we see can reflect the highly selective hidden and highlight, not only the dynamic scene frame, but also the amplification of the characters focusing on the close-up of the characters' faces and the amplification of the voice of the more prominent characters whispering. More importantly, the film uses motion shots and quick cuts to transfer scenes and viewpoints, so that the psychological changes of characters can rely on the changes of physical scenes. In addition, the scenes of lawn and tavern in the film can also play a role in adjusting the intensive lines. I think this film looks a bit boring because of too much dialogue, but the core of absurdity and marriage tragedy conveyed by the film is also conveyed to the audience in this way.\nIn general, this is a landmark film, which combines absurdity, incomprehensibility between people, escapism and other factors very well. It can also give our audience's view of love and marriage a very important reference.",

It is an oddly deceiving introduction to the film as what follows will capture your attention and make you afraid to look away for fear that you will miss something. And even when you did not look away from the screen it always feels like you are a step behind in the film missing a key part. Elizabeth Taylor as Martha and Richard as George are the stars of the film and their relationship will make you wonder if you have stepped into the life of a couple that have a love/hate relationship. The film will also make you think twice about alcohol consumption. Whether the issues of the characters are brought on by their need to continue the night's festivities. You will also discover that the other characters Nick and Honey only seem to make the otherwise chaotic scenes even more so crazed. \nI would personally recommend this film because despite how chaotic the scenes are they Elizabeth Taylor character Martha make every scene worth watching, Richard Burton makes you feel as if you are going to witness a crime at any given moment and the both of them together keeps you glue to the screen in the most uncomfortable way. The film is depicted in black and white and there are times the angles of the film makes you feel as if you are a fly on the wall intruding on a personal matter.

More drinks are poured during this one night than every season of Mad Men combined, and the film begins at two in the morning.

Mike Nichols (The Graduate) is masterful in his directorial debut. The film has such an intimate feel it's as if you're trapped on that 4th wall couch. The \"rifle\" scene and George sitting alone on the swing especially stood out to me, but there isn't a dull moment, even if you're kinda dying for one. Nick and George personify their respective departments at the unnamed college: Nick, biology, young, strapping, blond, handsome; George, history, old(ish), archaic, a thing that is passed. Apparently, Elizabeth Taylor gained 30lbs for the role, pulling a Christian Bale in 1966, and deserved the shit outta that Oscar. She's not just a tour de force but a force majeure, she's my worst nightmare, in her own words, she's \"the Earth mother and [we] are all flops\".

They were known for their tumultuous and toxic romance, same as Martha and George's one, however, their drama might have been entertaining for magazines and newspapers, but too repetitive for a two-hour long movie. \n\nDespite being repetitive mostly at the beginning, the film provides the public with different intriguing clues that managed to keep me curious and expecting the truth. Besides that, I also liked how at the beginning of the movie Martha is singing cheerfully the sing Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf, and at the end is George the one singing it, Martha replied that she is afraid. The title related to the writer Virginia Woolf and the Three Little Pigs alludes to living without illusion, at the end that is what Martha says, she is afraid of living without illusion. \n\nNichols did a great decision by filming the movie in black and white because of the ambient of the film and to hide the makeup that had to be done in Taylor to make her look older. The camerawork also performs a significant role in transmitting tension, they created different mechanisms to provide us with original and special shots, such as the one in the bar, for example, the dancing one made with high-angles or from the character's point of view. \n\nIn conclusion, despite the excessing amount of drama, Taylor and Burton's acting is really accurate and one of the best ones I have ever seen.

A Review of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\nThe Film Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf Follows the story of a night where a young couple named Nick and Honey Come and visit a middle-aged arguing couple named Martha and George. Martha and George who are played by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton respectively are constantly arguing and discussing points that are hard to determine if they are real or fake. The film is an amazing exploration of the complexities of not only relationships, but the importance of understanding the real from fake. There is an interesting exploration of how a simple joke or fib with some truth or emotional backing can lead to serious emotional harm over time. The film is really one that you need to watch and pay full attention to understand all the complex nuanced story saying that is present. At first the film seems a little hard to follow, but as the plot develops the story comes together. The way the movie progresses it leaves the viewer constantly guessing what is happening and questioning the motive of all the characters and who is telling the truth. I personally enjoyed the complexity of the story, and the direction of Mike Nicholas creates a viewing experience that leaves the viewer pleasantly confused. I found myself wonder what is going on throughout parts of this film as there where quick settings changes and the story moved linearly, yet the subject of dialog is constantly changing. In most cases when a movie confuses the view it is not a good thing, but in this case the tension it builds leads to an incredible conclusion that brings everything together. The film is hard to look away from as you are constantly perplexed by the relationships on screen that leave you guessing what is going to happen next. The flow of the film is as if there is a constant cliff hanger, and every piece of dialog is a mystery that you must solve to decide if what the character is real or total fabrication. The film is not something I would watch if you were not prepared to be engaged and really think about a story, but if you are prepared to watch attentively this film is amazing.",

The movie was based on the play by Edward Albee and stars Elizabeth Taylor as Martha, Richard Burton as George, and George Segal as Nick. The film was produced by Ernest Lehman, who also wrote the screenplay. The film takes place over the course of one evening and follows a middle-aged couple, George and Martha, who invite a younger couple, Nick and Honey, over for late-night drinks after a party. The film examines both couples' tenuous marriages as they spend a stressful evening bickering and drinking.    \n\tProduction highlights include stellar acting by all four main characters, particularly Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, as well as captivating cinematography by Haskell Wexler. Taylor portrays Martha as both callous and critical, living in her own imaginary self-centered world. Burton's suspenseful performance reveals his character slowly, evolving from normal but unambitious to positively maniacal. Taylor and Burton display extreme focus in their acting, sinking deep into the psyches of their characters as each attempts to gain control over the other in fits of fast-paced overlapping dialogue. \nWexler's cinematography adds to the tense atmosphere of the film by favoring close-up shots of the character's faces. Additionally, he utilizes many point-of-view shots, often switching back and forth between different character's viewpoints as they converse, allowing the viewer to easily understand each character's experience in the film. Wexler even occasionally uses blurred shots to illustrate a character's alcohol-induced haze. Dark lighting and a haunting score by Alex North add to the movie's strained suspense.  \nOverall, I highly recommend this film because of the way it forces the viewer to actively engage with the film in order to understand its complex characters. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a psychological drama, but the film has elements of mystery and keeps the audience thinking the whole time as they attempt to uncover each character's true motives. \nThis film plays heavily with the idea of illusions, sending a clear message about the danger of living in one's imagination. The fictional life that Martha and George have created for themselves only magnifies their inadequacies, falling to pieces as soon as reality starts to seep in. At the end of the day, Martha and George are incapable of accepting reality, choosing instead to create drama so that they can continue to play their chosen parts.",

            "content": "A hard watch with realistic alcoholics in a loveless marriage.\n\nMike Nichols' drama Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) is a landmark of realistic, toxic relationships being portrayed as alcoholics on screen. I don't know if I'd watch this emotional pain again, because I felt drained by the end. It's a long 131 minutes with a slow pace and few cuts from editor Sam O'Steen. You're meant to feel like you're in the room or watching Edward Albee's play and that can get old. \n\nHaskell Wexler's black and white cinematography is gorgeous and keeps you engaged during these long conversations, and Richard Sylbert's production design is often intriguing. This home looks actually messy with George James Hopkins' set decoration looking hilariously trashy. Nichols delivered a classic film that is still riveting, but it'll make you sad and perhaps frustrated with the ambiguous ending.\n\nElizabeth Taylor is incredible as she screams and freaks out to get her way as a stubborn and emotionally damaged alcoholic wife. You feel how miserable her married life is as she doesn't enjoy anything but drinking or being cruel. \n\nErnest Lehman's screenwriting captures Edward Albee's words with pithy insults and deep cutting remarks that push buttons in mean spirited ways. It's certainly like watching mean spirited drunks raving at each other, which has its appeal, but Taylor and Burton can be talking over each other too much. It's like the anxiety inducing dialogue from Uncut Gems at times.\n\nRichard Burton is excellent and captivating as the miserable alcoholic husband to Elizabeth Taylor. I found his frustration both funny in how antagonistic he gets and tragic as he's hopelessly unhappy. His chemistry with Taylor is fun in a brutally honest and toxically cruel way as you believe they have issues in this relationship. Alex North's subtle score creeps in to emphasize how twisted this pair have become as you never think that they'll be okay.\n\nGeorge Segal's new man on campus who Elizabeth Taylor likes is interesting as a foil for Burton to despise. Witnessing Burton get revenge is both satisfying and humiliating in a way. You cringe for how awkward and awful these characters are even the sweet Sandy Dennis gets to the point of being a raving drunk, unhappy with her life. I love her clapping and cheering on the couple's \"Violence!\"\n\nIn all, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a brutally hard film to watch, but a rewarding picture due to the impeccably raw acting.",

            "content": "\"TAKES MY BREATH AWAY\" LOVE FILMS\nby Timothy J. Verret\n\nI'm as drawn to love films as a beautiful and majestic horse is drawn to water. I create so much about and from the notion of love that it sometimes is hard for me to take a decent, deep breath. Here are 10 (actually 11) films about love (or the lack thereof) that \"take my breath away\" and heal my still-sometimes-very-broken heart (BOTH!):\n\n1. SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998):\nThis would indeed be my all-time favorite love film because it's got Shakespeare and it's got that message: \"Love is the ONLY inspiration.\" This film is inspired by a great and awe-inspiring love for acting, writing, directing, and how passion engages all of these things in one love film. Even if this film was not an ode to why Shakespeare wrote sonnets in the first place, the scene where Viola is onstage in a staged production of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET and William is lovingly looking at her from the wings is more than enough of a reason why I adore this love film. Viola loves William, William loves Viola, and the music takes us away to just this one moment of two looks and two smiles all looked and smiled in the name of a beautiful, all-encompassing love. That scene alone \"takes my breath way\" every time I see it. Even though this film is #10 on my all-time favorite films' list, it is solidly #1 on my all-time favorite love films' list (I guess you could say, \"so the last shall be first, and the first shall be last\" [Matthew 20:16]). \ud83d\ude09\n\n2. SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1973):\nSwedish director Ingmar Bergman is not known for gushy and silly love films, but this film IS a very serious love film because Bergman gives us both the glory and grime of a marriage dissolving. In true and typical Bergman fashion, each scene of this film is a very serious \"take my breath away,\" because the truth and turmoil at the heart of this marriage ending are about as real as my hand in front of my face. Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as Marianne and Johan give towering performances. I will never forget the scene where Marianne and Johan go to the lawyer's office to sign the divorce papers and literally get into a fist fight. After the fight (and the marriage) is over, they both with their tattered hair and hearts sign the divorce papers. This film is as stunning as it is sacrificial. Marriage IS sacrifice and when that's not there, stunning is any marriage's dissolvement. I probably could have listed a handful of Ingmar Bergman films that explore the theme of this kind of intense love, but I have to keep this list as brief as possible.\ud83d\ude09\n\n3. MARRIAGE STORY (2019):\nVery much like SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, this film is haunting and often horribly uneasy to sit through. Scarlett Johansson as Nicole and Adam Driver as Charlie give exceptionally riveting performances as a married couple with way too big egos (she is an actress and he is a theatre director and if that's not \"way too big egos,\" I don't know what is). I will never forget the scene where Nicole goes to Charlie's apartment and they are in the throws of so much anger and so much hurt that the walls of Charlie's apartment are about to come down. Johansson's Nicole delivers to Driver's Charlie the line that is THE line where love hoped to save this marriage and love can't save this marriage intersect, \"You're so merged with your own selfishness, you don't even identify it as selfishness anymore!\" That line \"took my breath away\" because I totally identified with it. A marriage on its way to a divorce is all about selfishness unidentified anymore. The proclaimed egos of both partners \"win out\" and when ego \"wins out,\" everything is \"lost in\" a marriage war of two \"way too big egos.\"\n\n4. THE DANISH GIRL (2015):\nIt's so cool that this film is #4 on this list, as #4 is my spiritual number. It's also cool that this film is #4 on my all-time favorite films' list, as well. The story of Gerda and Einar (Lily) Wegener is what love films should always be about: The sacrifice one partner needs to make for a marriage to survive (often times in a marriage, both partners have to make sacrifices). Gerda makes the ultimate sacrifice by accepting that her husband, Einar, believes he is a woman and wants to have an operation to become Lily, the woman he always was on the inside. Anyone else that I can think of in Gerda's position would have said in response to this, \"no way, no how\u2026.this marriage is OVER!\" Gerda loves Einar so much that she is willing to do just about anything (and she does) to keep their love alive. Alicia Vikander (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actress) is an absolute and complete revelation in her performance as Gerda, and Eddie Redmayne completely and totally seals the deal in his performance in this film to make him my all-time favorite actor next to Joaquin Phoenix. I swear I could go on and on about how this film \"takes my breath away\" at every twist and turn where love is concerned but, once again, I'm needing to be brief here.\ud83d\ude09\n\n5. YENTL (1983):\nVery similar to THE DANISH GIRL, this film is not your conventional love film. It's about a woman who loves this man who thinks a woman is a man, this man who loves another woman who is also a woman but since he can't have this other woman, the man asks a woman to marry this other woman so he can be close to this other woman, and a woman who this man thinks is a man marries this other woman, and if none of that \"takes your breath away,\" I'm not sure what ever would! This film \"takes my breath away\" because it's simply about the lengths and heights and depths we find ourselves reaching for in the throes (or thrown) of love. And because I am a huge Barbra Streisand fan and this is Barbra's best film EVER, I can't think of any other love film that pleases and excites me more than this one. And never mind that it is mainly because of Barbra Streisand and my love for her that helped me to believe that I could ever be someone someday who could love someone someday. Now, that \"takes my breath away.\"\n\n6. WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966):\nWhile most in a million years would never call this film a \"love film,\" I do because it's a film about the absence of love in a marriage, the absence that is SO common in a lot of marriages, and an absence so penetrable that the married couple in this film actually make up that they have a child to keep the marriage bearable. Edward Albee's play and Mike Nichols' film adaptation are what I love most about stories where love has flown the coop (if it was ever in the coop in the first place), i.e., the dissection and probing of the insides of people who are losing their identity because love has become nonexistent while brutality and mean-spiritedness are what's left to exist. Elizabeth Taylor, known for her striking beauty, goes from \"riches to rags\" in her physical beauty and gives us an \"ugly\" Martha, a force of nature who is as forceful as she is vulnerable. Taylor, Best Actress Oscar winner) gives what I consider the very best female performance ever captured on film. Richard Burton as George and George Segal as Nick are also excellent, but it's the other female performance of Sandy Dennis as Honey (Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner) that makes this love film truly one that \"takes my breath away\" every time I see it\u2026.and I've seen it a lot!\ud83d\ude09\n\n7. TESS (1980):\nIf there can be any love film that is truly lovely to look it, it would be this film. Based on Thomas Hardy's classic novel of the same name, Roman Polanski directed this film that makes the novel come breathtakingly and beautifully alive. This film \"takes my breath away\" not just because it's pretty to look at but also because it is rapturous and daring to expose seduction between a man and a woman as actually rape, and how that one act of domination produces shame that stays with the victim. I know that one's shame is to be nailed to The Cross of Jesus but for some, death is the one way, and maybe the only way, to be rid of that shame. Nastassja Kinski as Tess might not be the best actress who ever lived, but Polanksi knew exactly what he was doing by casting her in the title role. Because Kinski was a relative unknown and maybe because Polanski knew she wasn't the greatest actress around, it was precisely these two very things that allowed Kinski to inhabit Tess as bright-eyed innocent, and na\u00efve. A well-known and a great actress would have destroyed these precious traits, so thank God Polanski and Kinski didn't. There's one scene of a closeup of Tess with the brightest yellow sun behind her that to this day, every time I see a sun like that, it \"takes my breath away,\" and I call it, \"the Tess sun.\" LOVE THAT! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n8. THE WAY WE WERE (1973):\nIt certainly makes sense that I would have two Barbra Streisand films on this list but even if I didn't love Streisand, this film would be on it anyway and probably most others' \"love film\" list. It's the ultimate love story of the girl over there and the guy over here and how there and here come together and we are all the better for being present to witness that. The odds are that two beautiful actors like Redford and Streisand couldn't possibly go wrong in a beautiful love film that ends with a closing scene that still \"takes my breath away.\" Streisand's Katie and Redford's Hubbell are looking at each other after having separated when famous Streisand takes that famous hand and famously brushes away that famous hair from Redford's famous face. \"See ya', Katie.\" \"See ya' Hubbell.\" See me balling my eyes out.\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\n\n9. CASABLANCA (1942):\nWhile not the film I would have included on my \"take my breath away\" love films' list, I'm including it because it's on the top of the list for two of my favorite people and because any film with an actor or actress with the last name of \"Bergman\" should be on any film list I compile (see #2 for that \"other Bergman\" film). That said, I have seen this film and I remember loving it very much. Many \"love film\" aficionado's are divided into two camps where this film's ending is concerned: One group wants Rick to let Ilsa board that plane to Lisbon with Laszlo for The Resistance, while the other group says, \"C'mon! Rick and Ilsa forever! We're not talking about The Resistance here! We're talking about love!\" This film reminds us that love doesn't always end as victorious as The Resistance, but what we cannot \"resist\" is that we loved in the first place. That is usually enough for any kind of love to take flight.\n\n10. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934) and SOMEWHERE IN TIME (1980):\nI admit I was torn between which of these films to include to round out the top 10 \"take my breath away\" love films, until it dawned on me that both films have something very much in common: The element of time when and where love is lost and/or found. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is simple enough to say love can happen one night, whereas SOMEWHERE IN TIME says one night is fine, but true love cannot be contained by the element of time. Love can happen one night, sure, and then more nights can happen after that, but sometimes you have to go \"somewhere in time\" to find that love again. Whether one night or \"somewhere in time,\" love alters us to our very core and we do search time and space to find it, but there are no guarantees that the Jericho Walls (reference to the ending of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT) will stay up or come down when love happens in just one night or \"somewhere\" outside of space and time for a lifetime.\n\nNow, I'm not currently in a love relationship (unless you count Jesus) but if I were, my partner would need to have seen AT LEAST one of these films. If not, watching AT LEAST one of these films is essential if any partner who loves me expects to \"take my breath away.\" \ud83d\ude09\u2764\ufe0f",

This older couple begin to air all their dirty laundry in front of this couple and we (the audience) begin to see just how fractured this marriage is. They men are facility members work for a University where Martha's father is the President so there is a dynamic in their relationship from the beginning. The visit consists of George and Martha taking swipes at each other all night while the younger couple who also indulge in drinking, begin to air their laundry as well. Their fights seem to always goes back to her father his money and influence and George not being able to live up to her dad.\nThis movie was shot in black and white I think to show dramatic effects of what was happening in the movie. The shots with just them in frame helped highlight the seriousness of what was going on in the scene. The midpoint of the movie is shot with the characters at the height of the disagreements /issues within their prospective marriages each scene seems to show them at their most emotional vulnerability. By the end of the movie we get a clearer picture as to what is going on with this couple paired with the music it softens these seemingly harsh and abrasive characters and helps give a better insight into how their marriage got to point in time where we meet them.\nI think the movie was great and I would recommend it if you want to learn how to take a play and turn it into a Hollywood classic. This movie deals with issues that can fester in a marriage to the point where it appears to the outside the two people in the marriage hate each other. These same issues over the years have torn the marriage apart but its also the thing that holds them together, shared emotional pain.  Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton comes across as a real couple dealing with some real problems in their marriage, they have learned to deal with these problems with alcohol and insulting each other. The younger couple to me represents what Martha and George used to be before the years turned them into this hateful version of themselves. If Honey and Nick are smart, they will address their issues before they find themselves the new Martha and George.",

The movie examines the complexities of marriage of a middle-aged couple, Martha and George. The play has a total of three acts which has been put together one after other. Edward Franklin Albee III (March 12, 1928 \u2013 September 16, 1016) was an American playwright known for his famous plays including Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and won Pultizer Prize for Drama. He had attracted theater attention by having scripted and published nine poems, eleven short stories, and essays.\n\nThe story is about two couples that are quite different at first sight \u2013 one used to each other and married for many years whereas the other one is newlyweds and getting to know each other. George and Martha who are the older couple whose relationship has gone through many ups and downs. They are drunk throughout the film. Despite of being together for so long, George and Martha don't have a good relationship they humiliate each other and have lost mutual respect towards each other. Nick and Honey visit the older couples house at two in the morning as they are the newly hired professors at the college where George teaches, and Martha's dad is the president at the same university. George and Martha had lost their son and I believe this is also one the reasons that their love had died, and they didn't know where to start from.\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Martha and George are excellent actors and have done an outstanding performance in the film.

The movie has great acting, great writing and the camerawork has perfected the cinematic. Overall, I highly recommend this movie and there is not even a moment that you'd get bored out of the film.

Martha embarrasses George in front of the couple by telling them a humiliating story about George which makes him even more furious. As the night goes on and the younger couple is ready to leave George offers them a ride home. However, this this leads to more events which builds up more tension between Martha and George. They are at a roadhouse where George cannot stand Martha anymore and attacks her. Nick pulls George off Martha and she and the couple drive away leaving George to walk home. When he is finally home he notices that the car has been crashed with Honey in the back seat extremely intoxicated. George notices Nick and Martha together in the bedroom and interrupts. He brings up how their son has died in a car accident. However, this is where the truth comes out and Nick comes to a realization that they were lying about their son the entire time and he leaves with Honey. George and Martha are unable to have children, but they secretly pretended to each other that they actually had a son and had a promise they would never tell anyone else about him. George telling Martha that their son was killed in a car accident resembles the fact that Martha broke their promise to each other. The film ends with George singing the song they were playing throughout the night which is the title of the film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, where Martha at the end says that she is afraid. \n\n\nThe film was definitely a huge success and was a tremendous break through due to the vulgarity of the verbal abuse and the profaneness behavior. During the 1960's, films like this were not being released due to the Production Code. However, the code was removed so this film could be released, which makes it that much more appealing to its audience at the time. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was considered such a success and achievement it was nominated for thirteen Academy Award nominees, and ended up winning five of those awards. Elizabeth Taylor won an Oscar for her dazzling and incredible acting as Martha. Overall, this film received remarkable and unforgettable recognition from its audience.\n\nIt has always been difficult for me to watch movies that came out before the 2000. However, this film was extremely easy for me to get into. I have always admired Elizabeth Taylor and the fact that she gained 30 pounds to fit the role of Martha demonstrates how well she can transform herself into Martha. Also, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton being married at the time in real life and on set makes it that much more intriguing to watch, especially because the movie portrays them verbally abusing each other and overall pushing each other to their limits. I definitely would recommend anyone to watch this film if they have not seen it before. You won't regret it! \n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is such a classic because it made an impact on the film industry due to its profanity and language. It's always interesting to watch and analyze movies like this because now a days movies are so much different. This film was extremely interesting to watch and I'm really glad I was able to learn about the background of it.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, directed by Mike Nichols, explores the tumultuous relationship between a couple. Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor, and George, played by Richard Burton, arrive home at 2 AM from a college staff party, when Martha informs George that she has invited over a couple from the party. Nick, played by George Segal, and Honey, played by Sandy Dennis, arrive at the house only to quickly become part of George and Martha's fighting. As more alcohol is consumed and the night goes on, the fighting continues to escalate as more touchy subjects are discussed.\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf was originally a play written by Edward Albee. In its transition to film, the movie faced some initial resistance due to the adult themes featured in it. However, due to changes being made in film ratings, it made it through censors with only minor changes. \n\nWhether or not you enjoyed Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, it's hard not to see how fantastic the acting is in the film. Throughout the film, you can really see as each character becomes more and more drunk. Both Martha and George are clearly drunk the whole film, but Nick and Honey both start sober and become drunk through the film. With Honey, she quickly succumbs to the alcohol, but Nick has a slower transition. Both George and Martha quickly flip between extreme outbursts and more calm moments. It's remarkable how effectively the actors capture these quick flips in mood. \n\nI personally did not enjoy Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, but I recognize it is not because the film did something wrong. This film is clearly looking to make a statement to married couples, or those who have been through difficult marriages. This is not a subject that I can effectively relate to, so I feel little connection to the character's struggles. However, I did clearly feel there emotions, and understood the each moment of the character's struggles. While the story was not for me, I still see how effectively it was communicated. \n\nI don't feel that Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Is a movie for everyone. This film will appeal to those looking for impressive acting performances, or those interested in extreme marital issues.",

            "content": "Films based on plays can be brilliant, Amadeus (1984), Tape (2001), or they can feel completely over the top and fail to translate well from the theatres of New York City or London. This film sort of falls in the middle for me because it goes on for far too long and belabors the points it makes but at the same time I did see moments of excellence shining through in the writing and performances. In the 53 years since it's release this film has built up quite the reputation and while I do not think that it is one of the 100 greatest films of all time I do acknowledge that it is a unique film. I wouldn't say that I think this film is worthy of recommendation because I don't really like it or even admire it that much but most people will probably find their way to it at some point in their lives.\n\nA drunken and mentally unstable Martha, Elizabeth Taylor, and her professor husband George, Richard Burton, terrorize young couple, Nick, George Segal, and Honey, Sandy Dennis, over a long night spent playing \u2018games'. It is slowly revealed that because Martha and George were incapable of having children they invented a fictional son and they use the idea of him to attack one another constantly. They also delve into the problems in the marriage of the younger couple as it is recognized that Nick was forced into the marriage and slightly resents his wealthy wife. Eventually Nick and Honey are allowed to go as it sets in just how sad and lonely Martha and George's lives are.\n\nThe most acclaimed part of the film are the performances as Taylor gives arguably her most iconic turn, Dennis won an Academy Award, Segal had his career launched and Burton solidified his status as one of the great actors of the 1960s. I didn't feel that their performances were extraordinary as I could have seen a lot of actors giving performances on the level that they do and possibly exceeding them but they are all good enough to keep us engaged. I think Burton works better with his long monologues than Taylor does as he brings a great physicality and comic defensiveness to the role where she can feel a little one note. I would have awarded Best Actress to Ida Kaminska for her performance in The Shop on Main Street (1965) and Best Supporting Actress to Geraldine Page for You're a Big Boy Now (1966) because she's possibly the weakest actor in the film.\n\nI like Mike Nichols as a director as I think that The Graduate (1967), Silkwood (1983) and Primary Colors (1998) are all very good films but I don't think this is his strongest work. He gets the claustrophobia and the tension just right in some scenes as Martha goes on a rambling monologue while George reads over her as the young couple watch on in fear. Where he loses it though is including so much of the play as this is a film that really doesn't have to be so long and I would have been much happier seeing a film that was only 90 minutes long, or even less. Most films could do with being cut down and seeing as how this film is so repetitive it really deserves that treatment. He brings more lightness and yet more introspection to The Graduate (1967) which is a much better film.\n\nI think that 1966 may have been one of the weakest years in cinema history because I don't like A Man for All Seasons (1966) and I feel lukewarm about this one therefore I can't say that this is one of those great or even good years in film. Maybe in a few years I will decide to watch this film again although I doubt I will and I will discover that it actually is as brilliant as everybody says it is and I have been missing out on true greatness by not seeing everything this film has to offer. I was left nonplussed which is disappointing when considering the regard that this film is held in and I find that rather unforgivable.",

            "content": "The adaptation to the screen of the play by Edward Albee is a violent experience, unpleasantly overwhelming, of an inclement intensity with the spectator who has agreed to enter the game of the theatricality of the staging. Who fears Virginia Woolf? (1966) was a sudden and triumphant start in film for Mike Nichols, who had gone from being one of the most successful comedians in American theater, in his duo with Elaine May, to one of his favorite directors.\n\nIn full theatrical glory, he accepted the proposal to adapt Albee to the cinema, reuniting on the set the star duo Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton, already duly married after his overexposure adulterous romance. The critical and commercial success of his debut (which garnered five Oscars out of a total of 13 nominations) opened for Nichols the race for which he would ultimately be more massively popular.\n\nThe staging of Who fears Virginia Woolf? it does not seek to disguise that it is a play directed by a theater man. The dialogues being the engine of the text, Nichols leaned on an already brilliant cast to make them glow. Otherwise, if something is worth the data, two of the Oscar cited were for Taylor and the secondary actress Sandy Dennis. But it is a play in the cinema, with the tools of cinema. To try to isolate the participants of the huis-clos, the Haskell Wexler camera (another Oscar more) resorts without complexes to the movements, insisting with the closed planes even more in the unsustainable emotional charge. The staging thus offers a space of artifice that becomes the only possibility of respite from the intensity of what is represented.\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\nThe unbearable dynamics of Taylor and Burton's couple, whose motor seems to work with alcohol, is even harder because of the manifest link with reality. But more than an exhibitionist gesture, it is a gesture of humility of two titans who want to show that they are because of their talent rather than their glamor. Here they strive to be ugly, with characters taking refuge from their poignant vulnerability behind a shield of meanness, cruelty and baseness. In the splendor of their physical attractiveness, the actors compose through decadence, suppressing all the grace of their beauty to embody bodies -and souls- in disgrace. George and Martha live in that insufferably closed universe of American suburban colleges. He is a history teacher, but his career has been far less dazzling than expected. She is the daughter of the president of the university, an omnipresent detail in the relationship.\n\nThat night (because everything happens during one night), when they return late from a party at the home of the father-boss, she announces that they have guests, that her father asked her to distract a young couple newly installed on campus. When Nick and Honey appear (George Segal and Sandy Dennis), they are in the middle of the battlefield. If Martha tries to be detestable, George does not settle into the position of victim but tries to equalize his level. Soon the possible vision - which would allow him to take sides and thus to know where he is standing - of him as the reasonable element, attacked by the gratuitous malice of his wife, is annulled. No, no one wants to be a victim, but players of a game in which they will do anything to win.\n\nThe guests, also quite drunk (before the four decidedly drunk), unbalance and rebalance the game, and are potentially almost as perverse as their hosts, in a permanent mutation of rivalries and complicities that no one seems to control. A theme crosses everything and concentrates the greatest tension: the son to which they allude from the beginning in a threatening tone. The son who, although they do not know where he is, thinks that he will appear the next day to celebrate his sixteen years. The son that seems to be the only taboo in his dirty war where every attack is allowed.\n\nDuring an entire night (131 minutes of film) punctuated by various crises, dialogues, monologues and explosions, the tension barely relents for a moment before starting again. The rhythm is not made to accommodate the viewer and allow a real relaxation, but to make him feel the discomfort. In one of her hardest roles as a castrating woman, Elizabeth Taylor shines with the ferocity, the noxiousness and the hypnotic fire of an erupting volcano, and naturally transforms into the center of gravitation of the sick microcosm.",

The film centers around a middle aged married couple, namely George (played by Richard Burton) and Martha (played by Elizabeth Taylor). The screenplay was based on an adaptation of the play by the same name, written by Edward Albee. Taylor, who depicts the wife Martha, shocks the audience with her unpredictable temperament towards the husband George who, on the other hand, lands his jabs through a series of backhanded and passive-aggressive comments aimed at back  his wife. The two continuously go after each other during a late night drinking session with a colleague from the college George works at and his wife. The couples verbal volatility is all the more spurred on by their terrible drinking habits, which enable the two to berate each other over their failing marriage. Martha, the daughter of the president the university, resents George for his inability to succeed at the university. The remainder of the film track George and Martha, alongside their younger coupled friends, as the group examines the negative sides of marriage mainly through extended dialogue. \nBy showing the failing marriage of George and Martha alongside their younger counterparts, Nichol\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s highlights the challenges that uniquely face older married couples. This dialogue structure constantly reinforces how jaded George and Martha have become over the years, juxtaposed against the doe-eyed nature of the younger couple\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s marriage. The nature of the film\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s warning message regarding marriage is further aided by the simplistic, black and white editing style.

George shortly later finds out that Martha invited guests over for that night whom are new faculty members.  Once Nick and Honey arrive at the home, the mood immediately becomes unsettling and everyone begins to become intoxicated.  After just a short while of George and Martha bickering, Nick and Honey are tempted to leave but George insists against that.  After that the two couples continue to talk and get to know each other a little better followed by each question and conversation.  There are two things the viewer feels while watching the film up to this point, the sense that Martha has a crush on Nick and George and Martha should not be married.  In the middle of dancing and singing, Honey gets sick and Martha follows.  Everyone is in the home at this point is extremely intoxicated.  While Honey lays on the kitchen floor, passed out drunk and George helping her, Martha and Nick start hooking up.  After the hook up rooms into the other room, George sits with his drink and imagines that a message came that his son has just died.  After Nick failed to perform in the bedroom, Martha is irritated and George delvers the news.  Martha, even more enflamed than the failed affair, screamed at George that was not his decision to make.  George snapped back telling her that she cheated and told Nick and Honey about their son.  At which point Nick knows that the son has been made up all along.  Nick and Honey proceeds to leave George and Martha without any more imaginations of their beloved, made up, son. \n\n\nProduction highlights (positive or negative):\n\nThe highlight of this film was definitely the climax.  This is when George tried to strangle Martha in front of Nick and Honey.  All intoxicated of course, this shows how drunk or sober the couple was it never dulled their hatred for each other. \n\nOverall Recommendation:\n\nI would recommend this movie to someone or a couple who is looking for a classic, black and white, film.  It was honestly a great film and the acting was superb.  \n\nConclusion: \n\nI really liked this film.  Mostly due to the fact the camera angles changed all the time, mostly in close shots.  This gave me an exciting feeling throughout the duration of the film.",

The film was an adaptation of the play \u00e2~Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u00e2(TM) authored by Edward Albee. It first aired in 1966. The movie starts off with a married couple in their 40s named George and Martha, walking down the road to their house late at night. George, played by Richard Burton, and Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor are constantly arguing throughout every scene of the film. George is a history professor at a University in a city called New Carthage. Martha\u00e2(TM)s father is the president of the same University. One evening after getting home from a faculty party late at night, Martha alerts George as he is getting ready for bed that they are having guests over shortly. Little to George\u00e2(TM)s knowledge, Martha invited over a young new biology professor and his wife to their house, whom she met briefly earlier in the evening. As they are waiting for their guests, Martha and George continue to fight and argue over seemingly random topics; such as reminding her the name of a famous film. Martha is a very aggressive outspoken rude woman, which is only perpetuated by her excessive drinking. She seems to be seeking conflict with almost every word she speaks. Which after a certain point is only met with aggression from her husband as a response to her incendiary comments to him. The couple arrives shortly after notifying George of their pending guests. Nick is a young biology professor played by George Segal. His wife Honey, is played by Sandy Dennis. Nick is a tall hansom 28 year old whom Martha finds attractive. The reason for her inviting them over remains unclear. Honey, Nick\u00e2(TM)s wife is a frail 26 year old woman. Immediately after they arrive, large cocktails are made for them. Over the next several scenes there is a tremendous amount of banter between Martha and George which make Nick and Honey uncomfortable. As they slowly get more drunk the hysterics rise further. \n\nGeorge and Martha are playing out some strange game within their relationship fueled by anger, while using this couple as a conduit. Slowly this seemingly nice young couple is pulled into George and Martha\u00e2(TM)s drama. Martha continues to flirt with Nick while his wife has become very intoxicated. George decides to dance with Honey spinning her around to the point that she has to vomit, and runs to the bathroom. Martha goes to take care of Honey in the bathroom while Nick and George play mind games and have malicious conversations in the backyard while drinking bourbon. George is able to learn more about Nick, so that he may use this information against him later. George is even upfront yet tricky about his intentions while talking with Nick. Martha yells out the front door about making coffee, George and Nick come back into the house after exchanging curses to each other. Once they arrive back inside, Honey is in the hallway telling them that Martha has gone upstairs to change into something more comfortable. Additionally, Honey asks George about his son, whom Martha told Honey about, explicitly against Georges request earlier in the night. This sparks something in George where he is now willing to play the \u00e2~game\u00e2(TM) Martha is trying to win at. \n\nOnce Martha comes downstairs she is all dressed up to go out. After several arguments between everyone it is decided that they will offer Nick and Honey a ride home. George is very drunk at this point and swerves while driving them home. The subject of dancing comes up in the car and they drive passed a sign of a bar which has music and dancing. Further arguments occur in the car before they decide to go for some dancing and one drink. Once they arrive at the bar Honey and George sit down and have a drink while Nick and Martha dance inappropriately. Martha continues over the whole film to give George a very hard time and often points out failures and inadequacies he has in her eyes. While they are at the bar dancing Martha decides to tell everyone about a book George attempted to publish, but her father prevented its publication. This highly embarrassing moment to George pushes him passed the edge as he pleads with her not to talk about the subject. Everyone gets into a huge argument as tensions rise. George in retaliation to Martha\u00e2(TM)s actions verbally responds by telling everyone the private story he was able to get from Nick when he was drunk in the backyard. This story is about Honey and Nicks marriage, and is very upsetting to Honey. Nick storms out of the bar after Honey as they try and walk home from the bar. Martha and George continue arguing till they declare they are now in a \u00e2full war\u00e2? against each other. Martha runs for the car and drives off after Nick and Honey, leaving George to walk home. Martha catches up with the couple and drives them back to her house. George finally arrives back at his house to find Honey laying on the lawn outside while Nick and Martha commit adultery upstairs.\nCONT...",

Things continue to spiral downwards all night and eventually a major truth bomb gets dropped about George and Martha\u00e2(TM)s son. \u00e2Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u00e2(TM) was a highly enjoyable film. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton give amazing performances. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are a real married couple and that relationship really helps them perform to the best of their abilities in this film. The monologuing in \u00e2Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u00e2? is top notch. This was a film I did not think I was going to enjoy but the constant back and forth of the deranged couple kept me engaged the whole time. This film deserves every single award that it has received. I would recommend this movie to any one that wants to watch a highly entertaining film that has a great combo of drama and sarcastic comedy.",

The film is based on Edward Albee\u00e2(TM)s play, which takes place primarily in the living room of married couple George and Martha. After attending a faculty party, Martha tells George that she has invited George\u00e2(TM)s co-worker Nick and his wife Honey back to the house for drinks. Upon their arrival, the chaos begins as both Martha and George disregard the fact that they have company and consistently take jabs at each other and bicker in-front of them. Their dysfunctional, toxic relationship is further fueled by the excessive amount of alcohol they consume \u00e2\" a recipe for disaster. Through late into evening, matters only get worse. George makes several comments to Nick to upset him, while Honey is incredibly intoxicated and lacks complete awareness for everything that\u00e2(TM)s going on around her. In all the chaos that takes place throughout the long evening, there are two significant events that take place that I think are really symbolic of how toxic Martha and George\u00e2(TM)s relationship is: 1. The couple tells their company that they have a son which is far from the truth and a topic that to both is very sensitive. In all reality, this is a story that they have made up due to their infertility. 2. After a really bad fight at the bar, Martha drives off in a rage with Nick and intoxicated Honey. However, back at the house, the flirting between Nick and Martha lead to them having extramarital affairs. Once George makes it back to the house, he realizes what is taking place and in revenge, he later tells Martha in-front of Nick and Honey that their son is dead. Something that seems to upset Martha very much. \n\nIn the end, despite all the drama and fighting that has taken place Martha admits that the only man that has truly made her happy is indeed George. The only one that accepts her the way she is, is good to her and even when she does not want to be happy, he makes her happy. A clear depiction of a couple that is madly in love but are completely wrong for being together and bring the worse out of each other.\n\nProduction Highlights:\n\nIn doing some research on the background and production of this film, the best production highlight is how Elizabeth Taylor and Mike Burton were able to truly deliver an incredible performance of their characters. Based on the fact that they were married when this was filmed, their previous relationship and love for alcohol, it\u00e2(TM)s clear that all these factors contributed to such stellar performance on both of their parts. I also think that the fact that the movie was filmed in black and white for the sole purpose for emphasizing the darkness of Martha and George\u00e2(TM)s relationship and the events that took place was pure genius!!! Finally, in most of the scenes where George and Martha fight, I noticed that the camera would zoom into each character to capture the raw emotion and make an impact on the viewer. For example, in the beginning of the movie when Martha jumps on George and she is signing \u00e2Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Wolfe?\u00e2? she has very exaggerated movements and the camera moves in and we can see how drunk and obnoxious she\u00e2(TM)s being. The same happens towards the end when George gets home and as he stars laughing sarcastically, he walks back out and starts crying. Other highlights include, the facts that Elizabeth Taylor put on 20lbs to play the part and adjusted her tone of voice to sound annoying, intoxicated, obnoxious and to an extent evil-like. All great ideas by the production team.\n\nOverall Recommendation/Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this movie. It\u00e2(TM)s very clear to see why this movie won 5 Oscars and was nominated for 8 others. Something that is unheard of. Although the story line is quite dramatic and dark, in all reality I think it\u00e2(TM)s something that many of the audience can relate to one way or another. Elizabeth Taylor is absolutely incredible, and once again proves what an outstanding actress she was. If the movie is this good, I would love to see Edward Albee\u00e2(TM)s play in theater. I think it\u00e2(TM)s definitely something to watch.",

            "content": "The film is directed by Mike Nichols and the screenwriter is Ernest Lehman, but the film is based on Edward Albee's stage play. The main actors are Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, produced in the United States. The main plot of the film is that the young couple came to George and Martha to be a guest, portraying the family conflict between George and Martha, and the contradictions between George and Nick and Nick and Honey. The film has a lot of highlights: 1. Elizabeth Taylor's outstanding acting, her performance is very exciting. 2. The film won 13 Oscar nominations and is the only film in history that has been fully nominated. 3. The film's director is the director of \"Graduate\". The film was launched in 1966. The \"Graduate\" was launched in 1967. The director twice nominated Oscar for best director and won the best director in two years. I am very impressed with him. I think that this film, and graduates, have a connection between the two, both of which show a kind of nothingness and confusion. Whether in this movie, the child that Martha and George fantasized, or Dustin Hoffman, after getting married and sitting in the car in the new year, turned from laughter to confusion, which profoundly showed a kind of nothingness. The emptiness of marriage. Because this film is a stage play adaptation, there is a strong sense of stage, which combines a sense of absurdity. The child in this fantasy is a bit like Godot in Waiting for Godot, also as Hitchcock said. MacGuffin. The Martha are in a sense of oppression, which is related to the age of the film in 1966, and 1966 is the peak of the Cold War. Therefore, the social collective subconscious has a sense of oppression, which is also shown in the film works. In this movie, there is a kind of conflict, sarcasm in marriage and violence in speech; breaking all the good illusions into the early morning. Under the sane appearance, all the characters have collapsed at the end. I generally recommend this movie, which is a movie that people who consider marriage should watch.",

            "content": "Director:  Mike Nichols\nWriter/Producer:  Ernest Lehman\nKey Players:  Richard Burton (George), Elizabeth Taylor (Martha), George Segal (Nick), Sandy Dennis (Honey)\nBased on:  Edward Albee's Tony-Award 1962 play\n\nGet ready for a front row seat in the living room of George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), the principal characters and actors in the movie Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf directed by Mike Nichols in 1966. From the start of the movie there is obvious tension between the couple, George, a history professor, and Martha, his wife and the daughter of the President at the college where George teaches.  As the couple returns home from a faculty event speaking loudly and experiencing difficulties walking - all signs of already having a bit too much to drink, the other shoe drops when Martha surprises George with the news that she invited a young couple, Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) over for drinks.  Nick is a tall, blonde, handsome, intelligent, and well-educated new biology professor who in his eagerness to climb the academia ladder as fast as possible, is viewed as a threat by George both professionally and personally.  His wife, Honey, the daughter of a preacher who married Nick under the claim of a false pregnancy, appears to be in la-la land not understanding the conversations and wishing to remain in denial of the night's events.  George and Martha, perceived as well-mannered hosts, lose control of their inhibitions and go literally at each other's throats in front of the young couple.  This one-night of casual drinks at 2am in the morning quickly turns into turmoil as George and Martha create a hostile and uncomfortable environment for their guests.  Determined to play a series of games, George and Martha's irrational and drunken behaviors will keep you wondering how their antics and games will end and who in the room will be the next casualty as each of the couple's most inner secrets come to light.  Some of the scenes show both George and Martha yelling, insulting, and degrading each other where the signs of an unhappy, stressed, troubled couple rise to crumble the illusion of their perceived happy marriage.  There is more violence than loving moments as George and Martha insult each other and often times swear and use euphemisms with sexual undertones inappropriate for adolescents.  Nichols' use of close and angled shots captures the perturbed beaten faces of the actors in pain and disarray as voices get loud and continue to rise as George and Martha become violent with each other. Filmed in the 1960's, it is a black and white picture where lighting is dark and characters are visible by moonlight or a light pole when outside. Elizabeth Taylor, a beautiful and highly visible actor at the time of filming, transforms into a frumpy older woman who definitely has more grit and teeth than her awkwardly beaten down, submissive husband with pent up anger ready to be let out.  The off-screen power couple bring all their might to the screen resulting in many accolades and a movie which is one for the books of history.  Elizabeth Taylor won an Academy Award.  The movie, based on Edward Albee's 1962 play, earned him a Tony Award in 1962.  Subsequently, Mike Nichols earned an Academy Award in the Best Director category.  A love-hate relationship played out in a messy living room and in the presence of a younger couple which is worth grabbing a seat for so that you can determine for yourself who is really afraid of Virginia Woolf - Nichols, Taylor and Burton do not disappoint!

            "content": "Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a brilliant film adaptation of Edward Albee\u00e2(TM)s original play. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton embraced the characters of Martha and George in a way that was pivotal for character development on screen. It is clear that the fact that Taylor and Burton were married in real life contributed to the way they were able to bicker and interact on screen. The choice to only have four characters throughout the entire film makes the audience focus in on the dynamics, interactions, and development between each and of each character. We see Martha and George invite over the other two characters, Nick and Honey to their home. This then begins the interactions that portray the unhappy, bickering, ugly couple that is George and Martha when compared to younger, more in love couple Nick and Honey. The film continues through these interactions, where Martha and George get their guests caught up more and more with their antics, fights, and drama between each other. \nFilm director Mike Nichols did an incredible job making a somewhat lacking for action film feel full of action. This film is essentially just the interactions between the four characters we see, but delves deep into their development, issues, and dramas that becomes incredibly exciting and puts you on the edge of your seat since the characters have so much going on. Nichols had impeccable directing techniques with this film, especially the way certain shots were films; they added an extra layer of chaos and drama to the story. This film also takes on a very controversial aspect for its time that adds to the brilliance of the film. There was a lot of swearing, fighting, and drama that were very controversial with the audiences. This film embraces that women can be just as abusive and fight just as much as men can. This aspect from having Martha have the lines such as \u00e2goddamn you\u00e2? really embraced the resentment and abuse Martha would have towards her husband. This film also was shot in black and white, which adds to why it is so well done. The black and white adds an aspect to force the audience to focus on the characters and reflects the feelings of the characters rather than having flashy colors and surroundings that do not embrace this.\nOverall, the storyline, direction, and especially acting of this film made it what it is; an incredibly brilliant and well done film that has impeccable character development and interactions that do not bore the audience.",

            "content": "Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Woolf showcases the physically and emotionally violent and manipulative behaviors of couple Martha and George, and its effects on their guests Honey and Nick. \nThe threadline of George\u00e2(TM)s instability in Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Woolf was consistent in stylistic choices, which I enjoyed very much. His instability is shown throughout the film in swirling motions. First, the light fixture in the closet swirls around his head while he searches for the fake gun. The second time this is seen, he spins around on the swing while he speaks to Nick incoherently. The final time this is shown is when he begins walking back to his house after Martha abandons him, with shadows moving over his face in a visually uncomfortable way. The consistency of this theme of swirling equating to instability in George\u00e2(TM)s character was wonderful to see. It allowed me to acquire an insight on when George was unstable. I will also mention that this was portrayed so nicely and with such great clarity due to the great cinematography seen in those instances, as well as throughout the film.\nAnother stylistic choice I really like in this film is the use of breaking the 4th wall. I found this film\u00e2(TM)s use of this tool to be very clever and gripping. I enjoyed the fact that it was always George breaking the 4th wall, and that as the movie progressed he addressed the audience more directly. I found it really wonderful how he walked toward the camera in one of these instances. I also enjoyed that he looked, very informally, to the camera to explain to us that things were going as he thought they would be. I have to say, this may have been my favorite thing about the film. \nI loved that there was great thought put into the placement of people and props. For instance, I found it very nice that Martha said \u00e2what a dump\u00e2? and immediately following this she is seen tossing things around and therein creating her own disorganization, An instance of my likeness of the placement of people is when Martha is seen at the beginning of the film talking to George (as opposed to talking with him) while sitting very high up on the cabinet. Later in the film, George is seen sitting above Martha while she is on the couch and he is sitting on the side of the couch, These thoughtful placements of people and props aided in this feeling of things coming full circle and of questions being answered without being spoken about. \nAnother instance of intentional placement that I enjoyed was the placement of the camera behind characters. This happens twice in the film, and in both instances, it is very gripping. I provided the sense that I was seeing what they were seeing; that I was experiencing what they were, as opposed to watching what they were doing. When Martha is very drunk, I saw blurry, unstable camerawork that showcased how drunk she was. \nI really enjoyed that there was a lack of filmscore. I found that this was in line with Edward Albee\u00e2(TM)s preference that he doesn\u00e2(TM)t want to be told how to react to things through music. I do agree with Albee that the use of film score at the final scene of the film created a sentimental atmosphere, which was contrary to the intent of the writing. If anything, I found that moment to possess a great irony as a result of the film score. \nI liked that the lack of film score allowed for moments, such as is seen in the ballroom, to be really powerful. I found the writing to be wonderful here. Instead of having the film score guide my reaction to what I saw, I heard the shouting of what was happening in one word. Honey shouted \u00e2violence!\u00e2?, Martha proclaimed \u00e2we\u00e2(TM)re quiet now\u00e2?, George stated \u00e2total war\u00e2?, and Honey said \u00e2bells ringing.\u00e2? It gave me the impression that there was a new chapter beginning and these words were the titles of them. \nI enjoyed viewing this film very much. I did not find that this film showcased an enduring love or a happy ending. I found that, at the final scene, these characters were reflecting on their behaviors together, and that their bond lied there in their shared disturbed nature.",

            "content": "Who is Afraid of Virginia Wolf is a brilliant film centered on the dangers of illusion that was directed by Mike Nichols. The screenplay was written by Earnest Lehman and it was produced by Edward Albee. The two stars of the film are Elizabeth Taylor, who played Martha and Richard Burton as George. These two actors were a real-life couple, which is how they were able to channel raw emotion into their performances. They truly put on a show with their portrayal of how emotional dependence can ignite a distorted reality. What do I mean by this? Well, it all starts one disturbing night when the couple Martha and George return home from a faculty party. They invite another couple Nick and Honey over for drinks. Over the course of the night, Martha and George begin to go at it, verbally abusing one another, Martha violently verbally attacking her guests as well. At first, Nick and Honey seem horrified, but with alcohol in their systems, begin to mirror Martha and George\u00e2(TM)s behavior, as repressed emotions of the past come out. \n\nThey begin to play games with Nick and Honey, which truly reveal the troubling reality of their psyches.  The underlying issue and explosion erupts when talking about Martha and George\u00e2(TM)s imaginary son Nick, whose birthday is the next day. The production highlight for me was when George reveals to Martha that Nick is dead; this is the climax of the film. Here, we see a change in demeanor and their illusion is crushed. It is very well acted. It helped create an analysis for one of the main themes in the film, which is the struggle between reality and illusion. In my opinion, it is the illusion of their son Nick that keeps George and Martha\u00e2(TM)s marriage alive. It is hard to decipher what is reality and what is an illusion throughout the film because to Martha and George, they really believe the illusion, which makes the audience believe as well. There is also a conflict of love and hate. The couple really seem to hate each other, with few moments of love and tenderness throughout the entire film. Although, we do see the love still sometimes, which says something. I am still trying to figure out if it is love or just them needing each other. This movie has won many awards in the industry, so I would definitely recommend checking it out. But, just know that you\u00e2(TM)re in for immense vulgarity and indescribable weirdness.",

            "content": "- Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? I am. -\n\nOkay, so here's the thing, I studied physical education at university. I know, right? Weird choice for someone deeply obsessed with film. After two years of studying the wrong thing, I abruptly quit physical education and studied film and media instead. And excitingly, after making that decision, I was then allowed in the film archive section of the university library. This was all before Netflix, when we still had DVDs.\n\nOn the days that I wasn't drinking studying, I would go to the top floor and slowly make my way through all of the classic films. It didn't matter if they had anything to do with my film classes, I watched as many as I could. That's when I stumbled upon Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and I absolutely lost my mind.\nWhat a masterpiece! And because I believe it is so brilliant, I need to focus on only a couple of its best features, otherwise, I will totally blow out my word count.\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was originally a play written by Edward Albee in 1965. It was then adapted into a film, directed by Mike Nichols and it stars the real life married couple Elizabeth Taylor (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) and Richard Burton (Cleopatra). Burton plays George, an associate professor of history, and Taylor plays Martha, his wife and the daughter of the president of the university.\n\nAfter a party one night, Martha invites an attractive young couple back to their house for drinks because \"daddy said we should be nice to them\".  From there, the night unfolds from inner to exterior turmoil for the four featured characters. I felt like I was being dragged kicking and screaming into a fight and I felt super fucken uncomfortable about the whole thing.\n\nOut of all four characters, it was Martha that captured my attention from beginning to devastating end. I credit Elizabeth Taylor for not only making Martha unforgettable but making her one of the most fascinatingly unlikeable and misunderstood characters ever to grace the silver screen.\n\nTaylor was 32 years old at the time and with prosthetics, an added 30 pounds of weight, and a deepened voice, she encapsulated a 52 year old Martha. It was such a transformation from being one of the most beautiful women in the world.\n\nI remember thinking that even though she was caked in makeup and prosthetics, she couldn't hide her famous eyes. And as much as I wanted to lose Elizabeth Taylor in her character, it was impossible to completely forget her. This truthfully added a layer of authenticity to the character of Martha because, in reality, Elizabeth Taylor was an alcoholic who often fought with her husband and co-star.\n\nSo out of all the inspiring women-protagonists in the world, why do I love a drunken, verbally abusive, manipulative woman? Because simply, she was a woman in pain. We can all relate to pain. The difference is how we react to it.\n\nMartha chose a path of bitterness and regret, and she took it out on her husband, as he did with her. And not to give away too much, it is the pain that comforted her. This \"thing\" became the one good thing in her life that helped her to continue living.\n\nSo even though I detested her character, I couldn't really judge her choices. I can't judge someone on how they deal with their pain. But I can learn from it. I can learn who I don't want to become. And so this character of Martha is truly inspirational in the best way. She makes me not want to be like her.\n\nElizabeth Taylor won a second Oscar for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? And she said that her performance as Martha was the best of her career. Not all women-protagonists have to be heroines for us to connect with them. They can be the misfits and anti-heroes of the stories as well. They can be the forgotten house-wives in an unhappy marriage. Those are the characters that can shake you and dishevel whatever safe place you have inside you.  \n\nFor me, Martha is one of the most brilliantly written characters I have read and seen. One of my favorite lines in the film is said by Martha, \"I am George, I am\". It will make absolutely no sense for someone who hasn't seen Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? but when you do watch it, I want you to focus on the weight those words have for Martha. Just feel how everything in the two and half hours of sheer debauchery, verbal and physical abuse led to these words having so much resonance and how brilliantly Taylor delivers them.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/whos-afraid-of-virginia-woolf, and was written by Jules Raynes.

Burton and Taylor spit daggers at one another, each sharper and shriller than the last - the sense of history and sheer bitterness between their characters evoking an air of authenticity seldom seen on screen.\n\nBut Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is much more than a showcase for some of cinema's best acting and bitterest dialogue. In fact, the note-perfect coupling of Taylor and Burton is but a bonus factor in a film that offers an eerie exploration of the link between drunkenness and insanity, punching as opposed to poking the creaky boundary between the two at every opportunity.\n\nOn the surface, Nichols' film is a piercing theatrical melodrama. Underneath, it is a psychological thriller, a ghost story, a black comedy, a brutal romance and more. In fact, one might argue that the film offers one of the richest, most honest and resonating commentaries on the age-old concept of true love that the screen has ever seen.",

            "content": "Mike Nichols' original masterpiece, as much a horror as it was a comedy and a literary tragedy. This movie forced American cinema to grow up and embrace not only darker subtext and more profane subject mater, but also morally ambiguous concepts.  While I'm sure Edward Albee didn't invent literary comprehension on screen, the creative team here certainly were the first to pioneer the concept to Hollywood - still stuck in the golden era.\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was not only controversial for its day (one of the movies that helped bury the Hayes Code) but also a wonderfully warped mind trip that is still shocking almost 50 years after the fact. The movie has multiple layers of depraved entertainment; it is a marriage farce, a battle of old time wits (Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor at their most imprudent), a coarse perspective of relationship counseling, and of course, it has a plot twist so brutal, you'll never play games at the dinner table again. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? has two things going for it: it's based on a play by Edward Albee (the best scripted films are always based on plays) and it's directed by Mike Nichols who has an enormous sensitivity when he's directing couples on screen. This PG rated drama is still the most disturbed thing you'll see in any given month.\n\nWhat I Learned: I really think Edward Albee and Mike Nichols' creation is where I got some of my harsh and caustic wit. Of course, I always thought really disturbed and funny things in my own head, but until Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf I never knew it could be so deliciously fun to torment people with using only your quick-witted mind. There was great sadism in this sarcasm and it helped me realize there is no need to bite your tongue-at least not in art.",

It has the unavoidable stage to screen difficulty of containing way too much dialogue shooting off in all directions. It works well in the theatre when you're more able to absorb yourself into the situation, but in the cinema its frustratingly alienating, and ramps up the films runtime to over 2 hours. The arguments, which drive the entire plot, are acidic, deeply personal and must've been hugely shocking at the time. It's a lot tamer nowadays, full of barbs you'll see every day on all the worst realty TV shows. But what makes the whole experience so effective is the acting. All 4 principle actors are so natural that you'd never think they were acting, particularly Elizabeth Taylor, who throws her drunken, bitter weight around in a career-defining performance. It's principle problem, as I've hinted at before, is that its non-stop verbal sparring becomes wearisome about half an hour before the credits roll, and if only some of the dialogue had been cut it would be much better to watch. With that said, it's a vicious examination of marital discord and gender politics, and it's stood the test of time on the strength of its acting, directing and acerbic wit.",

When I saw this on DirecTV from TCM, I was thinking about how I've heard about this movie for a while, but I haven't got to see it for the first time, especially since it's the first film from director Mike Nichols. So with no information, I just decide to watch it, and was deeply surprised of what I gotten out of it. All of the actors gave a powerhouse performance as all of them did a fantastic job as they give a different part of their own and just steal the show from what they got, especially since the movie is all about those four, so they have to give it all they need to get. The writing by Ernest Lehman is at it's A game as it's spot-on, and it feels more natural for the fact that Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were married at the time. The movie can go in two ways, whether it be a dark comedy about two couples going at each other, or a drama that feels like a horror from how relatable it is from couples that might act like this, and it shows it from both sides as it has some dark humor in it that's funny, or it can be uncomfortable in an unnerving way that does way better at portraying argument couples than This is 40 as you were suppose to like those characters that it feels really awkward to see them argue when they can be a good couple, in this, the beginning starts with them arguing already, but the tone keeps it consistent with the film that it's actually being serious about where it's going, and the viewers liking them or not is their own choice, the movie wasn't leaning towards one side. It interesting to hear them curse so much as during the old days of cinema, there wasn't much of them saying those kind of profanity because there's a tight relationship going on with the MPAA about it. I was interested in what's going on with their arguments, and I have learn about the characters as it goes on. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a fantastic film that it really showcases the acting in this that's thanks to the direction by the late Mike Nichols.",

It's the kind of movie they should show to couples planning a divorce, not to talk them out of it, but so they can appreciate how annoying it is when they bicker in front of other people. I suppose the acting is good, in between the screaming and drunken rambling. I suppose there's artistry in capturing on film something so obnoxious, but I don't have the proper mentality to appreciate it. It doesn't help that the way they talk to one another is so artificial and scripted. This isn't how real people interact, and it certainly wouldn't be how they'd interact under the extreme influences of alcohol. Even the most convincing performance in the world doesn't feel genuine when I can see the dialogue written out on a script page, but can't imagine them coming from someone's lips. This is clearly a stage play translated to screen, by some writer who understands emotions but not how real people express them. I'm not sure if the climax of all this screaming is intended to be a surprise, but I saw it coming hours before they verbalized it. Perhaps if anything of significance happened in this film it would have interested me at least slightly, but imagine my surprise when I realized it was merely 2 hours of bickering. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is only for the masochistic person who enjoys watching the demise of another couples' relationship. I was delighted when it ended.",

They're arm-in-arm and seemingly all is quiet and right with the world.  The second the action starts, when Liz Taylor flicks on the light and we begin hearing her talk with Richard Burton, we know all is definitely not right.  And thus begins 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'.\n\nThe two play a college history professor and his wife, who is also the dean's daughter, and we quickly come to know that they are (a) very unhappy and frustrated with one another, (b) highly blunt and sarcastic in expressing this, and (c) functioning alcoholics.  The first scene which lasts something like 50 minutes and has a younger professor and his wife (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) coming over to drinks is absolutely stunning.  The script and Taylor and Burton's performances are outstanding.   Humiliation, flirting with the opposite sex, telling stories and confusing \"truth and illusion\" to play mind games with the other are the order of the day, and the two serve it up again and again in ways which may make your jaw drop.   \n\nThe movie is minimalistic in the sense that it only has these four major characters, two extremely minor characters (who briefly appear when they visit a roadside bar), and it all takes place in a single night, mostly in their home.   However, the performances are explosive and 'larger than life'.  Taylor in particular really put herself out there, because let's face it, putting on weight and acting like a loud, cheap, bully is far more dangerous for a woman than it is for a man.  Images of the SNL sketch from a decade later may come to your mind as she munches on a chicken leg and then carelessly tosses the bone back on the plate in the fridge.  She is absolutely exceptional, and was worthy of the Academy Award she received.  I was also reminded of the power in some of Jennifer Lawrence's recent performances as I watched her, but Taylor takes it to another level.  Burton is also fantastic, trying to remain intellectual and appear above it all, but displaying a frustrated rage within and constantly needling all the three of the other characters.  When he goes out for the rifle in the garage as Taylor is telling an embarrassing story about him and returns with it, we feel serious tension, and I thought first-time director Mike Nichols did a great job here and throughout the movie.\n\nIt loses a teeny bit of momentum towards the middle, and I have to say, the story behind their child, whose apparent death seems to be an explanation for why they've gone a bit kooky, but who has been an imaginary child all along, does not ring true, at least in the emotions it evokes out of each of them.  While it's a symbol of an unrealized dream they share, just as Burton's failure to advance in the hierarchy at the college is, to me this is a weakness in the original play.  The ending, which as them tenderly resigned to one another despite all that bickering and fighting (and bottle breaking, and choking!), is powerful nonetheless.  It's not exactly a feel-good movie, but it's one that will stir you.",

Played to perfection by the four cast members, including Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, you can't help but feel like you are watching the actions of two actual drunk couples. Some of the one liners involved within their chemistry makes you physically laugh aloud forcing you to pay attention as they come out of no where. Just as the scene quietens downs, it doesn't take long for one character to throw a line towards another to get the characters and the viewers alert.\nThe story may not have any form of dramatic conclusion or heavy narrative, but the 2 hours are well spent if it means witnessing the arguments and remarks between an unhappy couple and their new 'friends'.",

            "content": "I had no idea what to expect from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but considering that it was the winner of multiple Academy Awards, it would most likely be a good film.\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? does not deviate far from its stage roots at all. It maintains the appropriate dramatisation of the material and keeps it within a small scale. Everything feels like a stage production but has the credibility and technical qualities of a film.\nTo simplify what I'm saying, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? feels like a stage production because it takes place within few sets and locations which feel genuine and embody the theatrical style of the original play at the same time. Also, the cinematography tends to film things from the audience's perspective which allows a third person view of things, and a lot of the shots are long ones instead of quick ones combined with a lot of editing. The scenery in the film is great and the cinematography captures every inch of it at a nice slow moving pace. The cinematography shifts its focus at a nice speed as well and it constantly keeps things at an interesting perspective.\nAnd as well as capturing the appropriate theatrical style of the film from a technical perspective, it does it from a storytelling perspective just as well because director Mike Nichols ensures that the dramatisation of the story stays true to its roots and that the actors follow on with the same dramatic style, and it is fairly impressive to say that this is his debut as a director of films.\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? has a simple story full of a lot of complex characters attempting to deal with a changing world and the drama that causes them to slowly disintegrate, and thanks to Mike Nichols' handling of the material it proves to be a well paced dramatic feature which harnesses all of his potential and serves as a strong adaptation of the play. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? finds the fine line between being a cinematic piece and a stage production thanks to his careful direction, and the dramatic effect of the story ends up remaining as strong as the script and renders Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? a strong dramatic experience which is very character-oriented while keeping its focus very broad.\nAs a largely theatrical film, the importance in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? mostly rests on the performances of the cast which are excellent, particularly the Academy Award winning performance of legendary actress Elizabeth Taylor.\nElizabeth Taylor is unrecognisable for her role in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. As she gained 30 pounds for the role and reinvented her look, she doesn't embody the woman deemed the most beautiful woman in the world at the time of the film and instead adopts the look of a simple attractive woman of age, an everywoman. She is recognisable for her role as an actress in the film because her dramatic strength as an actress just steals the screen. Her sharp and dramatic line delivery is matched only by the way she keeps her physicality in tune with her and expresses a lot of her emotions through her facial gestures. She is simply a screen-stealer in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and it is a role significantly different to many others she has taken on. Yet it is one of the greatest of her career, and her strength as a lead actress has done nothing but grow over the years. The genuine way she interacts with the surrounding cast members is incredible, particularly with Richard Burton as their chemistry feels genuine. It is likely that this is true because of the fact that the two shared a complicated relationship in real life, and when it transitions onto the film screen the result is impeccable. Despite looking a lot different in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Elizabeth Taylor is as beautiful as ever and stronger as an actress for taking an Oscar winning lead in the film.\nRichard Burton also gives a strong performance. As Elizabeth Taylor is the one dominating the screen in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Richard Burton has a hell of a platform to step up to. Yet with his immense skill as an actor, he manages to do it. Richard Burton stays on the wrong end of all Martha's criticisms without ever breaking characters as George, and you can see the small elements of his character changing gradually as he develops over the course of the film while the drama unfolds. His line delivery is fierce, and when he sees fit he manages to grab the screen and grip the drama of the film in his hand with an undeniable tenacity. Richard Burton proves what makes him a great actor in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and his lead performance is one of the most tense and powerful efforts of his entire career with an undeniable dramatic effect as the result.\nGeorge Segal's supporting performance is an effective one as well because you can see how he lets his character develop over the course of the film as the dramatic situations grow in intensity, and his facial expressions and line delivery become more and more sharp as things happen which gives the story a good sense of movement.\nLastly, Sandy Dennis' performance as Sunny was a nice touch to the cast as well, and her chemistry with George Segal was very effective. Similarly, you can see the drama of the film gradually taking its toll on her as it develops affects the viewers, making the experience of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? well acted from every contributing cast member.\n\nSo Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a bit of an old film and doesn't break its cinematic roots too much, but the power of the story's dramatic impact and the excellent lead performance from Elizabeth Taylor gives it more than enough credibility to succeed as a memorable feature.",

Richard Burton plays a sullen history professor who's hit a career plateau and Elizabeth Taylor is his middle aged foul mouthed alcoholic wife. Its a perfect example of art imitating life.\r\n\r\nOne night, after attending a college party, they invited a younger couple Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) to have a drink at their home. \r\nIt is during this nightcap that the family drama begins to develop in full force\r\n\r\nThe simple plot deals with two university couples, one young, one not-so-young, who \"entertain\" each other in the wee hours of the night after a university party. George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) invite a young couple over who just joined the university staff. While George and Martha are old hats at this \"banter\" they have developed, they draw the young couple into their psychological torture chamber resulting in a riveting but exhausting evening of fun and games\r\n\r\nCutting insults keep the viewer awake as do the sometimes embarrassing revelations, like Sandy Dennis's hysterical pregnancies and frequent vomiting. When Albee latches on to what he feels is a good turn of phrase, it gets repeated until it becomes laughable per se. \"It's good that you're a biologist\r\nThe dialog is crisp, biting, caustic, strange, compelling, honest, brutal and thoroughly engrossing. It is disturbing and not for the faint-hearted but is a fascinating look in the dark recesses that make up some relationships. It also demands that you pay close attention to the dialog because this is where you truly find out exactly what this entails.\r\nInsults fly in all directions. One person may reveal a secret to another, who then runs over and trumpets the information to the others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood close-up takes showing Martha's hysterical grief after George has told her that their son, who in fact never exists, was killed in an accident\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Albee's play is full of the kind of stinging dialog that made it controversial in the 1960s, and today it still retains its potential for hitting its characters on to the audience in a shockingly overwrought and, in connection with this, very funny manner. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis movie is 131 minutes long and only contains 5 actors, on of which hardly gets any screen time and the two leading characters played by the famous couple Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor are on screen almost the whole time. Also this movie only contains a couple of locations so the whole project depends almost entirely on these two actors superb performance. The two of them fight almost the entire movie and it never gets boring for a second. \r\n\r\nThe acting by Taylor and Burton is great.George Segal impresses in his debut.Sandy Dennis,I feel,overplayed her part and came across to me as annoying\r\nBut most of all, the acting is what makes this movie work. Richard Burton especially is hypnotic in his obsessive devotion to whatever pops into his mind, and he has a few speeches in here that he performs so well, it's a shame he didn't win an Oscar for it. However, Taylor is extremely good as well, humorous but not hilarious and entirely convincing. Admittedly, the young couple aren't as big a part of the movie, but nevertheless perform well and are still interesting characters.",

Again, the film I got and the film I thought I was going to get were different but in this case not that much so. From all I read and saw in the trailer I thought this film would be about a couple who hate each other but like each other after they get drunk and verbally torment their guests for the duration of the film and for the most part I was correct. For a film that's about nothing but dialogue the dialogue had to be good and of course it is! The way the characters spoke is a way that I've never seen people do before or see again. At first I thought it was a bit odd how they were speaking, like it was overly aggressive but before long I realised that the aggressiveness had only just begun. I'm still finding it difficult to believe that Martha was played by the absolutely beautiful Elizabeth Taylor, I know she gained 30 pounds but it doesn't even look like her, bravo! I feel bad for Richard Burton, he really deserved that Oscar, or hell, any of them. Everyone did an amazing job with acting and keeping me interested, the film is very deep and I still don't think I got everything. For awhile I was unaware of what was going on, for a minute I thought there was some elaborate con going on or it was a test to see how long the guests would stay, considering George talks about teaching a lot but it was nothing more than two bitter old people literally hating each other. I want to watch it again but the movie was such an unpleasant experience but for all the right reasons, I think I might need to wait.

What's more amazing is that there were no high tech bells or whistles: nothing CG-ed, no incredible pyrotechnics or any special effects of any sort, no scenic or exotic locale, no death-defying stunts-- just four ubber talented actors, all assembled in a drab, unimpressive house under some pretty ordinary circumstances. The energy and the vigor of the ensembles' performance was absolutely stupendous, yet exhausting but made the movie so thoroughly engaging that it was difficult not to get completely enthralled. And just when you think there can't possibly be anything else left unsaid, no more surprises left to be revealed; then, they throw just another little morsel of information just before the end of the film that just takes you for another loop and realize \"Holy cow!\"....the depth of this film is absolutely incredible and these seemingly simple characters are actually quite complex.

Her Oscar-winning performance as the psychologically tormented Martha is one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema. Taylor's imperceptible shifting from sadism to tenderness, from bullying condescension to exhausted vulnerability, is a masterclass in character building. Martha is a truly monstrous character, and yet Taylor is able to imbue her with sympathy, allowing you brief glimpses of the warm and lovable woman she could have been.\n\nRichard Burton is equally magnificent as George; an ageing, failing college professor whose initial meekness gives way to a raging torment all of his own. His verbal sparring with Taylor, like two pit-bulls in the ring of an endless and bloody dogfight, has become legendary. Every word drips with malice and contempt, every sentence is designed to cut the deepest wound. At times, it becomes painful to watch, but like true train-wreck television, you cannot drag yourself away from the inevitably terrible conclusion.\n\nQuite possibly, this is as close to perfect as movies can get; beautifully written dialogue, deeply complex characters, an evolving and suspenseful storyline, beautiful photography, and a wonderfully understated score by Alex North. Nominated for 13 Academy Awards in 1967, but lost out to A Man for All Seasons and Born Free to win only 5.\n\n\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" \"I am.\"",

But to make such characters compelling and sympathetic as well-a necessity if the audience is to care about the juvenile antics happening on screen-is much more challenging.  Ernest Lehman's screenplay and Mike Nichols' directing are not up to the task.  Burton and Taylor, unsurprisingly, are, and only their acting makes the film watchable.  In an early scene Taylor gets the chance to impersonate Bette Davis, which she does remarkably well.  Still, viewers seeking an intelligent film on the theme of domestic dysfunction would do better to watch Liz in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1958).",

When they invite junior professor Nick and his mousy wife Honey to their home for a drink, they set the young ones in between night-long emotional warfare, playing disturbing \"fun and games\" and exposing them to their violent nature. It all ends in a shocking revelation bathed in alcohol and cigarette smoke. The story is helped tremendously by the powerhouse performances of the cast. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor are a perfect George and Martha. Ironically, their marriage was in the same nature as the couple in the film. George Segal is a fine Nick, and Sandy Dennis is absolutely hilarious as Honey, who really gets going when she pounds down a few drinks.

            "content": "Starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton with director Mike Nichols, this taboo-braking adaption of the stage play revolves around a middle-aged couple. George is a proffessor and he and his wife Martha have a love-hate relationship. Urged by her influential  father, Martha invites a young couple to their home. Because of the late hour and lots of alcohol, the rest of the evening becomes a wild war full of nasty insults, hurtful games, and manipulation. Martha and George use their guests and go as far as physical violence. However, in the end secrets are uncovered and they realize that they truly are afraid of Virginia Woolf. What began as a joke became all too true. At points this film seemed to elude me but I will say the acting was intense and powerful. There were moments where you disdain these people, then you feel pity for their plight, and other times you may even be able to relate to them in some ways.",

They speak quietly, and in the last lines Martha answers the title question with \"I am, George, I am.\"\r\n\r\n3    The choice of Elizabeth Taylor-at the time regarded as one of the most beautiful women in the world-to play the frumpy, fifty-ish Martha surprised many, but the actress gained 30 pounds for the role and her performance (along with those of Burton, Segal and Dennis) was ultimately praised. \r\n\r\n\r\n4    The film was considered groundbreaking for having a level of profanity and sexual implication unheard of at that time. Jack Valenti, who had just become president of the MPAA in 1966, had abolished the old Production Code. In order for the film to be released with MPAA approval, Warner Bros. agreed to minor deletions of certain profanities and to have a special warning placed on all advertisements for the film, indicating adult content. Even the Catholic Office refused to \"condemn\" the film.\r\n\r\n[img]http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSK5CzmGBO2ILD5o5j9l27fToJScRV_SZbwyiQstYZ_rjQ_fL1W_A[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCast\r\n\r\nElizabeth Taylor as Martha\r\nRichard Burton as George\r\nGeorge Segal as Nick\r\nSandy Dennis as Honey\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by\tMike Nichols\r\nProduced by\tErnest Lehman\r\nScreenplay by\tErnest Lehman\r\nStory by\tEdward Albee\r\n\r\nMusic by\tAlex North\r\nCinematography\tHaskell Wexler\r\nEditing by\tSam O'Steen\r\n\r\nDistributed by\tWarner Bros.\r\nRelease date(s)\t\r\n\r\nJune 22, 1966\r\nRunning time\t131 minutes\r\nCountry\tUnited States\r\nLanguage\tEnglish\r\nBudget\t$7.5 million\r\nBox office\t$40,000,000\r\n\r\n[img]http://cdn-3.nflximg.com/images/0290/1060290.jpg[/img]",

I had never experienced that sensation-at least not outside of my books, not in the form of real people saying their lines on a screen in front of me. Now, many years removed from that first viewing, I am inclined to write-off my reaction to my unfamiliarity with cinema's canon. But I believe I would be wrong to do that. Surely, it is due, in part, to the original playwright, Edward Albee, but I think this movie captures its audience with the reality of it all. The characters seem real, and the dialogue does too. The events and the stories are all too familiar. The tragedy of life is laid out before us, and we cannot help but weep for it.",

Shocking, intense, vulgar yet hauntingly beautiful, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is an explosive game-of-wits thriller. \n\nThe film has only four actors, takes place in a very few locations and that too in a single night. In the entire film, George and Taylor inflict verbal abuse at each other yet there is not a single moment that lets you go off. Their arguments, their silly petty games, their outlook towards sex still makes movie fanatics wonder how the hell \"they\" could have done it so realistically. The film repels us with it's disgusting allegory yet attracts us with how perfectly it's filmed. Kudos to Nichols' direction, Lehman's screenplay, the score, the beautiful black-and-white cinematography, the editing...\n\nElizabeth Taylor, who was considered the most beautiful woman in the world that time, surprised many when she played the vulgar, frumpy, fifty year old Martha and had gained 13 kilos to play the role. She is the best in the entire ensemble and no doubt she won an Academy Award for her stunning performance. \n\nThis is undoubtedly one of the best Drama films I have ever seen.

Yes, it was adapted originally from a play, which was also amazing and chilling, but mostly it's the superb performances, and the beautiful directing. The two main attractions in the film are George and Martha who are a married couple that drink a lot. And when i say a lot i literally mean it, throughout the movie the drinking gets worse and worse, and somehow the amounts become larger. Which is great because that's what makes the movie build up to it's intense and craziness! Martha is played by the superb Elizabeth Taylor, who shines and scares in this role how intensely she plays a drunk. She has so many great yelling, insulting, and mean things to her husband, George throughout the film. George is played by the professional and interesting Richard Burton, who ironically, in reality, was married to Elizabeth Taylor for a small portion of time. Let's hope they didn't behave like this. About 20 or 30 minutes into the film they invite a younger married couple over that are much more put together, that is until they get some alcohol in their system. There are many scenes in the film that get so intense and insane that at times it gets awkward and uncomfortable to watch. But that's the effect of the film, some may strongly dislike and others may love it like myself. Taylor is superb in her role as Martha, and this film shows why Taylor won and deserved so many of the oscars she won in the past and future, including the best actress award for this role. Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? is definitely not a film for everyone but it is for sure done well.",

This is a powerful play on film, with some brilliant performances and each of the 4 main performers managing to hold their own against one another while on screen, it's power and controversial themes brought down the Hays Production Code, and ushered in New Hollywood. Set on the campus of a nameless New England college, it has the alcoholic Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) and her husband, history professor George (Richard Burton) coming home at 2am after a party. Martha then announces she's invited a young couple over for a few drinks, Nick (George Segal), who is a sports instructor and his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis). George is peeved that Martha has done this without consulting him first, but they come and despite trying to put on a good appearance, it's Martha's decent into drink and horrendous rants which George joins in with, and it's the alcohol and the presence of Nick and Honey, which George and Martha use to hurl abuse and pain towards one another about their failing marriage. It's heavy going stuff, but it's the brilliant dialogue and performances that help this move along, along with Nichols' tight direction, (he missed out on an Oscar for this, but he got one the following year for The Graduate (1967)), it's dark stuff and it shows what damage alcohol can really do to people. You don't get chamber pieces like this now, but Nichols did something similiar with Closer (2004), oh and Polanski's Carnage (2011).",

It's a pretty straightforward question, but one that is clearly open to interpretation. On the more extreme side of the scale we have an answer in the form of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? And I doubt you'll find a better acted, better scripted, or better executed film, not just about the question I just asked, but in general.\n\nThe plot is a marvelous understatement; \"A bitter aging couple (Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) with the help of alcohol, use a young couple (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) to fuel anguish and emotional pain towards each other.\" (www.imdb.com) But to be honest, that's all there really is to say. Looking at the facts, this movie only has 4 characters, not including 1 bar owner and 1 bar maid with one line of dialogue between them, it takes place on no more than 3 sets, and is almost solely dialogue driven. \n\nThe starkness of this film makes for an unambiguous singularity of purpose. Richard Burton and Elizabeth are extraordinary in their roles as their constant, venom-laced, tongue-in-cheek dialogue is spat back and forth, much to the shock of their guests. It is worth noting that all four actors in this film were nominated for an Oscar, making it one of three films ever to have its entire cast nominated. Suspense seamlessly rises and falls courtesy of heated conversations and simplistic camera angels. \n\nRereading this, I don't feel I've done a good job selling this film, but I really don't know what else to say, except watch it. I will say that this movie is an emotional train wreck with no point, or metaphors. It's a film for film lovers primarily. I believe I am, and give this film what is feel is a deserved 5 stars. However this film can be viewed as bleak and hopeless just as easily and earn 2 stars. It rides a finer line than most films.\n\nThe simplicity of this film, complimented with its dialogue (yes I'm going to bring it up again) is shockingly compelling and delivers an emotional hit akin to a sledgehammer on a drawing pin. It shares an assassin's single minded since of purpose. It's brutally cold, cynical and calculated, and there's plenty to like about the way it does its thing.",

Therefore, so many films, so little time is the basis of my excuse (as of today there are 318 titles on my list to see). For now, I am taking aim at many films that have eluded me from the 1960's. Virginia Woolf was high on the 60's titles and now I understand why Mike Nichol's film is hailed as a masterpiece. About 20 minutes into it thought, how is this film going to run for over 2 hours? Well, about 30 minutes into it, all questions or earthly concerns died. My house could have caught fire and I would have went up in smoke staring at Elizabeth Taylor tormenting Richard Burton in her drunken rage. I immediately took notice of how well it was shot and focused on the careful angles and closes ups. This is 60's filmmaking at its very best! A Man For All Seasons has much to live up to now. \r\n\r\nElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton stumble home from a party one night and are just about too drunk to stand. Once home and ready to call it a night, Burton is informed that Taylor has invited a young couple over for a nightcap. Although angry at the inconvenience, he straightens up a bit and prepares to entertain his guests (George Segal and Sandy Dennis). Once, the guests arrive, the tension boils over and bitter anger erupts almost immediately. Taylor reveals a never before seen viciousness that simply must be seen. Burton is electrifying as he meekly dismisses Taylor's verbal assaults but he soon shows how quickly he can rip someone to shreds with careful words of his own. Segal and Dennis soon play into the warfare taking as many hits as Burton or Taylor, however, this young couple may very well be a suitable match for the evening. \r\n\r\nHonestly, I have never seen this much liquor intake in one single film. I seriously cannot recall a film with more copious amounts of hard liquor consumption. By the end of the picture my throat felt vodka burnt and my breath tasted like an ashtray. The story is mean and unforgiving but at the same time flawless in execution, just like the cast. These actors go for the throat in every scene for the entire running time. Ernest Lehman must be praised for his Oscar nominated screenplay because without this element of genius, this film would have been a different story for the actors to carry. Taylor is brilliant in her delivery and is one of the cruelest characters I've ever seen. Bravo for one of the greatest female performances in motion picture history! Meanwhile, I have been very interested in Burton since I saw Equus, and now I know I must see more of his work. Here, he intelligently defends himself, yet also has a keen style for inflicting pain on others in his path. The supporting cast, Segal and Dennis, earn their status among two villainous roles. They add much flavor to the main course in this banquet of insanity. How did I miss, this for so long? I must say, it is just unlike anything else I've ever seen and can't classify it with any other body of work. Period. (A+)",

It's emotionally exhausting, brutal, cynical,and a real downer. Here's the thing, though: there are people like this who really exist in real life. It's painful, but honest.\n\nThe film garnered much controversy (as did the play) for the language and sexual content. It's rather tame by today's standards, but the viciousness of the verbal abuse and vitriol still stings. The insults and badgering in this movie are quite venomous at times, and I was somewhat unnerved by it all. Polanski's movie Carnage is comparable, but that one at least started off mildly pleasant before descending into savagery, whereas this one is uncivil from the start.\n\nThis really isn't a film I want to endure very often, if ever again. There is a point to it all, and while it is good to experience stuff like this from time to time, you'd have to be a little off to think this warrants frequent rewatches.\n\n\nBesides the unpleasantness, the film is overlong and somewhat repetitive, but what makes it all worth it are Haskell Wexler's excellent cinematography, and, most of all, the excellent performances from a cast where all four main players got Oscar nods, with two of them winning. That's easily the biggest redeeming factor here. This is a real master classic in acting, especially from Taylor and Burton. \n\nIt's overrated, grueling, and really joyless, but if you want to see excellent acting, and how dark relationships can get sometimes, then give this a watch.",

And can also at times be such a marvel to see great acting by Taylor and Burton to carry the film.  Winner of 5 Oscars including \"Best Actress for Lead Role\" for Elizabeth Taylor and \"Best Supporting Actress\" Oscar for Sandy Dennis out of 13 nominations!\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth out of 10 films Elizabeth Taylor/ Richard Burton starred together!\r\n\r\n3 out of 4",

Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor could not have acted in a more apt time in their marriage - which too, like the couple in the film, was breaking apart. But nothing, not even the reputed notoriety of this classic, prepared me for the real thing. \"Damn You\"s and \"Screw You\"s are tossed all over the place like a baby howling tantrums. Plus of course the effective (and tense) Haskell Wexler cinematography and the poignant Alex North score, among others. It accurately depicts the break-up of a marriage built on ideals and crumbling in the face of reality. Edward Albee could not have had a better director to adapt his play than Mike Nichols. Nichols manages to keep us fixated in the film without any wavering of interest on our part. And the shocks that come abruptly from time to time - like for instance Burton's character suddenly preparing to \"shoot\" Taylor's character after she makes fun of him - are indeed quite jolting and entertaining. Mousy-faced Sandy Dennis and the seemingly quiet George Segal are also commendable as the newly wedded couple, both of whom in the end enliven their relationship out of the decaying disillusionment within the Burton-Taylor couple onscreen. Overall a 5 out of 5 stars.",

Unhappily married George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor) always bicker, and invite junior professor Nick (Segal) and his wife Honey (Dennis) to their house. Little do they know how much their hostes' fight and drink ... \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" is considered both Elizabeth Taylor's and Richard Burton's best film. It's very easy to see why. This was one of Mike Nichols' first movie, and was followed by the more popular \"The Graduate\". They're obviously very different, which proves his versatility. Though a married couple fighting seems like a bad idea, it's so much more than that. Taylor was only 34 when this was filmed and had to portray someone in their '50's. Burton was only in his '40's so it was the same for him. This movie goes down the same spiral every time-- a topic that sets George and Martha off, cringing, comic relief, and then silence. Though a weird mix, it's very noticeable, and besides being such a essential drama, I also think it is definitely the best black comedy as well. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is perfect because there's hardly any music, no thrills, no glitz, so the effect is so much more real. To make it better, the four actors are all absolutely mesmerizing. Dennis and Segal are the perfect married couple, and yes they most definitely deserved their Oscar prizes. Burton had already proved his point in this kind of genre, but this was a huge risk for the late Elizabeth Taylor. She had only proved herself as a dramatic actress, and though being good, she was always glamorous and made people think, \"Elizabeth Taylor is a vision\". This movie could have ruined her career, but instead marked a new point. She is ugly in this movie because of the makeup, and the way she portrays Martha is so painful yet wonderful that I was in awe every time she opened her mouth. Bravo. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is one of the best movies ever made, and those who say it's long and boring are obviously stupid.",

Elizabeth Taylor de-glams herself to play surly Martha who desperately clings to a secret fantasy, while real-life hubby Richard Burton is no less vicious as George. Mike Nichols attempts to distill the material from its Broadway roots via moments of experimental photography (courtesy Haskell Wexler) with mixed success.

Martha is a viscious lush with a loud and nasty mouth fit to be muzzled if ever George had his way. Taylor won the Oscar, but Richard Burton's nuanced and sinisterly funny performance is a marvel. George is a stifled associate professor with adequacy problems, but it doesn't stop him from eventually winning his \"total war\" with Martha over the course of a drunken late night with two guests (more like hostages).

One night, they invite a new instructor (Segal) and his wife (Dennis) to dinner. There, years of drinking and marriage and a secret used to kept that marriage together erupt to the surface.

            "content": "In terms of acting and the cleverness of the writing, Virginia Woolf is easily 5 stars. In terms of enjoyment, I'd rate the film a little lower. So let's be diplomatic (something the characters in this movie would never be) and give it 3 and 1/2 stars. \n\nDon't get me wrong--Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, based on the play by Edward Albee, is a great film. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are riveting as a married couple who have learned how to perfectly torment and humiliate one another over the course of their many years together and take great sadistic and masochistic pleasure doing so--often fueled by endless glasses of liquor.\n\nThe plot is simple: Taylor and Burton (playing Martha and George) spend an evening \"entertaining\" a younger couple (the men are both university professors, and Taylor is the daughter of the university's president, so the evening is really more business than pleasure), which involves dragging the couple into the abyss of alcohol-fueled shrieking matches and crying jags that seem to be par for the course for Martha and George. By the end of the evening, infidelities have taken place, laws have been broken (drunk driving! drunk loitering! drunk everything!), and secrets have been revealed. While George and Martha seem to have gotten to a place of catharsis (again, they seem to indulge in these shenanigans on a regular basis), but we wonder if the young couple's marriage is not now completely infected by the unhappiness and degradation of the older couple's relationship.\n\nSounds fun, huh? It is for the first hour...quite funny, in fact. But by the time the final third rolled around, I wanted to plug my ears until it was over. Spending two hours with these characters is excruciating enough...I can't imagine being married to one. No wonder they drink.\n\nBut the worst part is that everyone involved is complicit in both their cruel actions and words, as well as their acceptance at what the other characters throw (literally and figuratively) at them. At any time, any of the characters could have stopped drinking and left--even just walked out of the house. No one does of course, because then there wouldn't be a movie. But they act like their problems are caused by the others in the room. In fact, each character creates his or her own misery.\n\nAnd the big question is: are George and Martha miserable? If so, why don't they get a divorce? Sure, Martha is the president of the university's daughter and thus George, a professor, has political and aspirational reasons to stay, but come on! There's a limit! The friends I watched this film with offered another explanation: George and Martha enjoy their screaming matches, their drunken fights, their intimate, castrating insults. Maybe not on a conscious level, but the two have been playing the game for so long, they can't imagine anything different. Couples play weird games all the time, but many confine them to the bedroom The difference is that George and Martha let their games of dominance, submission, humiliation, and one upmanship hang over their relationship at all times, like a black cloud waiting to burst. This makes for a riveting, haunting, but extremely unpleasant glimpse into the lives of two people who are thoroughly unhappy--and are quite content to stay that way.",

He is a flailing passive-aggressive college professor who reluctantly works for his wife's father. While she is an extremly self-destructive and embittered flirt who punishes her husband relentlessly for not being the man he truly wishes he were.\r\n\r\nAmongst their issues are his failure to become a published author despite his wit and love of words. And she feels he only married her beuse he had hoped to one day run the college her father runs a tight reign on. Is she right? Did he ever really love her? Did he really murder his parents? And what is the secret surrounding their absent teenage son?\r\n\r\nThe answers slowly reveal themselves in a series of verbal games as a young couple drop by late in the evening to have a few drinks. After a party ends that was thrown in the young husbands honour by the professor's father-in-law, the new players quickly learn that smiles and friendly commentaries will not be enough for them to make through the evening with the seasones drinkers unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe young husband is handsome, cocky and ambitious. Hes a studly former athlete whose goal is to take the job the aging professor couldn't handle himself. The aging professor takes an immediate dislike to him. He embittered wife has other ideas. The young wife is naive and can't hold her liquor. Upon their arrival it is clear no one is going to become friends and soon everyone's dirty laundry is laid out in full view.\r\n\r\nThese four characters are made more intriguing by the sharp dialogue and witty bantering. Its like watching an angry ping-pong game. You can't take your eyes off it, but you wouldn't say its completely enjoyable either. I think its a timeless film. It must have been incredible to watch as a stage play. A definite personal favourite of mine. I love its rawness and its striking honesty to depict its cast with more than just one character flaw a piece.\r\n\r\nI watched this last night in honour of Elizabeth.

            "content": "Sadly, there are very few films that are capable of eliciting a visceral reaction out of me. However, Mike Nichol's 1966 debut film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, is such a powerful film on so many levels that I cannot imagine anybody watching it without being significantly moved. The film is based on Edward Albee's Tony Award winning play and covers the events of one very long and alcohol induced night. It follows the plight of an aging couple George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor). When friends Nick (George Segal)  and Honey (Sandy Dennis) come over for a nightcap, they become caught in the middle of a series of games in which George and Martha take their pain and attempt to push each other to the breaking point. Albee's dialogue is explosive, both in terms of being emotionally charged and how it is projected, and is adeptly handled by the entire cast.. There is a brilliant mix of temperamental humor and anguish which includes one of my favorite lines, \"There isn't an abomination award going that you haven't won.\" \nWhile Albee's superb script provides a well-built chassis for the film, it is Nichol's direction mixed with Haskell Wexler's brilliant cinematography that makes this film really take off. Often times the camera will capture the scene as if it were merely a fly on the wall. However, Nichols really knows the material and will zoom in to the point of intrusion when a character feels emotionally isolated or verbally backed into a corner. In one particularly distinguished scene that deviates from the play, Nichols captures George walking into the back of the house when the Martha and the guests are still conversing in the living room. Even though George is out of ear shot of the others, Nichols keeps the audio of their conversation going while he follows George. This illuminates the extent of Martha's deviance as George can still knows that Martha will be speaking ill of him even when he is not in her company. Also, in the same vein as a noir, Nichols uses mirrors to show how these characters never take a good hard look at themselves and what they have become. One is even shoved in the face of George at one point, yet he is too steeped in his own misery to even see the man on the other side. \nThe performances here are simply astounding by all players involved. Although Taylor would nab the Oscar for best actress, I really feel as though Burton was snubbed. While his character could have just been watered down to nothing more than a dispensary of caustic wit, Burton injects a sense of humanity into the character that is present in the smallest of gestures.  \nHistorically, this film is bold as it was produced in some of the most impassioned years of the civil rights movement.  These years saw a mass movement to finally put an end to the anti-miscegenation laws that had previously prevented interracial marriages in America. This film shows that even white upper-middleclass marriages, which were seen as a bulwark against the decay of the human race, had their blemishes. \nIn the end, it is a beautiful film about a volatile relationship. It is about pain and the fiction that we manufacture in order to deal with it. The film isn't easy to watch, but if you do you will find that this is an absolutely astounding film.",

George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) are the older couple, having been married for years. He is a college history professor, and she is the daughter of the university president. Martha is also a raging alcoholic, and their relationship seems to be one from hell. Even from the very first scenes of the movie, we could see they they consistently taunt and verbally abuse one another, obviously fueled by Martha's massive booze intake. Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis), on the other hand, are newlyweds, and are pretty much the most stereotypical newlyweds you can get. One night, Martha invites the two over for a night in. Add in a little (make that a LOT of) alcohol, and what we get is possibly the most interesting drunken night of insults in all of film.\r\n\r\nIf one is expecting this movie to be laden with physical violence, goofy humor, and/or eye-catching action scenes, they may be disappointed. These four characters are pretty much the only people we see for the next two hours, and the content of the film is almost all entirely composed of dialogue. This may initially turn many off, but, in my opinion, it's really some of the most interesting dialogue I have ever heard. The vast majority of the words passed are, of course, the insults directed between George and Martha. Although much of these remarks are hurtful, we find a surprising hilarity between it all. This was also one of the first films to aid in garnering in the MPAA rating system; it was rated R, mainly due to profanity and phrases such as \"screw you\", \"up yours\", \"great nipples\", and \"hump the hostess\".\r\n\r\nHowever, as entertaining as this may all seem on the forefront, it is a bit heartbreaking when digging deeper into the surface. Such rude remarks had passed among the couple through much loss of mutual respect. George can't stop taunting Martha, and Martha can't stop humiliating George. She even attempts to seduce Nick, in her efforts to spark up some jealousy in George. We soon wonder if love still even exists in their marriage. Eventually, we see Nick and Honey firing upon each other as well, as if such an environment was contagious towards their actions. The alcohol may be to blame, but throughout the night, we see them becoming less like the couple they were from the start, and more and more like George and Martha.\r\n\r\nThe acting undoubtedly played a major role in the overall profoundness of the film (all four actors were nominated for Oscars this year!), but the standout performance definitely comes from Elizabeth Taylor. Prior to this film, she was already a big-name actress and considered one of the most beautiful women in the world. Having to make her into the ugly, frumpy, middle-aged Martha was some leap of faith, but she makes it work, and I do believe this is her best piece of acting ever. She and Richard Burton were actually married in real life at this time, so the heated arguments George and Martha engaged in sparks the viewers' imaginations as to how their relationship actually was.\r\n\r\nOverall, this film is something that has to be seen to be believed. Not everyone could benefit from watching this movie, as the completely dominant usage of dialogue might seem slow for some, but this is definitely a must-see for any classic film lover. This is also my favorite Liz Taylor movie, and I'm just so glad that this wonderful, talented actress left us with this remarkable feat that shall be most treasured for the time coming. She will be missed so dearly.",

            "content": "This is a doozy in every sense of the word.\n\nOne of the bleakest films ever made, this over-sexualized black comedy about the facades people live under in order to convince themselves that their lives are definitely worth something and the befuddled state of relationships in the modern era helped change Hollywood for the better, transforming it from a garbage dump of forgettable and saccharine films (with gems somewhere along the way) into a face-to-face competitor with France, Japan, Britain, and any other film industry that didn't try to censor mixed race relationships, LGBT issues, and (most importantly) profanity. Throughout these two hours, the viewer is pelted with some of the most abrasive use of dialogue that hasn't been matched by any other film (not even \"Pulp Fiction\"), pure emotions, and every single thing under the sun. Except for nudity. Mike Nichols wasn't that crazy yet.\n\nGeorge (Richard Burton) and Martha (Liz Taylor) are a middle-aged couple who hold parties and play the image of a happy, successful, and passionate household in order for people not to investigate into their lives. One Saturday night (or really early Sunday morning), Martha invites a couple (Sandy Dennis; George Segal) over for some harmless fun and games. Unbeknownst to any of them, this would be a night that will change their lives forever. Thanks in part to some insanely frightening and sadistic party games (like \"Get the Guests,\" where you torture the guests by relaying sordid elements of their past), these couples are stripped bare of any adult qualities, now writhing around on the floor and crying like little children.\n\nWhat makes the film (and the play) so powerful is how wickedly humorous it can get while pulling the heartstrings. It's the antithesis of the romantic comedy - we're not looking at husbands who strive to be better than Alvy Singer. Instead, we're looking at the dissolution of the traditional family unit, from the parents all the way down to the children. The whole film is steeped in insanity and comedy, from scaring party guests with a fake shotgun to making snark about their private lives. To be honest, it's not just about couples and living life without illusions - it's also an allegory on the generation gap and how people don't really change (despite being younger and having different ideas on how things work). We get behavior vs. observation here. We get young vs. old. We get man vs. woman.\n\nThis play (or album or film or whatever) is a transition piece that shows how tough it was to change from one set of ideas to another during the turbulent '60s. It's a film that wants to document how life was behind these curtains of success and happiness - and what people did in order to make themselves feel happy. It's a film that brought about the era of modern filmmaking. It's also a film that showed us that profanity could be used not as an exploitation of sordid elements of our culture, but a way to liven things up - to make the party more exciting. In summary, it's a modernized Warner Bros. epic.",

Who can make me happy and I do not wish to be happy. Yes, I do wish to be happy. George and Martha: Sad, sad, sad. Whom I will not forgive for having come to rest; for having seen me and having said: yes, this will do. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGeorge: You take the trouble to construct a civilization, to build a society based on the principles of... of principle. You make government and art and realize that they are, must be, both the same. You bring things to the saddest of all points, to the point where there is something to lose. Then, all at once, through all the music, through all the sensible sounds of men building, attempting, comes the Dies Irae. And what is it? What does the trumpet sound? Up yours. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGeorge: I'm very impressed. \r\nMartha: You're damn right. \r\nGeorge: I said I was impressed.

Hey swampy! \r\nGeorge: Yes, Martha? Can I get you something? \r\nMartha: Ah, well, sure. You can, um, light my cigarette, if you're of a mind to. \r\nGeorge: No. There are limits. I mean, a man can put up with only so much without he descends a rung or two on the old evolutionary ladder, which is up your line. Now, I will hold your hand when it's dark and you're afraid of the boogeyman and I will tote your gin bottles out after midnight so no one can see but I will not light your cigarette. And that, as they say, is that. \r\nMartha: Jesus. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMartha: Well, you're going bald. \r\nGeorge: So are you. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNick: [to Honey] We'll go in a little while. \r\nGeorge: Oh no. No, you mustn't. Martha is changing, and Martha is not changing for me, Martha hasn't changed for me in years. If Martha is changing, that means we're going to be here for days. You're being accorded an honor, and you mustn't forget that Martha is the daughter of our beloved boss. She is his right... arm. I was going to use another word, but we'll leave that sort of talk to Martha. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[George takes a corner far too fast, tossing everyone in the car from side to side.

You think he made his own wife sick? \r\nGeorge: Well, you make me sick. \r\nMartha: That's different. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMartha: Hey! \r\nGeorge: Hark!

I'm not. \r\nGeorge: You're a spoiled, self-indulgent, willful, dirty-minded, liquor-ridden... \r\nMartha: SNAP! It went SNAP! I'm not gonna try to get through to you any more. There was a second back there, yeah, there was a second, just a second when I could have gotten through to you, when maybe we could have cut through all this, this CRAP. But it's past, and I'm not gonna try. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMartha: I looked at you tonight and you weren't there... And I'm gonna howl it out, and I'm not gonna give a damn what I do and I'm gonna make the biggest god-damn explosion you've ever heard. \r\nGeorge: Try and I'll beat you at your own game. \r\nMartha: Is that a threat George, huh? \r\nGeorge: It's a threat, Martha. \r\nMartha: You're gonna get it, baby. \r\nGeorge: Be careful Martha. I'll rip you to pieces. \r\nMartha: You're not man enough. You haven't the guts. \r\nGeorge: Total war. \r\nMartha: Total. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGeorge: I used to drink brandy. \r\nMartha: You used to drink bergen, too. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGeorge: Did you really think I was going to kill you, Martha? \r\nMartha: You, kill me?

Poof! \r\nNick: Poof! \r\nGeorge: Poof! And all that was left, aside from some wart medicine, was a big fat will. \r\nNick: Your wife never mentioned a stepmother. \r\nGeorge: Maybe it isn't true. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNick: Who did the painting? \r\nGeorge: Some Greek with a mustache Martha attacked one night. \r\nNick: It's got a... \r\nGeorge: Quiet intensity? \r\nNick: Well, no, a... \r\nGeorge: Well then, a certain noisy relaxed quality maybe? \r\nNick: No, what I meant was... \r\nGeorge: How about a quietly noisy relaxed intensity? \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGeorge: Now that's it! You can take over a few classes from the older men, but until you start plowing pertinent wives, you really aren't working. The broad, inviting avenue to man's job is through his wife, and don't you forget it. \r\nNick: And I'll be your wife has the broadest, most inviting avenue of the whole damn campus. \r\n[long pause] \r\nNick: Her father president and all. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGeorge: You can sit around with the gin running out of your mouth; you can humiliate me; you can tear me to pieces all night, that's perfectly okay, that's all right. \r\nMartha: You can stand it! \r\nGeorge: I cannot stand it! \r\nMartha: You can stand it, you married me for it! \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMartha: A drowning man takes down those nearest.",

Every single person in this is enigmatic but the crowning glory goes to Elizabeth Taylor who is Martha; a crude and slew wise cracking but ruthless woman. Richard Burton who is George as her supporting co-star deserves credit for his performance as well.

Making a film so simple with such limited sets and a small number of characters means the movie has to be attention-grabbing and stay that way.  This movie is strange in that because it is so caustic and bitter, it becomes horrifying and then dull in the sense that you soon get it:  this type of arguing happens all the time and there is no end in sight.  As a result, the movie is too long in some parts, with it simply being a series of arguments that are separated by brief lowkey moments.  The script is razor sharp and full of caustic wit; it's too bad the film wasn't trimmed down a little.  The audience can only take so much yelling and malice.  It's a very unflattering and sad portrait of a loveless marriage, and it's worth seeing if only for the writing, performanes and direction.  But I guarantee you won't be smiling afterward.",

By just watching the movie, you actually believed it so well from beginning to end that you didn't know what else to believe? This movie is one of those films. Its dark and psychologically haunting take on a married couple in college, Virginia Woolf just left me breathless.\r\n\r\nBased on the play by Edward Albee, this movie stars Edward Burton and Elizabeth Taylor as the Dean of a college and his drunkard wife. Throughout the movie, they're constantly fighting and bickering while she drinks and berates him. Later on, a newlywed couple of a college professor and his wife arrive, and Burton and Taylor really begin to go at it. Separately, though, they learn more about the new couple: secrets, history, etc. With the new knowledge, Burton and Taylor start \"playing games\" with each other while involving the new couple. There's a big moment where the fight eventually turns into a free-for-all, but Burton draws a wild card in the end and, although bittersweet and somewhat Pyrrhic, defeats Taylor.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Taylor, if Wikipedia serves accurate, was considered by many the last person anyone saw for the role; but she honestly put on an obvious effort to prove herself. The chemistry and anti-chemistry between the two mains is just perfect, and it grips you from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nThe scariest thing of all, psychologically, is that you don't know whether they really hate each other or are just simply playing games. Edward Albee wrote this play to say something, and it looks like he's describing marriage as a constant battle for superiority. Who has the most power over whom? Who really has the upper hand in everything, especially in a commitment? And how far do you go in such a battle before you realize you've gone too far?\r\n\r\nBottom line: this movie has amazing acting, a really good story buildup, and it leaves you with shivers both in mind and soul. It's one of those films that makes you afraid of living this life yourself.",

An unhappy husband and wife couple is about to have guests they don't even know over for a late night get-together. But as the liquor flows, inner feelings are let loose and there's no stopping the couple from hell. But they are also keeping secrets. This must have been a very impressive play, but I think this movie pulled it off the best it could because of the brilliant cast of Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor (who by the way won an oscar for her role)\r\n\r\nThe characters move all around the place, so the direction in this film was very impressive, keeping focus on every character, switching from one to another when trying to capture their lines or reactions. There is very little room to breath in this movie because Burton and Taylor are constantly at eachother's neck, and the film captures the intensity wonderfuly.\r\n\r\nThis isn't that much of a technical movie, the real brilliance and attention grabber was truely the acting.

I mean, she has never been bad but this picture clearly proved her to be a versatile character actress if needed. And Richard Burton- her husband at the time- is a worthy opponent to Taylor's venemous facade.\n\nThis is one of those good old fashioned dramas that employ a somewhat claustrophobic setting to fuel explosive human interaction.

The film itself garnered thirteen Oscar nominations and won five Academy Awards including Best Actress (Taylor), Best Supporting Actress (Sandy Dennis), Best B/W Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction.\r\n\r\nThe film is deserving of its Academy Awards.  It is well written and the performances are impressive, with the real-life husband and wife team of Taylor and Burton as the main standouts.  The biting and sharp dialogue characterized by name-calling, insults and accusations between the two main characters can be very sad and disheartening at times because of its cruel and condescending nature while at the same capturing the essence of their rocky 20-year marriage with unflinching honesty.\r\n\r\nThis is a black comedy where the humor is placed at just the right moments thereby giving audiences some comic relief from its grim subject - albeit, some nervous ones.  As Mike Nichols' directorial debut, he is to be commended for successfully adapting a stage play onto the big screen.  His choice of camera shots and angles is worth noting.  He is able to show who has the upper hand in the numerous no-holds-barred exchanges while capturing the intensity of the verbal arguments that ultimately leads to an exploding climax along with the behaviors and hateful thoughts of the different characters.  The film is an emotional roller coaster and a very intense one at that.  Nichols' impeccable pacing keeps the viewers guessing as to which character will finally \"lose it\" and end up actually physically hurting the other.\r\n\r\nIn the year this film was released, Fred Zinnemann's \"A Man For All Seasons\" will go on to win the Best Picture Oscar.  Maybe the content and language of \"Virginia Woolf\" was just too shocking for its time and the Academy as a whole.  But I would have preferred Nichols' film to Zinnemann's for the top prize.  Needless to say, Nichols would win the Best Director Oscar the next year for \"The Graduate\", which is also on AFI's Top 100 Films at #7.  He will also go on to direct \"Silkwood\", \"Biloxi Blues\", \"The Birdcage\", among others.\r\n\r\nFilms that have a well-written screenplay, compelling performances, beautiful cinematography, fine direction and technical artistry will always stand the test of time.  \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is one of those films.",

Martha and George have a life built on the misconception that they can be happy based on political and social standards, but now, in their middle age, both feel the weight of their inactions and prejudices. They invite over a married couple (Sandy Dennis and George Segal) and spend the entire night fighting and degrading themselves and their guests.

            "content": "In, perhaps, one of the best directorial debuts, Mike Nichols brings us the story the horrifying evening spent by couples George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor) and Nick (Segal) and Honey (Dennis). George is a miserably unhappy history professor and Martha is his verbally abusive and corrosive wife. They invite over the newest professor Nick and his plain-looking wife for drinks. Things start volatile and just escalate in a night of painful self-reflection and cruel revelations. Fueled by a large amount of liquor George and Martha begin a very explosive battle of wits, hurling insults and threats at each other and their guests who are unfortunately stuck in the middle of this unexpected war. Here is a couple (George and Martha) who have been married for so long they cannot seem to remember what they liked or loved about each other to begin with. This is a couple so firmly rooted in their absolute hatred of each other that happiness is but a distant memory.\r\n\r\nTaylor and Burton are brilliant in their roles. She is just viscous and he is absolutely despicable. Years of nagging have made George into a bitter old man only content with spreading his misery around and poor Nick and Honey are that night's targets. \r\n\r\nAs the night goes on couple Nick and Honey's relationship is tested and begins to almost mirror that of George and Martha's, revealing the flaws and resentments of their own marriage.\r\n\r\nNichol's debut film is fantastic! The dialogue is smart and is sharply delivered by silver tongues of the two leads. There are plenty of awkward, uncomfortable moments, but, like watching a car crash, one cannot help but watch and be drawn in.",

This is a film about unhappy people whose only solace is their own fantasy world, a world which one party maliciously destroys in order to wound the other one the deepest.  With only four characters and two main settings, the focus is on dialogue and the interactions of the characters.  And these four actors do not disappoint.  Burton gives a more restrained performance as the exasperated husband who quietly and subtly cuts down his wife, only raising his voice when absolutely necessary.  Liz is more brazen as his wife, screaming and tearing into him with insults that would still sting today.  She is nonetheless just as incredible in her performance; even in black and white you can see every angry flash in her eyes.  Sandy Dennis was a revelation as Honey; when I first saw her on screen I thought \"Bambi\" because she looked like a deer in headlights.  And when she opened her mouth I saw that she acted like one too, a child not quite grasping the horror of what's happening around her.  Segal seems to be the forgotten one here, seemingly the weakest of the four, but the fact that he held his own in one on one scenes with the thunderous presence that was Burton shows his true depth. This is not a movie you can watch often--unless for some reason you enjoy watching people verbally knife each other in the heart--but there can be no denying that the first time you see it will be unforgettable.",

Many said that the only reason for Elizabeth Taylor's Oscar win here was because of her deglamorization, not acting, but I, along with many fans of this film, beg to differ. But the performance that really does not demand criticism of any kind is Richard Burton's uncanny performance as George, but I really couldn't say it was a performance, because he inhibited the heart and soul of the character, rather than just playing it. George Segal and Sandy Dennis also gave brilliant performances as the questioning, devastated young couple in the middle of the emotional war between the two bitter, older couple. There were plenty of interpretations regarding the aging couple's child and its effect to them, some wouldn't even care to give meaning to its ambiguity, but I would say that the (SPOILERS!) killing of the imaginary child was the spark to bring them both to reality, as reflected to their rather tender, honest exchange in the end, in contrast to their endless verbal skirmishes that covered the duration of the film. Is there really an adequate explanation to all of the psychological dilemmas that the film has brought forth? None maybe, but the film, as a whole, also shows the maddening effect of a loveless, bitter marriage.",

            "content": "Real life (at the time) couple Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor star in this cynical send-up of not just marriage, but the human race in general.  Burton plays George, an aging history professor who's married to the daughter of the university president, Martha.  George, at first glance, appears to be a henpecked and harried husband, whereas Martha is loud and \"braying\" as he describes her.  They both seem to be (somewhat) functioning alcholics, and they both seem to loathe one another on some deeply fundamental level.  It's not only that they loathe one another, they can't even be bothered to pretend at the pleasantries of marriage anymore.  The film begins as George and Martha arrive home (at approximately 2am) drunk from a party and begin to bicker.  Martha then tells George she's invited the new professor and his wife over for drinks and they should be there at any moment.  When the young couple arrives, it's clear to George exactly what the new professor's motivations are, especially when he begins to butter up Martha.  From then on, it's an escalating war of words and painful diatribes as everyone's weaknesses are brought to the fore.  It's not the twist at the end that's so shocking when compared to the other twist that it's really George and Martha who truly love one another, and the young couple whose marriage seems more out of convenience than genuine affection.  The viciously well-written play by Edward Albee is excellently adapted to the big screen by Mike Nichols (\"The Graduate\").  Taylor and Burton seem to delight in ripping into each other, and even when the second half begins to meander along (including the unsatisfying and bizarre ending), it doesn't really dull the blistering impact of the first.  Modern sensibilities might be more shocked by the venom than the taboo subject matter, which I'm sure was ground-breaking at the time.",

    "rt_summary": "History professor George (Richard Burton) and his boozy wife, Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), return late one Saturday night from a cocktail party at the home of the college president, Martha's father. Martha announces that she invited another couple, newly appointed instructor Nick (George Segal) and his timid wife, Honey (Sandy Dennis), over for a nightcap. When the younger couple arrive, the night erupts into a no-holds-barred torrent of marital angst and verbal tirades."
